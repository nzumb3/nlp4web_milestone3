Waiting for the Light
###BREAK###
A frank, funny and intensely moving portrait of 85-year-old Irish film auteur George Morrison by Ciar√≠n Scott, whom Morrison trained. After nearly dying, Morrison makes his first film in over 30 years; we see his triumphs and obsessions, his long years of failure, and his great personal charm and humour.

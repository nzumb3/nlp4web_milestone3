Writer's Day
###BREAK###
Six strangers undertake an overnight train journey, on a foggy night across the American mid-west. It is "Writer's Day!" A night when murders are known to be committed with unfailing regularity, on that very train, for the past eighty-two years! The passengers face their journey with mounting dread. Is the murderer someone physical, or is this the work of demonic spirits? Either way, how can the passengers take steps to protect themselves from the murderer they fear will arrive? Or, will their situation result in the ghastly culmination of their worst fears... is the murderer already among them? Yes; it is "WRITER'S DAY!"

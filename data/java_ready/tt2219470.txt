El Bella Vista
###BREAK###
'El Bella Vista' is the story of a house started as a football club, becoming a successful transvestite brothel and changes at last to a Catholic Chapel, all in a small conservative village in Uruguay. Two transvestites, one brothel's Madame, a brickmaker, ex football player, and a nun will bring to life this battle for control of a single physical space, home to mutually antagonistic institutions, driven by the same motivation: passion.

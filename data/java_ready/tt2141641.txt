Cafe Europa
###BREAK###
Every Sunday a group of holocaust survivors come to dance at Cafe Europa in a suburb north of Tel-Aviv. They tango, waltz, and cha-cha, drink coffee and eat pound cake, but never discuss the horrors of their past. Among the patrons of the cafe is a group that came to Israel after the holocaust and had to pay yet another horrific personal price in Israel's wars. Some are reevaluating their choice to immigrate to Israel, and others wonder if one should sacrifice a son for a country that betrayed them.

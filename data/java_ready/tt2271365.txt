Housemates
###BREAK###
A supernatural movie about UK-based Nigerian-born African son - Patrick Bolaji (Emeka Ike). He is a qualified research scientist who ended up on unemployment benefits. This personal journey began following redundancy due to government cut backs and a move into a council share apartment at the brink of eviction from his private home when he was unable to meet rent. The council apartment has seen a steady turnover; other renters have typically fled after only 3-days due to haunting by the unhappy ghost of a deceased former tenant - Maya (Jazmine Hammoudeh). Patrick, thoroughly non-religious, without spiritual believes, and no belief in anything like a ghost is unlike most African sons born and raised in Nigeria. But from the first day he moves in, he begins to experience paranormal mishaps that becoming increasingly harder to dismiss as coincidences. As things start to spiral out of control, he doubts his own perceptions and beliefs. In desperation, and on the advice of his best friend Michelle (Sophie Fonteyn), he turns to Bimbo (Victoria Inyama), another UK-based Nigerian woman with weird psychic abilities.

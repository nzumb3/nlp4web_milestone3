The principal of the kindergarten put a lot of effort into teaching music to the kids because it was "free". The was of importance because the kindergarten was under the threat to be shut down. Thus, the principal decided to run a fund-raising dinner and invited the alumni of the kindergarten to donate. The dinner, however, turned out to be a failure because the alumni weren't able to donate much money, because the alumni were mainly gangsters. Later, the principal found an agent to publicize the choir of the kindergarteners and help them earn performing opportunities. After attending several performances, with astounding performances, including one in the concert of Andy Lau, the agent scammed all the money the choir earned and ran away. The kindergarten shut down eventually, but the musical education the alumni received had profound influence on them.

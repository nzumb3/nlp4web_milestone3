Albania: Steps Into Freedom
###BREAK###
A travelogue and documentary about the poorest country in Europe, which, for forty years, was completely isolated under the ruthless rule of Enver Hoxha. From the Orthodox South where Greek civilization has left its mark in theaters and churches, up to the North, where Muslims and Catholics mostly live, the situation is everywhere the same: primitive life conditions, abject squalor and despair.

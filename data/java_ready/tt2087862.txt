Low Definition Control - Malfunctions #0
###BREAK###
Low Definition Control is a film about images. Surveillance cameras, ultrasound detectors and MRI images in medicine are fabricating models of conformist behaviour and healthy bodies but as well of anomalies, suspicion and hidden risks. In times of terrorist threat, risk prevention and all-embracing control phantasms these images foreshadow a possible future. A film about this future.

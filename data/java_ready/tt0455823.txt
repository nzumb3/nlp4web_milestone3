On the battlefront of global terrorism, one government team is hunting down and eliminating terrorist threats, sometimes within our very own borders. A seemingly routine mission falls apart after a direct order is disobeyed and Bravo 1, a team member, goes on the run. Running for his life, Bravo 1 must accept the aid of an ex-military man, in doing so a discovery is made that forces both men directly into the path of the very people trying to eliminate them. With time running out Bravo 1 will make a decision that could not only alter his life forever, but also the destiny of an entire nation.

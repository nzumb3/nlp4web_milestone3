Your Day Is My Night
###BREAK###
In "Your Day is My Night", a collective of Chinese performers living in New York City explores the history and meaning of "shiftbeds" through verit√© conversations, autobiographical monologues and integrated movement pieces. On screen, the seven performers play themselves, while living together with a young Puerto Rican woman in a shift-bed apartment on Hester Street in the heart of Chinatown. The concept of the shift-bed allows us as viewers to see the private become public, as the bed transforms into a stage for our characters to reveal the struggles and joys of their lives. "Your Day is My Night" is a provocative hybrid documentary that looks at issues of privacy, intimacy, and community in relationship to this familiar item of household furniture.

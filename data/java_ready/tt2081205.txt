Changing Gears: Flagstaff and the Mountain Bike
###BREAK###
'Changing Gears' captures the creation and evolution of the Mountain Bike (MTB) in the northern Arizona town of Flagstaff - the pinnacle breath-taking (in more ways than one!) mountain biking town in the USA. For over 100 years, the rugged locals - women and men - have been riding bikes in this elevated and progressive fat tire town. Then, in the 1970's, a revolution in building, selling, and riding bikes kicked into high gear. Cannibalizing and competing consumed the lucky few - including MTB legend Joe Murray and trail guide author Cosmic Ray. While the historic 1982 Snowbowl Race is central to this documentary, many passionate voices and colorful tangents tell the unique story of how MTB's are part of Flagstaff's life cycle today.

Wright on the Park: Saving the City National Bank and Hotel
###BREAK###
During his long and prolific career, Frank Lloyd Wright designed over 1,000 projects. Unique among them was the City National Bank and Hotel in Mason City, Iowa. However, the project was developed during one of the most turbulent periods in Wright's life. During its construction, he abandoned the project, his practice, and his family. When it opened in 1910, the City National Bank and Hotel was the architectural pride of Mason City. Yet less than sixteen years later it had begun a long, slow decline to near ruin. This is the story of one of Wright's most distinctive commissions, determined efforts by a community to save it, and the 21st century restoration of the last remaining hotel by America's foremost architect.

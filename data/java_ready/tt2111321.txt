Hawk(e): The Movie
###BREAK###
Movie-maker-come-idiot Mike Hawk sets about making his latest movie, a Rom-Com called "Get Becky Laid", and is followed in his pursuits by documentary maker and film fanatic Philip K Longfellow. Mike Hawk also plays the lead character and has named him Mike Hawke - after himself only adding an additional 'e' to his name to distinguish the two. Mike's bitten off more than he can chew, and is followed as he gets through the making of the film, achieving it only through sheer determination and ignorance.

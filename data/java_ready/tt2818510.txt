Mr Coperthwaite: A Life in the Maine Woods
###BREAK###
In 1960, Bill Coperthwaite bought 300 acres of wilderness in Machiasport, Maine. Influenced by the poetry of Emily Dickinson and by the back to the land movement of Scott and Helen Nearing, Bill Coperthwaite is committed to what he calls a handmade life. For the last fifty years, Bill Coperthwaite has lived and worked in the forest. He is a builder of yurts, and a maker of spoons, bowls and chairs. A meditation on time and process, this film explores an overlooked aspect of American culture and the critical place of nature within it.

La nature morte d'un flic
###BREAK###
The ever-present parade of prostitution, drug dealing and murder is choking the life out of a world-weary, middle-aged Paris cop (Le Flic), who has seen too much and done too little to clean up his precinct of the criminal vermin that now torment him. After 25 years as a plain-clothes vice detective, his own life begins to existentially wear out its welcome. His main informant (Remy le Rat) works for a local drug-lord (Le Turc) who supplies drugs to the neighborhood prostitutes, who all work for a mysterious madam and nightclub owner known as La Contesse. Le Flic is desperately trying to arrest, convict and lock-up the elusive Le Turc, if only to redeem his own futile, unfulfilled life. Between Remy's web of lies and Le Flic's own jealousy of Le Turc's lifestyle, we are able to peer through the cracks of this tormented cop's sick psyche and glimpse his personal philosophy of fractured fatalism.

The goal of the film is to give viewers a better understanding of how the federal debt affects their daily lives, the choices that will have to be made to manage the problem, and how they can participate in the ongoing economic debate. Through first person accounts, the factors that have contributed to the debt and possible solutions are presented, including such major topics as entitlement programs, defense spending, tax reform, and the choices America's debt forces on individuals and businesses. In addition to the documentary, the production team has developed five, one-minute segments on key topics in the documentary.

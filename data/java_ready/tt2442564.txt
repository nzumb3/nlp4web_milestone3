Lunch
###BREAK###
For the past 40 years, a group of comedy writers and directors has gathered every other Wednesday for lunch - and other nourishment. The members and their meeting places have changed occasionally, but their friendship and humor persist. Lunch describes more than a single meal. At each, their perceptive comments are sharp and brilliant. But their meetings mean more to them than affable, professional companionship; rather, a need to keep wit and wisdom alive and well. These are the fabled guys that made America funny. This is the feature length documentary LUNCH, which follows an earlier (2007), experimental Short by the same title, but with other cast members.

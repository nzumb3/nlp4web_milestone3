Maya: The Reality
###BREAK###
Maya is a prostitute who is used as an emotional sponge by her customers. The action of the film describes one night in Maya's life. Whether it it's the lustful and morally two-faced shopkeeper, the cuckolded businessman, the self-righteous autocrat or the jilted youngster, they all unburden themselves without too much thought for Maya. It is only with the newly promoted manager that Maya is able to share a genuine two-way communication.

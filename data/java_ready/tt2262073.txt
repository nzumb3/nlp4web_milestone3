Scrooge & Marley
###BREAK###
A modern day variation on Charles Dickens' classic story of the holidays, A Christmas Carol. On Christmas Eve, Ben Scrooge, the man who hates the holidays, is given the chance to begin again when he is visited by three spirits -- the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present and Future. Revisiting the tragic missteps of his life enables Scrooge to rediscover the joy of the holiday season and make a journey back to love. Recounted from a gay sensibility with heart, comedy and music, the magic of Dickens' timeless tale comes alive from a fresh perspective that will appeal to audiences of all persuasions.

East Side Showdown
###BREAK###
In inner Metropolitian Toronto, there is a conflict growing. With many formerly run down sections of the city increasingly coming under the ownership of well off people who determined to fix up their new homes, they are becoming increasingly hostile to the indigenous poor population there. This film examines the two worlds of the gentrification side and the urban poor who struggle to live within their means and the activists who help them as the two sides fight their political battles for their fair share of living space in the city.

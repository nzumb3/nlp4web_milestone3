Un si long voyage
###BREAK###
SO FAR is about the life of a woman from South America struggling to make her way into the United States. To capture the struggle and danger of the journey, I traveled alone with her during weeks, filming her overland from Ecuador through Central America and into the United States, ending the journey in New York City.

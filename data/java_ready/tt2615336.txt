###BREAK###
The documentary tells the story of a man who, as a result of a trauma, is to live a life completely different from that which would have imagined. The idea came from participation by Fabrizio, disabled athlete, Rowing World Championships after only 4 months of activity. The movie unfolds through two planes narrative: The main one is the tale of this lifetime, accomplished through the testimonies of people and technicians who were close to Fabrizio and who accompanied and supported him along this path. The secondary one is made by immersive documentation in his everyday life. The span is that of a day. We lead a life of 'ordinary' but handled with a force and a positivity that not all people are able to get.

Deadly Melody
###BREAK###
All the masters of the various martial arts clans desperately want to possess the magic lyre - an item which, in the right hands, has devastating power. The item is placed in the hands of a young security man by a mysterious woman who knows how to harness the power it holds. However, the delivery of the lyre is not her true goal, rather she is out for vengeance on all the masters, and is merely using the poor man as a stalking goat, to catch those who go after him and the lyre.

My Grandma: Frau Masha
###BREAK###
Yonatan, a 13-year-old boy, sets out with his camera to document for the very first time the story of his 90-year-old grandmother, Masha, a holocaust survivor. Masha tells Yonatan her story in such a way that revives events that she surpassed during the holocaust in front of the spectator's eyes: Life in the shadow of war, the impossible decisions she had to face, the separations, the loss... The movie reveals a unique encounter between a grandchild and his grandmother, which serves as a bridge between the third generation, the grandchildren, and the holocaust survivors who outlived the atrocities.

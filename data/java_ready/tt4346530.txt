I am so endlessly alone. The night is dark and warm, and I am so endlessly alone. This time is going to be finding out. Whats my illusions, whats my odds, and illusions have to be killed, I don't have more time to destroy. Don't I? Is my loneliness real and is my longing about what? Then who are this people? Shame, shitty dirty business, the ego of such ones as me possibly drive the rest of the world to the brink. I'm walking, judging, thinking. I'm a robot, a camera eye, I'm taking it in, and letting nothing out.

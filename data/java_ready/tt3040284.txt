Based on the rapes that took place in the Wrigleyville area of Chicago in 2005-2006, the story is told by Joe Archibald, who questions what lies beyond the horizon across open water. Comparing the experiences in his life to a sailor who crosses treacherous currents, Joe evokes a compelling story about his own journey in life after he lost everything and the people who helped to shape the man that he became.

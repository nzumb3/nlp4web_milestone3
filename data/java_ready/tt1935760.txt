Campania In-Felix (Unhappy Country) explores the damages produced by the illegal dumping of toxic waste in the environment and people's health specific to the Campania region in Southern Italy. The management of waste material in the region has been in the hands of the Camorra - a mafia organization with vast economic and political power. Through the narration of personal stories, this documentary reveals the broken emotional and cultural balance between the people from the region and their land. The goal of this film is to engage audiences and inspire participation in the conversation about how social and cultural interdependence between people and their land is shifting due to the degradation in the environments they live in.

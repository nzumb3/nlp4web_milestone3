El sol
###BREAK###
What's the state of society and youth culture, twenty years after the nuclear apocalypse? Well, more or less like this in Buenos Aires. Black humour, nasty words and intelligent rubbish in a unique cartoon for adults by the maker of Mercano el Marciano. The protagonists are Checo and Once, two difficult teenagers who live and survive in Buenos Aires. The nuclear explosion with which the action more or less starts turns the world to ashes, bringing incomprehensible social changes. But for Checo and Once, who are used to an uncertain existence, not much changes in this post-apocalyptic world. Filled with disrespectful language and with an imaginative drawing style, Blasco gives us incomparable and absurd adventures. But all those crude jokes do lead up to a strangely moving conclusion. The Sun is the living proof that there is more than Pixar, manga or European animation art.

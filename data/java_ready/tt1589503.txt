Spinsters
###BREAK###
After a 'night of clubbing', the documentary "Spinsters" starts to unfold into a series of informative interviews with female club DJs, promoters and producers. They emerge from all walks of life and from as far away as Australia and Italy, but they all have one thing is common: Their love of music. Through intimate chats with such trailblazers as techno luminary Mistress Barbara, turn-tablist Shortee, house legends DJ Heather and Marcia Carr and local celebrity Denise Benson, "Spinsters" reveals an alternative scene that still objectifies women, and into which these unique musicians continue to push forward.

Turning Point
###BREAK###
Set in New York city, the plot explores ethnic prejudice amongst the various black communities in America when a Nigerian playboy deals with the consequences after abandoning his American sweetheart for an arranged wife from back home. Ade (Igoni Archibong) is a playboy Nigerian-American investment banker in New York City. He is in a relationship with keen-to-marry African-American Stacey (K.D. Aubert). Her family (Ernie Hudson, Cynda Williams) had been cautious of this "African" but begins to warm to him due to his professional success and charm. However, Ade's manipulative mother (Patience Ozokwor) back in Nigeria would rather her son gets serious and dumps "that girl with no traceable roots" in favour of a wife from within her social circle. He is tricked into visiting Nigeria only to discover an arranged marriage had already been conducted on his behalf with a complete stranger. Reluctantly, Ade accepts the new wife, Grace (Jackie Appiah), since she is beautiful and seems submissive. Back in the US, Ade avoids Stacey until she crudely discovers his secret marriage. Grace quickly settles into the American lifestyle, living as a kept woman while Ade continues to enjoy the freedom of a bachelor. Grace eventually tires of Ade's behaviour and confronts him, setting off a series of battles that makes Ade realise how easily his enviable lifestyle could be taken away. With the going tough and friends thin, Ade decides to mount a final showdown that will be a turning point for everyone.

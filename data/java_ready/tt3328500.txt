It's a short documentary telling the drama of Marmato, a small gold mining town in Colombia. Traditional gold mining had been done there for at least 500 years, until a Canadian multinational came, and with the help of the Colombian government tried to kick them out of their land to make an open pit mine, causing a huge social disaster among at least 3.000 families that live there.

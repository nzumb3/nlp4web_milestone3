Microserfs
###BREAK###
Microserfs is a movie examines the angst of the white-collar, under-30 set in this entertaining tale of computer techies who escape the serfdom of Bill Gates's Microsoft to found their own multimedia company. The story is told through the online journal of Daniel, an affable, insomniac, 26-year-old aspiring code writer. Together with his girlfriend Karla, he relocates to a Lego-adorned office in Palo Alto, Calif., to develop a product called Object Oriented Programming (Oop!), a form of virtual Lego. Much of the story concerns the Oop! staff's efforts to raise capital and "have a life" amid 18-hour work days.

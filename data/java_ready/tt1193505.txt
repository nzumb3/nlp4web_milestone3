The Moving Men
###BREAK###
Everything is normal for the three friends until they find themselves in a very vicious cycle of outlandish deaths such as a girl choking to death while blowing up condom after an argument about party favors and a girl plummeting to her death from a motel balcony in the midst of drunken sex. So from bad to worse, worse to worst, the three friends continue to cover their tracks as much as they can and keep moving.

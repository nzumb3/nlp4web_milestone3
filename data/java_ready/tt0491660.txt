The Leech and the Earthworm
###BREAK###
Indigenous peoples voice their views on Western science, its vision of a genetically engineered future, and its deep links with corporate profits and globalization. The Leech and the Earthworm is a journey that combines passionate critiques of a future threatened by genetic engineering, and shares living alternatives to a globalized monoculture, with stunning visuals and music from around the world. The Leech and the Earthworm is a provocative film that inspires us to ask serious questions of the collective illusion we call "progress".

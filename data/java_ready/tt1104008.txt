What's the Vig?
###BREAK###
Tommy Irish is a dreamer, a documentary filmmaker large on ambition, thin on talent. He brings his ragtag film crew into a print shop, attempting to capture the pulse of America - the small business. Under time pressure from the Donald Vito, who wants to collect the Vig, Tommy begins to panic - his frustration at watching the ink dry drives him to "direct" reality. Complicating his life is his desire to define his ambiguous sexuality with his beautiful line producer, Julia. His nemesis is Kenneth, the religiously hypocritical owner of the print shop, who is hatching an evil master plan.

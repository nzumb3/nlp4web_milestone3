Patricia Uberoi, an Australian woman, married an Indian professor in the 60s and moved to his home in New Delhi. They raised three children there, but the riots and the anti-Sikh feelings led to her encouraging her children to move to Australia. A documentary about a multicultural family becomes a commentary on the events surrounding the anti-Sikh riots of 1984.

Anija (La nave)
###BREAK###
In the early days of March 1991, a number of ships laden with people made their appearance on Italy's Adriatic shores, marking what would later be known as the 'Albanian Exodus'. Who were the people on the ships? Where were they fleeing from? And where are they today. This is the story of a journey, the story of the ships and of the people who fled on them.

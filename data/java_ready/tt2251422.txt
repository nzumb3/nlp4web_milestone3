The Serious Muthafukin Business Of Love
###BREAK###
Angel and Tyler are a young couple with no lack of passion, but not an ounce of honesty. Angel's work as a contract killer keeps her away from home too much, and super-stoner Tyler can barely mapquest his way to a job interview. Neither knows the truth about what either does all day long, despite them being together a significant time. To compound the problems, Angel's Handler wants in her pants and won't take no for an answer, and Tyler just met a gorgeous dream of a girl who smokes more than he does. Will our young couple endure through these tribulations? Can they face the truth and survive? Will we be able to see through all the smoke?

Me and Dad: No Expectations of Applause
###BREAK###
Armed with a shaky camera and a loving gaze the now adult Kathrine steps back into her father's alcoholic world. A world of chaos and a constant fear of loss, but also lots of little jokes and big dreams of a better life. And what appears to be a film about social deroute is suddenly transformed into a warm and humorous feel good story about second chances when the unthinkable happens: Palle quits drinking!

Yeh Hai Malegaon Ka Superman
###BREAK###
Funny, irreverent and burlesque, this film-itself modelled on the Bollywood cinema parodies the typical Bollywood fare. It also has a larger purpose, in that it portrays the existing living conditions of a small town in India, which is true of any town in India. Made entirely by a group of non-professionals, its budget is a meagre one hundred thousand rupees(about US $ 2000/-). The superman of Malegaon is skinny, pencil-thin and has sunken cheeks. He does not provide thrills, he ushers in a new awareness in the town that he descends on. Using his special attributes, he tries to solve its problems and set it on the path of progress. It is an idealistic film, non-didactic and humorously told spoof.

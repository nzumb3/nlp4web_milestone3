Boy Pick-Up: The Movie
###BREAK###
There is an underground battle going on in the name of love. The soldiers are all Pikapistas. With pickup lines as their weapons to woo the gorgeous Neneng B, the war sizzles in the dark corners of the metro. And there is one undefeated champion among them: Boy Pick-up. Legendary, enigmatic, hypnotic, that's his appeal to most who don't get what his lines are all about, but his words penetrate their hearts just the same.

'Jung-hwan Park' is a serial murderer whose signature is savage mutilation of his victims. 'Myung-hyun,' identical twin brother to 'Jung-hwan,' is finding all social or work activity virtually impossible because his face has become infamous throughout the nation. 'Soo-min' is a six-month pregnant expectant mother who slaves away at a local factory because her husband does not provide for the family. She is on the verge of a complete nervous breakdown as she endures the cold and withering barbs from all around her, with only her lazy, sedentary husband by her side. Then one day, what was once a cold serial murder case reappears, and with it the renewed ire of the townspeople, deepening the discord between the troubled couple. To add insult to injury, the factory fires 'Soo-min' and the couple starts to become both socially and financially unwound and isolated. And there as spectator to all is the unchanging and ever-sedentary 'Myung-hyun.' With his confidence totally shot, how will he reclaim his control and position within the family?

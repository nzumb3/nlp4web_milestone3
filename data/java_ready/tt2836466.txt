... Under Your Shelter
###BREAK###
'Ayia Skepi', a therapeutic non-profit community for substance abuse, aims to offer the tools for mending the hearts of substance users that have found refuge under its shelter. The uniqueness of this long term program is that the community land is cultivated not only as a means of a therapeutic tool but also to produce organic products for self sustainability. Besides the Clinical and Managing Directors, no other faces are visible in the film. They must remain anonymous so their story is told through life in the community. The members speak of their fears, their past, their family relationships. They discuss their new-found realization of responsibility and wish to remain forever 'clean'.

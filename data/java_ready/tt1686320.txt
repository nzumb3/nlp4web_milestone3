James Noozle, a clumsy, lovable loser, promises to fulfill his dying mother's last request: to have the joy of seeing him married before she passes away. But the doctor says momma's only got two weeks, and James doesn't have any prospects. Frantically, he attempts to woo his office-crush, Becky, who hardly even knows he exists, while scrambling to recover the family wedding ring, which has been hijacked by two idiotic thieves.

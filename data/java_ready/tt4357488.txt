Blind Spot: Moments Unseen
###BREAK###
Blind Spot follows the epic journey of three visually-impaired adventurers who cross the Argentinean Andes by horseback. Set against the sweeping mountain vistas of Patagonian wilderness, Blind Spot challenges the conventional perception of blindness by awakening our senses to the overlooked. Blind Spot takes us on a horse-powered road-trip of self-discovery, new found perspective and personal triumph; because there is more to seeing than sight.

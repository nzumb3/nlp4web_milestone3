Pietro Ingrao, 97, tells his story through a long-distance exchange he has with a student from the 1980s, who is distracted from studying by the radio, which is transmitting Ingrao's own speech during the sixteenth Italian Communist Party's conference in March 1983. A long interview which takes place between January and June 2012, the film is not so much a story of Ingrao's life as much as it is his own tale on politics as a passion and 'as an instrument to change a world I don't like'. Ingrao tells the story of his twentieth and twenty-first century adventures. He talks about his great passion 'I wanted to be a film director, but instead I was kicked into politics'.

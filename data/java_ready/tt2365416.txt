Homecoming
###BREAK###
'It's hard to put the past behind you, when you're living in it'. Homecoming is the witty and poignant story of five friends who attended a Historically Black University together in the 1990s. The members of the group, now in their late-thirties, have kept in touch over the years, but have drifted somewhat apart. While gathering for Homecoming weekend at the house that was once their off-campus dorm, news of one member's recent death forces the friends to reflect on the past; rekindle relationships; reveal secrets; and redefine their lives.

On the Run

Michael, a young man in his early 20's has just been invited to his first big football hooligan fight after months of hanging around with the wrong crowds, and it's a mistake that will change his life forever. He convinces his best mate, Sebastien (Seb) to come along, who insists on bringing his video camera everywhere. When Seb is in serious trouble at the fight, Michael saves him, only to kill his attacker. After the horror of this accident, he is on the run, wanted by police, and is forced to live as a fugitive, away from society and his family... with a video camera. Seb vowes to stay by his side, but Michael keeps digging himself deeper and deeper into trouble before he finally has to face the reality of his actions.

Sistiaga, une histoire basque
###BREAK###
Jos√© Antonio Sistiaga is one of the greats in Basque contemporary art. Through lively exchanges begun in 1993 with his Salvadorean friend Manuel Sorto, we plunge into Sistiaga's intellectual intimacy and travel through a Basque history, following the steps of this experimental filmmaker and artist. This nearly two decades-old project is taken up again in 2011, with the filming of the installation of Sistiaga's retrospective exhibition in San Sebastian, Basque Country, Spain.

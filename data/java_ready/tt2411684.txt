The Campaign
###BREAK###
THE CAMPAIGN takes an inspiring look at California's No on 8 Campaign to defend same-sex marriage and covers the surprising history of relationship recognition in the United States. The story unfolds as a human drama following five ordinary people compelled by a passionate belief in equality. Their stories are placed inside a 60-year national context that explores the push for recognition of same-sex relationships since the 1950s. Ultimately THE CAMPAIGN provides a window into a timeless question: What inspires everyday people to opt in for something bigger than themselves?

The Final Gift
###BREAK###
The Final Gift documents director/producer Therese Bartholomew's quest to find life and meaning after the murder of her younger brother, Steve. Through video diary footage as well as interviews with Bartholomew and other members of Steve's family, Bartholomew has created an intimate story of grief and healing. The film culminates with a victim/offender dialog where Bartholomew comes face to face with her brother's killer, Karl, in a South Carolina prison. The film is a poignant story of introspection; it's about resilience and the complexity of being human. Through grit and grace, Bartholomew emerges a passionate advocate for restorative justice and, for victims, and yes, for offenders.

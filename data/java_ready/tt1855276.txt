Memories of San Pablo
###BREAK###
Memories of San Pablo follows Oriana Korol, the granddaughter of American missionaries and her friend, Priya Ghosh, into the Amazon region of Ecuador. Using an experimental format of eight chapters, the film documents the intersection of cultures, between generations and locations. The film actively explores the fluid boundaries between right and wrong, repetition and progression, and connection and repulsion. By examining one small town in Ecuador it raises question about what it means to be a global citizen and a loving family member.

The Ambulance
###BREAK###
A contemporary historical film reflecting the drama of the profound social changes that the Serbian society underwent at the turn of this century. The story is delivered through an account of the development of the local ambulance service. Adhering to the spirit of modern neorealism, this evolution is illustrated by three stories set in three different periods linked by mutually connected and conditioned characters; and there is also a dream of what it could be!

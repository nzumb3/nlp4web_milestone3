Stories from Tahrir
###BREAK###
In early 2011, I experienced the 18-day Egyptian revolution filtered through TV, Internet, and news reports. As an Egyptian American, and an experienced filmmaker, I felt a duty to help share the real stories of the people behind the revolution. So I created a documentary, which has been the official selection of half a dozen film festivals, and has won several awards. But the story isn't over. In November of 2011 I went back to Egypt, where I participated in the protests in Tahrir square, and interviewed people struggling to define a future Egypt, for a new documentary, 'Stories From Tahrir.' I spoke with activists, candidates, and the victims of decades of repression, who have never had a chance to share their stories until now.

Black Water
###BREAK###
Black Water is the dirty water, the stuff that accumulates in an RV tank. With that said, this trip had almost no plan and was destination-less. We knew we wanted to pick up a friend in the south and get away from the cold so we can do some much needed skateboarding. The rest of the trip was planned on the RV with the other 9 individuals including myself and an average of 3, 30 packs a day. Basically what you put in is what you get out, and this trip was it. 10 people on an RV. Living with each other has its good and bad moments. This film is a documentation of that. On and off the our skateboards this film takes you into a look at what happens as these guys trek through the American Southland.

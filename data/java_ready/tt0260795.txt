Superconductor
###BREAK###
Top scientists compete to achieve a breakthrough in superconductivity. Professor Lin and his younger compatriots rush to be the first to complete their experiments, but a Japanese scientist, who is recruited by IBM in New York City, is hot on his heels. In the world of science, it's often the result, not the personalities and sacrifices, that counts. But what both eventually realise is that individual honor is not as important as the intrinsic reward of making a real contribution to mankind.

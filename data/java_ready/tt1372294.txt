Baseball in the Dominican Republic is not just a game. For many Dominicans the long, competitive road to a professional baseball career is one of the few viable alternatives to a life of poverty. ROAD TO THE BIG LEAGUES introduces you to the young men who embark on this odyssey and shows you first hand the pressure and joy that go along with it. Through the eyes of local kids playing with pebbles to the perspective of Dominican major league stars David Ortiz and Vladimir Guerrero, this documentary reveals a side of 'America's Game' that few have ever seen before.

Just outside the southern wall of Kibera, the largest urban slum in Africa, is Sadili Oval Sports Academy. Meaning 'well-being' in Swahili,' Sadili is a social enterprise uses sports as a means to reach out to children and young people in need - both in the slums and from across East Africa. 'Dirt Court Dreams' centers on Flo - a Kibera resident and tennis coach - and reflects how Sadili has made her life better and through her has, and is, improving the lives of many others.

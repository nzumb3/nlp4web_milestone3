Street Monkeys
###BREAK###
Breaking and entering, gang fights-it's not the lifestyle you would imagine inside the posh Mount Edgecombe Estate in Durban, South Africa. But for our primate cousins, the vervet monkey, just trying to protect their turf is all in a day's work. This group of mischievous vervet monkeys bring action and drama to every street corner. Over the course of a year, two rival gangs, the Pani Troop and the Sugar Cane Gang, will vie for prime real estate. See who will win.

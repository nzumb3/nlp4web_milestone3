Tsunami in the Sky
###BREAK###
The Morning Glory is a natural phenomenon that happens only a few weeks a year in the skies above Burketown on outback Australia's crocodile coast. These waves in the sky, marked by clouds over 3,000 feet high, blow off the sea at 60 kilometres an hour, attracting sailplane, trike, and hang glider pilots from across Australia, and the world, all hoping for the chance to surf them. This documentary follows the journey of six men with the desire to do just that.

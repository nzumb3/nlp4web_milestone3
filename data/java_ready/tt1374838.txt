Bite Size
###BREAK###
Douglas Peatry's life is a bland routine. He goes to work every day at a mediocre job, tries to avoid confrontation with his tormenting coworkers, and basks in life's simple pleasures like fish sticks and his hot tub. All of that changes when two animal rights amateurs uncover a secret government experiment by rescuing a live and dangerous scientific specimen, a shark with a human brain, and dispose of it in the first place they stumble upon: Douglas's hot tub. Douglas discovers the opportunity for sweet vengeance against all who have wronged him... at one-hundred and one degrees. But how long will it be before reality comes crashing down?

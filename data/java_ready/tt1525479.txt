Zeitfenster: A View Through a Window
###BREAK###
Standing in the heart of Berlin, the Palast der Republik, was the golden centerpiece of the East German regime. In 2002 in was finally decided that the building should be demolished. In a rare display of bureaucratic inspiration, the famous brown mirrored windows which had covered the building were quietly given away to the public. See through the eyes of four very different people who wanted a window, an intimate journey through this very recent period of German history. Why they wanted the windows and what they have done with them, reveal touchingly different perspectives on a reunified Germany 20 years after the fall of the wall.

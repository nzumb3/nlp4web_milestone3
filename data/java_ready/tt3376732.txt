Christmas Hear Kids
###BREAK###
Jamie is in a relatively good mood as he works through the Christmas period waxing poetically about the horrors of a Christmas dinner with the drunken, depressed, semi-racists he calls his family. But with a new baby on the way, and struggling to make money in the current economic climate, he accepts a high paying job taking someone from Edinburgh to Glasgow: Laura.

Little Eden
###BREAK###
LITTLE EDEN opens with the Big Bang and the first five billion odd years of the universe. Several million years later, we follow the mishaps of Simon Moog, a former High Energy Astrophysicist and Edena, a world renowned psychic healer who suffers from an inoperable brain tumor. The lives of both characters revolve around the premise that everything that exists evlolved from stardust, and beyond that there is a great, mysterious force that governs the universe. Because Simon cannot come to terms with the endless conflicts that arise in his head, his quest leads him to insanity and devastation, while Edena ultimately finds salvation through love and self-forgiveness.

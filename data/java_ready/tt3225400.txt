El Tío
###BREAK###
Democracy, identity, and crimes of passion collide in this political thriller that blends reality and fiction, past and present. When Ignacio, a young Chilean actor, decides to make a play about his real-life uncle, assassinated Senator Jaime Guzmán- direct collaborator of military dictator Augusto Pinochet and architect of Chile's still-enforced 1980 Constitution- the result is a cinematic odyssey into the psyche of a nation still haunted by it's troubled past. Directorial debut of acclaimed screenwriter Mateo Iribarren, EL TIO's theatrical release in Chile caused controversy across the political spectrum. Supporters of Guzmán published full-page ads to denounce the film, while his adversaries renewed calls for constitutional reform. It went on to win the Jury Prize at the Biarritz Festival of Latin American Film and the Pedro Sienna Award for Best Screenplay.

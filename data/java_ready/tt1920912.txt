El silencio y la tormenta
###BREAK###
In the middle of National Park Donana (Andalusia), we find the home of the Virgin of the Marsh, in the Small village of Rocio. The area breaths everything the Holy Virgin symbolizes. Painter Alberto obtains it's inspiration from the watery surroundings and enjoys the plants, animals and the beauty of nature. His work is inspired by his philosophy concerning the area and it's origin. One time per year, for four days, Rocio and Donana undergo a transformation and they are opened for largely a million pilgrims who come to honor the Holy Virgin, on what has become the greatest pilgrimage of Western Europe. A colorful festival full of emotion, music and contradiction.

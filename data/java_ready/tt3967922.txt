Before 'I Do'
###BREAK###
A game of Russian roulette. There are scandalous secrets and a cover up, and three people, bound to take them to the grave. Before 'I Do' draws you into the realm of passion and love, lust, lies, and friendship. A fast-paced, colorful drama with a splash of comedy and a myriad of surprises. At the heart, Caleb Abrams, a magnetic, Baltimore, MD, firefighter by day, artist by night, flamboyant and smooth, he could talk his way into a convent. As his "thirties" reluctantly loom to an end, he is on the brink of turning forty, and suddenly afraid of dying alone. Running in burning buildings gives Caleb an adrenaline rush out this world, but he can't handle the deaths that are seemingly just part of the job. But Caleb's sanctified father sees his dreams of becoming the next Van Gogh as less than practical, a strike to his confidence. He's at a crossroad. Just one year ago, the love of Caleb's life bailed on the eve of the wedding, opting to stroll the aisle with someone else. Finally, Caleb is picking up the pieces and moving forward with his life, but the scars are ever-present, bleeding into his present life and coloring every decision. In a twist, Caleb finds comfort. Best friend, Shelby, is ecstatic, when he learns that his wife, Jasmyn, is expecting, and deems Caleb, the "Godfather". Out of nowhere, Asia resurfaces in Caleb's life, and not to apologize for leaving him at the altar, but to rekindle an affair that will lead to insidious, humbling consequences when he discovers that he still loves her.

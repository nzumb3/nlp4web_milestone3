Shooting Star(s): The Rise of Hip Hop Photographer Johnny Nunez
###BREAK###
The documentary tells the story of Johnny Nunez (36) and his escape from humble upbringings in Brooklyn to become today's most prominent hip hop celebrity photographer. The filmmakers Axel Ebermann and Daniel Frei document the incredible journey of this man who is now on the verge of becoming a household name himself. The film both depicts the glamorous life of Johnny Nunez, in which he mingles with prominent figures such as Russel Simmons, Al Sharpton, Swizz Beatz, Tyra Banks, Jay-Z, Bai Ling and many more - but also narrates Johnny's 'American Dream' rise from poverty and his battles with racism to becoming a star of his own.

Daghe fogo
###BREAK###
Daghe fogo is a zero budget drama comedy set in the city of Rovinj in Croatia. It is about the social problems that can affect people from various castes, seen through a demented and tragicomic perspective. Dilemmas and situations that nobody wants to talk about even thought we're all familiar with. The languages spoken are Croatian, Italian and the local dialect because of the multiculturality of the region.

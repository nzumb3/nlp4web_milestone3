"It Came From Another World!" chronicles the continuing adventures of everyone's favorite 'a-rockin' scientist, Professor Jackson. First introduced in 2006's "The Monster of Phantom Lake," Professor Jackson (Josh Craig) finds himself tasked yet again with saving the planet from certain doom. When Professor Jackson's colleague and best friend Dr. Frasier (Mike Mason) doesn't return from a scientific expedition in the deep woods, the Professor is sent to find and retrieve him. While searching, the Professor and Canoe Cops Sven (M. Scott Taulman) and Gustav (Mike Cook) stumble upon an enigmatic meteorite that may hold the answer to Dr. Frasier's disappearance - and something far more cataclysmic than they could ever imagine! Can our intrepid heroes unlock the secrets of the mysterious "rock from outer space" before its otherworldly power threatens not only the fate of the entire universe, but Professor Jackson's wedding plans?

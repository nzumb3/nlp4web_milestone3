Going Thru a Thing
###BREAK###
Charlie robs banks to pay the bills. All Samantha, Sammy, his precocious 13 year old daughter wants, is a normal father with a normal job. When the school teachers go on strike, her basketball team desperately needs a new coach and Charlie is coerced into the position by his 'hole in the head' gang, and the notion that it might ease his upcoming sentencing. A chance to bond with his daughter spirals Charlie's life out of control, this time involving Sammy, her team and an angry mob boss who watched too much Oprah. Going thru a Thing is the humorously poignant story of a middle-aged man who realizes that growing up can take place at any age and that's its never too late to change direction.

A zombie appears in the middle of Seoul in 2001. Groups of people start to worship him, and in time they build a church in the name of the zombie. The honorary president of the church is the current president who, in the past, was really fucked up by the zombie himself. And a slew of morons from all over Korea still discuss/worship the zombie. The name of the zombie all these morons worship is-surprise!-the bearer of modern Korea, ex-president Park Jung-Hee.

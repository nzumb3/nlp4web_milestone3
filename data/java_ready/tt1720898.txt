On a secluded patch of land in central Massachusetts, there is an abandoned Shaker cemetery. Of the 300 buried there, over half lived to extreme old age, surpassing the life expectancy of the time by at least 30 years. How did they achieve such abundant life on the earth? What truth had they stumbled upon to bring them unnaturally long years? What were their secrets? These questions are explored in the independent documentary film, 'Come Thou Fount: Thoughts on the Shakers'.

Sur le rivage du monde
###BREAK###
After several failed attempts to reach Europe, Cesar, Felou and Erik find themselves in Bamako, Mali deported, dejected, disoriented, but still driven to pursue their dreams. Meanwhile Ami, like so many other young women in Africa, fights with unshakable determination to escape a life of unfulfilment and forge a brighter future for herself and her children. Through their words, through poetry, theater and song, they begin to build atop the ruins of their shattered ambitions. They strive to express the inexpressible, share the unsharable, and in so doing heal their wounds, lift their spirits and rekindle their sense of hope. They stand up against the multiple forces that surround them and seek to suppress them. Their words are power.

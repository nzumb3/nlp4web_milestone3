Lokalni vampir
###BREAK###
When a passive young businessman is conned and thrown into great debts, he and his mother concoct a desperate escape plan - to fake his death, stage a funeral, then hide him out in the attic. When he sneaks out to visit his girlfriend, he is spotted by the neighbors, who jump to the conclusion that he is a vampire risen from the dead. It's not long before the news of a lurking vampire attracts waves of tourists, including some mobsters who aren't completely sold on this whole vampire story.

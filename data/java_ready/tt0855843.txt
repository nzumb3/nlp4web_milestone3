I Am from Titov Veles
###BREAK###
Set in the quaint town of Veles, three sisters long to escape the suffocating environment of their dying community. Burdened by memories of their late father, each chooses a different path. A contemporary story of urban decay, this film's stark realism blends with memorable performances to depict the vivid landscape of post-Communist Macedonia.

Street Vendors: Their Voices, Their Stories
###BREAK###
The streets of Hanoi are filled with thousands of rural women who come to the city to work as street vendors. Most of them come to the city not because they like the job but because they and their families are increasingly unable to survive on agriculture alone. 'Street Vendors: Their Voices ~ Their Stories' features some of these women. In it, they talk about their lives and their families, about their hopes and their dreams, and about the many difficulties they face as they try to balance their time between city and country. These are the voices and stories of women struggling to keep their families from getting left behind in the rapidly industrializing and urbanizing country of Vietnam.

The Legend of the Reno Brothers
###BREAK###
The Reno Brothers Gang were largely a group of criminals and war veterans that operated in the Midwest during and after the Civil War. They carried out the first peacetime train robbery in world History years before Jesse James and Billy the Kid gained notoriety. Ten members of the gang, including three brothers, were illegally lynched while in official protective custody of the US Government. Afterwards, a firestorm of international protests from Great Britain and Canada ensued. Ultimately, no one was ever identified or prosecuted for the murders. This new documentary examines the root cause of a small, rural Midwestern town in anarchy; not only due to the Reno Gang's crimes, but the secret formation of the Jackson County Vigilance Committee otherwise known as the Masked Halters or the Red Mask Society. Few know the truth about the Reno Brothers Gang. The Legend of the Reno Brothers sets out to enlighten those interested in the true history of a dark, and often neglected chapter in American History; the Post Civil War Reconstruction Era.

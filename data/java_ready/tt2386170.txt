Eating Alabama
###BREAK###
In search of a simpler life, a young couple returns home to Alabama where they set out to eat the way their grandparents did - locally and seasonally. But as their new diet forces them to navigate the agricultural industrial complex, they soon realize that nearly everything about the food system has changed since farmers once populated their family histories. A thoughtful and often funny essay on community, the South and sustainability, "Eating Alabama" is a story about why food matters.

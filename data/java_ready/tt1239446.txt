The Last Days of Emma Blank
###BREAK###
Mr. Haneveld runs the household like a devoted butler in Emma Blank's Dutch seaside villa. It's a crazy mix of disgruntled staff, unstable lovers and incestuous offspring, constantly harassed by Emma's absurdly inconsistent orders. Her brother Theo even literally plays the family dog. Only Gonnie, Hanevlet and Emma's daughter, finds an external lover, Martin, who later shares in their pointless misery. When Emma discloses the inheritance everyone waited for without pay is lost in stock crises, only the house is left, a grim finale ensues.

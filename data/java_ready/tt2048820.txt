No hay nadie all√° afuera
###BREAK###
A film about the teenage angst. Gerardo, a seventeen boy, let the days go by while rehearsing with his rock band, wandering the streets looking for someone to get lost with, and avoiding the inevitable confession of his love for Andrea, trying not to get his house, a place that is no longer a home. Because, as everywhere, there is no one outside and nothing is happening here.

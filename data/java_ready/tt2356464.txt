Ostwind
###BREAK###
East wind - Together we are free is the incomparably beautiful history of bad schoolgirl Mika, which not only learns in the summer holidays, that she is a good rider, but the language of the horse speaks. For whatever reason it is the only well that can ride the previously untamed east wind, and thereby learns to love above all else. East wind is for all horse lovers, whether large or small, to highly recommend it. The story captivates until the last second. Great nature shots make the film well worth seeing as many also often dramatic twists. Can one or the other critics despise the story to this friendship as cheesy and boring, I am of the opinion that they were not allowed to experience the magic between humans and animals from their own experience in their lives. East Wind - Together We Are Free.

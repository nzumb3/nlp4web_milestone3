Salvage
###BREAK###
'Salvage' is a documentary that takes a look at the stories of women on Skid Row, and their struggles with homelessness, abuse, and addiction. Filmed at and with the help of the Union Rescue Mission, the film takes a special glimpse into the Mission and the transitional housing facility Hope Gardens. The stories of the women are as varied as the way that they got to Skid Row, and each is salvaging their life in a different way.

Focus Puller
###BREAK###
After an accident involving a gun on the set of a B-movie leaves the 1ST AC position vacant, 2ND AC and boy-next-door Charlie Dunlap gets promoted. This places him squarely in the sights of the film's starlet Becca Mustaine. Becca, once a household name as a child has since aged into a recovering addict, quickly steals what keeps Charlie tethered to reality. With no medication to rely on and breaking his heart by continuing her affair with the films director, Charlie tries to keep it together but can't. With no one to help he finally succumbs to his hallucinations. Because in this allegory, and much like our world, the singular attempts of a madman to quiet his demons are never enough.

Mountain Men
###BREAK###
A field diary that depicts the portraits of the Palestinian hard, day workers from east Jerusalem. They are employed by the grand death industry at the very bottom of Jerusalem's biggest and busiest cemetery - Har Hamenochot ('Resting Mountain'). There, they come together to sweat out not only the grime of their daily routines, but also their grief, hopes, joys and memories.

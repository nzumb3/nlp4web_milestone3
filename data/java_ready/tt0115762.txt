Broken Silence
###BREAK###
A Carthusian monk, Fried Adelphi, dedicated to silence and meditation for the last 25 years, tells his story (to priest, Michael Moriarty, in a minor role). His order sends him to Indonesia to request the extension of their cloister's lease. En route to Jakarta, he experiences claustrophobia and de-planes in New Delhi, India. Without contacts or any worldly knowledge, he fortunately is reunited with his fellow passenger, Ashaela, the wallet thief. Unaware of her indiscretion, Fried allows Ashaela to help him find his way to Jakarta.

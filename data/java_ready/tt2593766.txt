Bastardi 3
###BREAK###
The teacher Tom치s Majer, who came to one former special school in 2010, has disappeared. He came to the school a few months after his sister, also a teacher, was murdered. The boys that murdered Jana Majerov치 died mysteriously during the school year. It seems that Tom치s Majer most likely cold-bloodedly revenged his sister's death. Is there no problem with that? Will the police apprehend him? Will he face trial? What do the children's parents think? And Tom치s Majer's parents? Society? What will happen when similar schools are shut down? The film that shocked the public two years ago is coming to its conclusion. A drama that plainly shows the hard reality of this day and age, that shows how far things can go it we only idly watch.....

Eat. Sleep. Repeat.
###BREAK###
Ethan Traum: a frowzy, post-teen burn-out, drifting aimlessly through life with no purpose or direction, living out the same routine day after day, suffers from contradictory sleeping conditions that hinder him from obtaining a regular sleeping pattern. His bland, empty existence is lived out in stark contrast to his bright, vibrant imagination that manifests it's self completely in his dream life, which he'll go to extreme measures to try and escape to on a regular basis...and maybe even permanently.

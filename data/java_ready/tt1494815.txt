###BREAK###
Documentarian Christopher Hines illustrates the varying degrees of masculinity in contemporary gay male culture by posing specific questions, and studying the variety of lifestyles of the gay community. The film offers an alternative and new look at masculinity and homosexuality as interpreted by the members of the gay community. There are interviews with rugby players, rodeo riders, writers, teachers, historians, and psychologists, who draw a rich portrait of masculinity and how gay men see themselves and others.

Leaving No Trace
###BREAK###
Aurelia, a Norteña who's a high-school dropout with two sons, ditches her life as a sweatshop seamstress by stealing her boyfriend's dope, selling it, and heading for Cancún in her station wagon. At a truck stop, she's approached by Marilú, who deals in Mayan art forgeries, speaks with a Castilian accent, and wears Gucci. Marilú's also on the lamb, trying to avoid prison and escape a corrupt federal investigator. On the road, it's soon apparent they're being followed, but by whom? At least six people are in pursuit of the women. Can the women trust each other enough to work as a team; is there honor among thieves?

One Day Removals
###BREAK###
Andy and Ronnie are removal men. Andy owns the van and Ronnie lifts the heavy stuff. They have been doing this job for several years and nothing interesting has ever happened. That is, until the events of 'One Day Removals' start to unfold. Follow the adventures of two unremarkable Scottish men who are forced to deal with events of a quite extraordinary nature. Events that will take them into parts of Scotland seldom seen. Events of a very dark kind. It just takes one bad day to change everything, and no-one is safe. In a case that will rock the very foundations of the Scottish legal system, Andy Watt is telling the truth - but no living soul will ever believe him.

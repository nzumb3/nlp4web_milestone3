Eye Music
###BREAK###
In a southern Mexico's coast small village, a group of young deaf people receive an unusual proposal: to make a movie out of their dreams. While Eric and his friends watch films and discuss the stories they wish to film, we meet their everyday life full of desires as well as deceptions. Eye Music is a reflection on the dreamy world of silent films and its cross-linking with sign language, perception and culture of the Deaf.

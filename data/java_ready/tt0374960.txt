Faith, Love and Charity
###BREAK###
A woman goes aboard one of the big ships that docks at her local harbour, the Port of Ã…rhus. She is alone with her camera. She talks to sailors from all over the world. Each ship is like an expedition to a new country. A portrait of the sailor of today. A classic tale given a brand-new guise. A film about prejudices and myths, love and yearning, sailors and their women, with Christmas providing a framework for the story.

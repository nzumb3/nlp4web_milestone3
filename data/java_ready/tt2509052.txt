Bread Thieves
###BREAK###
Simon is released from prison after a three month drug sentence that should have belonged to his father. He returns home to find his brother Jason and his friends are there to welcome him back. They drink and discuss an opportunistic robbery from a local dealer, but Simon declines even when Roach suggests going on the lamb together to prevent loose lips. After a confrontation with his father, Simon is forced to flee, having no other option than to do the ill-fated robbery. Unbeknownst to the boys, they are recognized during the robbery and not only is Zane on their tail, but another criminal named The Hindu and even Simon's own father are also en-route. Once they make it to the cabin, one of the boys drinks too much and shows his true colors as he spirals, eventually leading to the kidnapping of a young woman and the accidental shooting of one of the friends, sending the situation into chaos. Things continue to spiral as Simon's father, Zane and the Hindu eventually all find their hiding place, with each them working toward their own end in an effort to steal the money and kill the boys. Both Simon's loyalty and sense of morality are tested as he has to carefully choose both his friends and actions in order to survive.

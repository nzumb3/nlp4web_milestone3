Adela
###BREAK###
Bolivia, 1945. Two murders have been committed in Hotel Central, the inhospitable meeting point of the mixture of indigenous, Creole and European people who live in San Jacinto, a city of despair. Adela, the attractive owner's wife, blames Maria, one of the servants. But Timar, a young traveler, finds out some information that suggests a very different truth. In an oppressive atmosphere, where escaping seems to be the only thing that matters, Timar will struggle between his feelings for Adela and the injustice of convicting an innocent person. The risk of it is losing the few values he still has; the reward, experiencing love at its most.

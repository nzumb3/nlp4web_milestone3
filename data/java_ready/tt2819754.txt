Tik & the Turkey
###BREAK###
The townships in the suburbs of Cape Town, SA are blighted by the highly addictive, heroin-based 'unga,' which is mixed with cleaning detergents; and Crystal Meth known locally as 'tik' which are slowly crippling the population. Lainey Richardson's debut documentary follows 27 year old, party girl addict Analese, and her 25 year old childhood friend Trevino, who is struggling to hold his family together, having lied about his heroin addiction until he was married. Tik and the Turkey is the human face of an abandoned community facing a drug abuse epidemic.

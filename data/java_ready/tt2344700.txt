The Epic Adventures of Lakegirl
###BREAK###
Two orphaned children with out-of-this-world abilities are left to grow up in Gimli, Manitoba to protect Lake Winnipeg from an intergalactic heist. However, one of them is not told of her abilities, leading university student Carlina Hanley to receive them without knowing even how to use them. The other one, Tyson Johnson has been pressured since he was a child to learn how to use them properly to defend Carlina, leading him down a dark path of substance abuse. This makes waging their defense a challenge.

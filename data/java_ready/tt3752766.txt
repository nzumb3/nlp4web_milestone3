Mermaid's Song
###BREAK###
An homage to Hans Christian Andersen's "The Little Mermaid", Done Four Productions' inaugural feature "Charlotte's Song" tells the story of Charlotte (Katelyn Mager), a young girl coming of age in the midst of one of the most desolate and desperate periods in American history. Set in the 1930s Oklahoma Dust Bowl, the untimely death of Charlotte's mother triggers a downward spiral for her father, five sisters and their family-run song and dance act. Help comes from an unlikely source when a gangster named Randall (Iwan Rheon) offers to pay off their debt in exchange for making some unsavoury changes to the family business. Matters are complicated when it is discovered that Charlotte, like her mother before her, is in fact a mermaid capable of controlling humans with her voice. What follows is a sophisticated magical turf war in which antagonists from many camps seek to take advantage of Charlotte's power. The best and worst of humanity are put on display and Charlotte must choose her own path, knowing that the wrong decision will have deadly consequences for herself and the people she loves.

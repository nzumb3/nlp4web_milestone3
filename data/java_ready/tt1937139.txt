Dissonance
###BREAK###
DISSONANCE is composed of documentary material of diverse kinds, juxtaposed on an HD wide-screen, in a challenging formal manner. The opening sequence is composed of 3 screens, each with a single shot on it, lasting 50 minutes; the interaction between the 3 images is force which compels interest. Following this sequence are a number of other much quicker shots, often enigmatic. The conclusion is abrupt. I have no idea what it means, only that it poetically probes the meaning of life, and offers no conclusions. It is meant, on many levels, to disturb the viewer.

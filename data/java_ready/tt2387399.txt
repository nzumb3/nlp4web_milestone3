Bastrop: Rising from the Ashes
###BREAK###
The 2011 Labor Day weekend in Texas will remain a painful memory for thousands of families who lost their homes to the devastating wildfires. While many fires raged out of control across Texas, the community of Bastrop was hit the hardest with over 1,600 homes destroyed. Thousands of volunteers and aid organizations flooded the community and have been assisting in the recovery process, which will take years to complete. The documentary titled "Bastrop: A Community In Recovery" will be released on September 3rd, 2012, the first anniversary of the fires to bring continued awareness to impact and the continued recovery efforts, as well as document many of the incredible stories of survival and rebuilding. Classic Jack Films will explore and tell the story of the victims and the heroes of Bastrop. In this feature-length documentary, we will tell the story and history of Bastrop and the fires, follow several families as they continue to live and attempt to rebuild their lives, and interview the men and women of the local police and fire departments as they recount their experiences and struggles on the ground. We will also be riding along with those working to clean up the destruction and document the daily efforts to restore Bastrop to normality.

Abortion Democracy: Poland/South Africa
###BREAK###
This documentary feature contrasts changes in Poland and South Africa regarding abortion laws and their impact on the lives of women. In the 90's, Poland banned abortion due to the increasing influence of the Catholic Church after the fall of communism; around the same time South Africa legalized it, reforming the health system after the fall of apartheid. The film also however, illustrates the paradox that the implementation of such laws may have little effect on the accessibility of abortion services: Illegal abortions are more accessible in Poland than legal ones in South Africa.

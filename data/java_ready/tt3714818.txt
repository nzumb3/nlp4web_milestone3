For the Love of Poe
###BREAK###
Poetic-Suspense. Martin Skald (Nils Oliveto) is an ex-convict and a beloved fan of Edgar Allan Poe's poetry. Shortly after his release from prison, he is commissioned by a world-class smuggler (Serge Patry) to find three artifacts with supposedly supernatural powers dating back from Francisco Pizarro's conquest of the Incas in the 1500's. Three years after his mission, which took him to Europe, South America and Africa, Martin's assignment comes back to haunt him through a mysterious memoir given to him by a homeless gentleman. Martin feels like a marked man, a sentiment enhanced by a higher level of anxiety resulting from the reading of Poe's book and the bewildering events described in the compelling personal journal. Engulfed by the presence of Poe's charismatic verses and the strong presence of classical music, ''For the Love of Poe'' (produced, written and directed by Nils Oliveto) is a modern day poetic-suspense which extracts the deepest fear of a man suffocating from paranoia and delusions in direct connection with his past actions.

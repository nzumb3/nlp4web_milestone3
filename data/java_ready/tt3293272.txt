###BREAK###
Recognized and respected all around the world, laureate of many awards for his film Skupljaci perja /Even Met Happy Gypsies/, Sasa Petrovic always had big problems with censorship in SFRJ, from his first film Dani /Days/ to his last Seobe /Migrations/. After the affair around Lazar Stojanovic and film Plasticni Isus /Plastic Jesus/ , whose mentor was Sasa, he lost his job on the Faculty of Dramatic Arts in Belgrade and was unable to make films in SFRJ for many years. Petrovic refers to these topics, but also explains how it was difficult to make Seobe /Migrations/, during the 90's. He died in 1994.

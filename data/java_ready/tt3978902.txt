In this touching family drama, Kacie Lewis (Allie Deberry) is a rebellious 17-yr-old girl who is struggling with guilt and anger after witnessing the death of her younger brother. When Kacie is arrested and sentenced to a work-release program at Spirit Riders, an equine therapy camp for disabled and physically challenged youths she finds herself out of her element and having trouble adjusting to the rules. She finds a kindred spirit in Blaze, a retired racehorse having difficulty adjusting to his new domesticated life. Under the guidance of Rex (Lance Henriksen), the no-nonsense owner of the ranch, Kacie helps re-train Blaze and in the process learns to let go of the past forgive and set her spirit free.

The Profession
###BREAK###
Tommy is a twenty one year old man, who has never been able to hold down a job for very long, having left school at sixteen. We soon learn that Tommy's financial backing is through the distribution of illegal substances. Over the years he has built up a large list of clients, some he respects, some he doesn't. But the end result always ends in a pay check. We follow Tommy as he goes onto bigger and 'better' things in his drug dealing career, but is it all as glamorous as Tommy first thought?

Moose River Crossing is a feature film based on the play that examines the premise and asks the question "Does time heal all wounds?". Six childhood friends and former residential school students meet at the train station to travel to their school reunion. It's been eighteen years. Excited yet apprehensive they greet each other with the warmth of friends past and do the preverbal "catch up." As the minutes move to hours and a derailed train delays their travel, these six adults flash to the past; the love, the lies, the pain of childhood lost and finally resolution. Their reunion insulated in the stark lobby of the train station, proves to be the door that opens a path to healing.

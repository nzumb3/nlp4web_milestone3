The film centres around three female supermodels who live and work together. They belong to the international world of fashion and modelling and are at the top of their game. When a regular fashion show goes horribly wrong, they are sucked into the nasty but irresistible underworld of Bombay. The girls have unwittingly botched up a diamond delivery to the Middle East. Their task is now cut out for them: Plan A - get into the fashion extortion business Plan B - stage India's biggest bank robbery to get the diamonds back Plan C - decamp with the loot.

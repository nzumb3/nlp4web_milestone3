Black Sorority Project: The Exodus
###BREAK###
In 1913, a group of twenty-two female students at Howard University changed the course of American history forever. Defying barriers of race and gender, they courageously joined the women's suffrage movement and formed a new sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, which would grow to become -- as it is today -- one of the nation's most formidable women's organizations. Narrated by Tamara Tunie, "Black Sorority Project: The Exodus" transports the viewer back in time on a photographic journey into the world of these dynamic and ambitious Howard coeds and reveals one of the more remarkable chapters of women's history.

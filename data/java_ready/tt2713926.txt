Double Negative
###BREAK###
Double Negative is the story of 2 strangers who are caught in an elevator.... that is falling bit by bit. These two unlikely friends- a 'today's the due date' 9 month pregnant single mom and and an obsessive compulsive, coke addicted corporate president of sales- are forced to deal with their demons, and each other, in a sometimes dramatic and some times comedic way. It is all about who they are and who they become when faced with the possibility of the end.

Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York
###BREAK###
'Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York' is the story of the Photo League (1936-1951), which for fifteen years was the center of the documentary movement in American photography at a time when the camera was held to be, in James Agee's words, 'the central instrument of our time'. Featuring little-known examples of the work of fifty of the Photo League's leading photographers and supplemented with interviews with still feisty (and active) League veterans, the film features a captivating, 'period' musical score and an incisive narration read by Campbell Scott. 'Ordinary Miracles' is a tribute to the high purpose of photography, a remarkable group and an unmatched panorama of urban life in the neighborhoods of New York City during the 1930's and 40's.

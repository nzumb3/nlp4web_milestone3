Spanish Steps: Flamenco in a Foreign Land
###BREAK###
How Britain caught the flamenco bug. 'Spanish Steps: flamenco in a foreign land' is a warm hearted tribute to the pioneers of flamenco in Britain. Older flamencos, now in their 70's, 80s and 90s, recount how they fell into the exotic world of flamenco that shaped their lives and influenced future generations. Without a narrator. flamencos tell stories against a background of archive footage and photos. Those that can still perform kick up their heels at a reunion party in Soho London - the heart of the burgeoning cafe culture flamenco scene in the 1950s and 60s - a time of great social change.

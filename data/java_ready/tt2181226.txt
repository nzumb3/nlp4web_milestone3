Love is like an endless ocean in which our hearts dwell. Sometimes it is calm and gentle and other times it is raging and out of control. This unique love story set to music with no dialogue explores the tranquility and the tempests that love can bring. An experimental visual music experience exploring the depths and mystery of love features 19 songs from songwriter Daniel Jay Paul.

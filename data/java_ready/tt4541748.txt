Vadivel and his friends specialize in different aspects of film making and decided to make their first movie as one team. Vadivel wants his first film to be his story based on Tamil folklore that is also close to his heart since his father was a performer of the dying rural art form -'Koothu'. But every producer he meets, reject his story on grounds of absence of elements that would make it commercially viable and deem it too risky an option for a debut. Driven to the limits of desperation and not wanting to jeopardize the careers of his friends, he puts forth a plan to fund the movie by executing a heist. The turn of events once the team agrees to the plan is detailed to form the rest of the movie.

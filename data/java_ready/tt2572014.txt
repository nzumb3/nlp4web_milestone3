Blood of the Witch: The Complete Film
###BREAK###
Originally conceived as a trilogy of short silent films, Blood of the Witch: The Complete Film is a new edit of all three films put together into one stand-alone piece. It follows the ill-fated Abby Thelma on a quest to speak to her deceased father that turns both surreal and frightening. Director Casey T. Malone's lo-fi silent epic features an increasingly strange cast of characters who are all banded together on a Halloweenish journey through a world of dreams and autumn tropes.

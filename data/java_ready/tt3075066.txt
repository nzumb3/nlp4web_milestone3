Renata dreams that she returned to Veracruz after traveling in the United States, where she went to work for many years. But, it seems as if he had not left, even her family have not realized that she has been absent. Perhaps, for that reason, she dreams about Natalia who has not left and she is waiting for her husband who left for the North. While Renata attempts at leaving again, for real, Natalia refuses the man that according to her daughters is her husband. The two women struggle against their own desires in an intermediary territory that is the border as the women live it in the context of the male migration to the other side.

Get a Life
###BREAK###
Two filmmakers discover an unknown, lethal disease, that hits children in the remote parts of Africa. In dusty villages in the outskirts of the Sahara desert, they find the victims of this horrible illness. The filmmakers now think that they will simply portray reality professionally, as they usually do. But instead, they are personally drawn to the struggle of saving the children. During the shooting they are forced to take a stand in crucial dilemmas: Third World poverty, exploitation of the weakest and most ill people in the developing countries, and the ultimate in life; Death. At the same time it is a film about the morale of filmmakers.

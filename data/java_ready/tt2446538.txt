Dear Fukushima
###BREAK###
Friday 11th March 2011. This was the day I began to look at the world, my life and values from a completely new perspective. What happened in Japan that day seemed incomprehensible but suddenly became so real. What does the future hold for the residents of Fukushima? Will they ever be able to return to life before the tragedy? Will they ever find their way out of this long dark tunnel? The largest nuclear disaster took place in Chernobyl in 1986. I traveled to Chernobyl to find the answers to my questions. I wanted to see for myself. Perhaps I would find a solution for Fukushima. It is impossible to turn back the clock and change the past. We have no other choice but to move forward.

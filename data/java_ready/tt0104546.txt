Jana und Jan
###BREAK###
Fall 1989: Jan is almost 16. Caught while trying to escape to West Germany, he is transferred from prison to a juvenile detention center. Here, he meets Jana ... and what starts as a bet, becomes true love. When Jana gets pregnant, the situation spirals out of control. In the summer of 1990, Jana and Jan flee into the unknown, insecure future of a new Germany. In this film, the director, internationally known for his critical films about children and young people, cast non-professional actors - some from juvenile detention centers - in the leading roles.

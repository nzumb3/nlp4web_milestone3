I Work
###BREAK###
I WORK is an existential comedy which follows a confused anarchist and his workaholic housemate, as they set out to find an estranged parent. But the two get more than they bargained for, when an accident along the way reveals wires beneath their skin. Dealing with the nature of existence, mortality, our reliance on, and the obsolescence of, technology, human connection, societies expectations, and of course what happens when a skinhead in his pants lunges with a knife at his best friend, who wears an eyepatch and rubber glove, protecting himself with a chair.

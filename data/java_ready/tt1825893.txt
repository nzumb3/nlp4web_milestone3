My Angel
###BREAK###
Brad Curtis (Tim Blore) is a husband and father who struggles with forgiveness, which creates a distance between him and his family. One night, after experiencing some car trouble, Brad loses consciousness near the road and awakens in a world where his wife and son do not exist. As Brad searches for the family that only he can remember, he encounters a mysterious young girl (Sarah Rogerson), a surprisingly unconventional preacher (Dave Johnson), and several other characters who help him discover a truth he had not previously contemplated: no one is beyond falling. In the end, Brad is able to return to his family with this new understanding.

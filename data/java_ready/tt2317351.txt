Waiting Without Her
###BREAK###
From first-time feature director Louis Sallerson comes this story of a college love triangle and a broken van. Michael is in love with Rachel who is still romantically attached to Eric. This is all well and good until the shuttle van carrying all three back to college breaks down, leaving them stranded in the middle of nowhere. The dynamics of the abusive relationship between Eric and Rachel are revealed, and Robert and Claudia, two other occupants of the van, watch in varying ways as this love triangle plays out in the field alongside the road. Made on a budget of less than $10,000 by students from the Five College Undergraduate System, Waiting Without Her is a low budget love triangle that you won't want to miss.

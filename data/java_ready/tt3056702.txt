Visions of Scotland
###BREAK###
Like others in the Visions series, this is filmed gorgeously, although the helicopter's shadow is intrusive in a couple of places, something that probably is difficult to avoid in some cases. Also, the zigzag sequencing of locations was a little disconcerting for the geographically inclined in my family. The music, a mix of traditional and modern, is good but not outstanding. Given the musical legacy of the Scots and modern Scots' importance to and influence on the UK (and therefore world) music industry, I had hoped for something a little more stirring and adventurous, but the score is pleasant, and this is an enjoyable travelogue. Scotland is beyond beautiful, and this DVD displays many of its fabulous lochs, Ben's (mountains), castles and cities very well.

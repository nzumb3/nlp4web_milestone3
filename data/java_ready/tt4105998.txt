The Harvest Run
###BREAK###
For three generations, the Beckley family of Colby, Kansas has made their living harvesting crops for farmers in the Great Plains region of the United States. Every spring, the Beckleys and their crew hit the road with a fleet of equipment, following the ripening crops from Texas all the way to the Canadian border, on the little-known Harvest Run, a demanding seven-month journey that is essential to producing America's annual yield of wheat and corn. This is the story of the Beckleys' struggle to hold onto their way of life while facing the seemingly insurmountable hardships of economics, Mother Nature, and the changing American work ethic.

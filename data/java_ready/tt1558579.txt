Notes from the New World
###BREAK###
"Notes From The New World" is a contemporary retelling of Dostoevsky's novella which unfolds in Los Angeles of 2011 where dreams and harsh realities collide. It is a place where almost everyone spies on everyone else, and everyone seems to be playing a dangerous game. Steven is torn between the loves of two women, each of them pretending to be somebody else. The danger only intensifies when Steven comes face to face with the Russian Mafia. Soon he will discover who he really is. On another level the story suggests an amazing reading of the state of the post modern/post communist world. Are we witnessing certain realization of Dostoevsky's prophecies - especially as far as the Underground Man's dilemma regarding Love/Terrorism is concerned?..

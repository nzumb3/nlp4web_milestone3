His parents are miffed with him and he doesn't even know to treat his sister properly. However, his life takes a turn when he sees Anu (jennifer) who is a rather serious girl. Much to Vicky's luck, the families go for a picnic and in between, both of them get lost in the forest of Bisile ghat. Together, they spend three days and it is here that both of them fall in love.

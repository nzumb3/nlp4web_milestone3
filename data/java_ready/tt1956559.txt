Making of a Dream
###BREAK###
How does a spiritual journey become a tangible reality? In "Making of a Dream" award-winning architect and humanitarian Nader Khalili powerfully answers his own question, "Is it really sane to follow one's own ideals and dreams and race alone in today's world?" To the audience who have come and gone in their thousands, gathering in the dreamy "Rumi Dome of Lights" he asks, "Is it really reasonable to insist on holdng to one's visions against all odds and after many trying years?" And after three decades of tirelessly swimming against the raging current, his answer is still a celebrated "yes". "My quests became more meaningful when my goals met with others' needs and goals", says Khalili as his words weave together visionary designs, the universal elements of earth, water, air and fire, timeless earth architecture, and the Persian mystic poet Rumi's stories that have guided him through his journey of quest to create a sustainable solution to human shelter. Turning the materials of war, sandbags and barbed wire, into the building blocks of peace, he developed "Superadobe" technology, to address the most pressing issues of our planet today such as global warming, deforestation, and the over one billion homeless and refugees, victims of natural disasters and war. The resulting beautiful, sustainable earth homes demonstrate that humanity can live in harmony with nature. Khalili's Superadobe and Ceramic Houses construction technologies have been published by NASA for futuristic lunar and Martian colonies, and awarded by the United Nations and the Aga Khan Award for Architecture for shelter for refuÂ­gees and homeless.

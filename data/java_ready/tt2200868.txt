Exorcist Diaries
###BREAK###
A hypnotist takes on a case of demonic possession, convinced that the victim's problems are all in the mind. As the case develops he finds it increasingly more difficult to hold onto his atheist and clinical perspective and begins a descent into a dark, dangerous and terrifying place. Exorcist Diaries is a film with real people: a real hypnotist, real exorcist, real demonologist and possibly a real demon or two.

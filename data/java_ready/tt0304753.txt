Still Looking for Morphine
###BREAK###
Ricky rides her motorcycle among real and imagined dangers, to arrive unscathed, but unalterably changed, at the end of summer. The unrelenting wind of the season disrupts a landscape of inaction, theft and drug use. The end of innocence has already begun and a new path, dark and hopeful, stands waiting like the ships beyond her window. It will be an act of violence that thrusts the girl into womanhood and leads her to a new life where, not without pain, everything is possible.

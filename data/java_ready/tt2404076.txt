All She Wrote Anthology
###BREAK###
All She Wrote is a story of a group of talented, passionate and brave women who stand up for what they believe in and make their voices heard though the art of graffiti. Thriving in what's long been a male-dominated subculture of the art world, these exceptional women are strong, spirited and proud, and they refuse to be silent. Contrasting the stark differences between life in western and eastern societies, the director follows these women in their native environment as they continue to make their mark - on walls, in alleyways, on trains, and wherever their message can be seen. Whether political or social, all of them contribute to the ongoing fight for women's rights, while trying to affect change in their communities through a shared passion and medium: graffiti.

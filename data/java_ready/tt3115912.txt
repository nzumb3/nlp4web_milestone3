The Road Ahead of U.S.
###BREAK###
Never really having gone far from home before, a senior in college realizes the uncertainty of the life ahead of him and builds up the courage to embark on a cross-country road trip to find answers to his questions of life and 'The American Dream.' Recruiting five of his closest friends, they set out on a road trip of epic proportions: New York to California, following the southern route. Hitting New York, Washington D.C., North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada & California, it is a snapshot of America as a whole, and a glimpse into the lives of people all across the country who you would never ordinarily get to meet. A learning experience, and an experience of a lifetime, that will show how much you can really change your life in 16 days... by just getting in your car and driving.

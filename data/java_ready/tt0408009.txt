Friday night in Rome: a group of thirty-five old friends decides to try and renew a kinda private ceremony of the good ole days: what they call "bastard night" - wandering all night long in pubs, parties and friend's houses, tuxedo dressed, doing nothing but smoking, drinking and talking until they have no more energy to go on. Together with them, two girls: the italian Cate, the girlfirend of the most radical and fool of the group Marcello, and the spanish Carmen, whom they met that night. But time has passed, and the "bastard night" reveals to be but an inachievable desire of the past. One of them, Alex, renounces to go. As a matter of fact, even if all of the others pretend to be still young and foolish, each one of them has tried to make a living, and bears with him failures and traces of aborted adult lives ready to spoil their night: a violent ex wife and a daughter to take care, a pregnant girlfriend... on their way, the group of friends will meet a lot of weird night creatures, such as a sad jazz singer with his mother in jail, a japanese award-winner writer, two sons of the same father unknown to each other looking for the man through the night while he's been robbed at the airport, and an odd, jealous friend of the spanish girl, "El Fantasma"... then comes another day.

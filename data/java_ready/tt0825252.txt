###BREAK###
After severing contact for three years with old friends, his girlfriend Grace, and the last remaining member of his family (his father), an unsettled drifting musician named Stephen Williams returns home to search for the missing pieces in his life. In his uncertainty and his longing for real connection, he begins to stir up emotions in himself and others by acting on conflicted and dangerous impulses. Laced with humor, universal conflicts, desires and struggles of the heart, we witness the changes in the lives touched by the central character as he follows through with his choices and actions. It is a moving story that addresses our inability to truly grow and make healthy choices in life when we suppress our core feelings.

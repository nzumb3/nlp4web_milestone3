Refrigerantes e Canções de Amor
###BREAK###
Lucas Mateus wanted to be a rock star, but things never quite worked out that way. Instead, he makes his living as a jingle composer for commercials. Until the day he finds his girlfriend in bed with former best friend and band colleague Pedro, a successful musician. Abandoned and out of work - his jingles have become sad love songs and scare away the customers - Lucas will find refuge in a supermarket where, amongst all the products he has written songs for over the years, he will find a new best friend and a new love interest - hidden inside a dinosaur costume.

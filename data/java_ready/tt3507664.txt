Sea of Change
###BREAK###
Led by a 24 year old paralyzed woman, Cody Unser, nine veterans living in wheelchairs themselves are finally released from their chairs with no worry of high curbs or large steps. This is a story of freedom through weightless movement and of self-renewal. It is based on an experience the veterans never believed they could have, on a reef 60 feet below the surface of the sea. In the process, this amazing experiment, chronicled by Johns Hopkins doctors and narrated by Montel Williams, may change the lives of anyone with paralysis.

What is a bad person? Why is there no one else who sees all wrong in the society? Why does it feel as I do not live? Why am I only CP when I talk and not when I think? Why is it always me who has to console and never be consoled? Why can she not love me? The six characters are fighting with all their inner demons in a Stockholm where time just flows by. Who has the strength to change and who will always remain in their own bubble of self-denial?

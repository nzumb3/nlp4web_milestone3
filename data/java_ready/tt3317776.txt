Elbow Grease
###BREAK###
Elbow Grease is a sincere look into the humor and craziness that is the everyday life of the Barnes family as they come to terms with each other. Billy and Ellie's marriage may be on the rocks, but they don't know chaos until Billy's wayward brother arrives and spreads it not only through the family but to the neighbors and the entire town of Guppie, South Carolina as it prepares for its annual festival.

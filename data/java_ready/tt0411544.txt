Just Indian
###BREAK###
Just Indian unearths the class of values, the differences, and the internal conflict experienced by Indian Americans. The film brings Indian Americans from all walks of life to a commonly felt experience. The movie sheds light upon a new kind of classism, which is not based on financial status, race, gender or religion, but the date of entry into the freedom land USA.

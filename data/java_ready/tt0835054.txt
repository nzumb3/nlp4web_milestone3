The documentary film The Silent Death aims to discuss and display European policies regarding prisons. Through the different interviews made with political detainees and former prisoners in Germany, Italy, Spain, North Ireland and the USA and with their families, we will try to show that the European prison system and the isolation cell system all around the world, is not the ideal system as propagated by the Turkish authorities.

Thirteen Percent
###BREAK###
Thirteen Percent takes a probing look at how and why 13 percent of the population (African-Americans) now accounts for 50 percent of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. It tells the stories of individuals representing the hardest-hit segments - men who have sex with men, women aged 25-44 and youth - and shares the perspective of the experts on the driving factors behind the epidemic. Sharing their hard-won lessons are politicians, physicians, academicians, clergy, journalists and, of course, individuals living with the infection. In the spotlight is a continuing culture of stigma and silence - exacerbated by a new complacency as AIDS becomes a chronic disease instead of a death sentence. It concludes with thoughts about how to change the trajectory of this disease, starting with each individual.

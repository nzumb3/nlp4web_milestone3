The Phantom Tollbooth: Beyond Expectations
###BREAK###
The Phantom Tollbooth at 50: Beyond Expectations, playfully explores the creation, creators, lasting impact and enduring relevance of one of the most beloved children's books of our time. Through interviews, animation, and archival imagery, the documentary traces the friendship between author Norton Juster and Pulitzer Prize winning artist, Jules Feiffer, and the wit and wisdom of the novel, over half a century. Norton calls himself an accidental writer who never set out to write a children's book. Jules had his sights set on overthrowing the government through his cartoon strip at The Village Voice. In 1961, these two young artists came together in a rundown duplex in Brooklyn Heights to create the classic that has been called the Alice in Wonderland of our time.

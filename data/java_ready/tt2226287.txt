Anak-Anak Srikandi
###BREAK###
CHILDREN OF SRIKANDI is the first film about queer women in Indonesia, the country with the world's largest Muslim population. Eight authentic and poetic stories are interwoven with beautiful shadow theater scenes that tell the story of Srikandi, one of the characters of the Indian Mahabharata. This collective anthology transcends the borders between documentary, fiction and experimental film.

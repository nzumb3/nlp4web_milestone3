Little by Little
###BREAK###
Kicked out of a family at 12, Eliza was left with little choice. Living on the streets and trading her body for protection, Pili had little options. Shuffled from house to house at three, Zai was too little to have a say in her fate. But there's a Tanzanian saying. Little by little; a little becomes a lot. Little by little, these girls find family, hope, and a future. But is it enough to heal their battered pasts? Is there room for another girl, abandoned and neglected? And can she survive long enough to join them?

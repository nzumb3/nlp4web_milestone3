Whatever Happened to Zulay?
###BREAK###
Sharon Sherman's ethnobiographical film documents Zulay Sarabino, an indigenous Ecuadoran woman who negotiates multiple identities in a globalized world as a cultural leader, single mother, and local entrepreneur. Embodying both the new and the old, the communal and the transnational, Zulay's remarkable story is one of adaptation, acculturation, struggle, and personal transformation. Against the exquisite backdrop of the Andes, this film interweaves the celebration of the fiesta of Inti Raymi with dramatic dialogue from Zulay and her adult daughter, Paola. Paola also confronts similar issues for her and her generation. Whatever Happened to Zulay? explores the interrelationship between tradition and innovation and will appeal to those interested in cultural change, folklore, ethnicity, gender, Latin American communities, oral history, and religion.

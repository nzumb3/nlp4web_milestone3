On the Road with the 2010 Phantom Regiment
###BREAK###
Over the previous five years, Phantom Regiment has excelled at bringing the stories of characters-be they human, animal, or the stuff of legend-to life on the field. In contrast, "Into the Light" doesn't follow a narrative; instead, the show expresses the life cycle with all its ups and downs. Numerous episodes are inspired by Michael Kamen's symphonic tone poem, "The New Moon in the Old Moon's Arms," which the composer has described as "a glimpse of the future in the light of the past." An "Awakening," like the simple beauty of the opening of a flower, sets the soul on its life-long voyage, though parts of the "Journey" of adolescence leads to some challenging moments. Later comes perspective through "Reflection," as we take stock of the voyage thus far. In adulthood, major traumas and difficulties create some serious "Conflict," but this is followed by a final "Discovery." Finally, it's time to walk "Into the Light" to experience the glorious beauty of a life well lived. Shot entirely in HD, this dual-layer DVD follows the 150 members and staff every step of the way. From the first step at auditions to the final step off in Lucas Oil Stadium, you'll have unprecedented access to one of the World's most beloved Drum Corps. This is our 2010 story.

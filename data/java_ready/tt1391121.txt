Small Talk
###BREAK###
Small Talk takes a look at post college annui and the choices that have to be made in order to move on with life. George, Dana, Shak, Erin, and Jess find themselves stuck in a kind of arrested development. They hate their jobs, their prospects, and their lives. The only real joy that anyone has is the friendships that they've sustained through the years; but even those must be looked at carefully if any of this group is to move on to the next stage of life.

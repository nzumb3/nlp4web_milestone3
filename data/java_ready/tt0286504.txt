Beti No. 1
###BREAK###
Durga Devi has three sons, Ram, Laxman and Bharat. She wants a heir to carry the family name forward. Ram and Laxman are married and have so far only produced girls, much to their mother's disgust. So when Bharat marries Priya, she is expecting them to have a son. But Priya delivers a baby girl. Anticipating the mother's anger, they hide the gender of the child initially, and subsequently; switch their child with another male child, thus giving rise to more conflicts.

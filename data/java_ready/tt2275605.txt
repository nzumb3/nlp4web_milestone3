Contatto
###BREAK###
Probably failing to convince, doctors told Felice Tagliaferri that he had lost his sight at the age of 13 without realizing it. After success as a Judoka he undertook a lucky career as sculptor. In 2000, his mentor Nicola Zamboni accepted him as an apprentice and after few years, Felice started exhibiting his work throughout Italy. In this film, Felice Tagliaferri illustrates his life as a sculptor and his more recent teaching activity to persons with disabilities. Contatto is a story of resilience and perseverance in its most simple and effective form.

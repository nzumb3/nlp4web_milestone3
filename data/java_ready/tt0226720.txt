Un banco en el parque
###BREAK###
Juan and Teresa have been lovers for two years. The day before she leaves to live in London, he abandons the apartment they were sharing. Juan embarks on a series of encounters with other women. He only allows himself to meet them by chance. Every afternoon at the same time, he sits on the same bench in a park, and then he also sits at the same table in the same bar. Shortly thereafter, using these methods, he meets both Alicia and Ana.

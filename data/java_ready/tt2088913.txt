Terrados
###BREAK###
During the severe economic crisis plaguing Spain during 2010, Leo and his friends enjoy a conveniently secure situation living on unemployment subsidy. In their thirties and unmotivated by the working environment, they spend their days visiting different rooftops around the city chosen at random to spend hours doing nothing. In the midst of this stream of passivity and evasion, Leo discovers that perhaps he had never before stopped to think what he really wants. The relationships with his girlfriend Ana and best friend Mario mark the beat of Leo's evolution to a point where he will have to decide whether to continue his same old life, or conversely, follow his instincts and take his own initiative.

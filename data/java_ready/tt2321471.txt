I Wake Up Yesterday
###BREAK###
This quirky student comedy tells the story of Petr Kovár (Filip Blazek), who gets the chance to return to the past for a while and he meets the love of his life, his classmate Eliska, again in June 1989. There is one hook: physically he is seventeen again (played by Jirí Mádl), but his mind remains that of a modern "forty-something". He returns to a different reality, forgetting that he will be tested again and how the school system was different back then. Thus the plot throws him several comical and provocative twists and through a surprising romantic entanglement it lets the audience see and recall the absurdity of the pre-revolution era.

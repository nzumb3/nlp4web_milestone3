The Lambirds
###BREAK###
In January 2015 sixty-eight young students from both Nepal and India borrowed money from banks and loan sharks and bid their families farewell in hopes of finding a better future in North America. 'Lambirds Academy' offered them 8 months of education as well a secured job and a visa in exchange for $10,000. Upon the completion of their degree in St. Lucia, an island in the Caribbean, they were promised a job on board a cruise ship, as well as the opportunity to further their education in a 'sister school' in California. When the students arrived on February 2015 to St. Lucia, a paradise for honeymooners, they found what 'Lambirds Academy' was. Nothing but an empty room above a grocery store; no teachers, no classes. With no money, no job, no home and their passports confiscated, the students were left stranded on the island. For a year, they have tried to face the ones who scammed them in court to attempt to recuperate what was taken from them. This is a journey in every sense of the word. A quest to get back what was taken from them.

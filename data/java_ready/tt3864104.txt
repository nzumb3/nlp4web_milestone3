Ich Hunger
###BREAK###
Ich Hunger is an expressionistic German art film about a 'creature boy' who terrorizes a small farming township. Frankfurt Inspector Stephen Heckle has been tracking this elusive creature for years, but when It becomes apparent that the creature has ended his constant migration and settled in Frondenberg, Stephen must leave the bustling city and confront him face to face in the deepest darkest reaches of the forest. Part Gothic horror and part psychedelic dream-scape; Ich Hunger is a feast for the senses.

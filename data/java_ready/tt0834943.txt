Victoria is a Southern girl who runs from an abusive home in a small North Carolina town to follow her dreams in New York City. As a little girl, she dreamed of becoming a famous dancer. Instead, she ends up in a cruel relationship mixed with drugs, abuse and humiliation in the crumbling New York society. While her personal life is going downhill, pressure of her surrounding is becoming oppressing and damaging. When sober, she suffers major bouts of depression. She chooses writing as part of her therapy and escapes the real world as Alice in Wonderland. Her imaginary life begins at her computer, but slowly becomes an obsession and loses all distinction from reality. In her fantasy world, her Alter Ego Jana, is as she once envisioned her life to be. Her real life abusive boyfriend, Taylor, becomes the perfect guy, Travis, and everything conforms to her fantastic ideal. But as the pressure of her life increases, her sensibility and confusion of this world progresses. She starts mentally deteriorating and becomes emotionally numb, even loses interest in her own writing. Then she chooses to escape it all. Her writing turns morbid and becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy of her actual life.

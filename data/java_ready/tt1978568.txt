The Stopwatch Gang
###BREAK###
The FBI coined the name, "The StopWatch Gang," for the stopwatch worn during their bank robberies ranging from California to Florida. Using outrageous disguises such as wigs, sunglasses and presidents' masks, the StopWatch Gang never took longer than 90 to 120 seconds to clean out a bank vault. Yet Lionel Wright, Stephen Reid and Paddy Mitchell never fired a shot or harmed a single bank patron or employee. Renown as the most successful bank robbers in North American history, the FBI hunted them for years without finding a solid lead. Living a double life in Oak Creek Canyon in Sedona, Arizona, their neighbors were just as clueless--believing them to be successful rock concert promoters. In this documentary, hear first-hand about the StopWatch Gang from an FBI agent who hunted them and Sedona neighbors who still recall them with great fondness and affection.

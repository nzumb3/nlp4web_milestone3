Aluku liba
###BREAK###
Loeti is a drifter who has spent years away from his village in French Guiana, working in extreme conditions. When the army cracks down on illegal gold mining in the Amazon forest, he is forced to flee from one of the sites, and must use the skills he learned as a child to survive in the forest. His only hope is to find his way home and be reunited with his people, the Aluku/Bonis, for he longs to reclaim his Maroon past and culture. Upon his return, he is thrown into an intense reunion with his past and what is left of his ancestors' African customs and traditions. Loeti finds a changing world where old traditions and values are both challenged and influenced by the modern world.

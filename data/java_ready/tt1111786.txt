Dribbles
###BREAK###
In this "surprisingly moving piece about teen life" (HBO Screenplay Coverage), talented high school artist David McNeil is desperate to prove himself to his runaway father by winning a state championship basketball jacket. Grueling tryouts, family conflict, and strained friendships are merely the underpainting for David's greatest challenge as he suddenly finds himself in the role of friend and protector of Dribbles - a mentally challenged old janitor and the basketball team's unofficial mascot. With self-confident new girl at school, Mary, as his guiding spirit and artistic muse, David may just find there are more important measures of a man's worth than trophies. This "beautifully written, heart warming, and quite charming" (Republic Pictures Screenplay Coverage) story is one to experience again and again.

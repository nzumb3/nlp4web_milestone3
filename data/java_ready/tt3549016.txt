Send in the Clowns
###BREAK###
Send in the Clowns is a documentary about performers from the organization Clowns without Borders, whose mission is to use the power of laughter to relieve stress and suffering in areas of crisis. The film captures their work in Haiti, following them both before and after the earthquake and explores the conflict between the humanitarian aid world's agenda and the actual needs on the ground.

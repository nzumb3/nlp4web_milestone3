Stealing Summers
###BREAK###
Two twenty-something expatriates spending an indolent summer in Buenos Aires meet a beautiful American girl who reveals a stash of illicit money hidden at her Argentine boyfriend's apartment. Dreaming of freedom and never having to return home, the three plot to steal the cash during the weekend of the Superclasico, the epic football derby between bitter rivals Boca and River. One needs the money. One wants the money. Both love the girl. But what starts as a kind of game quickly turns violent, and as passions erupt, the three Americans find themselves on the verge of consequences none of them ever expected.

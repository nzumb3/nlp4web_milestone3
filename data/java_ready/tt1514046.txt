Hope
###BREAK###
Leon Zend lives precariously perched between two worlds.  Life for him is an uneasy mix of the real and imagined, the ridiculous and sublime.  The convoluted and mysterious path he walks ultimately leads to where the shadows gather.  Then, like King Hezekiah of old, he is granted a speck of precious time to discover the illusive reality he has sought all along.   In 2010 laughter, suspense, friendship, and grace will all blend together into a unique screen experience simply called HOPE.

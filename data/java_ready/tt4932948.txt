Circus IMAGO One Chance in a Million
###BREAK###
We are in a dreamworld with two Circus-camps IMAGO, where everything is possible and dreams can come true. The world is much darker at OBSTINATE, ruled by the mean and pompous MACHIAVELLI. A crowded summer-festival full of artists and jesters. Machiavelli humiliates his best artist Dag. Anna from Circus Imago saves Dag that flees to Imago. From now on Machiavelli only tries to get his artist back. At Circus Imago everything is in chaos with the broken Director all alone. Will they manage to make a new show and will the wannabee Morgan add something? While Machiavelli stops at nothing to harm Imago and get Dag back.

Audrey of the Alps
###BREAK###
Twenty-something Audrey isn't entirely sure what she wants to do with her life. Other young women in her position would most likely backpack or volunteer, but Audrey decides to sign on as a shepherd for the season. In the high pastures of the French Alps, Audrey and her boyfriend take on the daunting task of marshalling 1700 recalcitrant sheep, a handful of goats and six dogs. Often at odds with her pragmatic employers, Audrey struggles to learn shepherding ways, until she finally discovers her inner strength.

Pete is engaged to be married, so he should be completely happy. Yet, that is very far from the truth. Pete is absolutely miserable and he doesn't know why. His apprehensive feelings suddenly reach a new high when he discovers that his old high school crush, the one that got away, is now acting in the adult entertainment industry. Pete is suddenly struck with an insatiable desire to find his long lost love and free her from the negative and destructive lifestyle she has found herself consumed within. Should Pete go after the girl of his dreams or stick with the girl he has promised to marry? It is not an easy decision to make, but one that Pete is forced to resolve.

Visions of Violence
###BREAK###
'Visions of Violence' is at once a fascinating time capsule of life in the 1990's as well the ultimate video diary. Tracing a period from 1992-98, we get an insight into what being a teen/early 20-something was really like. In a non-traditional, experimental way, the vignettes unspool to form the narrative as a cohesive whole. And that whole makes up the world which was one filled with hanging out, vandalism, working (if you'd call it that), getting arrested, a riot, girls, and much more. We're seeing reality from a whole new perspective.

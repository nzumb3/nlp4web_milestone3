Paradox
###BREAK###
After his wife is killed in a hit-and-run accident by a mysterious Hooded Man, DYLAN BRANDT, a Theoretical Physicist, builds a Quantum Suicide Machine to jump through parallel universes to find another version of his wife. Based on the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, where a man storms of the Gates of Hades to return his wife to the land of the living, Dylan transverses infinite worlds of the Multi-verse to find his wife. But with every jump, Dylan is thwarted by the efforts of the mysterious Hooded Man. Ignoring the warnings of his mentor, DR. YAMAMOTO, Dylan recklessly jumps into ever more flawed universes, until the rules of physics completely break down, threatening to destroy the universe and everything in it.

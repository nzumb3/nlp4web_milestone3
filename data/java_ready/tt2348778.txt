'A man is immortal as long as he lives in the memory of others,' said the world-renowned Czech author with a wry smile. When her father turned 80, his daughter who is the filmmaker, began to see just how closely his words applied to him personally. Employing his notorious sense of humor and accompanied by friends including the Czech dissident ex-president and most creative of the Czech film directors, she presents an artist and holocaust survivor with immense talent, luck and eternal love for life speaking to her about what matters in times of war and peace. The documentary is an unconventional, lively movie.

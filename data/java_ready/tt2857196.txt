Tell 'Em Steve-Dave Puppet Theatre
###BREAK###
Bryan, Walt, and Quinn are the hosts of a podcast called "Tell 'Em Steve-Dave", airing from Jay and Silent Bob's Secret Stash in Red Bank, NJ. Each week they travel to the store to discuss their worldviews, life stories, and radical notions. First traveling to a local flea market to discover the secret to success, the trio travels over a landscape littered with hot-button topics, seeking to get to the bottom of post office dis-customer service, the Grandfather paradox and time travel, as well as divulging their innermost secrets on a created gameshow.

American Cannibal

A brutal Survivor-style reality show produced by the publicity-obsessed promoter of the Paris Hilton sex tape was shut down suddenly in September 2005 when a contestant was critically injured. Closely following the train-wreck production and the industry that spawned it, this film documents the human cost of popular entertainment.

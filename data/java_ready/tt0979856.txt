Big Fellas
###BREAK###
Two young white wannabees, JAKE and ZED, set out on a road trip from Cape Town to Johannesburg to close a deal to sell their film. One problem - they need a BEE partner, and they need one fast. On the trip the boys are stalked by their nemesis RAY WHITEHEAD, his femme fatale girlfriend LOLA, a Karoo serial killer, supermodels, shop window mannequins, and a psychotic Gatberg darts champion.

The Man-Hunt
###BREAK###
This new tale of suspense continues following Peter Heading, the cop from "The Kidnapping" who swore to take down The Hit Man. In the final of three films by writer/director Ryan Konig, it has been three months since Officer Peter Heading watched The Hit Man drive away after escaping capture. The Hit Man, played now for the third time by Andrew Lembeck-Edens, has been staying off the grid with the hope that Officer Heading might give up the man-hunt. Unfortunately for The Hit Man, Heading is stubborn, and will go to any lengths to track him down. Still, as much as The Hit Man wants to stop hiding, he hasn't quite shaken the rush of facing off against Heading, one of the few adversaries who's given him a run for his money. Knowing he won the first round, The Hit Man stalks Heading in a sick hope that one day Heading WILL find him, and they can go for round two. But as Heading and The Hit Man trade blows once again, their lives may not be the only ones at risk.

Moving Home
###BREAK###
Told through archival footage and interviews of her students, MOVING HOME is an enigmatic portrait of Korean dancer and teacher Halla Pai Huhm, for whom dance became the vehicle in which to traverse turbulent historical tides between Korea, Japan, and Hawaii throughout the 20th century. A pioneer who gave voice to the Korean experience against the backdrop of colonialism, immigration, and modernization, the film weaves through the entanglements of identity and loss that brings to light notions of belonging, search for self, and the courage of the artistic spirit. A poignant and imaginative lens into the diasporic experience, MOVING HOME provokes us to reflect on own connections of home and how it moves throughout generations and beyond geographic boundaries.

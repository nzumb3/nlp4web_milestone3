Two Journeys
###BREAK###
Directed by David Jasse, DMJ produced 'Two Journeys', a stunning short documentary for Chailifeline on Pediatric cancer. This highly emotional short film includes segments captured by the children themselves who were given handy-cams to document their arduous journey. The highlight of the films is the children's outrageous camp experiences in Camp Simcha-Camp Happiness. The camp features state of the art medical care, and an outrageous and dedicated volunteer and paid staff. The mini documentary featured two families, one from Maryland and the other in Philadelphia. Contains intense subject matter.

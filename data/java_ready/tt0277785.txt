Ten-year-old Fanynka is the star of the local gymnastics team. She lets her fellow pupils know that she is the best and they play her at her own game. She has a complicated relationship with her mother and lives alone with her father. Her mother left them some time ago, remarried and is now pregnant. Fanynka finds this hard to accept and as a result is unable to concentrate on gymnastics. A serious injury from a fall shifts her out of the limelight and leaves her in a wheelchair. She grapples with the consequences of her injury but, above all, tries to gain the trust of people who are close to her.

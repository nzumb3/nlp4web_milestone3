Father, Daughter, Mother Road
###BREAK###
A father, pushing 60, and his 30 year old daughter, a clinically depressed aspiring filmmaker, travel Route 66 in hopes of making a documentary about the famed road. Interviews and footage about the road intertwine with the increasingly personal story of the daughter's struggle and filmmaking's role in the healing process, the father's apprehensiveness to turning 60, and the trip's therapeutic nature for both of them. Father and daughter bond and make fond, even humorous memories as they draw nearer to the finish line in Santa Monica, CA, which happens to be where the daughter lived and ultimately left at the height of her depression.

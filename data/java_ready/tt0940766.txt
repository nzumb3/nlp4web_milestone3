The Blue Hills
###BREAK###
It is 1944. The Red Army that moves nearly a thousand kilometres towards the west elsewhere in Europe cannot conquer three heights of land near the eastern border of Estonia - the Blue Hills. Concentrating on the destiny of Paul Maitla, a hero of these defence battles, the film tells a story of the young men who had to make their choice at this complicated time in between two totalitarian powers.

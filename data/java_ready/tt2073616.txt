More Than Frybread
###BREAK###
Mockumentary on the first annual World Wide Frybread Association's Arizona State Chapter Championship, a two day event in Flagstaff. The event is receiving extensive media coverage as Arizona News Network's own native American reporter Tracey Lightning will be on location reporting. It, which will have extremely strict regulations, will consist of four preliminary rounds on the first day, with the four winners moving onto the final round the second day. Frybread is a staple of indigenous cuisines, including native American cuisines. The winner will receive not only bragging rights as to making the best frybread in the state, but will receive $10,000 and will represent the Chapter at the national championship in New York City. There are twenty-two contestants, one representing each of the federally recognized tribal reserves or nations in Arizona. The types of frybread are as diverse as the Arizona contestants in this inaugural year. That disparate group of contestants includes: Buddy Begay, the only male contestant, who aspires to a native American infused hip-hop lifestyle in every aspect, including the fan worship; Betti Muchvo, to who beauty is everything as witnessed by her beauty pageant past, and making her garden look even more beautiful by spray painting her flowers; mild mannered Sammy Powsky who is always at a loss for words; Sharmayne Cruz, who, in her own mind, does everything better than anyone else, everyone else being idiots; and Sunshine Smith, the twelve minute older twin sister of Stormy Smith, the two who have a loving relationship with just a little hate bubbling under the surface. What happens at the Championship is driven primarily by passion, by the organizers, the judges, the fans and the contestants, that exuberance which leads to interesting results.

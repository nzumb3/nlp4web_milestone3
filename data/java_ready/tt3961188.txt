Born Warriors
###BREAK###
Born Warriors is a documentary that focuses on the ancient fighting sport of Lethwei. Burmese Lethwei is one of the oldest practiced combat sports in Myanmar(aka Burma). The Burmese are the last of the great bare-knuckle fighters in Southeast Asia. The bare-knuckle matches often served as a rite of passage into manhood for young boys in rural villages. Martial tradition was an important component of the spiritual and physical growth of each young man and during the lively festivals he could demonstrate his fighting prowess. This rare documentary told in two separate and distinct parts was shot entirely in Myanmar over an extensive fourteen-year period.

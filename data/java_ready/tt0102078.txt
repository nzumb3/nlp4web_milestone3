The film, to a certain extent, talks about the damage urbanization in Hong Kong, and the casualties it inflict. Bo is the owner of an old building in Hong Kong. He sublets his building to other people, and even though they never pay rent on time, Bo still treats them like they are family. One day, Bo discovered an unconscious man who was left for dead on a street corner, and decides to take him to his place to treat his wounds. It is later discovered that the man is Lam Feng, the son of a rich property developer. Feng's relations with his father was never good, and Feng's belief that his father indirectly caused his mother's death in a fire did not help either. During his stay at Bo's place, Feng learned about hospitality and human kindness, but things are about to unravel. Feng's father had his sight set on Bo's building, and ordered his staff to do whatever it takes to force Bo to sell his property, even if it means involving the Triads. Bo refused all offers, and the Triads eventually set fire to Bo's house. The movie also included other subplots, such as Bo's uncle, along with his acrobatic and culinary prowess.

More Than a Month
###BREAK###
An African-American filmmaker attempts to end Black History month with the argument that black history should not be contained within one month. He conducts innumerable interviews, conducts an experiment, and throughout the film ponders the question. At the end of the journey, he realizes that the question is really a part of a broader discussion about the empowerment of a people through education.

Stand By
###BREAK###
Mumbai-based impoverished Rahul Narvekar, the son of widower bank employee, Damodar, and Shekhar Verma, the son of wealthy industrialist Jaiprakash, are two football players who are also close friends. They participate in a match against Goa and win - but the media finds fault with Shekhar and praises Rahul. The team then goes on to win another match against West Bengal and bring home the much coveted Santosh Trophy. Both friends hope to be selected for the National Team but only Rahul gets picked while Shekhar gets to be the 'stand by'. Rahul and Damodar will find both their lives and respective careers endangered as Jaiprakash uses his wealth and influence to ensure that his son gets a place in the team - by hook or by crook.

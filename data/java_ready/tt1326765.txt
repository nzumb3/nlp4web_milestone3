Eddie Macken: True Legend
###BREAK###
Eddie Macken is the greatest rider ever in the sport of equestrian show jumping. His career spans four decades, and hundreds of world class championships, earning him the respect and admiration of riders at all levels, from amateurs to top-ranked professionals. Requested by the riders themselves of Ireland's National Team, a special position of Team Trainer was created for Eddie, along side the committee chosen coach for the Samsung Super League, the sport's premiere competition which tours eight European countries each year. His popular but unconventional approach, created a clash with current management which threatened the team itself. Now, Eddie's greatest challenge is to guide the struggling team to victory in Ireland's famed Aga Khan Cup, or they face being eliminated from the league.

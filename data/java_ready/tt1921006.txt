Luther's Magic Weed
###BREAK###
Craig, acid-dealing punk and aspiring chemist, pours a batch of failed speed on his brother Brock's marijuana, creating a drug that induces orgiastic funk parties. This makes Craig popular at school and allows Brock to exact revenge upon his emasculating ex-girlfriend, but it also damages Craig's budding relationship with a girl he may really like. Luther, a homicidal 70s-style drug kingpin, wants the formula, and comes to get it at GrooveTaco, the play-within-the-movie, an homage to lesbian assassin hookers written by Craig's psuedo-freudian drama teacher.

Alabama Sasquatch
###BREAK###
When local badass Jebediah "Junebug" Jefferson's stash of the legendary "Alabama Sasquatch Skunk Ape Special" is stolen all hell breaks loose in Grass County. Junebug reunites with old war buddies: the always intoxicated ex-talk show host, Jimby Bumgardner, and illegal gunrunner and weopons specialist, Bertram Doonsberry Bundick, known by the locals as "Old Man Bundick". Also along for the ride are Jimby's illegitimate Asian son, Junior, and master tracker and kung-fu expert, Bumper Hardwood. But when Nazis, sasquatches and a family of psychotic cannibal hillbillies threaten to ruin the reunion, or more importantly smoke Junebug's SHIT, it's time for a final showdown in Grass County.

Everyone has had a two dollar bill before, right? Most people believe they're out of print, good or bad luck, or a rare commodity. But in this comprehensive documentary, all aspects of the "deuce" are explored - from its history to the superstitions surrounding it; from its use by special interest groups to the way it's perceived by consumers and vendors.

In Search of the Sublime
###BREAK###
What is the sublime. When we witness something that instills fascination mixed with fear, or if we stand in the presence of something far larger than ourselves, according to Edmund Burke (1729-1797). So a father and his two sons went walking in the Yorkshire Dales. In the footsteps of Joseph Mallord William Turner, the nineteenth century landscape painter. In search of the sublime. They have seen death. They have admired life. And they have done stupid things. A short story about walking. And about how walking mirrors life.

To Topple an Empire
###BREAK###
To Topple An Empire is the story of Aidan Clarke (Sean Patrick Flaherty) as he is brought in front of crime boss, Vincent Donnelly (Art Lynch). Through a series of flashbacks, Aidan tells Vincent how he alone has taken out key members of his organized crime family. But as the story goes deeper, the lies that litter Aidan's storytelling become apparent to the ruthless mob boss and that he clearly did not do it alone.

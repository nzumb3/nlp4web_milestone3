###BREAK###
Urban Comedy takes us on a wild ride through the day-in-the-hood madcap adventures of Tidey Whitey Cleaner clerk Kyle Freeman and his co-worker and best friend William "Clem" Clemons. Kyle is late to work. As usual. And almost gets fired. Again. And so the day begins. What follows is classic "round-the-way" hijinks-baby-mama-drama, beatdowns, con games, rejection, schoolings, lies, science and fiction, paybacks, trouble. cappin', reunions, clownin' and a whole lot of madness goin' on. Will Kyle win back the affections of the beautiful Rachel? Will Clem's "speech" stand in the way of his chance with his dream girl? Will this crazy day turn into a "cool ass one" after all? Only one way to find out-check out "So Fresh, So Clean"... a down and dirty comedy.

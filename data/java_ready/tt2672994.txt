Me and My Bud
###BREAK###
Two carefree and bumbling maintenance men of a low-budget motel, share in adventures and misadventures as they strive to achieve their seemingly unattainable goals. Ted is an aspiring writer, while Danny is an aspiring-to-be anything better than what he presently is. Though is seems the whole world is against them, they bond together with the help of commonly unacceptable practices of self-medication, with result being a strong yet extremely humorous relationship. As comrades-in-arms they embark on a comical quest of improper behavior and situations to worsening behavior and situations. In the end they realize their goals may be as close as their reflection in the mirror.

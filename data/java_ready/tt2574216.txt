Sympathy Pains
###BREAK###
When Danny and Stephanie find out they're pregnant (surprise!), Danny can't stop his own morning sickness. Every mention of the baby sends him running for a bathroom, except when he's on stage. Even though he's the worst comedian in the room, no matter the room, Danny lives to be on the stage. Stephanie doesn't put up with much, but she puts up with Danny. She actually thinks he's funny, despite all evidence to the contrary. They were the perfect couple, before his "condition". Danny's symptoms only get worse until the impossible occurs: he starts getting laughs. Danny's career takes off just as Stephanie needs him the most. That can't go well. Fighting a battle between his family and his dream job, Danny chooses both and succeeds at neither. Is it possible for a good stand-up comic to be a good dad?

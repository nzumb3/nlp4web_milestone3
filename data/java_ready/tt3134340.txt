Prohibition does not work. This is a story of one citizen marked guilty by the Military Industrial Complex. We find that if punishment is built into the process of proving your innocence, the there is no due process. Are we so bored now that we don't have a war, that we are willing to turn the war against our own citizens? Joshua Braun opened the Horta Pharm marijuana clinic in May 2005 and despite continued promises by the Obama administration and local law enforcement, it was. subsequently raided on June 11, 2010. Joshua's life was systematically destroyed through the process of proving his innocence. His pregnant wife was held on $1,000,000 bail. And to allow her to give birth in peace and not in jail, Joshua plead guilty to one out of the 46 felonies put against him. Once a proud Marine and loved caregiver, now he is marked with the scarlet letter of our justice system.

The Medicine Game
###BREAK###
Tucked away in central New York State is the Onondaga Nation, a sovereign Native American community known to produce some of the top lacrosse players in the world. Yet, the fear of leaving their community, substance abuse, and poverty have kept far too many of these players from venturing off the 'rez' and into the collegiate or professional ranks. A film six years in the making, The Medicine Game shares the remarkable journey of two brothers from the Onondaga Nation driven by a single goal; to beat the odds and play lacrosse for national powerhouse Syracuse University. The obstacles in their way are frequent and daunting, but the brothers love for the game and their family's unyielding determination, propels these boys towards their dream.

The Year I Broke My Voice
###BREAK###
Situated within a post-industrial wasteland, eight youths, portrayed by transgender adults, struggle to find and define themselves and their world. Episodic vignettes reveal the intertwining adventures, traumas and banalities of their daily lives amidst a town that time has forgotten. The script for this project was composed in a collage format by excerpting and adapting dialog from several classic coming-of-age films.

Saving Face
###BREAK###
On the surface, Matt Kern was a teenager that had everything. He was MVP on his high school football and basketball teams... elected class president... son of respected upper-middle class parents living in the Redlands of Miami. But one night in March of 1988, Matt Kern and his friends go out to steal a car for fun and end up committing murder. SAVING FACE profiles the personal journey of Matt Kern through the Florida Criminal Justice System and in the process poses hard questions about crime, punishment, the nature of redemption and the healing power of faith.

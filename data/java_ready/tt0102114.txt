In the Shadow of the Stars
###BREAK###
This charming documentary focuses not on the opera divas, but on the cast of background singers that are essential to creating the grand spectacle of the San Francisco Opera. The background singers, or choristers, play all of the supernumerary soldiers, senators and peasants while providing musical support to the star singers who stand in the spotlight. The struggles, joys and jealousies of these background players are rendered in heartening detail as they seek to rise through the ranks.

"5...6...7...8" is a feature-length documentary that captures the emotions and excitement of a year in the life of Nova Jazz, an elite girls dance company. The dancers, ranging in age from 10 to 18, are based out of The Pulse Performing Arts Studio, in Bedford Hills, NY. Opening with Registration at the Pulse, Jennifer Dell, Artistic Director and Owner and in her late 30s. She is a married mother of two, is the choreographer for Nova Jazz. She hand-picks new members from the 500-plus students at the Pulse, and few of them have what it takes to survive the year. From there, we meet the new Nova captains, and see how they cope with leadership, and the infighting that nearly tears the group apart. In addition to parties and sleepovers, we travel with Nova as they perform at Six Flags, the Cherry Blossom Parade in Washington, DC, dance festivals, shopping malls and more. The film culminates with the year-end concert. For the older girls, this concert is their last performance with Nova. For the younger ones, it is a rite of passage that marks their transition from apprentice to full member. 41 girls. 10 performances. 104 rehearsals. 473 costumes. 2,197 miles. One incredible year. Spend a year with Nova Jazz. "5...6...7...8"

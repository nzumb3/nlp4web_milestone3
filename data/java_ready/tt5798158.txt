The Unexpected Turn of Jim Sagel
###BREAK###
This video is a meditation on the life and early death of Jim Sagel, whose fiction, poetry and plays, inspired by the culture of the Hispanic people of Northern New Mexico and written in his non-native Spanish, received awards and recognition in Spain and Latin America. Through interviews, old footage, and texts by Sagel, video artist Pilar Rodr'guez Aranda dreamily weaves the tale of this artist who chose to keep his manic-depression a secret, leaving behind many unanswered questions.

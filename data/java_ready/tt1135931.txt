Rishi, the son of legendary Raj Kapoor, decides to try his hand at politics, and to garner support, re-locates to his birth village, Hadbahedi. The village is located in an isolated area where most trains do not stop, and electricity is only available for about 6 hours a day. He also decides to shoot a film 'Khooni Khazana' with Producer/Director, Malkani. Once there, he secretly makes a deal to lend his name to an alcoholic beverage, in exchange for a plot of land in nearby Triphala, and one Crore Rupees, while pledging to the naive villagers that he has no intention to re-locating anywhere. Misled villagers believe Hadbahedi will get popular and modernized, and decide to assist him with all their might. Things escalate into chaos, and anger, when they find out that their valuables are being stolen, and the women being molested, by the film crew, while the police accuse them of harboring a terrorist who was responsible for the December 13, 2001, attack on the Indian Parliament.

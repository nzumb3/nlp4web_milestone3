Tales of a Sea Cow describes how a team of scientists have achieved the first ever decoding of animal communication; for the first time in history, they have translated the song of a marine mammal - the 'Steller's Sea Cow' - a species, which was until now thought to be extinct since 1768. The rediscovery in 2007 off the coast of Greenland is discovered in 'Tales of a Sea Cow'.

N'kisi Concorde
###BREAK###
N'kisi Concorde, a documentary feature, investigates the lives and work of two Detroit-area outsider artists and visual storytellers, Olayami Dabls and Dmytro Szylak, whose extraordinary installations reflect the power of the imagination unbound by artistic conventions or popular tastes. Though unrelated by work or acquaintance, these artists are united by the power of their singular visions to stimulate lively public engagement and to color the cultural landscapes of their communities.

Kaj Tonny Holmgren has been waiting for a miracle for nearly 30 years. He has a progressive muscular disease, preacher ambitions and an intimate dialogue with God. His caretaking wife and fellow believers are all waiting for the impossible to happen. Director Ann Holmgren has filmed her father for six years. The result is both a highly original family portrait and a bold investigation of the boundaries of faith in a life stuck between visions and bodily decay.

Prior to their wedding, Gil and Sidney did everything right. Both devout Christians with a desire to spread God's message, their idea of marriage was perfectly aligned with what the Bible says it should be: a lifelong union. However, shortly after the wedding, Sidney moved out, leaving Gil devastated and facing a challenging journey that would test his faith. "I Do, I Don't" is one couple's story of love, marriage, and what happens when the realities of modern day life collide with the biblical ideals by which some 174 million Americans are trying to live their lives.

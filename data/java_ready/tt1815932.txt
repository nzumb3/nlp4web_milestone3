###BREAK###
Weaving together interviews, archival footage, photographs, animation, and narration, "Signs Out Of Time" is an incredible journey that delves into the life and work of UCLA Archaeologist Dr. Marija Gimbutas. Gimbutas' work focused on revealing the linguistic and mythological origins of European cultures in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, and how they were matriarchal in nature, including Earth-based spirituality and Goddess worship. The film explores how her notions of European prehistory challenged many traditional assumptions about the beginnings of European civilization. The film features interviews with both her supporters and critics, and explores her studies, excavations and publications, her extensive scholarship, and the controversy surrounding her theories.

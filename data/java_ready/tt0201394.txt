Samantha, a travel writer suffering from claustrophobia, agoraphobia, and a whole host of other phobias, isn't exactly lucky in her romantic fate. But when her pshycologist suffers a major mental breakdown, she secretly poses as the missing shrink in an effort to turn Michael, her new neighbor, towards her and away from his girlfriend. Through her chase, Samantha meets the happy-go-lucky magazine salesman, Henry. What follows is a series of events that lead to the one question Samantha has to face: Is she thinking with her heart... or with her mind?

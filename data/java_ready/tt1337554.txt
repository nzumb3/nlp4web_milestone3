This Is Berlin Not New York
###BREAK###
This documentary traces the journey of fifteen young, talented New York Artists to Berlin, as they meet and join forces with their German counterparts. Together, the American and German artists explore artistic ideas and concepts while collaborating on original projects that push conventional boundaries. Original musical scores and animated artwork complement and enhance this provocative examination of western contemporary art and the ongoing tension between commercialism and creativity for its own sake.

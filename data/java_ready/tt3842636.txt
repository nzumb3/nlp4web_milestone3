The subject of sexuality is still considered a taboo in this part of the world. There's no such thing as sex education among girls and boys about to hit adolescence. As a result they grow up with skewed concepts, which gets reflected in risky behavior, untimely and unsafe pregnancy, eve teasing and rape, child marriage and child mortality. Under these circumstances, few local NGOs united under the name of Unite for Body Rights (UBR) are working with the aid of an INGO from Netherlands to raise awareness about body rights among local school students. This film explores the contrast between the sexual objectification prevalent in the society and the efforts of people to be aware of and exercise their body rights.

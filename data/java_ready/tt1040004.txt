Seducer's Fall
###BREAK###
"Forf√∏rerens Fald" (The Fall of the Seducer), is a film about the legendary Danish newspaper "Dagen" and its fatal crack in 2002. For the first time in Danish medias, the man behind "Dagen", - the mysterious and charming Danish developer genius, - Peter Linck, - tells his incredible story of how he seduced all the sharpest journalists in the entire country to leave their tops jobs to work for him, and how this high flying and extremely extravagant newspaper adventure ended in a nightmare for everybody involved with a debt of 70 million Kroner. The film uses a ground-braking new way of mixing fiction scenes with documentary material, making the involved persons act themselves in precise reconstructions of the real events. This way the film follows Linck's personal crisis with his family and friends, as his legendary self assurance and charm gradually breaks down totally. It's the story of choosing between career or family, - about putting everything at stake for your life dream, - the story of how to rise again after hitting the bottom of your life.

U Game?
###BREAK###
Gamers is an independent documentary film that introduces the strange and varied culture of fantasy gaming in the United States. With a camera in hand, the socially-awkward filmmaker stepped blindly into many venues and approached other socially-awkward strangers with sincere curiosity. Unsatisfied to create the usual film that encourages audiences to marvel at the "freaks", the filmmaker used her own experiences of exploration and discovery to shape the film, which is an honest, affectionate look at gamers in gamers' own words. The bottom line is that chances are, someone you work with is a closet gamer.

Gamers
###BREAK###
Ever wonder what goes on between geeks? Sneaking suspicion all nerds think they're geniuses? Find gaming hot? Gamers is an independent documentary film that introduces the strange and varied culture of fantasy gaming in the United States. With a camera in hand, the socially-awkward filmmaker stepped blindly into many venues and approached other socially-awkward strangers with sincere curiosity. Unsatisfied with the usual films about gamers that points at the spectacle of the 'freaks,' the filmmaker used her own experiences of exploration and discovery to shape the film, which is an affectionate look at gamers in gamers' own words. The bottom line is that chances are, someone you work with is a closet gamer.

The System
###BREAK###
THE SYSTEM is a metaphorical comedy adventure inside a human body after a cocaine binge. When a neuron discovers that his company, Cerebellum, is destroying data to cover up the details of a 'black out,' he must travel to the Right Hemisphere and beyond to find out the truth about what's happening in the System. With a red blood cell as his ally, he must save the System before the heart workers in Circulation City go on strike and cut off the oxygen supply to the brain. This experimental feature plays with B-movie traditions and humor to create an atmospheric and unusual world that gets to the heart (literally) of what it means to be a part of a global society in need of change.

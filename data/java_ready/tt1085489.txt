Pied-de-biche
###BREAK###
We hear a lot about male violence. But what about female violence? There's no question it exists, but because it generally takes the form of verbal or psychological abuse it leaves no physical evidence, and is usually unreported by the media, which tends to depict women as victims. Violence by women is perpetrated against men who don't report it and against children who don't speak out, and is neither harmless nor trivial. Through interviews with violent women and their male victims, Pied-de-Biche explores the flip side of conjugal violence.

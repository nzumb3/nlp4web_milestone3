No Problem

A quirky scientist working for the Indian government has discovered a chemical formula which will make the body of army soldiers bulletproof. He asks the chief minister for security so that the formula doesn't fall into wrong hands. The whimsical chief minister, in turn, orders a nincompoop police commissioner to provide security to the scientist. Meanwhile, Spider man - a hilariously sinister Koli (fisherman community) - is already plotting to steal the formula for his evil boss. Enter Jai and Veeru - two goofy guys who are forced into becoming private detectives by their pushy mothers. Jai and Veeru are assigned the job of protecting the secret chemical formula. What follows is a series of one comical situation after another.

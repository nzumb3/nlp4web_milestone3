Geboren in Offenbach
###BREAK###
The social life of immigrants in Germany has been a widely discussed topic. Often ignored is the question of how the second generation deals with the presence of two cultures. Nazmi, Nagije and Bege are three Kosovar Albanian sisters - born in Offenbach/ Germany. After the death of their father (their mother died 11 years prior) the film accompanies them for a period of five years. The relatives are never seen in the film but it becomes evident that they have an enormous influence on the girls. Kosovar Albanian tradition clashes with German daily life as the three sisters struggle to establish their own identity. The film captures their individual inner conflict as they deal with two cultures.

###BREAK###
Eli Regrets... It's an often funny, somewhat heart wrenching look at the life of a boy just leaving high school and heading into a life with no real options: His mom's an alcoholic, his friends are stoners and his job's a dead end. Then an enigmatic girl appears in his life and he is pulled into a world that he never thought he'd see. Can he handle the hunger in a never ending search for satisfaction?

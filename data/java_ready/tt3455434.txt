Pásztor
###BREAK###
Zoltán Miszori, feels his calling to the service of God with such conviction, that he abandons his studies in forestry and bids farewell to his bride. He chooses instead to live only for his vocation, to be a pastor of the spirits. Once a priest, he takes his love of God to the community in a variety of ways, he serves in a prison, in old people's homes, in orphanages, homeless shelters or at sports events, pilgrimages, or even situations where people are giving blood. Anyone who had a chance to converse with Father Zoltán, remember him saying that it was vital to be instilled with the love of God, faith, and the profound importance of prayers for people's souls. "We found our faith with him", say the people who regularly attended his services. Father Zoli was not a celebrity priest, but God's modest and humble envoy, whose words and deeds always matched one another. He only requested that the following inscription to be written on his grave: A Pastor of Spirits. God's conduit, a mediator between the Lord and his people. Never wanting to convert, he merely wanted to transmit thoughts and point to signs; by doing this, he made us recognise the necessity for self-examination, the re-evaluation of life as a way to become happy and fulfilled.

In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee
###BREAK###
In the 1960s just before being adopted from a Korean orphanage by an American family, my identity was switched with another girl named Cha Jung Hee. I was told to keep the switch a secret, then sent to America. In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee is a personal essay that chronicles my journey to find my double, while exploring the ethical and social dimensions of international transracial adoption. The film is a poignant reflection on memory, identity and what it means to walk in someone else's shoes.

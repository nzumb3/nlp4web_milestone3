Accidental Tourists
###BREAK###
The film is a meditative art experiment, meant to evoke that sense of psychological shift that happens with quiet time in nature. It documents the trip of a group of dancers through different landscapes in western North America, a collage of images of physical and sensory meditations on place following a set of minimalist filming and editing rules. Both the subject matter and the rules of filming are intended to evoke the kind of calm and simplicity of presence that opens up the senses to the 'more-than-human' world.

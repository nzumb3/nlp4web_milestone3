A fantasy thriller, where one face merges into the next. The thread that connects the worlds of the two protagonists, Niki and Lefteris, is memory, violence and a polemic of hope. A 'solo' performance in many respects by The Boy (director, writer, art director, composer) and his actress Sofia Kokkali, Nima challenges the values of contemporary society, with a unique cinematic articulation.

Pincus
###BREAK###
PINCUS focuses on the relationship between Paul, a man with Parkinson's disease, and his son Pincus. By day, Pincus ineptly runs the family construction business, and by night, he begrudgingly acts as caretaker for his needy father. Pinucs struggles to transcend the drudgery of his daily life by escaping into drugs and the companionship of his sole employee, Dietmar, a German construction worker living in the U.S. illegally. Soon, Pincus meets Anna, an attractive yoga instructor he courts under the guise of looking for alternative therapies for his father. When Dietmar mysteriously dissapears, Pincus' search for him evolves into a personal journey that explores the meaning of family, spirituality and isolation.

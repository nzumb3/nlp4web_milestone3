Transforming Loss: A Documentary
###BREAK###
How does one cope with profound loss and find hope? The award-winning film, 'Transforming Loss' follows six families through the grief process. Incredibly, these individuals not only have survived profound loss, but through love, faith and perseverance are transforming. A grief survivor herself, Burdick began her journey in understanding grief and loss when, at age 31, with two small children, her husband of 10 years was killed in a scuba diving accident. She found herself alone, entirely overwhelmed and unprepared for what her life, and their lives, had suddenly become. This film is Judith's transformation.

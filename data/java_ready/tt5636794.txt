The Tortoise and the House
###BREAK###
A fable about architecture When my grown daughter left the nest, I asked myself, as every parent does, should I stay or should I go? I decided to stay, but not without serious reflection on the transformative possibilities my house harboured, that from now on she would first and foremost be a nest whose lone inhabitant is a single, deserted mother. This short film charts a poetic journey through this architectural transformation, in a way that melds the past and the present, the house's animal and spiritual lives, as if she herself speaks of me, and I of her. And the turtle proves itself to be not just the cute little reptile we all know and love, but also a symbol of the divine. I would never have thought I'd film a turtle in my house. But the turtle's image imposed itself upon me: a human is an animal that needs shelter, but with family, under a common roof. And that solitary life I spoke of soon evolved into the life of a new grand-mother...

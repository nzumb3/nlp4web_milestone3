The Fourth Dimension
###BREAK###
Grolsch Film Works and VICE Films present 'The Fourth Dimension', a film that gives us a glimpse of enlightenment through the eyes of three one-of-a-kind characters. The three filmmakers - Fedorchenko, Korine and Kwiecinski - have created three unique stories that offer up their vision of this higher plane of existence, the Fourth Dimension. Each filmmaker takes his character on a journey that changes the way they see the world and themselves. And each filmmaker will offer a different perspective on what the Fourth Dimension is.

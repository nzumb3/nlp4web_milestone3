Nuclear Neighbourhood
###BREAK###
Nuclear Neighbourhood is a Independent feature horror comedy film written & directed by Matthew J Oliver. Produced by Megan Schultz and Matthew J Oliver from Oliverschultz Film . This film was made on a very tight budget, we like to call it a punk-DIY 80's throwback film. Local punk bands/artists/musicians and actors were involved in the making of the production. We think this film has a unique B-movie 80's horror feel that some might compare to the rawness of John Waters films meets the Cult Killer B genre of underground cinema.

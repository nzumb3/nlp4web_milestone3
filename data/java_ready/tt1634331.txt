Jatra: Hyalagaad Re Tyalagaad
###BREAK###
After getting their Mumbai-based underworld boss, Ramdas Mali, is arrested for attempting to abduct Mumbai's DCP Madhav Sakharkhande, Mohan, Siddhu, and their 3 slacker buddies. He is unable to pay rent to their landlord, Shiva Kanhole, and decides to take to crime after watching 'Dhoom', and 'Hera Pheri'. Both capers comically fail, and the duo end up stealing a car, which stalls just about 100 kilometers from Sholapur. Before they could get there, both get abducted by rival residents of Hyalagaad and Tyalagaad, and must compete in the 100th Bhagwan Shri Bhairavnath Jatra - and as per past tradition and custom - only one of them can survive this fierce competition.

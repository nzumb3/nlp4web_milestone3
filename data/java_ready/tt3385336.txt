All over North America, city centers are decaying. In San Francisco, an unusual coalition of artists, city officials, property owners and residents is working together to reverse a 40 year decline on central Market Street through the convergence of arts and technology, while working to preserve the culture of the neighborhood. But will this revitalization effort unwittingly displace the current low-income residents and small businesses - something no one involved wants? Will the reality of pricing people out defeat the promise of lifting people up? Can political and ideological enemies put aside past differences and work together to make real change? This project follows a large-scale attempt to use the arts and technology to transform an entire neighborhood, an ambitious and daunting task. This may be a "once in a lifetime" opportunity to revitalize this gritty neighborhood and, therefore, to document the process. The lessons learned, whether through success or failure, can serve as a model for other communities across the globe.

The Sentinel's Flight
###BREAK###
A veteran of the war in Afghanistan, Francis is now back home with his fianc√©, Chloe. He experiences severe psychotic episodes and symptoms of dissociation, and as a result is treated with electroshock therapy. During his treatment, he experiences fragments of his past through the eyes of his alter ego Michael Wolf (Paul O'Connor). In these hallucinations, Michael has a conflict with his father, is reacquainted with his buddies, and must fight for the well-being of his friends and his love, Chloe. As the treatment continues, Francis' fantasy begins to loop, although the situations and characters become progressively darker and grittier. Francis awakens at the end of his electroshock therapy. However, he remains forever lost in the world of his alter-ego Michael Wolf.

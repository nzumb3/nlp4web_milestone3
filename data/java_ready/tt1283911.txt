Herpes Boy
###BREAK###
Rudolph Murray hates his life. He has a large purple birthmark on his upper lip and everyday he finds someone staring, pointing, or calling him names-like Herpes Boy. He makes videos for the Internet in which he rants about his quirky life and zany family, including his New Age mother, emotionally distant father, and grumpy grandmother. When his "actress-slash-model-slash-dancer" cousin re-edits his videos to make herself more popular, it attracts a huge new audience and makes Rudolph an unlikely-and unwilling-cyber-celebrity at the worst possible time in his life.

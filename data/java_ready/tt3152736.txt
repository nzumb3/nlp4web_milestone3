Solitudes goes from laugh to drama, from musical to documentary, from romantic comedy to mean satire, keeping loneliness focused in all its aspects at all times, in many stories that are linked to each other. Stared by Vanessa Giacomo and Oswaldo Montenegro, a great cast gathers in several episodes about the greatest fear of mankind: loneliness.

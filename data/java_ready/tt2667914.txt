Pepe el andaluz
###BREAK###
When I was a child, I was told my grandfather Pepe had died. Later I found out that after the Spanish Civil War he had emigrated to Argentina. My grandmother never knew anything else about him. This autobiographical film is a trip against time and oblivion to uncover family secrets.

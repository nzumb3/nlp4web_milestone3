Nine years after the 1986 crime-spree of Bunch, Sheriff Pat Porter's daughter "Gina" receives some unexpected news from those events which compels her to continue the case to fulfill her deceased father's legacy. That news brings her some unlikely help from a few characters of the past in not only finding out what became of the whole fiasco, but she also finds that together, they have a chance to make everything right. This sets them on their path to Malibu and proves to be no fun as there are others on the same mission, but with their own sinister agenda... including king of the Malibu underworld, "Markovich".

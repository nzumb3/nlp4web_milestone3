###BREAK###
ELECTED is a film about five young German politicians aged 25 to 32, who are elected for the first time into the German Parliament, the Bundestag. Their legislative period started in 2009 and has ended in 2013. What do they expect to happen in Berlin? What are their ideas and maybe doubts? How will their lives change now that they are part of 'important politics'? Can they live up to their own resolutions? Can they change something or will they just blend in? How do they experience democracy in their home country? What kind of success or disappointments will they experience?

###BREAK###
A team of middle school secret agents uses high tech gadgets, motorcycles and helicopters to try to take down cyberbullying profiles. The Rage Page is born, and everyone is a target! By defusing a nuclear social media bomb, and tracking down a former mean girl who has become a target, the creator of the Rage Page is discovered, and it's not who they thought it would be! Wrong information and texting leads to confusion among the secret agents, but a bystander steps out of the shadows just in time to tell the truth, and hopefully save the wrong person from getting blamed for all the cyberbullying before everything crashes down around them.

The family is back, and they are getting ready to celebrate their favorite holiday! 'Tis the season for the Harvest of the Black Moon. The family has chosen three people to be the souls to harvest for their holiday feast. According to cannibal customs, the three must be harvested before nightfall so they can ascend to the heavens, and guide the moon back into the night sky. But, if they manage to make it until nightfall, they are set free. Savannah, Wilbur, and Sue Ellen were the unlucky souls chosen to be hunted. As the time passes, and the sun starts to make its way below the horizon, they wonder if they will make it out alive, or if they will be food for the table.

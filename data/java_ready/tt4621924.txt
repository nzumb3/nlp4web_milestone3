Special Annie
###BREAK###
A Korean filmmaker living alone in NY happens to meet an American woman, Annie. Annie was sexually abused as a child, subsequently turned to prostitution and heroin addiction from which she contracted AIDS. She robbed a bank to support her habit and served prison time. Now out of prison, and drug free, she still has to live with AIDS, but seems remarkably happy- at times, radiantly joyful - simply to be alive. The filmmaker learns that Annie is the same age as her older sister suffering Parkinson's disease in Korea and begins developing a strong bond with Annie. These two women from very different back grounds begin to share their solitary lives with the help of a rescued cat, begin opening up to each other.

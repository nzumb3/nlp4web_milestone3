The theme of my opera is the communist show trial in 1950. At its beginning there was the endeavor of a totalitarian power to eliminate all non communist heroes of the anti fascist resistance; at the end gallows from which four people swung and a countless number of other fates devastated in the openly and spectacularly manipulated trial. The whole trial was built up as a theatrical production making use of all the possibilities of the mass media of the time with the aim of intimidating and violently uniting the working people. This is why I used only original texts from the trial for my opera, which was filmed by Jan Hrebejk in 2010.

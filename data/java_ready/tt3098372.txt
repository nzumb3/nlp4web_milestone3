The Hawaii Wisdom Project
###BREAK###
The Hawaii Wisdom Project is a feature length documentary. We asked Hawaii's leaders two questions: what challenges are you facing today and what advice would you give someone starting out? The documentary features Governor Abercrombie, Henk Rogers, Robert Cazimero, Tulsi Gabbard, Danny Kaleikini, the world champion bodyboarder, and many more. This was filmed in Hawaii with an all Hawaii crew. Directed by Jeff Orig

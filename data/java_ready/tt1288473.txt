###BREAK###
Small stories mix to paint a vivid picture of what happens when life colors outside the lines. The strange incidents of spatula art, the morality of laundry, and soft-core office porn. Everyday people become circus performers in their own routine. A man bumps into a witch and suddenly his girlfriend turns into a mailbox. A pigeon finds true love but is haunted by the past. This one day tour through unbelievable possibility leads into a night of shocking banality. A woman makes pasta. Three guys get a drink. A man meets a neighbor who killed his father, sometimes dresses like a pirate, and holds the secret to his deepest desire.

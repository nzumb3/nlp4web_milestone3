Ali Bab√† u Palermo in serie A
###BREAK###
The day when Palermo reached the First Division. The documentary is about the making of the celebration after waiting for 32 years and about the anxieties that such event produces in the collective consciousness, a factor of sublimination and personal revenge. A film about soccer without soccer as leading role. Fans and common people take over the scene and make a show about their passion.

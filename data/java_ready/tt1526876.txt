Bring Children from Streets
###BREAK###
When young local filmmakers Espen Faugstad and Eivind Nilsen suddenly decide to travel to Uganda to make a documentary about the orphanage Nsumba, it is the start of the long line of events that make up the story of BRING CHILDREN FROM STREETS. The pair seek out Richard Kiwanuka who heads the Bring Children From Streets foundation. Forced to logde among the locals due to financial difficulties, they end up living with the Kaweke family, something which gives BRING CHILDREN FROM STREETS a unique perspective on both Ugandan society and the problem of orphaned children living on the streets.

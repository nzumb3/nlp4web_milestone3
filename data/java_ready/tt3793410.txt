N: VI - Vanishing Roadsides
###BREAK###
We used to travel along roads that went through inhabited places. Now, those roads have been replaced by motorways isolated from the landscape they cross. Between the point of departure and the point of arrival we have left behind those places of passage where, apparently, nothing happens anymore. The N-VI is one of those roads.

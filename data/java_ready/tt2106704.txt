The Last War Crime
###BREAK###
Epic political fantasy drama, envisioning what would have happened if Dick Cheney had been indicted for ordering torture, which was used to get the false confessions to make a fraudulent case for war. Starting with a dramatic recreation of events of the morning of the 9/11 attacks, we tell the story of a heroic assistant U.S. attorney, who uncovers evidence of war crimes, and a suspenseful race against time to serve the Vice President in public with an arrest warrant before they can intercept her and quash it forever.

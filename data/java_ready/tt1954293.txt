Darren makes a film narrated by his mother that is 'Based on A True Story,' featuring a couple of guys playing video games, drinking beer, and making prank calls while a bunch of girls, simultaneously, talk about 'women's issues'. Things go horribly arrives, there is a dance off, and chaos ensues. Nothing will prepare you for the film's final act.

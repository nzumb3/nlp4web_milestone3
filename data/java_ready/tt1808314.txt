Seth (Christopher Stewart) has just moved into a new apartment with his best friend and actor roommate, Nate (Corey Wright). Mired in a post-grad funk, Seth is badgered into going out on the town with Nate and his old pal, Jared (Karl Hammerle). Soon separated on the dance floor of a risqu√© go-go club, Nate gets frisky with an older Pilates teacher, Brie (Natalie Thomas), while Jared makes eyes at the DJ. At Nate's behest, Seth starts an inane temp job with cute co-worker, Sephora (Mimi Hirt). Seth hesitantly starts dating Sephora as Brie postpones her trip and moves in along with her ill-tempered cat. Meanwhile, Jared becomes infatuated with his new DJ friend, leading to drug abuse and a quick eviction from his studio. With the foursome all living together under one roof, the cracks in their half-thought out dreams begin to show, forcing them to confront what's really holding them back; themselves.

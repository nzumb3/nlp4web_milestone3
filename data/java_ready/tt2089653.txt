Molly and her troubled husband Roger are on a cross-country road trip when they get into a scrape at a highway rest stop and decide to run. Disoriented by a blizzard in the back roads of the Idaho lava rock desert, the couple becomes snowbound. Their relationship strains under the pressures of starvation, hypothermia, and wolves. It is a slow-burning psychological thriller that builds to a horrifying climax in a small car at The Craters of The Moon National Park.

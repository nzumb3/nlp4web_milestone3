'This is the best uranium in the world. The bomb the Americans dropped on japan was made from thus stuff,one million dollars per one kilogram'. Meeting, black market, Congo. The film depicts rare documentation of how uranium deals are made on the black market, in the world back yard, in Africa. This is the story of a conflict riddled country that has sunk into a war, even now days militias control many regions. The UN mission there has no real means to give aid, and the high echelons seem not to care. For now, the villagers who live near the uranium mines are paying the price - babies born mutated, hundreds of thousands of refugees exiled from the homes, people paying with with their lives.

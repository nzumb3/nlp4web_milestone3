All Day
###BREAK###
All day is a 3D animation/experimental video project produced in collaboration with Justin Gibson, a 24 year old man serving a life without parole sentence at a state correctional facility. The piece reflects on Justin's fictional interpretation of the story of his crime and ensuing incarceration. Following detailed descriptions of the cells Justin has been locked in, we are constructing a site which emulates the physical space within which the stories unfold. Justin's cells, however, are door-less boxes, scattered in an abandoned landfill, and inhabited by the videotaped figures of previously convicted individuals, recently released, who are reenacting the different facets of the inmates' life in prison, as well as their own past experience. Music/Sound track for the piece has been produced by Oded Zehavi.

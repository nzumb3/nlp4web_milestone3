Harry on the Phone
###BREAK###
Harry and I met in recovery from drugs addictions about a year ago. We initially bonded through our love for football and today we help each other to stay sober on a daily basis. Harry is a natural born entertainer, football pundit, comic and a great friend to be around. This film was mainly shot in Bethnal Green, East London and recorded on my phone. The aim was to create an immersive portrait, to transport the viewer into our relationship, into Harry's head, into his everyday surroundings, and his daily struggle to live a clean and sober life.

Graffiti Verit√© 3: A Voyage Into the Iconography of Graffiti Art
###BREAK###
In Graffiti Verite' 3 filmmaker BobBryan steps away from the traditional story-telling format and re-invents himself by using contemporary musical idioms from different countries to proclaim the narrative. This experimental musical opus probes the socio-political context that distracts the average person from appreciating the historical / artistic significance and impact of Graf. GV3 is a compelling sensorial experience; shockingly honest and deviantly politically incorrect.

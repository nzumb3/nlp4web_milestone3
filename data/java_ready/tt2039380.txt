Deep within the ruins, Sinjin, a sinister overlord freed from a cryogenic chamber that was his prison for many centuries, is now in league with the Quintari, a malevolent insectoid race known throughout the galaxy as the scourge. In possession of a powerful new energy source, Sinjin plots his revenge on the descendants of those who betrayed him in the past.

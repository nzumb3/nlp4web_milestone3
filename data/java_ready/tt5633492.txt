Only barberry remains

In April of 2012 two escapees from the maximum security wing of a forensic psychiatric hospital find a safe hideout in Wiesbaden, Germany in the home of a developer and part-time psychologist. This man decides to take them to Sardinia in order to establish an alternative therapy center on the island together. He then contacts two students of the Academy of Media Arts Cologne to document this very project. The resulting movie accompanies the three men on their audacious journey. At the same time, the movie documents the construction of the new forensic psychiatric hospital in GÃ¶ttingen 2014. The ambitious plans of the medical director and his fairytale-like security concept stand in contrast to, but also corresponds with, the outlaw-mission of the self-proclaimed psychiatry reformer.

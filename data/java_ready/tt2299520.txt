Heroes Behind the Badge
###BREAK###
This inspiring documentary will change the way we look at the men and women of law enforcement and highlight the unselfish acts of bravery they commit each day in the line of duty. Its stories will be powerful, emotional, insightful and educational. Thanks to our partnership with the NLEOMF, active duty police officers, retired officers, and family members of the fallen, audiences will experience what it's really like to walk the thin blue line. 50% of all proceeds from the film will go to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.

BoyStory
###BREAK###
In 1979, disco was murder... BoyStory is based on true life events that took place in Adelaide circa 1979, and is a coming of age story of a young man who leaves home at an early age, finds himself on the street, and eventually into a mixed gay nightclub called "Catches". Carl learns that the very people he has been taught by his strict Mormon parents to think of as sinners and low-lives are, in the end, the only people who offer care and support. However, there is always a price to pay when one chooses this environment to live in. As was the case with many young people that went missing in that era, there may be no happy ending for Carl...

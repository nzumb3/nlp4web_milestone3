Transcending Fear: The Story of Gao Zhisheng
###BREAK###
Born in a cave with only stars to tell time, Gao Zhisheng overcomes incredible odds to become one of China's top attorneys. The people call him "the Conscience of China." But then, in the eyes of the Communist Party, he goes too far. After speaking out against taboo human rights abuses, Gao is abducted, tortured. Secret police hold his wife and children hostage. In a heart-wrenching dilemma, Gao is forced to choose between his lifelong quest for justice and his love for his family. A story of courage, compassion, and cruelty, this film is a must-see for anyone wishing to understand the tensions bubbling below the surface of today's China-or to meet one of the most noble freedom fighters of our time.

Shut Your Eyes
###BREAK###
A stormy couple in real life come back together to make a film where, try as they might, they can't avoid falling into their old traps. A naked couple spinning their ritualized vocal and physical dialogue in a loft reserved for their rituals. A black comedy about the animal poetry of seduction and sexuality. About the fantasies the couple makes real or the reality they make into fantasy. About the jagged borderlines between film - fiction and documentary, theater, dance and poetry.

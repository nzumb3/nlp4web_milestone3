Unsure of his future after college, James returns to his small rural hometown before his senior year begins. He unexpectedly begins working on the dairy farm his father once owned, befriending an eccentric twenty-something farmer and, to his surprise, a grieving cow. As James connects with his past, he opens old wounds about his father's sudden death. A lyrical meditation on growing up, MUCKLAND is a coming-of-age film about the grief and joy of letting go of your past to begin your future.

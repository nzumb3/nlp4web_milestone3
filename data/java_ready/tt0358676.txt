Il ritorno di Cagliostro
###BREAK###
In the Sicily of the late 40's, two brother sculptors, tired of selling madonnas to the local churches, finally realize their dream and set up a Sicilian production company, thanks to the help of a local bishop. They start producing one box-office failure Z-movie after the other, all with terribly bad local non-pros as actors. Covered in debts, they finally have their great chance when a local nobleman obsessed by magic decides to invest all his wealth in the making of a movie about Cagliostro, just one year after Welles' "Black Magic". They hire a famous American actor (Robert Englund) and start shooting "The return of Cagliostro"..

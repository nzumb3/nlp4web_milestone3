The Last Executioner
###BREAK###
Inspired by real events, THE LAST EXECUTIONER is the incredible true story of Chavoret Jaruboon, the last person in Thailand whose job it was to execute by gun - a wild rock and roller who took a 'respectable' job to support the family he loved devotedly, then constantly tried to reconcile the good and bad karma that came from his decision. It is a story of life at its most beautiful and death at its most surreal.

In his early thirties, Nikos is a poet and a dreamer, a bohemian figure of a man who even though he is content with his simple daily routine watching indolently the days pass by from the windows of his favourite coffee shop, on the inside, he is silently aching to love and be loved. On the other hand, Sophia, a decisive fashion stylist in her mid-twenties, thirsts to fulfil her dreams in life, she is fresh and staggeringly beautiful, yet, she is also leading an ordinary life. Eventually, by an interesting turn of fate, the two opposites will attract and as the lights flicker on a warm August night, amidst vacant Athens' stillness, Nikos, the knight in not so shining armour, will find the courage to converse with Sophia, the alluring woman he just met at a phone booth, blurring the line between chatting and flirting. Over the brief course of the remaining evening, while strolling around the city's quiet night streets, Nikos will earn Sophia's trust, underlining the necessity of a change in her life, however, by morning, who knows what the first ray of light will bring?

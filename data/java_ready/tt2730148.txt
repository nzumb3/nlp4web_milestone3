Built on Narrow Land
###BREAK###
Built on Narrow Land Built on Narrow Land is a film that looks at a moment in Cape Cod when the spirit of European modern architecture inspired a group of bohemian designers -- professionals and amateurs both--to build houses that married principles of the Bauhaus to the centuries-old local architecture of seaside New England. But in 1959, with the establishment of the Cape Cod National Seashore the fate of these houses suddenly hung in the balance: houses built after 1959 became the property of the park on the death of their owners. Through the points of view of the characters, the film reveals the privilege of building on virgin landscape, the impact of eminent domain, its effect on people whose houses will have to be given to the federal government and, literally, given back to the land.

Multicultural Arts Victoria in partnership with Melbourne film maker, Thomas Baricevic of Jackson Black Films have produced a documentary film that captures the fascinating development of two groups of young Sudanese in Melbourne: A-MCs, a group of Sudanese school age boys based in Dandenong who write and perform hip hop music; and a group of four young Sudanese school age girls based in Melbourne's west who learn and perform hip hop dance and music as part of Jungle City Massive. MAV and Thomas Baricevic worked alongside the A-MCs, the Jungle City Massive girls, other Sudanese community members and leaders, local governments, the Victorian Multicultural Commission to create a film that has integrity and meaning for our newly arrived Sudanese refugee community. The film focuses on positive developments within Sudanese youth communities in Melbourne with the aim of counteracting much of the negative media that has surrounded these young people and hampered their settlement in the past several years. The film will raise awareness of issues and educate wider community members about the development of Sudanese youth as they come to terms with the post refugee experience of settling in a new land and new culture. The film will also contribute to an enhanced sense of belonging and cultural pride for other newly arrived African youth and stimulate further cultural activity through raising awareness of the many opportunities available to them in Australia to participate in positive social and cultural activity.

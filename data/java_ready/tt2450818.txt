The 24 Hours race at the Nuerburgring is the toughest 24 hours race in the world. More than 230'000 fans visited the 2012 race and camped around the 25km long race track to enjoy the race and the night long party. It is the stage of great stories and the birth place of many legends. In 24 Hours in 70 Minutes we tell the story of Hofor Racing, a small team of independent racing drivers, that had the dream to reach the checkered flag after 24 hours of racing with their two BMW M3 race cars. Dejan Grujcic and his team captured everything on camera, from the first test drive to the checkered flag coming down, from racing action to pure emotion.

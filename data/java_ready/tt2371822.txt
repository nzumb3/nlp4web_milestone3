Bullish
###BREAK###
A satirical rags-to-riches story set in Berkeley, California, "Bullish" follows five Berkeley students as they journey from rent-pressed college poverty to stock market fortune. Through a series of investments buoyed by sheer luck, the group takes on the real estate market to become the youngest landlords in Berkeley. Friendship turns to enterprise as profits skyrocket, earning the attention of the city's ruthless property moguls. Competition ensues as the old spite the efforts of the young and conspire to drive them out of the market. Set against the backdrop of the Occupy Movement, the recession, and BP's oil spill, the film satirizes the absurdity of the capitalist system and revisits the contest between friendship and business.

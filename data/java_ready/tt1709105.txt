Drive is a film about lethal combinations. A documentary project conceived by community organization Big hART, it goes behind the official advertising campaigns to produce a highly personal and cinematic look at the connections between young Tasmanian men, fast cars, booze and drugs. The truth about Australia's biggest killer of young men between the ages of 18 and 25 is moving, intimate and direct.

Namatjira Project
###BREAK###
In the rugged heart of Australia, Aboriginal painter Albert Namatjira carved out his place in art history with his captivating landscapes. The first Aboriginal person to be granted citizenship, he pioneered both art and Aboriginal rights. Yet the fruits of his legacy have been denied to his people, with the copyright of his works posthumously sold off. The Namatjira Project aims to restore those rights to his impoverished family.

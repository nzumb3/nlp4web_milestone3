Blue Moon
###BREAK###
Justin McAndrews, a free-living, collegiate jock, falls in love with studious Kathy Perkins. Unfortunately Justin has a run in with Arnold Black, a drug dealing low-life, who hides a stash in Justin's car. To make matters worse Justin is involved in a mix-up with a gypsy, Zian. Zian throws the curse of lycanthropy (werewolfism) on Justin. It's Tuesday night and Justin has until Friday at midnight, the next blue moon, to evade the curse, settle things with Black, and fall in love with Kathy. If he does not find a cure by Friday then Zian's curse will turn him into a wolf forever... that is, if Black doesn't kill him first.

After giving the chest to Joe, the Clockmaker "accidentally" locks the chest. Joe must now go on a series of wacky & diverse adventures to find the key. Each adventure is a different genre. There are 15 genres in the film, including action-adventure, comedy, Western, romance, science-fiction, film noir, musical, and more. Joe is finally living life instead of saving. He makes new friends along the way and eventually finds the key on the necklace of a beautiful young woman named Abbey. He falls for her at first sight. However, his desires for her and the treasure are in direct conflict. After another series of dangerous adventures to save Abbey's life and recover the key, he must choose between the two.

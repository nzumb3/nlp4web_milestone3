The Bloodlines Video Diary Project is a one hour documentary co-directed by two 8th grade children. Ebony Graves, 13, and Dennis Midiri , 14, each filmed video diaries over one school year chronicling their lives in inner city Philadelphia. Dennis, who lives in the working class neighborhood of Port Richmond, lives with his mother and two sisters. He attends a disciplinary public school and is isolated from his classmates and peers due to emotional and learning differences. Ebony Graves attends a small Catholic School in North Philadelphia, and lives with her mother and grandmother. Each child creates intimate and powerful family narratives about their transition from 8th grade to high school.

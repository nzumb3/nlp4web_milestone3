Dangerous Cripple
###BREAK###
This is a tale of revenge and retribution between Cripo and Rafael two marginalised ruthless criminals and their wannabe sidekicks, who wax and wane in their support for the two protagonists. Cripo plots his revenge against Rafael who is being released from prison for stabbing him and confining him to a wheelchair. The action takes place in the seamier parts of Edinburgh seldom seen or imagined by the tourists. All the dysfunctional characters want something else from life, the problem is they are not sure what. Although dealing with the serious subjects of criminality, purposeless youth and the Politically Correct norms of disability in modern Scottish Society, a broad streak of tongue in cheek humour runs throughout.

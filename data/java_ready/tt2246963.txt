###BREAK###
Shot in the direct cinema tradition, Roy: Dream Catcher is a profile of an aging, cantankerous collector with a larger than life personality who left his home and wife and came west to live by his own rules in the Land of Enchantment. Now, some 30 years later, with a possible reconciliation with his ex-wife on the horizon, he is forced to pack his books, records and ephemera and confront his past decisions.

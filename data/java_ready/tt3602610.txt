CreateLIFE
###BREAK###
120 elderly people, living in 5 different structures, decide to get out from their nursing home and meet the territory in the createLIFE project, that lasts 3 years and ends with a public exhibition. Forgetting art as a merely aesthetic product, the works of art created and exposed are the final outcome of a long and intense creative process focused on the dialog between elderly people and society. This is the documentary telling the story.

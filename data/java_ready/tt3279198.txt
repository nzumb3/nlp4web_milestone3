Bedevil
###BREAK###
After winning a landmark Supreme Court case upholding religious freedom, High Priestess Darla Wynn became the target of relentless persecution. Enduring 9 years of oppression- having her life threatened, her pets murdered, and forced to live as a heavily-armed shut in- Darla finally gets her teeth back. This is the story of the witch of Great Falls, SC, beaten but unbroken by the demons that possess the sleepy southern town.

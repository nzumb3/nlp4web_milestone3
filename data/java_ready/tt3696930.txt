This project is a full feature historical fiction film set in St. Augustine, Florida in the early 1700s. The all volunteer cast and crew are based out of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and began the project as students at Louisiana State University. The story promotes the values of determination and loyalty, with a strong female protagonist who exemplifies what it means to be courageous and strong-minded. With a narrative sprinkled with history, the family-friendly film strives to teach facts while entertaining and engaging the audience. The project was truly one of passion for the cast and crew, who all worked together on a volunteer basis to make this film happen.

When D'arc gives royal Chrysaintian daughter, Cagin, an amulet binding their souls together, his forbidden Garlach heritage is discovered. Now with D'arc's exile, the unexpected death of her father, Garlach attacks, and the influence of prophet Elisha upon her, Cagin must above all else marry the new Chrysaintian King. As D'arc is released from exile, their love could be dangerously rekindled. Cagin struggles to relinquish her love for D'arc by looking to her unfailing Christian faith for the sake of her crown. This leads to those around her to wonder- could her broken heart save a falling kingdom?

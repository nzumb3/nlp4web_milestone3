The Condor's Shadow
###BREAK###
A year-in-the-life journey through endangered species recovery, this beautifully shot film follows passionate field biologist Joseph Brandt to reveal the realities of bringing the iconic California condor back from the brink of extinction. Filmed in the rugged California habitat of the condor, the film interweaves scenes of the extreme lengths that biologists will take to reestablish a self-sustaining wild condor population with insights from conservations, scientists, zoo keepers and hunters to explore the dilemma of the very first recovery program to be executed after the passage of the Endangered Species Act. It's a mission tasked to biologists but fundamentally wrapped up in public policy - revealing the true challenge of environmental sustainability - that place where human preferences clash with the goal of renewal.

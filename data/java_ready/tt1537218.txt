Brush with Life: The Art of Being Edward Biberman
###BREAK###
Edward Biberman's groundbreaking depictions of Southern California's haunting urban beauty are today more powerful than ever, as is his determination to live by the same high standard he set for his art. Moving from youthful struggles as he traveled from Paris, to New York, to the American West, Brush With Life illuminates Biberman's growing commitment to social justice, a progressive patriotism through WWII and the McCarthy-era (when Edward's brother, Herbert Biberman, went to prison as one of The Hollywood Ten), and the growth of a singular artistic vision. With epic scope, remarkable characters, and breathtaking paintings, Brush With Life encompasses one man's inspiring efforts to create a loving family life and a body of work that still dazzles. It's an unforgettable journey, an overdue tribute to a brilliant artist, and a rare glimpse into the heart of a deeply humane man.

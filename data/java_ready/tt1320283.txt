###BREAK###
Broadcast on Novermber 4th, the day of the US Presidential election, Mr Firth Goes to Washington is an SBS election special about how Charles Firth goes to Washington and manages to score an exclusive meeting with President George Bush. Along the way he explores the relationship between politics and Hollywood in America, realizing that much of American politics has been "Hollywoodised" and is nowadays based on pure fiction. Part documentary, part mockumentary, part docudrama, Firth claims he has developed a new genre of television. The show provides a comprehensive lack-of-analysis about the 2008 Presidential elections.

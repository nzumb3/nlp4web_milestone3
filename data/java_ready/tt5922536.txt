This is a musical film featuring a multi-instrumentalist/Singer name Dolphin. In this film, he's displaying his guitar skills in a live set he calls 'IOTA'. A collection of 9 songs composed in his head and never physically played them aloud until the night of the shoot. Between songs, there are brief interviews to give insight on the mysterious man behind the guitar. The vibe of this film has a gritty feel and is guaranteed to deliver great musicianship by Dolphin.

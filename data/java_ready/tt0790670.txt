That evening was supposed to be fun. Five of them wanted to celebrate Thomas's birthday; they wanted to go to the house where they met for the first time 12 years ago and remember the best days of their lives... Many things will happen there that weren't supposed to. Michael is still in that house. He knows Julia, Peter and Thomas from the moment they moved in. On this evening friends will meet him again and that will change their lives, because... well because Michael is las six years... dead.

In Search of Meluhha
###BREAK###
In Search of Meluhha: The Story of Mohenjodaro frames the 7000 years old Indus Valley Civilization within the current regional context. Recent Indus floods have highlighted the precarious nature of the Indus river delta while new research has shown that the Indus civilization existed on a 'Goldilocks moment'. With the thawing of tensions between India and Pakistan, In Search of Meluhha is the kind of a Goldilocks project that presents a view of history irrespective of nationalist or religious identity. In Search of Meluhha begins with pastoral visuals that take the audiences to the flood plains of the river Indus. The narrative is then driven by discerning conversations that articulate the interviewee's relation to the ancient civilization and the stirring effect it has had on their identity as artists, artisans and activists. The narrative is apolitical but captures emotive vignettes from the likes of Sobho Gianchandani, a revolutionary Sindhi activist called 'The Man from Mohenjodaro' by Rabindranath Tagore, Attiya Dawood a feminist poet and playwright, Suahee Abro an Indian classical dancer who practices Bharatanatyam in Karachi and Meeral Abro a soil conservationist and local artisan from the Mohenjodaro village. In Search of Meluhha presents an opportunity to experience the remnants of a unique civilization and to leverage our combined human experience.

e-Virus
###BREAK###
The CIA is tasked with keeping the United States one step ahead of any opposing military technology. While stealth and drone technology have dominated the battlefield, the enemy has constantly engineered equivalent weapons. But, now the CIA has developed a revolutionary type of warfare. It is called e-Virus which is considered a hybrid electronic virus because it contains deadly biological data. This unique quality has made e-Virus exceptionally remarkable because it is delivered electronically via smart technology through the use of a text, e-mail or any other form of electronic communication. e-Virus can infect any human or animal but does not kill them unless they are the target and also makes anyone who has been infected a carrier. The film's protagonist is a brilliant computer engineer, by the name of Michael Crane, who has taken on the project's final stage and has proven that e-Virus is now fully operational. But, when secrecy is paramount over loyalty, Michael Crane is now fighting a battle to merely stay alive. The same people who hired him now want him dead to preserve the classified nature of e-Virus. Will he find a way to survive?

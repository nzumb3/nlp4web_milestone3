The film is about Joy, Deb and Ananda. While Joy is a struggling actor and conducts workshops, Ananda works in an I.T. company and Deb is an actor. Joy's wife who is a fashion photographer runs the entire show as Joy hardly earns any money, Ananda's wife is a housewife and Deb is forever willing to sleep around with whoever catches his eye (in fact a new girl every day). However barring Deb, the rest of the couples don't share any intimacy at all.

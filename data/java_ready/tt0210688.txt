Fortune Cookie
###BREAK###
Three very different dating couples end up in the same late Chinese restaurant where a seer gives each diner a personalized fortune. A teen geek is dining with a blond cheerleader, who is there only to make her boy friend jealous. Her independent-minded mother is also there with her long-time beau, who is trying to gather his nerve to propose. The geek's older sister is also there with a DJ whom she met at a book club. All of the individuals are shown to have flaws and assets, which makes for a well-rounded story and good insights into relation's expectations of males and females today.

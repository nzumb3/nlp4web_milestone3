What started as a silly idea for a movie has become a reality. When director, Stephen Ihli, pitched the idea to Producer, Eric Small, it seemed like an impossibly wacky idea that no one would take seriously. A month later, two Olympic athletes were JumpRopeSprinting and a college track team was incorporating the JumpRopeSprint into their workouts. A new sport was born and it was all happening in front of the camera.

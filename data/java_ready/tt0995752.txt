Tashan
###BREAK###
What happens when you throw two guys who hate each other together. A cool call center executive Jimmy Cliff (Saif Ali Khan), a desi wannabe gangster Bachchan Pande (Akshay Kumar) add for good measure a beautiful girl Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) who cant be trusted - on a journey across spectacular India - a journey which will alter the course of their lives in more ways than one - a journey where even enemies need to trust each other if they want to stay alive. Trouble is, in this world no one can be trusted ever. And to top it all there is the evil eye of Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor - Slumdog Millionaire and 24), maverick gangster who enjoys killing people as much as he enjoys learning to speak English.

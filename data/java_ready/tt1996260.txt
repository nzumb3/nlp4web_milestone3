First World Problems
###BREAK###
Los Angeles, California: People Persons, mega-movie star, is having issues with his current Godlike fame status. He calls on his old friend, Sherman Firecracker, to help him get back to his normal self and try to shed his huge ego. San Francisco, California: After repeated film and theatrical production failures (The Color Purple "On ICE" , The Killing Fields: Cirque du Soleil edition) Sherman Firecracker turns to his best friend for help on his latest project - the most famous up and coming movie star, People Persons. They agree to make an indie film together without Hollywood influence in San Francisco, but when the cameras start rolling we see that People Persons is having a VERY hard time telling the difference between reality and the film itself. As cast members start to die, and the film crew begin to disappear, Sherman loses control and fears for his life. The cast and crew begin to slowly become infected by People Person's ego and fame...literally! Or is this just all part of the movie? Is this real, or just part of the reel?

Innuendo
###BREAK###
A single mother trying to rekindle her relationship with her teenage son, a failed writer trying to revive his creativity and a group of friends trying to revive an unexpected situation form the crust of the film. This film is an introspective take on life the way it is. It's about communication issues, creative obsession & self destructive motives.

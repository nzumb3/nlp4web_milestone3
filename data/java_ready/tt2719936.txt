###BREAK###
A street tale of redemption through the power of a spiritual awakening. Dave finds such an escape in a negative way by following the evils of the streets and yet confronted with the positive love of God. Dave must face the pressure of the streets and turning his life around and making a decision on whether to except Christ as he attempts to turn his life around. We often hurt those we love the most. Sometimes it is doing the right thing that takes so much courage.

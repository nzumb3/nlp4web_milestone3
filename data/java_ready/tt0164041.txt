Thinking his relationship with Jill is over Sanjay goes on the prowl and is easily able to score with two different women over the next two days. He mentions his conquests during a drunken evening with his friends and they persuade him to attempt to become 'The Guru' by sleeping with different women on each of the remaining five nights before Jill's return. Reluctantly, Sanjay agrees to undertake the challenge without realizing the possible consequences.

Subvaloradas, sin ser vistas. Voces literarias de Guinea Ecuatorial
###BREAK###
Equatorial Guinea is the third largest oil producer of Africa south of the Sahara and the only country with Spanish as official language. Neither publishing houses nor libraries exist within the country. Government doesn't show any interest for art and culture. This documentary shows how the population, especially the intellectuals, stays isolated and lives under difficult conditions.

Mayan Renaissance
###BREAK###
Feature length film which documents the glory of the ancient Maya civilization, the Spanish conquest in 1519, five hundred years of oppression, and the courageous fight of the Maya to reclaim their voice and determine their own future, in Guatemala and throughout Central America. This elegant, beautiful, and thought provoking film will share their vision for the future, their call for a long-foretold renaissance of Maya culture and wisdom, and their 100 year plan to lead humanity forward, from the year 2012 on. The film stars 1992 Nobel Peace Laureate and Maya leader Rigoberta Menchu Tum. All of the images, voices, expert commentary and music in the film come directly from Central America, from the heart of the Mayan world.

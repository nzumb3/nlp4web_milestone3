Santa's Summer House
###BREAK###
A group of six lost tourists and their van driver find their way to an elegant hilltop mansion where they are invited to stay for the weekend by an eccentric and overly cheerful middle-aged couple who introduce themselves as Nanna and Pop. They soon reveal themselves as the actual Santa Claus and his wife whom spend their summers away from the North Pole at their summer house in southern California. Everyone, except for teenager Andy, who is dealing with his bickering and workaholic parents, Dean and Sadie, is skeptic to Nanna and Pop's claims. During the weekend, Nanna and Pop try to open up their guests to brightness and positively to better their lives to find the true meaning of happiness.

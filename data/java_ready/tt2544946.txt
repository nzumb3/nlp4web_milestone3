Cento Storie Italiane di Meno
###BREAK###
The documentary is a social criticism to the lethargic state of contemporary Italian culture, as it slowly suffocated under mass-media's heavy hand. There are few intellectuals who have strived to face the television device as an equal, bending it to their own expression. Among them are Carmelo Bene and Pier Paolo Pasolini. Their interviews on consumerism and mass culture, anticipating the anthropological change of Italian society, are more relevant today than 40 years ago. These authors are echoed by contemporary artists such as the songwriter Marco Castoldi, Pier Paolo Capovilla, and director/poet Silvano Agosti. As an ensemble, the documentary paints a revealing narrative to the role of culture in post-war Italy to a non-Italian public, victim of the political cliche and stereotypes.

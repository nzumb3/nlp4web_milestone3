Charlie's Party
###BREAK###
'Charlie's Party' is a sexually charged comedy about a group of friends from college coerced into reuniting for a 'partner-swapping' weekend by their former ringleader, the formidable Charlie. The film is both a frank and funny look at modern sexual relations, while at the same time exploring the emptiness and dissatisfaction of a group of young urbanites realizing they're not where they wanted to be.

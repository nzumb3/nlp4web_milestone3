Motherland: Tales of Wonder
###BREAK###
This film casts a curious and critical eye at North American discourses about motherhood since the 1950s. Through conversations with seven mothers, a selection of archival footage and stills from the 1950s, as well as some home movies, this film offers new ways of thinking about what it means to be a good mom.

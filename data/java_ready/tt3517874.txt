Fool's Gold: California Roadtrip in an Election Year
###BREAK###
An experimental documentary that explores the theme of greed and envy through popular legends and stories of the livelihood and moral fiber of a once wealthy, small, and rural American community of Trona California; after a corporate layoff and its ensuing exodus. We are subjected to the effect of progress and social responsibility upon nature and humankind. Historic facts spanning the Gold Rush, the 1980's, and today's housing crisis; combine with stories from Trona California's remaining elderly townsfolk, and comments by Dr. Theodore Dimon and the curators of M/F Horror Gallery. Landscape footage, live action of the story of the first murder, Cain & Abel, dancing Zombie from Michael Jackson's THRILLER form composite imagery; to make for an atmospheric piece that contemplates 'work' and the human condition.

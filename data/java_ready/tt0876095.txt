The Blueberry War
###BREAK###
The Blueberry War is an underdog story about some underprivileged berry pickers getting cheated off their money, taking justice into their own hands. Two young Polish guys take the initiative to take the berries back and under their run away trough the rural Sweden they meet a country that is much different from the official picture. This is a story on two levels. On the upper level there is illegal hunting, intrigues and political dribbling with stocks, fake deal and plans how to get the fingers on a 5 million Euro subsidy. On the lower level in the story, we have the berry pickers who, allied with some of the locals, start the quest of finding both the treasure, the kingdom and getting a delightful revenge. And all that's available is a ton of rotten blueberries.

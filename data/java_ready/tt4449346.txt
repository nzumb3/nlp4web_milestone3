During the summer of 2012, a reality show called, "Millionaire $oulmate" was well underway before production was abruptly and inexplicably halted. The truth as to why the show was never released and aired by the network was ultimately hidden and classified as incomprehensible. But now, against the instructions of government authorities, the producers of this "lost footage" are making the accounts of this horrific discovery available to the public. *** WARNING: Some of the images contained herein may be disturbing. ***

Kama Sutra for a Dead Girl
###BREAK###
Austin finds a copy of the Kama Sutra on a grave, and the quest to find the joker who put it there begins. He recruits two strangers for help, but with a suicide fresh in their memories, the three can only handle the dark topics with equal parts whimsy and gravitas. An improvised feature film shot entirely on the iPhone 6s

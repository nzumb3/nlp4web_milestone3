All the Wrong Faces
###BREAK###
"All The Wrong Faces" is a dark romantic comedy, an anti-love story about looking for love. Our hero is baptized in heartbreak and enters the world of single urban twenty-somethings shocked to find gender roles reversed. He fumbles through attempts at relationships only to cling to a vulnerable beauty that becomes the instrument of his own destruction. Be careful what you wish for.

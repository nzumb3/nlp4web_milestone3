Dark Side of the Moon; an Interpretation
###BREAK###
Set to the music of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, a man from space transports himself and his younger brother to a new world for observing. Once they arrive, however, they are captures by masked officers who later force the two space men into their extremist socialist society. The space man proceeds to formulate an escape via a rocket ship, but after his plans are destroyed by the officers, the space man comes face to face with the extremities of the environment he's in, prompting his brains to explode.

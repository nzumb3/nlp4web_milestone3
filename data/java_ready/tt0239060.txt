Ik ook van jou
###BREAK###
While camping in France, Dutch friends Eric and Eddy fall in with two women. Eric talks to Silke, a Ugandan studying medicine in Holland. She tells him about her life and asks about the book he's writing: it's the story of his love affair with Reza. He tells her the story and we see it in flashbacks: Reza explodes into his boring life, she's unpredictable, their relationship becomes intense. She moves in with him, pushes him to write instead of studying law, then jealousy and fits of bizarre self-destruction become part of her quixotic moods. How does Eric's story end?

F4L: Friends 4 Life
###BREAK###
Friends 4 Life is not just a title, but a truth. Kevin and Michael have been friends since Kindergarten or 2nd grade depending on who you ask. Nothing can separate them, or can it? With humor that will make you laugh out loud, Friends 4 Life is a new type of Romantic Comedy, with a hint of Thriller and a side of Horror. A must see film that will have you laughing and screaming at the same time. When it comes to your best friend, do you know them as well as you think, or is there a darkness hiding inside of them waiting to be unleashed?

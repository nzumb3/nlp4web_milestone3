You'll be a Man...
###BREAK###
What is a man...and what does he do?' is the question that begins '...You'll be a Man...' (YBAM), an exploration into Black male identity and development from the perspectives of Black men of varying ages and walks of life. YBAM explores identity formation, education, and the importance of rites of passage for Black men. In an attempt to define manhood as more than the maturation of youth to citizen-worker, consumer, and baby-daddy, YBAM leads a conversation that explores topics as broad as health and personal authenticity, fatherhood, spirit and god, and women, sex, and relationships, in order to redefine our notions of manhood while developing a living moving primer to help youth and the community at large construct functional conduct and optimal choice making.

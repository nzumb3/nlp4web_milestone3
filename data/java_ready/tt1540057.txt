The Renegades: A Beep Ball Story
###BREAK###
The film follows a team of athletes from Boston who are blind. They play an exciting form of modified baseball called 'beep ball'. The game is played around the world. We follow the Renegades as they play tournaments throughout the US culminating with a World Series in Houston. Each player has a story to tell about their blindness. Can a particular player make the team? Will another player finally score his first run in 7 years? Can a female player compete? Can Boston finally beat New York after years of futility? Will the Renegades win the World Series? Are they playing to win or just playing to play? It's not just a sports movie, it's a dynamic emotional roller coaster.

The Nothing
###BREAK###
THE NOTHING tells the story of Ren Dubbin, a man struggling to reconcile his spiritual convictions with his crippling fear of the unknown. He awakes to find himself in an eerie, ramshackle barn with four strangers. The men have no idea where they are, and no memory of how they got there. The mystery turns to desperation when they open the doors to find the barn floating in an endless expanse of emptiness and total darkness. Nothing. The oppressive nothingness outside and bizarre events inside bring to light the men's deepest fears, doubts, failings, and beliefs. When their situation appears to grow hopeless, the men turn to reflections on life and death, faith, God and- ultimately- the afterlife.

Blood & Oil: The Search for a Future Driver
###BREAK###
'So you want to be a race car driver?' Many children play with toy cars dreaming that one day they will become a professional driver and race for a living. But most loose this dream and resign themselves to a life driving home in rush hour. Blood and Oil follows 38 young drivers who have battled to keep that dream alive. Faced with the opportunity to win a fully paid scholarship to race in the Jim Russell Championship, a Formula 3 series, which grooms the competitors for the rigors of the professional world, the fight is on to prove who will be a Future Driver. Over the five days there are: tears and tantrums, joy and relief, spins and crashes, two winners and thirty-six losers.

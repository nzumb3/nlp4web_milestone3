Echoes
###BREAK###
Dave Hidie is a troubled man. Seeking closure and peace of mind following the trauma of family bereavement, he and his wife have tried to move on. New home, new job, new friends. Everything should be coming together - if not for the visions, the voices...and the feeling that someone, somewhere, is trying to tell Dave something...something that will have shatteringly life changing effect. Dave is is experiencing the echoes of something deep and dark that should, perhaps, be left well alone.

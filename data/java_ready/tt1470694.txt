Lost Road of the Popes: Via Papale
###BREAK###
Beginning with a city in ruin, the Pope under arrest, and Catholicism under siege, "The Lost Road of the Popes Via Papale" is the untold story of the "lost" road on which 16th century Rome - and its Church - made the most profound urban and religious comeback in history. In little more than a lifetime, fueled by their faith, wealth and mission, we follow the lives of six powerful Popes and their family dynasties - and how they take on the task of first rebuilding, then glorifying, the new Rome. They have separate agendas, separate allegiances, and separate fortunes, but one thing in common: the need to rebuild the Faith along Rome's most visible, important address: along the "road of the Popes" and route of Papal processions, known as the Via Papale. The Lost Road of the Popes unfolds the miracle of this remarkable renaissance. How Rome and its Papal rulers not only survived, but were inspired by a Holy road to create the magnificent monuments, churches, art and architecture that helped to glorify and save the Catholic Church. And why that once powerful road has been...forgotten.

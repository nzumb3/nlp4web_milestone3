Addiction
###BREAK###
Addiction is the story of a young businessman, happily married to a sweet, understanding woman. After accidentally killing a mugger in self-defense, he is caught up in a flood of emotions he doesn't understand...rage, excitement, joy, even lust. This need soon blossoms into desire, desperation and then total dependence, a desperate rush that he cannot live without. And as he slowly alienates himself from his friends, his job, and the only woman who truly loves him, the downward spiral of his life takes hold, and he soon finds he is no better off than the heroin junkies chasing ever-more-elusive highs in dark alleys and forgotten hallways. Murder becomes his passion. His obsession. His compulsion. His Addiction.

Writer's Block
###BREAK###
"Writer's Block" explores the heated conflict between graffiti as urban art form and criminal act. The film moves between the worlds of anti-graffiti community activists, law enforcement officials, and graffiti writers in Boston and New York. With a nod to graffiti's historical roots in hip hop culture, "Writer's Block" captures the ongoing battle over graffiti's place in contemporary society. The film examines the complex culture of graffiti writers as outsider artists both at odds and immersed in the cities in which they work. At the same time, moving from city walls to City Hall, community activists and law enforcement officials fight against the spread of graffiti. Meanwhile, city workers attempt to maintain control over public and private property as graffiti writers assert their need for free expression.

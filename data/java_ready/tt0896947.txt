His father then trades the animals in the nearest village for the things they need to survive in the wilderness. Marek needs to stay in hiding since it is a war and, if found, he would risk being recruited in the army. His father wouldn't survive on his own. But then one day, an unexpected catch awaits Marek in one of his traps...

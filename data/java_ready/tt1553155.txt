Pawn Takes Queen
###BREAK###
Christopher Thompson, 23 years old, has a good life. He has a family, a girl, a home. He has memories of a happy childhood and the presence seems to be as fulfilling as he always wished it to be. But now and then uneasiness takes hold of him, a feeling he can't quite identify. More and more this feeling creeps into his life and dreams. Dark thoughts, restless nights. What could it be, what is wrong with his life that seems to be so peaceful? What's about this numbness that lies over the light of day like mist? He tries to ignore it. Until at last, by accident, the reason presents itself to him, and drives him insane.

Legion: Patria Nostra
###BREAK###
The Legion is our Homeland, Honour and Fidelity or French by Spilled Blood, rather than by blood received - those are mottos of the French Foreign Legion, where a number of Czech soldiers have served. Some of them speak up in the film about reasons that led them to join in, and describe often different experience serving to France and its interests. Major part of the film includes amateur video recordings and private photographs of modern legionnaires.

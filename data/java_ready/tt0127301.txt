The Sterilization of Leilani Muir
###BREAK###
This film deals with one woman's attempt to sue the government of the Canadian province of Alberta for sterilizing her against her will because she was considered a "mental defective". In short, she was a victim of a government policy that followed quack medical theories about eugenics in a manner that differed for the methods of Nazi Germany only by degree.

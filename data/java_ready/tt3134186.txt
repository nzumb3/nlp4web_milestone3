Choeurs en exil
###BREAK###
In order to pass on an ancestral heritage, Aram and Virginia, an Armenian couple from the diaspora, take a troupe of young European actors of the Wroclaw Grotowski Institute on an initiatory journey to the places in Anatolia where this art once flourished. Along the way, their questioning revives the wealth of an eradicated culture, and singing and theater become the languages of creation and sharing, a breath of life.

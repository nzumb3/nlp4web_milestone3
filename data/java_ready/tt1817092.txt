At Dawn
###BREAK###
Keltoum and her husband, Omar, live in a village in the heart of the Moroccan mountains. They are both actors, but do not have much work and have been dreaming of staging a play for years. Keltoum is sick and Omar takes her regularly to Tangiers to be treated. While there, he searches for a theatre for their play and also visits his daughter. Starting at dawn, 'At Dawn' portrays one of these trips, in which we meet the characters in the morning and meet up with them again in the afternoon on their way back home.

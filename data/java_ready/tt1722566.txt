Home Out of Nothing
###BREAK###
HOME OUT OF NOTHING traces the experiences of three women immigrants to Canada coming from very different parts of the world, including the filmmaker's transition from her Russian homeland to Canada in the early 1990's. Unable to leave Russia legally her husband defected in 1991 and Marina was able to follow three years later. Reflecting on the adjustments made by immigrants and how they overcome the shock of fundamental differences in cultural assumptions and values, the film follows their successes and regrets in a strange land with candour and honesty.

###BREAK###
Follow Me on Dead Media is the result of a study into an unexpected tendency: While the digital media has become omnipresent in the contemporary society, why some people and subcultures turn to analog media instead? According to this research-oriented documentary, this phenomenon cannot be explained simply through nostalgia but rather it seems that the analog media offers a new creative space in a world dominated by digital media. Insights are offered from an unlikely context: alternative skateboarding scene in Helsinki.

Brooklyn Girls Fight Club
###BREAK###
In the heart of Brownsville, Brooklyn, 100 or so young men and women from the surrounding housing projects gather inside a secret windowless garage. In the center is a brightly lit boxing ring stained with dried blood from a previous fight. Standing in the ring, two women dressed in regular street clothes and wearing martial arts training gloves are punching air preparing to not just fight, but brawl - bringing all of the despair and violence that surrounds their lives into the ring. No grabbing. No kicking. No scratching. No hair pulling. No biting. Three rounds. Ninety seconds a round. This is Brooklyn Girls Fight Club and the winnings are $1000 cash and invaluable street cred.

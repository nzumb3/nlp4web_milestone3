The Middle of Nowhere
###BREAK###
After escaping from youth-prison during a fire-alarm, young MAREK hitch-hikes into an unknown future. Suddenly there's a new chance: He 'gets' a car, a passport, a ticket to Australia and switches into a new identity. After the car breaks down, he is stuck at a filling station close to a very small village in former East Germany where he meets Margot. There are many problems to solve if he wants to continue his trip - maybe with his new love.

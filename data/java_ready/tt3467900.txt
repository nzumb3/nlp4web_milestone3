Kings, Queens, & In-Betweens
###BREAK###
KINGS, QUEENS, & IN-BETWEENS is a documentary drag queens and kings in Columbus, Ohio. Through the appealing stories of seven main drag performers, KQIB gives rare insight into an underground community and captures how a midwestern city full of terrific performers tackles the complexities and pathos of gender expression, personal identity, and human rights--all with humor, great music, big hair, and duct tape. Continuing the conversation started by the groundbreaking 'Paris Is Burning,' KINGS, QUEENS, & IN-BETWEENS is the first film to include the entire gender performance spectrum: kings, queens, and transgender performers.

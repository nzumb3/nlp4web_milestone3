###BREAK###
Cactus Jack: Lone Star on Capitol Hill reveals the rollicking saga of one of the most powerful but often forgotten figures in U.S. history: John Nance "Cactus Jack" Garner (1868-1967). The documentary charts Garner's extraordinary life, from his humble roots in Blossom Prairie, Texas, to his 38-year tenure on Capitol Hill where he wielded power as Speaker of the House during the darkest days of the Great Depression. Garner ran as a presidential candidate at the 1932 Democratic Convention and twice served as vice president to Franklin D. Roosevelt. Cactus Jack offers insights into this brazen political dealmaker who helped reshape the Democratic Party and push through New Deal legislation. Cactus Jack: Lone Star on Capitol Hill opens new chapters in U.S. history-and provides vital clues to the way our nation does business today.

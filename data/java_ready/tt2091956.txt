###BREAK###
A film about seven kids breaking into their high school. What starts as a poorly planned film school submission turns into a reality check. With free reign of the campus and a set of master keys, unlikely interactions occur and secrets become harder to hide. Drake, a young high school filmmaker, gathers his schoolmates to make a movie. Breaking onto the campus after hours, his cast consists of Tim, his best friend and fellow filmmaker, Ellen, a quiet bookworm, Carly, a gossiping cheerleader, Michaela, an intellectual loaner, Sean, a basketball star and Sully, a drug dealing loud mouth. Inspired by, "The Breakfast Club," Drake drags his players through the scenes of his "masterpiece," while off camera the cast explores their relationships, stereotypes, drug addictions and sexual identities. Each, involved in the film for their own reasons, divulge a reality never intended for the camera.

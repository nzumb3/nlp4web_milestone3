Saharan Diary
###BREAK###
The story follows a group of unlikely travellers as they travel overland to the Sahara. Along their route they learn as much about themselves as the people they meet. Set against incredible landscapes in Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria and Libya, yet shot upon consumer video cameras, this documentary shows the Sahara in a way that is rarely depicted onscreen.

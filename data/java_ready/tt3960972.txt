The King Sun: John Olsen a Portrait at 85
###BREAK###
In March 2013, John Olsen, one of Australia's greatest living artists, embarks on the second largest mural of his career. He is 85 years old. We follow the progress of John Olsen's mural The King Sun from the arrival of the 8 blank panels to the transportation, delivery and installation of the giant painting in the Collins Square development in Melbourne. On one level the film is a record of a great Australian at work on possibly his final mural. On another level, the film is a poem to joy, and the wisdom that can arrive at a later time of life. This film is an uplifting experience of a life in art, and a refection on mortality, optimism and happiness. The film is narrated by Olsen's flow of consciousness and thoughts which are woven throughout the structure. However, Olsen's own mortality is in question. He has already had a stroke and open-heart surgery. He needs an assistant to hold his hand and support him while he paints. He becomes very tired and needs to sit often to rest. At one point John suffers a blackout and is taken to hospital to have a pacemaker fitted. After a period of convalescing, he decides it is time to sign the painting and declare it finished.

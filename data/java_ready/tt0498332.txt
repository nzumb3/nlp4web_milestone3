Camjackers
###BREAK###
" It's cool man. We've got black friends..." Two rich, clueless film school grads ("the Filmfakers") are shooting a modernized "ghetto" interpretation of an ancient Greek play on the mean streets of Los Angeles. Their equipment is "borrowed" by three street youths ("the Camjackers"), who shoot a compelling documentary on underground hip hop. The Filmfakers rip off the Camjackers' film and rise to fame and fortune. The Camjackers see their stolen work on TV and seek revenge.

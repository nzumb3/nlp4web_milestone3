New Low
###BREAK###
The worst thing about Wendell (Adam Bowers) isn't his slightly balding head, skinny frame, or thin lips; it's that he's a bit of an idiot. He just started dating Vicky (Jayme Ratzer), an angry drunk, who conveniently shares his lack of ambition and cleanliness. But he might prefer a relationship with Joanna (Valerie Jones) because she's a selfless social worker who doesn't have lip acne. Eventually, Wendell is going to have to decide who he really belongs with: the best girl he's ever known-or the worst.

Changing Keys: Billy McLaughlin and the Mysteries of Dystonia
###BREAK###
Minneapolis native Billy McLaughlin astounded audiences with his innovative guitar technique and composing style. In the late 1990s he began to lose control of his hand and arm and was soon unable to play his own music. Many thought his career was over when he was diagnosed with focal dystonia, an incurable neuromuscular disorder. Billy had other ideas: He began the arduous task of retraining himself to play left-handed, one note at a time. Suzanne Jurva followed McLaughlin during these years. Through her eyes, we witness his miraculous and inspiring story.

Kanyaka Talkies
###BREAK###
Kuyyali is a sleepy hillside village where stands Kanyaka Talkies, a twenty year old movie theatre, whose mainstay was screening of soft porn films. When the owner of the theater, Yakoob, faces many tragedies in his personal life, one after the other, he decides to bid adieu to Kuyyali, and give up Kanyaka. Upon leaving, he requests the local Christian diocese to take over the theater building and space. Diocese converts it into a church and Father Michele gets appointed as the priest of the 'newly converted' church. The church attracts a steady stream of followers and one among them is Ancy, who lives the double life of a home nurse and that of a porn 'extra'. Ancy's life is punctuated with uncanny fantasies and moments of guilt pangs which pushes her to seek solace at the church. After reaching Kuyyali Father Michele starts listening to strange voices; his attempts to stop it nearly drives him crazy. He makes some secret moves to get over the trouble, which leads to a series of events that connects Yakoob, Ancy and Father Michele as three dots of a triangle.

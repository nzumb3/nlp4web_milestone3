Three stoner buddies throw a house party that ends in flames after two thugs burn the house down. Now in debt and desperate, the three concoct a half-baked plan to rob a medical marijuana club while posing as police officers. Unfortunately, this club is secretly owned by a drug kingpin who dispatches the feared Four Horseman thugs to kill them. This pursuit sends a wave of violence across Oakland as the assassins off hippies, ninjas, naked clowns, and just about anyone who stands in their way.

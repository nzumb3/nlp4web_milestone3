Together Alone
###BREAK###
Four young men and two young women in their early Twenties spend three days sleeping and waking on the Beach with the Sunrise. They play together or drift apart alone. A mature solitary woman, who paints large abstract paintings at her studio on the Beach, passes them by. She observes the Sunrises from her rooftop. Each day she paints over the same painting, in physical performances. Each day begins with a unique Sunrise and a color Red, Green or Yellow illuminating her studio. In the absence of dialog their body language and how they huddle together or stand alone expresses their potential. It is a meditation on time and space with long wide shots and close ups of their faces at Sunrise and Sunset.

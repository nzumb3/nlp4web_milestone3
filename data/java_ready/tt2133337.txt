The Desert Chronicles
###BREAK###
Three men, three lifestories. A Spanish constructor facing bankruptcy, a 60 years old French cowboy and a Senegalese inmigrant searching for a new beginning, face life in a desolate land in South Spain: Almer√≠a, a forgotten region formerly known as the setting for major Western-film production. Their lifes are bound to the desert, a wounded land that now holds the fragile destiny of three contemporary cowboys. Both past and present, history and biography melt within the exploration of the reality of this region, where the echo of the Westerns still resonate throughout kilometers of dust and silence.

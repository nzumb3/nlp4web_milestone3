Adopted
###BREAK###
ADOPTED is delightful documentary about a very unusual cross cultural exchange! African families 'adopt' Western adults who are estranged from their own families. The film depicts the life of the three protagonists Gisela, Thelma and Ludger, their journey to their new families in Ghana and a process of anticipated closeness and inevitable misunderstandings.

Up a Creek
###BREAK###
Up a Creek is the story of misapplied flood control spending in Fort Worth, Texas. Told from the point of view of an average citizen who became a flood victim along a creek that is a tributary of the Trinity River. The video informs about the diversion of funding away from the areas of the county that flood to the expensive economic development project slated for the Trinity River Vision. The flooding backstory is punctuated by on camera interviews with concerned citizens discussing the TRV, Tarrant Regional Water District, the TIF Financing scheme, eminent domain abuse, county wide flooding, Fort Worth spending priorities, the role of the local media, and the need to increase voter turn out to prevent continuation of this billion dollar boondoggle.

Element 1
###BREAK###
To make two unrelated story lines melt together and work as one. To reconcile documentary with fiction, without resorting to docudrama, nor to mockumentary. To tell a story as old as the existence of mankind and painfully actual. The documentary line- a man's strive to save industrial artifacts threatened with destruction. The fictional line- what remains of a human being when the most vital element is taken away. The vital element- the link between the two. This is Element 1. A film that wants to undermine the assumed perceptions and the generally accepted wisdom. And to stimulate the viewer's readiness to accept the film's discovered truth through non-conventional points of view.

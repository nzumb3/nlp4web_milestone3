Hysterical Psycho
###BREAK###
This wild horror comedy is comedian Dan Fogler's (BALLS OF FURY, EUROPA REPORT) directorial debut. Thrills, kills, and laughs abound as a theater troupe of horny teenagers are murdered one by one in the woods. The group embarks on a retreat to Moon Lake and soon discovers it's the one place on Earth that holds the strongest amount of insanity-inducing lunar radiation. As the confused thespians die in droves, the survivors wonder who is the killer among them? Did the lunar radiation turn one of the actors into a blood-thirsty psychopath? This splatter-fest homage to Alfred Hitchcock is a Tribeca Film Festival breakout and features cult comedian Gilbert Gottfried (THE PROBLEM CHILD, ALADDIN) alongside Noah Bean (TV's DAMAGES) and Lennon Parham (TV's FUNNY OR DIE PRESENTS...).

Southern Makers
###BREAK###
The Southern Makers documentary highlights the vision and process of four Alabama artists: a chef, a basket maker, a quilter and a visual artist. As the nation's creative economy grows, this film explores the charm and brilliance of distinctly Southern creative impulses. This film was made possibly by the Alabama State Council on the Arts in association with the annual Southern Makers event in Montgomery.

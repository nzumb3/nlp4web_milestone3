Tipping the Scale
###BREAK###
Happy-go-lucky Malya flies through life without resistance, breezing along on her charms, never questioning her relationship with her mother, her Down Syndrome sister, or anyone else for that matter. But in one split-second everything changes, sending Malya careening off in a different direction, until she's forced to stop herself and really think for the very first time. She wonders if life isn't a scale, and all the little things that we do really do count. And maybe every word and every action is "Tipping the Scale."

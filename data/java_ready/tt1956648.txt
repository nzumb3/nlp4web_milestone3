The Chocolate Seller
###BREAK###
Mark Grantham has an extreme degree of incapacity. He's thirty three and his movement is barely enough to nudge his motorized wheelchair using his chin. He has caregivers 24/ 7, yet he devotes his life to raising money for children in third world countries...and worries he is not doing enough. This is the extraordinary tale of a man determined to live life to the full, a man who makes you rethink all that is possible despite limits life can place on you.

The tormented history of the twentieth century northern Italy feeds this major work by the writer Mario Rigoni Stern. In this final account (he died in June 2008), he takes us on a journey through the imagination of Asiago's mountain people. To man's place at the heart of nature, at the heart of war, blenched in with the writer's voice. A territory that is but a border, the ever-present fascist past, war inscribed underneath a snowy peacefulness... where man resides.

Surfari! What Dreams Are Made Of
###BREAK###
Three middle-aged men decide to learn to surf and make a movie about their adventure. Their ultimate goal: catching a wave in Hawaii. But following their dream turns out to be much harder than the pros make it look on TV. The crew of friends and co-workers, including a first-time instructor, gather to teach the newbies and record their efforts. From the frigid waters of Northern California to the tropical shores of Maui, "Surfari!" documents their trials, tribulations, and successes as they tackle both the surf and personal obstacles on their way to living the dream. "Surfari!" boasts an all-original soundtrack backing the mix of interviews, surf education, and in-the-water drama of this often comedic adventure. From endless paddling, to a painful encounter with Hawaiian vana, to learning about "sinking a sub", "Surfari!" explores the aspects of surfing you never think of while watching the pros glide across the waves.

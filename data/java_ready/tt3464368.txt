My Uncle Gloria
###BREAK###
Most everyone would described Butch, a gruff looking, angry old Jewish man, who owned and operated auto salvage graveyards, as meaner than a junkyard dog, especially his nephew Steven, who idolized his uncle as a child long after Steven's father was killed over unpaid gambling debts. Butch was never available for any male role model support for Steven, thus letting Steven's life spiral out of control into an existence fueled by drug addiction and hatred. But at age 66, when Butch decides to undergo a sex change operation to become "the woman I always wanted to marry" it sends shock waves through his inner circle. Then everyone learns the real reason why he did it. Gloria and her female to male transgender partner Dan, challenge the notion about love and gender, and leave viewers with the message that you're never too old to be who you want to be, and by being true to yourself, you can heal old family wounds. The film includes riveting and deeply personal home videos, a tearful reconciliation with Steven after 35 years of being estranged, the sex change operation, Gloria's work as a dominatrix and a respected transgender advocate.

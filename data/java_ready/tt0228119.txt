After nine years, director Irena Pavlásková continued the theme she began with her debut Time of the Servants (1990). She returned to the character of the weakling Milan (Karel Roden), a man completely under the thumb of his manipulative wife Dana (Ivana Chýlková). In a fit of spite Milan finds himself in a psychiatric hospital and soon after enters into a complex relationship with Tána (Lucie Bílá), the doctor who is trying to help him return to normal life. In contrast to the psychological bent of her debut, Pavlásková here emphasizes the comic and socio-satirical aspects of the narrative.

It Was You Charlie
###BREAK###
IT WAS YOU CHARLIE is a dark comedy-drama that tells the story of a lonely graveyard shift doorman named ABNER, a once-accomplished sculptor and former college art teacher, but now sadly, a mere shadow of his former self. He is heartbroken because of an unresolved conflict with his brother over a woman he once loved, and is at the same time consumed with guilt and suicidal thoughts as he remains profoundly haunted a year after a terrible car accident that took the life of the young woman in the other vehicle. After meeting ZOE, a young, free-spirited taxi driver, something magical happens to Abner as he begins a quest to seek redemption, and reconcile his conflicted past.

Born in Trench Town
###BREAK###
This documentary comprises interviews and scenes of contemporary life in Trench Town. Many residents have lived there since its beginning, witnesses to the entire history. For younger generations who did not know the community before the violence started, their perceptions are markedly different. The video traverses from First to Seventh Streets through a maze of holes in the walls between tenement yards created when when it was too dangerous to walk on the streets, stopping along the way to consider the conditions that created the Trench Town of today. This small area has had a big impact on Jamaica. Its history is told by its residents, with the intention to give them a voice in conversations unfolding in the fiftieth year of Jamaica's independence.

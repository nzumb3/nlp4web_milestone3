Coming From All Sides Feature
###BREAK###
Two families face financial disaster with the mortgage crisis as the backdrop. Depicting a 24 hour period of their lives, each of the lead characters feels the pressure mounting, feeling increasingly pressured from every direction. This film tells how each family handles the crisis in very different way. The crisis mounts as the two lead characters discuss the dire nature of their respective dilemma, and each is shocked to see how similar their financial problems are. Both share their drastic 'fall back' solution to the crisis, and then each embarks on effort to keep their families, and their finances from collapsing. Starting from the same point, the two families head in entirely different directions, with entirely different results.

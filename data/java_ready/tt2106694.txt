The Girl Who Lived
###BREAK###
The Girl Who Lived is a visually stunning exploration through the lives of five young characters in war-torn Europe. Stylistically unique; the film is inspired by the true account of a young girl's survival in the Gas Chambers of Auschwitz Birkenau. The film uses ritual, mythology and fairy tale to present a dream-like journey through some of the darkest themes of human history. In a series of episodic stories, we are shown a picture of the Holocaust as a collective enterprise of persecution and extermination. The Girl Who Lived is a visceral, confronting, and emotive story, told with great beauty and dreamlike symbolism.

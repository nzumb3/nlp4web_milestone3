Punnami Nagu
###BREAK###
In order to acquire more powers for world domination, Mayadevi Bhairavi, a sorceress, holds two shape-shifting snakes in her power but is interrupted by her very own goons. As a result, the male serpent gets killed, and the female escapes. The only way Mayadevi could now acquire powers is first to locate a woman with a unique birthmark who must also be a virgin, and then lure the female serpent. The question remains - how will she find such a female, and even if she does so - how will she lure a now vigilant Nagin?

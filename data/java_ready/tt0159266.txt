###BREAK###
This documentary tells about a significant portion of Italian-Canadians were interned as "enemy aliens" during world war II. They were victims of a recurring pattern of Canadian xenophobia and bigotry that lead to the severe political persecution and imprisonment of minorities in times of war despite the lack of evidence that they posed any security threat to the nation.

Lost Creek is fantasy/drama that involves Ollie Marks who, after being tied up in a low key money laundering scam, murders his boss. Unsure what to do or where to go, he mysteriously gets an invitation to be a participant, along with three other people all on the cusp of turning 40 years old. They are to hike a mythical trail where the winner would get a chance to swim in the infamous "Lost Creek" and gain immortality. Ollie, realizing he is going on the run regardless, accepts the challenge. Soon the fantasy world he is hiking and the reality of the world he has left behind begins to violently overlap. If he is to be remembered for anything in his life, Ollie Marks finds himself in a race against time and a race against himself.

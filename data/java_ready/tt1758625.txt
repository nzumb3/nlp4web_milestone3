Hollywood
###BREAK###
Fifteen women around a man who cannot leave his house. A mixture of comedy and drama about Felix, a neurotic, depressive and agoraphobic writer, while writing a screenplay about his pathetic existence. Hollywood is about movies and life, an update, somehow ironic and indie to FELLINI's 8 and 1/2, a NINE whose only music is the water in the sink. With a style based on dialogs in the mood of Eric Rohmer or Noah Baumbach films, HOLLYWOOD faces the main character up to fifteen different types of women: the girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend, the maid, the elderly neighbor, the student... and is a touching story of love and loneliness.

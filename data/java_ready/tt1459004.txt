Svara: A Brooks Institute Documentary Project to South India
###BREAK###
Each year, the Visual Journalism program at Brooks Institute offers an international documentary trip for interested visual journalism, professional photography, and film students. The class, which is staged in a different international location each year, is limited to those applicants who demonstrate a solid understanding of visual storytelling, the ability to work independently, and who embrace their roles as ambassadors. In November and December 2008, the 20 selected students and instructor Paul Myers spent seven weeks in South India to chronicle the people, life and culture of the region. Upon their return, the students created projects to showcase their experiences from this trip, including a documentary, book, DVD, website, and print exhibitions.

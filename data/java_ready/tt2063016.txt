El coyote
###BREAK###
BAD just got WORSE! EL COYOTE is a classic good verses evil story, a traditional western, set in present day Mexico. Here corruption and violence are the norm. And the only person who could help now has to be worse than the bad guys. A wandering devil worshiping serial killer named El Coyote comes to the terrorized village of La Cruz. And so many people need killing, he becomes the hero. As the final showdown approaches, the subject of the film, the bloody reality of life in northern Mexico today, overtakes the production and tragically rewrites the script.

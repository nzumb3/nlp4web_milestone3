After the Byzantine Empire
###BREAK###
Is there a future of the Orthodox idea in the contemporary world? Can Russia, the spiritual heir of the Byzantine Empire repeat its fate? The filmmakers are seeking for the answers of these questions. They apply the metaphoric language of images and the unique documentary materials. The film was shot in Turkey and Syria, former parts of the Byzantine Empire, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Leningrad region. There're no a traditional host or an explanatory text in the film in order the viewers could become the onlookers to form their own opinion.

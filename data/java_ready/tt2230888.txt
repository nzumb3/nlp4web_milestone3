Fort Drum the First 100 Years
###BREAK###
Fort Drum: The First 100 Years tells the story of how a dusty cavalry camp in the early 1900s evolved into a modern marvel of training and efficiency for soldiers of the United States Army. Created as a national training site by President Theodore Roosevelt, Pine Camp grew into Camp Drum and ultimately became Fort Drum. Today, the base is home to the 10th Mountain Division, a premier U.S. Army unit whose troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fort Drum is one of the largest and most well-equipped military installations in the Eastern part of the United States. It is the economic engine of Northern New York and introduced cultural diversity into a previously isolated region. Over the course of a century, soldiers who trained at the legendary base have shaped the history of America and the world.

The Scrapper
###BREAK###
He was only a teen when his brother Syd took their parents lives. Fast forward years later, Robbie Hood lives a boring, safe life where chances are far and few. Rage builds and Robbie's life takes three turns: A bar brawling legend, an underground street fighter and a modern day, bank-robbing "Robin Hood". When the past comes back to haunt the young Scrapper, it'll take more than a gun to stop him.

The Modern Project
###BREAK###
"The Modern project" is about this phenomenon of the isolated group.There is no real reference to the outer world and the rules seem to be made up as they go along. It's a film about the search for the meaning of life, and people that make an honest attempt to find it, even if they have no clear direction in where to go.

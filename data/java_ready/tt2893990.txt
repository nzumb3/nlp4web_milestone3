Change: The LifeParticle Effect offers fresh philosophical and spiritual perspectives, as well as explanations found in modern physics and neuroscience that explore the connection between consciousness and matter. Leaders in the fields of education, medicine, neuroscience and spirituality such as Ilchi Lee, Neale Donald Walsch, and Stuart Hameroff, examine how the information that we hold within our brain creates our life experience, subtly impacting the world around us. Insights and techniques are offered to help achieve a neutral state, where the stresses of life can be approached from a calm, balanced state of mind, lending power to the ability to consciously tune-in and heal the deeper issues that you face in your life, ultimately creating a ripple effect of change across the world.

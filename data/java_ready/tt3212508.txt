The road for the migrants towards the USA has always been hazardous and difficult. When the war on drugs was declared in Mexico in 2006, violence quickly spiraled up, and migrants, lacking a legal status became the perfect victims. This documentary approaches the missing persons subject in this country from the psychological, social and institutional points of view. Through interviews to several players in this field, specialists and relatives of victims, a portrait of the national landscape of migration, drug traffic and violence is presented.

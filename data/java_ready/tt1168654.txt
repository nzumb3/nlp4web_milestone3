Shade of Grey
###BREAK###
Shade of Grey is woven from the intricate relationships of several characters who repeatedly find themselves in the same anonymous motel room across several years. The room bears witness to all the joy, heartache and pain that comes with their presence. As their stories are laid bare within this temporary cell, the players become forever interconnected, unknowingly staking their claim as a part of the history of this seedy intersection. It's about family, the complicated and fractured ties that exist as people try to forge that definition. It's about the overwhelmingly necessary and potentially destructive power of love. It's about rebirth and second chances, how everyone has demons shadowing their past and the past of those before them.

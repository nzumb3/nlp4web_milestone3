Roma Termini
###BREAK###
Termini station is Rome central station, where everyday thousands of people pass by: it is a modern sea dock in the middle of the cement, where faraway destinies meet for a moment and then separate again. Among all these passing people, hidden by the crowd, there is a bunch of men and women for whom the station is not a middle point of passing, but it is a place to live, eat, find money, sleep. A huge impersonal house that protects them from the cold and helps them to find a way of living with nothing. Among all these persons four stories arise, unfolding little by little from the background scenery of the station.

Mein Deudshland
###BREAK###
A love story between migrants who not only have to fight for integration in Germany, but also with the different mentality here. The focus is the friendship between the German born Turkish woman, Jack, who has gone through an arranged marriage and the African asylum seeker, Fesal, who has been threatened with de-portation. A cinematic plea for the mutual respect and recognition of cultural diversity in Germany.

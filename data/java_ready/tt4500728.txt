Severe Racing Films offers up the best sequences from their collection of past off-road films. The new film is an intense thrill ride into the sport of off-road racing, filmed at spectacular races all over the western U.S. and Mexico. This film features insane action from trucks, bikes, buggies, ATVs, UTVs and more. Severe Racing has previously released 4 off-road movies and this is the best from Scott A. Tugel, the producer, director and cinematographer. Scott has captured this sport beautifully, putting himself near the path of these powerful machines as they come tearing past. Severe Racing takes you through every turn and every jump. With this kind of action, viewers really get the feel of what it is like to be riding and racing with some of the hottest racers in off-road racing today.

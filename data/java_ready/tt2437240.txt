Lost Boys of Paradise
###BREAK###
Follow one man's real-life journey to reclaim the children of Guatemala's post-civil war slums. Nathan Hardeman, an uncommonly red-haired Guatemalan, is an unsung hero to countless boys fighting for survival in one of the world's most dangerous places -- "Paradise," Guatemala City's Zone 18. Here, most boys enter a gang by 13 years old, and most of those die from gang violence or drug abuse before they reach 23. Meet the boys, hear their stories, and see the ambitious "Engadi" project being undertaken to provide a refuge and education to boys who, as Nathan believes, will become "mighty men" who turn around Guatemala's impoverished and fatherless culture entirely. Prepare to be inspired by their boundless potential and faith. The debut film from Director/Producer and Phillip Blume, "Lost Boys of Paradise" represents a labor of love made possible by volunteers and told on behalf of the children who live and die in Zone 18.

Twenty years ago, at the age of 8, Christian witnessed the murder/suicide of his parents. We pick up his story today - Christian, now 28, has turned his traumatic past into a creative well that he can dip into at any time to become a much sought after writer and artist. Unfortunately, due to his use of illegal drugs, he walks a fine line between sanity and madness that makes his grip on reality even more tenuous. Into his life comes Beth, the new assistant editor at the Detroit Underground, the local free press paper. Beth bears a striking resemblance to Christian's mother and when they meet for the first time the walls that Christian has built around his psyche begin to crumble. Added to the mix are Beth's abusive boyfriend, Mark, and her shy, lovesick coworker, John. When all of these characters' lives intersect because of their relationship with Beth, they affect each other in ways none of them could have suspected. Christian sees in Beth the hope for a normal life but is pushed over the edge because of a combination of events that all players have a hand in. Mark falls from grace in Beth's eyes to become what she fears the most. And John sees suicide as his only option. At the center of this is Beth, unknowing catalyst to the events that unfold. The death of one man, the loss of hope for another, and the eventual redemption of a third.

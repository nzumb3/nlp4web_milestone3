Homegrown is the inspiring true story of a family "living off the grid" in the heart of urban Pasadena, California. They harvest over 6,000 pounds of produce on less than a quarter of an acre, while running a popular website that is known around the world. The film is an intimate human portrait of what it's like to live like "Little House on the Prairie" in the 21st Century.

Love
###BREAK###
'Love' is the first of a Docuseries by Maria Bartrum entitled 'Getting to the Heart of It'. This series aims to enlighten and educate viewers by asking people of all ages how they understand topics that we are always thinking and talking about with close friends but rarely share with strangers. It's an opportunity to listen in on others' thoughts, experiences, fears, hopes and dreams. The inspiration for 'Love' came from a brave teenager, a wonderful book entitled 'A General Theory of Love' and an article in the NY Times that was concerned with how we teach a generation how to love. It's a beautiful look into the souls of people you may never speak to but from which we have so much to learn.

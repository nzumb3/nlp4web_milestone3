The Blair Witch Rejects
###BREAK###
Satirizing (quite obviously) the original independent hit "The Blair Witch Project", "The Blair Witch Rejects" chronicles the misadventures of an inept Beverly Hills producer who believes she can ride the coat-tails of the original movie's success by filming a follow-up. Bankrolled by her father, she hires a documentary director, his production crew and four actors (to give the project a sexy "Scream"-like quality) in an attempt to track down evidence related to the "West Woods Witch". This witch (supposedly) fled to the forests of California and ritualistically sacrificed several Spanish settlers in the early 1700's. Rumors persist however, of campers disappearing in the woods to this very day. Events start to unravel very early on as the motley group encounter other film crews in the woods and end up getting lost themselves. Is the curse of the "West Woods Witch" for real... or something else entirely?

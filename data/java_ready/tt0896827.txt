Die Katyn LÃ¼ge
###BREAK###
This Nazi propaganda film "documents" the notorious Katyn Massacre, which took place in the Katyn Forest in Poland and in which thousands of Polish army officers, taken prisoner in the joint German/Russian invasion of Poland, were executed. The Russians said the Germans did it and the Germans said the Russians did it, but investigations completed after the war strongly suggested that it was the Russians who indeed committed the massacre.

Jools Holland: London Calling
###BREAK###
Jools Holland takes a personal look at the historical influences that have helped to create the sound of London. His journey takes him back to Roman times, and then forward through history until the present day, taking in well-known landmarks, pubs, music halls and more recent venues such as the 100 Club. Archive film footage is interspersed with contributions from performers such as Roy Hudd (comedian and music hall expert), Lucy Skeaping (of The City Waites ensemble), Eliza Carthy (folk musician), Sterling Betancourt (steelpan pioneer), Danny Baker (DJ and presenter), Ray Davies (of The Kinks rock band), Paul Jones (of the Manfred Mann pop group), Joe Brown (rock and roll singer), Suggs (of the Madness ska band), and Lisa Hannigan (Irish indie folk singer).

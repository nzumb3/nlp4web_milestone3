Auntie Lee's Meat Pies
###BREAK###
Outside the small, one-cop town of Penance, California, Auntie Lee bakes her popular meat pies, with the help of four nubile nieces and the ranch's blood-simple handyman, Larry. The source of the meat for the pies? Men who are passing through, lured to strange deaths by the nieces - Fawn, Coral, Sky, and Magnolia - who smile, show a little skin, and pretend to be playmates. Closing in on the trail of a missing man is a New York private eye, Harold Ivars; plus, the town's cop, Chief Koal, finds Larry's behavior a bit suspicious. Will the cop and the dick bring Auntie Lee's vocation to a grinding halt?

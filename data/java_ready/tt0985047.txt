Years after being shot by his eldest son Darius and taking the fall for his crimes, former gangster James "Animal" Allen serves a life sentence at Folsom Prison.

While serving his time, Animal learns that his son, James Jr., is framed for murder and the one responsible for calling the shots is on the inside. He is blackmailed and forced to return to his dark past as a fighter in order to save his son.

New Horizons: Brazil
###BREAK###
A documentary by Maine filmmaker Chas Bruns that sheds light on the lives of children living on the streets of Brazil. The film follows Maine artist John Whalley and his wife and actress Ellen Whalley as they travel to central Brazil to live and work with boys who were saved from a life on the streets by the Florida based NGO, Renaissance International. Coined "The New Horizons Youth Ranch" by founder Steve Solomon, the 150 acre tract of land has become home to over 200 children since 1991. The ranch includes home-dormitories, a dining hall, administrative offices, a chapel, classroom buildings, as well as athletic fields where the boys play soccer, volleyball, baseball and basketball. In addition, there is a pond for swimming, a nature trail complete with vines for swinging and several streams and waterfalls. The film begs the question, "Where would these children be without New Horizons Youth Ranch?"

Ladder to Damascus
###BREAK###
Ghalia is inhabited by the soul of Zeina, a girl who drowned the day she was born. Haunted by Zeina's past life, Ghalia travels to Damascus to study acting and understand her present condition. She meets Fouad an aspiring filmmaker who becomes fascinated by Ghalia's duality. He takes her under his wing and helps her find a place to live in a Damascene house, now converted into a dorm inhabited by young Syrians from different regions. Within the confines of the house and its ancient courtyard, Fouad's love for Ghalia and Zeina blossoms while the tumultuous events in Syria start unfolding in the streets around them gradually encroaches on their idyllic isolation.

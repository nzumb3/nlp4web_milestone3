A Girl and a Gun
###BREAK###
Reaching far beyond Hollywood's hypersexualized femme fatales, the film candidly explores the modern American woman through intimate portraits encompassing issues of protection, power, feminism, and violence. A Girl and A Gun is a complex and thoughtful meditation on a deadly serious issue. The intimate and graphic portrayals in A Girl and A Gun are of women who've carved themselves a home in the gun community, but their personal journeys in one way or another reflect the same issues every woman faces today.

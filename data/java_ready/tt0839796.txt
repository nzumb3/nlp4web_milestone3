The Engagement: My Phamily BBQ 2
###BREAK###
David (Andy Gershenzon) is a young man who brings his fianc√©e Mia (Tenique Mathieu) to an engagement party at his conservative Jewish parents house where they are shocked to see that Mia happens to be black. Mia and her more liberal African-American parents announce that they want a Baptist Christian wedding and soon clash with David's tradition-minded parents who have strongly discouraged him for his entire life not to date any woman outside of his race or religion. Tensions mount and cultures clash over what was supposed to be a celebration of David and Mia's decision to share their lives together by getting married.

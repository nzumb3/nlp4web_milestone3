Tales from the Spring
###BREAK###
Tales from the Spring is an historical documentary filmed in Prague, Czech Republic, and deals with the history and social influences of the Prague Spring. In the summer of 1968, the reformed Communist administration of Czechoslovakia attempted to introduce civil freedoms for its citizens, something unheard of during the previous regimes. The Soviet Unions response was a complete invasion of the country, involving nearly 250,000 Warsaw Pact troops. My film not only examines the acts of defiance and activism that rose during this period, but how current generations of Czechs are inspired to do the same against the corruption of their current government.

###BREAK###
Being female and being black in Cuba not only makes you invisible, it is also a wall where your dreams are shattered. Accompany the intimacy of a group of artists who have found with his work a hole through the wall thanks to music, word or image. Already belong to the XXI century but have managed to incorporate the rich heritage of oral tradition of their black ancestors that arrived on the island brought from Africa as slaves. Praise yourself is a tribute to these brave women who are proud of their color and their gender.

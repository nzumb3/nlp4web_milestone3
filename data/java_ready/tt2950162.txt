When C Goes with G7
###BREAK###
When a heartbroken film school graduate, an unemployed UC Berkeley MBA graduate and a junior high school student converge at the music instruments store of an aspiring musician, quirky thoughts on everything from work and education to love and life emerge against a truly catchy soundtrack. Relationships end and hopes are occasionally dashed in this episodic drama, but few could complain that this isn't a thoughtful attempt to capture the sentiments of growing up in Hong Kong as we know it today.

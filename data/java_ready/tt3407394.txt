Call for Help
###BREAK###
In the chaos of post earthquake Haiti, members of a guerrilla style relief team resort to 'the ends justify the means' approach to bringing relief. Their temporary sense of control enables them to grapple with the issues that propelled them from the US to this disaster zone. Call for Help explores the tension between pure altruism and a helper's high and the impact of their combination.

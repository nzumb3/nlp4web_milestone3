Russian Kids of Montreal
###BREAK###
Who needs the Russian language outside of Russia? Can it just be forgotten? How do Russian immigrants living in Montreal relate to their motherland? Do they want to pass the culture and traditions on to their children? The authors of "Russian Kids of Montreal" attempt to answer these questions. The result is a collective image of families that have crossed paths in the bilingual Canadian City of Montreal. The documentary addresses the problems of adaptation to a new life and the will to preserve a cultural heritage. It is a reflection on how people's self-perception evolves away from their motherland and an attempt to find an answer to the question "Who am I?"

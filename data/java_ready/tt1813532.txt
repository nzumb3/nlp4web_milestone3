Noemie Lafrance: Noir - Site Specific Choreography
###BREAK###
Lafrance first achieved major recognition in 2002 with "Descent" which was staged in the stairwell of a New York City landmark, the Clocktower Building by McKim, Mead and White. With "Noir" she takes her audience to a Lower East Side parking garage, for a dance experience based on "film noir" of the 1940's. The audience witnesses her choreography through the windshields of the parked cars.

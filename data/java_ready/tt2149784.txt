###BREAK###
A suburban cult is born... In a collage of news footage, home movies and other media, EMBRYONIC presents the story of three aimless twenty somethings who proclaim to receive communications from a supernatural being predicting the end of the world. Their cryptic prophesies turn sinister, however, when the group is linked to an unexplained missing person's case. Is there merit to their wild claims of psychedelic evolution and altered consciousness, or is it all an elaborate cover up? At precisely 11:11pm on December 21, 2012, all will be revealed.

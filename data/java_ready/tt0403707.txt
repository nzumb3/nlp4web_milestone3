Bansilal Choudhary lives a middle-classed lifestyle along with his wife and son, Karan. He works as a police inspector at the Hari Nagar Police Station and would like his son to be an IPS Officer and follow in his footsteps. Unfortunately, Karan repeatedly keeps on getting in physical altercations with other youth at the Nehru Hostel, including Vikram Kapoor and Shankar Tripathi, and as a result in trouble with the Police. Bansilal does his best to try and convince Karan to mend his ways, to no avail. On the contrary he gets information that Karan has been associating himself with a gun-runner, Iqbal Diwana and other hoodlums. Then Bansilal's world gets turned upside down when he is informed by his superiors that Karan has abducted Shikha, who is Shankar's fianc√©e and Vikram's sister - and he is instructed to arrest and bring in Karan at any and all costs.

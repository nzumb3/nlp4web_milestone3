A musical adventurer with a love of Balkan and Middle Eastern music and a passion to teach it arrived in Brisbane. Curious and interested amateur and professional musicians heard of his 'classes' and came to him as students. An open and generous teaching and learning philosophy eventually formed into an organic, elastic community where musical endeavors were encouraged and supported and the formation of different small bands playing particular genres of music under the Balkan and Middle eastern umbrella sprouted and flourished. This is a brief glimpse into the belief system and it's effects of a musically gifted and profoundly generous man existing in an alternative space to mainstream music.

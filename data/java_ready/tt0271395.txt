Beyond Vanilla
###BREAK###
Much as the title suggests, Beyond Vanilla explores the kinkier aspects of sex on the other side of vanilla. With interviews, demonstrations and a good dose of how-to instructions, this documentary covers the gamut of fetishes and SM practices. From bondage, flogging and fisting to knife play, fire and golden showers, director Claes Lilja takes us on an unforgettable journey to the wilder side of sex. Sharing fantasies, experiences and pleasures, the over 60 people interviewed in the film help to blur boundaries and shed new light on sexuality and sexual practices. Open your mind and the rest will follow...

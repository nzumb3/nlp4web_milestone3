Melody
###BREAK###
Jing Shan is not the type that Melody would fall in love at first sight, but all their friends say they look particularly alike. For a while, they begin to feel the same way. Perhaps for this reason, they become a couple. Their look, accent, and even act become similar. Melody never believes in fate; however, the first time she undresses in front of Jing Shan and finds the mole on his right shoulder, she can not help but believe in fate, because she has the same mole on her left shoulder. As to Jing Shan, he is more readily to believe in their destiny. But they are not clear that love islove is so fragile but powerful.

The Body Beautiful
###BREAK###
The "Body Beautiful" gym/spa is on the verge of bankruptcy and the female corporate raider is just itching to turn it into a high-tech spa for women. When the current holder of the Clicker flushes it down an airplane toilet, the blue ice crashes into the spa's store room where it's found by Ben and Linda who work at the spa (and are fooling around at the time). Linda discovers the Clicker's power to turn on anyone and uses it to make the place incredibly popular with the Orgasmic Workout. Soon they make enough money to pay off the bank and keep the place to themselves. Oh, and there's a lot of sex along the way.

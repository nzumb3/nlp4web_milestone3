Across the Fence
###BREAK###
This documentary film is about the long time traditions and more recent innovations of sustainable practices in ranching. Four ranching families from the Gunnison Valley on Colorado's western slope are the subjects of this picturesque film. Women, men, young, and old from these families speak of their passion for ranching and their concerns for the future. Shot over three years and several seasons in this high rocky mountain valley, Across the Fence, tells the story both visually and aurally of these families and their respect for the land and natural resources in this extremely beautiful part of Colorado. While promoting discourse among recreational users of public lands and livestock producers, Across the Fence suggests solutions through meaningful communication.

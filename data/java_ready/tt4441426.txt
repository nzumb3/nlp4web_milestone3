Ur: The End of Civilization in 90 Tableaux
###BREAK###
Shot in the south of France on a shoestring budget, Ur: The End of Civilization in 90 Tableaux tells the story of six characters in search of a zombie apocalypse. A searing insight into the decadent lifestyles of the British upper middle class, Ur follows Will, Dennis, Laura and Rosie, who have come to visit Alex and Edward in Bergerac, France. Edward loves Rosie. Alex seduces Rosie. Alex also seduces Laura. Will is having a nervous breakdown. Dennis is trying to put his life back together. Will then gets bitten when out running - and turns into a zombie. Do the others kill him or keep him? The title, Ur, means primitive and the film is shot in the primitive style of cinema's inventors, the Lumiere brothers.

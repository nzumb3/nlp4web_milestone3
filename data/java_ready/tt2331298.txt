Latinos Beyond Reel
###BREAK###
One in six adults and one in four children in the United States are Latinos, but their reality is rarely depicted in the mainstream media. Interviews with scholars, actors, filmmakers , and a group of Latino children reveal a striking pattern: in both news and entertainment, Latinos appear overwhelmingly as gangsters, drug dealers, prostitutes, maids, sexy Latinas and welfare-leeching 'illegals.' Most disturbingly, even children's games depict the killing of Mexicans. The film shows how a narrow range of misrepresentation, combined with hate speech against undocumented immigrants and Latinos, had devastating consequences for this nation as a whole.

The Sacred Broccoli Uprising
###BREAK###
Thought provoking, fast moving, and fun, this strange musical starts one hundred years ago as obscure philosopher Francis Barruth details a series of steps for humanity's next evolutionary leap. In the modern day the first step is unearthed -- a broccoli-based drug that brings joy and illuminates a new life path to those who partake. It quickly gains users world-wide. As humanity deals with broccoli's effects, will Barruth's bold evolutionary plan be driven to completion or will we simply become a planet of broccoli addicts? The Sacred Broccoli Uprising answers these questions and raises more with 10 original songs and an edgy and distinctive score in a truly unique musical drama.

Arte e stregoneria
###BREAK###
In this documentary, we enter the painter S.Giuliani's house and there we can see, for both in reality and in his paintings: gourds, brooms, black cats, fireplaces, candles, and, of course, S.Giuliani. He tells us his true story. He has been living in the forest in the old mill for around thirty years. In the late 60s, following psychedelic experiences and reading such as the Bardo Thodol text and meetings with an exorcist priest and a Tibetan Lama, S.Giuliani came to understand the mechanism of fears and found the key to destroy it: the key is his new magic way of painting, that he has pursued so far, killing his old Id and his previous way of painting (byzantine subjects and Modigliani style figures).

Thick as Thieves
###BREAK###
Kidnapping, shootouts, explosions...girlfriends. It's just another day in this house when Dave (Bob Ferguson) unleashes his crew to take down a man from his past named "Kincaid" (B.R. Smith). But when the job goes south it's up to an outsider named Rob (James Ladd) to save their skins. Brought together at the wrong place at the right time, Rob and Holsten (Brandon Michaels) form a bond thick as thieves. But joining the rest of the crew (Kelli Smith & Terri Frye) may be more than Rob bargained for. Evading romance, bar-fights, jealous boyfriends, and being kidnapped can be dangerous to your health. When Dave's lair is infiltrated, the team has to clean house and track down their friend. In the end, someone has to take the fall. The only question is who?

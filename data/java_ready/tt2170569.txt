Pumping Ercan
###BREAK###
Ercan wants to proof it to himself. After a 10 year absence from competitive bodybuilding he reaches for the heavy weight title once again. The documentary PUMPING ERCAN accompanies the 40-year-old over the course of one year during his preparations and extends far beyond bodybuilding to tell a Turkish-German life's story. The portrait of this mellow giant is not only an enthralling comeback story but also turns out to be a love story at the end.

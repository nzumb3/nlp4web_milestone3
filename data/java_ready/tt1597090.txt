Traveling around the world for 30 sleep deprived days would satisfy the appetite of most intrepid travelers, but not the host of The Amazing Race.

Last March Phil left his home in Los Angeles with his training partner, a cameraman, a former California Highway Patrolman, and his dad as the driver of the support vehicle. He set out to pedal 3500 miles in just 40 days.

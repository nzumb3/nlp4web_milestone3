AÃ±os de calle
###BREAK###
Four kids living in the streets of Buenos Aires back in 1999. How would their futures be? Shot for over ten years, this film explores three different moments in the lives of these kids, as they grow up living life like a game. As from these daily and intimate scenes, a collage is built assembling the meaning of marginality, the search for social inclusion and the look of the person behind the camera.

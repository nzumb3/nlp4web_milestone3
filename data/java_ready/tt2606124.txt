A family embarks on a journey for a weekend at a remote cabin to reconnect and revitalize the family union they lost after a tragic death. But this trip soon becomes a collective hell, where everyone is overpowered by their inner monster. The nephew is in love with his aunt, the mother can not forget her daughter and pretends nothing ever happened, and the ten year old twins are convinced the forest in which the cabin stands is haunted... What was planned as a peaceful weekend goes horribly wrong.

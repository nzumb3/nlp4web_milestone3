DF Tram & Cal-TV present The Great Movie Remix
###BREAK###
In the spring of 2013 I set about creating a 'Movie Mix' . I had done mixes with cinematic themes before. But this time I wanted to take it a step further. To mix audio,sound design,movie themes,film promos, and soundtracks into a seamless mix or 'movie'.My idea was to somehow put the films in a different context. Like a dj mix, but with movies.The result was even a surprise to me.It was like a film but with no visual aspect. I released the mix, and received a lot of nice feedback from it. The mix was subsequently heard by visual artist Cal-TV. He suggested putting together the video and clips from all the films and samples I used in the mix. I thought this was a brilliant of him to suggest it, as I was hoping for someone like him to come along and do the accompanying visuals. It turned into a true collaboration.His vision would help make my dream a reality.

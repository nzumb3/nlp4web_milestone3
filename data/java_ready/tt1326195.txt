Bicycle Lane
###BREAK###
Don is in a predicament. His car won't start and it's absolutely essential that he get across Los Angeles for a birthday party. But it's not just any birthday party. This is a party for Alli, the girl he's had a crush on for months now. After a series of failed attempts to get a ride, he's forced to ask his crazy neighbor for her car and despite the awkwardness, she is willing to help by offering him the only thing her ex-boyfriend didn't take - an embarrassingly pink beach cruiser with a basket on the front. With that Don sets off on his journey across a city where everyone drives. With the summer heat beating down on him, Don and his bike encounter apathetic friends, annoying co-workers, store clerks with too much advice, thieves, stoners and a cop with a major hero complex. Even though he's on the brink of defeat his determination kicks into over drive. He MUST get to Alli. After all, Don is a man on a mission.

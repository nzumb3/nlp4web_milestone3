Herr Schultz sets Sail
###BREAK###
House or boat? With this question Kurt Schultz confronts his family of six in 1957. After their lucky escape from the GDR they live in a flat of 590 sq ft in a temporary home among allotment gardens at Billerhuder Insel, Hamburg. Kurt Schultz is having it his way. Despite the cramped conditions they decide on building a boat - they go for making a dream come true rather than playing it safe. The 33 foot steel yacht materialises over years of hard and improvised work right next to the family's temporary home. But not everybody is happy about it.

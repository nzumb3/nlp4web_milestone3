The Tacoma Syndrome
###BREAK###
Tacoma, Washington: November 7, 1940. The Tacoma Narrows Bridge collapses dramatically four months after its opening. Montreal, Canada: present day. A major city in a terminal decline. The deteriorating roads, crumbling bridges and widespread construction repair sites have become a dreadful reality for its residents. The Tacoma catastrophe and the Montreal urban downfall have a significant emotional impact on the personal life of Dr. Markus Tulay (Nils Oliveto), a university professor specialized in bridge engineering. Markus eventually meets Stevie (Stephane Plante), the charismatic lead singer of a local Montreal rock band. This unlikely new friendship will allow Markus to momentarily escape his difficult life...but not without having to face painful evidence about his wife's secret behavior.

If I Were a Saxophone
###BREAK###
A modern-day Cinderella story, focusing on a 23-year old musician for whom the saxophone has proved to be both an inspiration and a practical means of escape from a life of dreariness in a Ukrainian orphanage. Now Veronica has been accepted to pursue higher studies at elite institutions in Eastern Europe, a development which offers her both a clear and direct way to the top of the performing arts world and yet another round of displacement. The camera follows her as a main character and a visual subject: a striking red-haired girl, through crowded streams of unknown faces, car traffic, and the waves of the sea. Between the storms of ovation and the loneliness of nights, she struggles to fulfill the dream of a lifetime.

NFL Characters Unite features Atlanta Falcons' Pro Bowl Tight End Tony Gonzalez, New Orleans Saints' star Tight End Jimmy Graham, Pittsburgh Steelers Wide Receiver and Super Bowl XL MVP Hines Ward, and NBC's Football Night in America analyst and Super Bowl winning head coach Tony Dungy. All four have experienced enormous success on the field; and have also overcome extreme hate and bigotry in their lives. In the documentary, the NFL stars each share their own personal journeys and each helps to transform the life of a teen currently dealing with a similar situation. Through candid interviews and unique one on one activities, these on and off the field heroes help the teens see their way through the challenges in their lives.

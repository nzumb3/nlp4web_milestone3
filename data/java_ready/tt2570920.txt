Mobster
###BREAK###
Mobster is the story of two men - Jacob Hadar, West Coast kingpin of the Israeli Mob, and Special Agent Ron Zarger, the man implanted to bring him down. Equipped with the latest surveillance technology, Zarger, known by his undercover name 'Eli,' has used his wits and his guts to slip into Hadar's inner circle. Hadar, brilliant and ferocious, has focused his attention on a long standing feud with the Baja Cartel, and has failed to see the saboteurs in his midst.

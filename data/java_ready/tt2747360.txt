This documentary discusses an episode happened almost 15 years after a significant war in the north of Brasil: Canudos. With similar proportions and significance, the Contestado War happened in a region of southern Brazil whose ownership was disputed by the states of Parana and Santa Catarina. Besides the important historical and documentary characteristics, the film also stands out because it is open (and movie sources freely available) and have been produced with free tools.

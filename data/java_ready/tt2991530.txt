El Tercer Sendero
###BREAK###
The Third Path is a non narrative essay film that explores the frontiers between reason and passion, between life & death, between reality and reflection, between work and fun, between the ordinary & the mythical. Through various characters, places and sceneries we witness the abandonment left behind by progress, along with the creation that arises from abandonment. Abandonment is shown through an ex mining town in which reason and power plowed by 70 years ago. It is here amongst the ruins where an alternate path begins between the monsters of reason and poetry.

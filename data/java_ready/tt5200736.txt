Postmaster
###BREAK###
'Postmaster is a film that I conceptualized almost 13 years before I finally completed it. Like every good film, Postmaster has a steady story-line, a parallel plot meandering into the main story and a strong backstory. Ray, Ghatak & Hitchcock have crafted my fundamentals while Spielberg, Nolan and Guy Ritchie are among the contemporary inspirations. The music is treated frame by frame for the film. It is not just a story, it's a school of thought stitched together in order to portray a bigger philosophy. I believe that a movie should be grand theatrical experience, equally rich in visuals and music. In my film the raw beauty of Bengal is in full splendor. I have emerged my own idea of Tagore without tampering the temperament of the film. Altogether, Postmaster is a complete broth with all the ingredients to assure you a true cinematic experience.' -Srijon Bardhan

Kamenák 4
###BREAK###
Its ten years later and the popular protagonists of the town of Kamenákov are back in fine form. Pepa's wife Vilma has left for Australia to be with their daughter and so Pepa (Václav Vydra) and his son Pepík are living in a purely bachelor household with no cooking or ironing skills and with eggs exploding in the microwave oven. The teacher Vlasta (Dana Morávková) is intensively circling around Pepa, sensing an opportunity to fill the hole that Vilma left. Pepa, however, is completely absorbed by his new future - he has become the Mayor of Kamenákov. He has inherited his predecessor's flexible secretary Bohous (Bohumil Klepl). Their first mission together at town hall is to establish a local police force since, as everybody knows, the income from the fines goes right to the town's coffers. The local Rambo, Franta Cloumal (Martin Dejdar), becomes the police Chief, finally earning some recognition from his wife.

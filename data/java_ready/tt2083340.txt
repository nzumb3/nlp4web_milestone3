While presenting an outward image of a harmonious and happy couple actually there are conflicts between them that over the course of the film reaches extremes. This is a movie about everything that is happening around us today. 'Sold Out' is the selling out of conscience, values and ideas in modern society. The lack of contact and communication, lost values and people that stop existing, disappear, when no one is interested in them. The protagonists suffer without reacting.

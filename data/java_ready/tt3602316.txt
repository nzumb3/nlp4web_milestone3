Rymmaren
###BREAK###
Rolf became commonly known as "The Escaper" (Rymmaren) since he escaped from every orphanage he got placed at. He was also sexually abused. At that time Sweden was extremely sexual-liberal on the verge of permitting sexual crimes as pedophilia and even incest. The main goal for his many escapes were his grandparents on his mother's side and they were his only security during his adolescence.

The Blimp Trap
###BREAK###
Nine-year-old Harwood isn't like other boys in 1977 Texas. After losing his brother in a tragic car crash, his mother takes up drinking, and Harwood finds comfort in his best friend -- fellow-nine-year-old Billy, the mentally-handicapped girl from down the street. Together, they watch the famous blimp fly overhead, and craft a "blimp trap" to catch it for their very own. They're teased for their special game, and their friendship, until one day, something miraculous happens.

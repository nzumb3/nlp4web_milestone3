Yolcularin gece sarkisi
###BREAK###
The old tailor, Yolan, just released from an Iranian prison, sets out in search of the village in Turkey where he was born. By his side is Ozal, a 9-year old boy. Together they wander through the mountains of Eastern Anatolia and discover a country whose realities are as fabulous as they are simple. Chance encounters abound - talkative truckers, gamblers, suspicious villagers, shop keepers, bickering couples, wanderers, cattle wranglers - but it slowly emerges that the object of the quest, a village no longer shown on any map, is becoming less and less clear. What are Ozal and Yolan really seeking ? What is their place in a world that they find harder and harder to understand ? After a long journey, they come across a fortune teller and leave it to her to enlighten them on their destiny. A road in the dark leads them to the seaside. Yolan starts dancing on the beach to the music of Armenian musicians...

Finn on the Fly
###BREAK###
FINN ON THE FLY is a madcap comedy filled with wild chases, mistaken identity and young romance. Ben Soledad, a shy thirteen-year-old, has just moved to a new town. He tries his best to fit in at MacKenzie Junior High, but most of the time he feels like his only friend in the world is his dog, Finn. Just when he thinks life can't get worse, his world is turned upside-down when the scientist living next door performs a genetic experiment that goes terribly awry, transforming his dog into a flea scratchin', cat chasin', frisbee lovin' HUMAN!

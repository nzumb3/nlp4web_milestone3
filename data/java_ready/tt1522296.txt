Walter is a professional killer and has messed up a job. He has to leave the city and takes up an offer of crime boss Berger to protect Berger's house in a remote region of the Carpathian Mountains. At his side: old friend Mickey. By accident Berger's young wife Sybille is killed and Walter and Mickey hide her body because they fear Berger's vengeance.

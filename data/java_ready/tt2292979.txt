The Heart of the Father
###BREAK###
The Heart of the Father brings you into the true stories of lives God has blessed through adoption. The stories of those who have adopted are amplified by accounts of blessings received by those who were adopted and the painful decision a birth-mother makes to best express her love, to her child, by placing him for adoption.

Forgive Us
###BREAK###
After losing 83 colleagues on September 11th, 2001, the film director Anthony Haden West, saw the US, his newly adopted homeland, descend into a thinly disguised anti-Muslim frenzy that left him aghast. He is traditionally Christian but had no understanding of evangelical America. He picked up a camera and followed 4 US missionaries through Muslim parts of Africa over 5 years. The film is tender, warm, close to the characters but still shows a sample of a vast global trend in religious fundamentalism.

The Dawn of a New Day
###BREAK###
A South African plastic surgeon, Dr, Tertius Venter, wants to leave his private practice to join a hospital ship providing free surgeries to the poor - but at a personal cost his wife Trudi may not be willing to pay. She is devastated at the realization she would only see him three months a year. While Tertius wrestles between being with the woman he has always loved and his destiny, the documentary closely follows Ambroise (32), Hyacinthe (10) and Fadila (11) who are three West Africans in need of life-changing surgery but without access to health care.

Duriban, a humble noodle restaurant visited often by lonely indie musicians in a bustling city of Seoul, Korea, was brutally evicted and demolished by greedy construction company and pro-conglomerate-only city government with mere $3,000 as a moving expense. Outraged by the situation and related to their disadvantageous performance and poor contract conditions, 51 and plus indie bands in the area join the long 500 and more days of protest till Duriban receives socio-economically reasonable and acceptable compensation and reopens its new venue in a new in the area. A striking social activism demonstrated among the young indie musicians and their growth as artists through unity in modern day in Seoul, Korea.

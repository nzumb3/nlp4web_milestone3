The Body
###BREAK###
James and Maureen Pastorini wake up to find an unexpected visitor in their home. An attractive but very dead woman has mysteriously appeared on their dining room floor, creating something of an inconvenience for the couple. Without any answers and not wanting a big hassle with the police, the couple decides to get rid of the body on their own. This leads to encounters with an overly talkative detective and his near-silent partner, a redneck farmer with a strange offer, a Mafia hoodlum with experience getting rid of dead bodies and the biggest horror known to man, the mother-in-law.

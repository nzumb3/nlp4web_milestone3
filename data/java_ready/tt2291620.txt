Wandering
###BREAK###
'Wandering' depicts the curious tragedy of a historical injustice victim, a man living in Diaspora. Christianity, immortality of soul, human sins and trespasses, historical injustices, love and purification - these topics are the ideological basis of the film. 'Wandering' belongs to the farcical and tragicomic genre and is exceptional in its style. 'Wandering' has a structure typical of classical opera: an overture, duets, trios, arias and choral performances with clear development and ideology. 'Wandering' is the first such a film in the region.

...and on the 7th Day, God Rocked
###BREAK###
Who will you root for in this laugh-out-loud rockumentary about a Christian Battle of the Bands? Wrathful Old Testament hip-hoppers Sons of Abraham or born-again hard-rockers Savior? Lapsed Catholic Angie Hynes, who's gone from punk to country in search of success, or the folksy love-fest of harmony-laden trio Glory Authority? A recording contract awaits the winner. Who that will be, only God, and perhaps the promoter, knows.

Bangkok Robbery
###BREAK###
When the Thai government announces a plan to empty its vaults to repay its IMF loans, a gang of local Mafia cook up a scheme for a mega-heist: they will steal the country's gold reserves. They hire the notorious Navin, a former military assassin, to lead an operation involving all of the top thieves in the country. The government sends Lieutenant Pakorn, head of the Counter-Terrorism Bureau, to track down Navin. As the two men try to outwit each other, the robbers race against the clock to pull off the biggest heist in the Thai history.

After the Fall: HIV Grows Up
###BREAK###
As communism fell in 1989, Romania was gripped with an epidemic of pediatric AIDS in its hospitals and state run institutions. With a lack of medicine and very limited knowledge of the disease, many health care workers risked their lives to help over 12,000 children infected with HIV and AIDS. 'After the Fall' looks back with those who were on the front lines of the disease in the early years, and looks forward at the hopes and challenges of the survivors who, against all odds, are growing into independent young adults. After The Fall: HIV Grows Up is a story that challenges the true meaning of bravery, hope and perseverance, inspiring an audience to rise against any odds and fight for fullness of life and dignity no matter the cost.

Flesh on Fire: Addicted to a Dream
###BREAK###
Feature documentary film that takes the viewer on an intimate roller coaster of pain and joy as actor Donnie Faught climbs his way out of the backwoods of Arkansas to success in the city of angels. Along this journey, passionate (and volatile) relationships are ignited, but some are agonizingly sacrificed, all for the ultimate dream of making it on the big screen. Faught's unwavering determination to succeed in an industry that swallows people whole and spits them out broken, is a testament to his burning passion that refuses to be extinguished.

###BREAK###
These two icons of progressive thought in America met for the first time to discuss a salient issue for our times: Why are some people known as whistle blowers willing to take courageous nonviolent action in defense of ethical principles and human rights--even at personal risk to themselves? This film explores the lives of whistle blowers and poses a further question: Why is so much money spent researching how to get people to obey external authority and no money is spent researching how to get people to obey their conscience? See this film and decide for yourself.

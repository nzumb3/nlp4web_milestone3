Just Another Racer: The Randy Bethea Story
###BREAK###
Throughout the 1970s Tennessee racer Randy Bethea was a regular competitor in NASCAR's second tier series now known as the Nationwide Series. In 1975 he made history, becoming one of only seven African Americans to compete at NASCAR's highest level, the Cup Series. But like many racers his dream of NASCAR success was unfulfilled for reasons he attributes to color. That color was green, and like the majority of up-and-coming drivers of that era Bethea didn't have enough green to compete at his full potential. Although he did experience some racism during his driving career, Bethea is quick to state he was 'Not a Black Racer', he was a racer who happened to be black, and he remains among the most popular drivers in Tennessee.

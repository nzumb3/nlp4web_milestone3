Lonely
###BREAK###
Lonely examines the stale and uncomfortable territory that six people have found themselves in when trying to cope with a deep loneliness and an absence of belonging. Grace sleeps around, Daniel talks to animals, Cassandra seeks love on the Internet, Louise talks to her hand, Steven befriends the dead and Mark stalks the girl next door. But connecting them all is a murder story that brings them closer to each other than they may want.

When the Queen Came to Town
###BREAK###
The Queen's maiden visit to Australia in 1954 marked the end of one era and the dawn of another. It was post-depression, post WWII, and pre TV, and Australians came in their millions to bask in the presence of a monarch. These memories and the footage captured are still vivid to this day. Drawing on the 35mm Technicolor cinemascope film footage and home movies shot by those who witnessed the pageantry and ceremony, we will recreate that time and reflect on how it touched the lives and fabric of Australian society. When Queen Came to Town- Coming soon to cinemas near YOU.

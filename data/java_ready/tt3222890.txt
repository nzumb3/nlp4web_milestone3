###BREAK###
An absurdist, pastel noir that documents events after an artist flees New York and winds up dead in a small town. A local sheriff, an old lover, and a distant friend try to sort out what's happened and, in the process, confront the ways that their own needs and desires have created the mysteries that surround them.

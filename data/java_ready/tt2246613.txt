Buzzard Country
###BREAK###
When two ghost-town dwelling Wisconsin burnouts with no money and no prospects come across a strange package containing fifty grand in the course of their daily scavenging, they think their prayers have been answered. That is, until a nun-chuck wielding fat-ass in a black El Camino shows up looking for the money. Suddenly, our heroes find themselves in the midst of a seedy small town underworld filled with blackmail, unscrupulous arthouse weirdos, sword play, stolen police weapons, furry-fetishists and hookers, a sleazy Scandanavian strip club owner, a furious cop, and an angry ex-girlfriend who can't be trusted. The chase is on for the loot in this quintessentially midwestern comedic tale of what happens when money turns regular small town scumbags into unlikely criminals and heroes.

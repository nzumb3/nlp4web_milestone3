One More Dream
###BREAK###
Four women who have reached the bottom of despair are ready to do anything to re-surface again. And at that very moment life offers them the most absurd opportunity-to fulfill their dream. On the borderline between fantasy and reality the four of them realize that when you have nothing you can risk everything. They rush into a planned bank robbery without realizing that money is the last thing they need. Because fate collides them with people who dream as well.

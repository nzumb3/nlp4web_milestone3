LoveTown
###BREAK###
LoveTown is the pop-musical tale of a dysfunctional bar singer helping three wandering souls find their way back to love. All the while- her time is running out. In the spirit of 'Glee for adults', LoveTown finds its voice in new, original rock songs and an engaging storyline. Originally debuting as a live stage show at OKM International Music Festival, it's the first feature film by husband/wife creative team Jay & Ann-Janette Webster. Their melody is simple: 'Pain shapes us, but it's love that defines us, baby'.

Steve thinks he's just going out for a birthday dinner, but his friends have concocted an insane hidden-camera adventure just for him. He'll get to fly in a helicopter, run for his life, and defuse a big fake nuclear bomb before the night is through. It's the most elaborate hidden camera prank ever caught on tape.

Vladimir en mi
###BREAK###
Vladimir does not know what he is. He has all the money he wants, he is afraid he will become schizophrenic; he is a vampire, an extraterrestrial, an eccentric millionaire, or all three at the same time. There is no doubt that he is a Lady's man who plays soccer perfectly, who can study the movements of a cabdriver and seduce the most beautiful and intelligent woman he meets.

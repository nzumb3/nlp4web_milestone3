###BREAK###
The story of bravery and heroic feats of PNP Col. Romeo Maganto are chronicled in this movie. He started from a lowly provincial town in Bustos, Bulacan as a police patrolman but his principles and exploits led him to becoming the Western District Station commander. He continues to fill the newspaper headlines for his incessant seizing of dreaded abductions and the froth of the gangland. Maganto was branded as "Leon Ng Maynila" for his prominent efforts to put down rebellions. For his acts of heroism he received the Distinguished Conduct Medal, the second highest medal that can be conferred to a Military Police personnel. He was promoted a rank higher in February 1990, becoming the youngest police colonel in the history of the integrated national Police.

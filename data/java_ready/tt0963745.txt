Art in the Face of War
###BREAK###
Eight World War II artists/veterans recount their service experience and their use of art for journalism, as a tactical tool and to preserve their own sanity. Having served in all theaters of operation and in all branches of the U.S. military, including the once-secret Army division known as The Deception Corps, their powerful imagery (some done on the spot, some done years later from haunting memories) will enlighten, challenge, even amuse, showing that war is hell but that creativity can exist in the face of destruction.

The Wishing Box
###BREAK###
A 1000 year old box that contains the black stones of the sorceress Cozara. Cozara ( Stella Kim ) using dark magic imprisoned hundreds of wicked tormented souls in the stones, believing it would give them the power to grant any wish, but she soon learned she was wrong. That the dark souls she trapped in the stones had a hunger for human blood and carnage. Unable to control the evil she created, she placed the stones in a wooden box crafted from the tree of life and buried it deep in the earth and there the evil slept. Now a thousand years later, the box and stones untouched by time have been found and anyone foolish enough to open the box will have only one wish, they will wish for death.

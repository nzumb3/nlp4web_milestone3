In der Fremde
###BREAK###
With the break of dawn, the day begins for Croatian migrant workers on the asparagus fields in the south of Germany. For the money, they leave their home for three months. Abroad, separated from family and friends, their daily life is determined by the rhythms of the field and the factory. Throughout, it is the contact with each other that helps create a feeling of community and get them through. Home is ever-present while elsewhere.

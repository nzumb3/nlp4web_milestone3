Going Cardboard: A Board Game Documentary
###BREAK###
In 1978, the German press and board game makers created the Spiel des Jahres, or 'Game of the Year' award for excellence in board game design. Competition for this award contributed to an explosion in the variety and sophistication of 'Euro-games.' With the arrival of The Settlers of Catan in the United States in the mid-nineties, more people began to discover the new breed of board game that had been quietly evolving in Germany for the past 30+ years. Going Cardboard takes you into the world of 'designer' board gaming, from the community of enthusiastic fans to the publishers and self-publishers, and of course, the designers.

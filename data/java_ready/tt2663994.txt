Broken Promises 3
###BREAK###
This time Amsugi faces a challenge from a new potential daughter-in-law, whom is highly educated, and extremely wealthy. Amsugi finds that she is well over her head, trying to out wit and out smart this new 'Tamil' daughter-in-law, Vimla. Vimla takes much joy in playing son against mother. She looks at it as an experience as she has never had a mother-in-law in her last three marriages. The movie sees the return of all popular characters such as the closet smoking Bommi, the compulsive eating Saras, the conservative well-dressed Kamla, and the ever girl-finding Reuben. They are joined by a host of new faces, who bring much comedy and excitement to the well-established franchise.

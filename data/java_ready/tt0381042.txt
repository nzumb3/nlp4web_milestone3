The Occupied
###BREAK###
De besatte portrays a year in the life of five Palestinians. Woven into the tales of their background, the story is a documentary on the history of the Palestinian people since they lost their country in 1948 and had even more land occupied in 1967. De besatte is not only about the physical occupation. It is a film about the emotional occupation that kills all dreams, and about the demons that the occupation lets loose and which threatens to take away a person's humanity, where the executioner and the victim constantly take each other's role.

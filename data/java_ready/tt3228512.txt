La Perla del Mar
###BREAK###
Maria is the voice of the Canary Islands. At the age of 86 she is a force of nature and performs with jazz musicians half her age. What keeps her energy going? Why are our eyes filling up with tears each time we hear her dramatic contralto? Mar√≠a's voice tunes in with the wind, with fog, with sea while we start to understand the secret of life.

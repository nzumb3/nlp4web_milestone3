Locks of Love
###BREAK###
Locks of Love is an anthology of eleven short stories each exploring the theme of love. From Florence to Paris, Melbourne to Seoul, public places abound with padlocks connecting people forever through love. This Canberra-made film tells the tales behind eleven padlocks. The dynamics of love play out in romance, friendship, family and heartbreak - charting a course across comedy, drama and even the supernatural. Centred around a gate of padlocks in a Canberra Park, almost 300 locals were involved in the making of the film.

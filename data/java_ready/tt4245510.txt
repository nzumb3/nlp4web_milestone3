But she is saved by a handsome motor-mechanic named Somu. Somu takes her to her uncle's house where he turns out to be one of his acquaintances. Gradually, Rupa and Somu come close to each other. One day they have a heated argument; but it's precisely after this that they realize their love for each other. They make up and even get married secretly without informing Rupa's mother. Soon, on her father's request, Rupa returns home. Her mother refuses to acknowledge her marriage; instead she decides to marry her off to her former match. On the day of her marriage, just when Rupa had given up all hope; Somu makes a dramatic entry to take charge of his 'sasurbari' (in-laws' house). But is it only his love for Rupa that has brought him here; or does Somu have a secret of his own?

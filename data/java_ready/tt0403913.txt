###BREAK###
Each and all of us have to undergo the same life cycle: being born, growing up, and leading the chosen course of life until the end of our time on this world. We are all bound and imprisoned in some ways, only varied by causes and factors. It's difficult to find an inarguable confirmation which kind of lifes is better between that in the so-called world of freedom and that behind the prison walls. Is any of the two are better or worse, or whether they are the same. The answer remains on which kind of confinement is one in. In the dark world of a prison, where dangerous female convicts make a disgusting society that no one wants to be in, Daosawai is sent for a jail term. "Khang Paed" becomes the realm that brings a new sunshine to her life.

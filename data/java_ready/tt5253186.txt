Monsters
###BREAK###
Jia Ying, a sales manager of real estate, is mean and indifferent, still remains single. She has never expected something like this would have happened to her. After her customers were gone, Jia found that she has left her personal phone at the model room. As she just stepped into the elevator, a horrid thundering comes, and the next thing she knew, she was waked from the dark, trapped among the destroyed elevator, and all she got was a cracked work phone, a lighter and a handbag. Jia managed to recover the phone and called for help, while the signal was fitful, and she cannot even remember her bes-tie or relative's number. The destroyed elevator fell again, iron stabbed into her thigh and caused badly bleeding. Jia kept trying on dialing, without the expectation to find a hidden conspiracy, as well as a bloody monster lurked deep in the dark.

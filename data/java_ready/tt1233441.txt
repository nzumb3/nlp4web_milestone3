More Than Dreams
###BREAK###
The portrait of a hopeless youth, ready to try any experience, however extreme, to find its limits at any cost. Sean, a young actor with no prospects, is at a turning point in his life. Hardly managing to scrape by in London, he struggles to maintain his relationship with girlfriend Claudia, due to spending too much time with his dope dealer friend, Nico. As he sees his own dreams go up in smoke ; Sean finds it increasingly difficult to deal with the success of his flatmate and friend Peter. When Peter then decides to seduce Claudia, it is the end of Sean's little world. Thanks to his mother, he escapes his nightmare in London by embarking on a trip to Geneva (Switzerland). He stays there with his cousin Marc, whose wayward life-style proves to be as problematic and fatal as his own. Once back in London, Sean is given hope by the presence of his father who has made a comeback in his life, with the intention to repair the damages caused by his former absences and hopefully restore some balance and happiness in his son's life.

###BREAK###
While Inuit art is often positioned as quintessentially Northern, of the North and of the Arctic, it is also urban and, for the urban Inuit artist, it is a living. In this short film, the filmmakers provide a brief glimpse into the daily work of an urban Inuit carver in Ottawa, Canada. Images of carving and rock-hounding are contrasted with the towering presence of Inuit art in the nation's capital.

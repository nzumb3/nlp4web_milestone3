Za horata i za mechkite
###BREAK###
Foreign tourists in Bulgaria can witness quite a funny performance. A swarthy, poorly dressed man plays a strange musical instrument facing a tied-to-a-chain bear that moves heavily as if dancing. This film tells the life-stories of several bears-wards as well as several bears. It reveals their desperation, the strange and cruel link keeping them together. In such cruel conditions a bear could hardly live without a man. On the other hand, a man, who has to support a family with his trade, could hardly survive without the bear.

Uncovering the truth behind his recently euthanized grandfather, film director Torsten plans the unthinkable. In an attempt to relive the torturous experiments his grandfather performed as a Nazi guard, Torsten hatches a plan to put himself in the shoes of the tortured, for the sake of self redemption and making sense of a past he had no idea existed. With two willing volunteers he gets to work in an abandoned industrial facility on the outskirts of town. With the experiment continuing to take its toll on all three, cracks begin to surface which eventually halt his deranged plan. The experiment maybe over, but the torture is only beginning..

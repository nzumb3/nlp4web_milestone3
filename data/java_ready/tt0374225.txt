Fito is trying his very damnedest to get an Erasmus scholarship to improve his English in England. He is at the brink of attaining his dreams. He has approved his first test and now waits on a long line of applicants to be told to wait an extra week to submit his last and definitive examination. In the meantime, his dad, the owner of a rotisserie truck in the city of Soria, asks him to pick up the renovated truck, that looks now like a roasted chicken, and bring it home. Toño, on the hand, has managed through hook and crook to climb the steep road of journalism and provides occasional services in the musical Magazine Chill Out. They are hiring one reporter this year. It is more than a flaky position of a stable job for Toño, since his rival to the job is the owner's son. Oliver is a pampered, good for nothing womanizer, who wants the job by all means in order to let his parents know he is not depending on their monthly check. If Toño wants to get this job, he needs to prove that he is able to get a photo and interview reportage of importance. But what to do to get the damn job? Watching on TV with Fito some pictures of Cactus Festival, a little light turned on in him. This summer, the famous music festival features a cast of luxury. Among the artists performing on this issue is nothing less than Slam, the shooting star of the world of rock. Slam is also world renowned for his stubborn refusal to grant interviews. What if he would get that unique interview? That would be a hoot and would get the post of editor at the magazine. But how to get to the Cactus Festival if you happened to be so completely broke, even to pay the train ticket? ... but there is the rolling roasted chicken...

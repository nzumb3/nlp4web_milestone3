While studying the differences between religion and cult in college, Mindy, who is the best student in the class, convinces her schoolmates Cassandra, Bailey, Alex and Morgan to research the massacre of worshipers of Kwan Yin by their leader Owen Quinlin twenty years ago in California. Quinlin had found an ancient amulet in Southern China that would give an enormous power to him after the sacrifice of human souls, but one woman resists and he is destroyed.

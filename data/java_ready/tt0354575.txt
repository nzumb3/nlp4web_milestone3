The Five Obstructions
###BREAK###
"The Five Obstructions", a 100 min. Dano-Belgian theatre documentary directed by Lars von Trier and JÃ¸rgen Leth. An investigative journey into the phenomenon of "documentary", based on manifestos written by each director. About a filmmaker not only revisiting, but also recreating (not in a conventional sense) one of his first films, The Perfect Human / Det perfekte menneske (1967), a document on life in Denmark, containing the familiar Leth idiosyncrasies.

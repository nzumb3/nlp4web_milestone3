Vytautas V. Landsbergis' new film "Tricolour" tells the tale of Lithuanian post-war history, which the director is so fond of, only in this instance it doesn't dwell on any particular person or event, but tries to create a general portrait of the post-war freedom fighter - unadulterated and authentic, as portrayed by twelve witnesses of the battles of the time, ex-partisans and their signalers. It is difficult to define the film's genre, because aside from compelling documentary footage it also has enacted scenes, filmed by the skillful hand of cameraman Saulius Lukosevicius. The film is enriched by musical episodes of songs performed by Ieva Narkute and Martynas Levickis. The calm-paced film will send the viewer on a journey into the colorful vortexes of Lithuanian history - some happy, some moving and sorrowful. The film uses simple, unpretentious language to speak to both the young and old who love this beautiful land.

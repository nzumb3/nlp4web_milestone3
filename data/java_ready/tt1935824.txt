In Search of God
###BREAK###
An American girl, Kavita, embarks on a spiritual journey back to her ancestral homeland. After a life of unfulfilled materialism and superficiality, her heart calls her to seek out a greater truth. Upon a friend's suggestion, she travels to Majuli Island, a large but remote river island in India. There she discovers a magical wonderland where culture is deeply embedded with performing arts, through centuries of tradition in music, dance, and simple spiritual lives. Along her journey, Kavita encounters a variety of fascinating holy people. A young monk named Ram guides her through an array of satras (temples), tribal villages, and memorable dance and musical performances. Immersed into the stirring culture and religion, she gradually finds that her heart is awakening to something remarkably profound.

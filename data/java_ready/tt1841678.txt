Just Around the Corner
###BREAK###
The dictionary defines the word 'extraordinary' as going beyond what is usual. This word perfectly describes Bob Benjamin's life. Being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the young age of 38 was a quite blow to Bob. Instead of letting the disease dictate his future he chose to take the fight to Parkinson's. He recruited his friends, many of whom were musicians he had worked with in the past, to help fight the disease. To date, that fight has raised 1.5 million dollars to fund research that will one day just around the corner, produce a cure.

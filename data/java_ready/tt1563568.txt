Freezer Geezers
###BREAK###
FREEZER GEEZERS (the ageless wonders!) follows 83 year old coach Ray Tuller and his team - Millenium 75's - from Springfield, MA, as they challenge three other teams from around the world competing in the world's oldest age division, 75 and over, in the annual Snoopy's Senior World Hockey Tournament created by beloved artist Charles Schulz in Santa Rosa, California. The story is sometimes hilarious and sentimental, but always inspiring.

Still Here: A Journey to Triumph
###BREAK###
An inspiring and dedicated group of African Canadian teens retrace the path of their ancestors' journey which lead them to the US from Africa, and from the US to their final resting place in Nova Scotia, Canada. They were the forgotten Americans; former slaves and free blacks who left the US in the 17 and 1800's in hopes of a better life in Canada. Instead, they were unprepared for what met them when they landed on the shores of Nova Scotia. The youth incorporate multiple artistic disciplines; including poetry, song, narration, African drumming and re-enactments to weave this powerful story.

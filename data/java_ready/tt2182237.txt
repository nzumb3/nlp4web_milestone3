Varg Veum - De d√∏de har det godt
###BREAK###
Varg tries to help a scared girl lost in the woods at night. But he fails to avoid her death. What was this young asylum seeker fleeing from? Was it an accident, or was she killed as a warning to other girls in the same circles? Together, Varg and Karin discover that the dead girl was deeply involved in operations in which young women where forcibly introduced in the country and at the asylum reception centres are cynically exploited. Important people in the high levels of the government put pressure on the police department to hinder further investigation. What are they trying to hide? Time works against Varg, who has to prove the identity of important people behind the ring, before more young girls lose their lives.

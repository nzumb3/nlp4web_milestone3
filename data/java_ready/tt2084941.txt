Someday You
###BREAK###
Robert Clark Young spends the first 47 years of his life looking for fame, fortune and love, only to end up a troubled young alcoholic, obsessive writer, and mercenary has-been. When both his parents have strokes and nobody else in the family will care for them, Bob returns home to San Diego and embarks on a transformative journey of self discovery which takes him as far outside himself as he's ever been in his life. Filmmaker Terisa Greenan follows Bob's odyssey of self discovery and tells his story with unflinching truth and surprising humor as he confronts the demons of his past by providing daily, life-giving care to his disabled mother and father.

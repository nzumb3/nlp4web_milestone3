Palmer's Pick-Up
###BREAK###
Two dimwit owners (Robert Carradine, Richard Hillman) of a struggling hauling company are approached about hauling a huge, mysterious box across country at the end of the century. The cargo has religious significance and may be an attempt to release Satan in the Devil's Triangle to start the next century. En route, many step out to try to stop their delivery including Patrick Kilpatrick as a gay ex-con, Talia Shire playing in drag, Morton Downey, Jr. as a tv celebrity, and Rosanna Arquette as a gun-toting sexpot.

Queen of the Whole Wide World
###BREAK###
In 1989, a few friends got together in a living room to put on a drag contest as a spoof of the Miss USA competition. Eleven years later, that little contest grew into a gala beauty pageant attracting a crowd of 2,200 people and raising more than $130,000 for Aid for AIDS, one of the oldest HIV agencies in Los Angeles. This film follows the poignant and often hilarious trials of the seven contestants who competed in the 'Quest for the Crown' event on March 4, 2000. While becoming familiar with these very different men, we learn of their personal triumphs and failures in love and life, incorporating their views on the plethora of stereotypes behind putting on a wig and a dress and being gay in a prejudiced world. As the big day approaches, community and philanthropy gradually give way to competitiveness and ego, as the contestants attempt to put on this most outrageous and over-the-top spectacle with the help of seamstresses, carpenters, designers, make-up artists, hairstylists and animal wranglers in the hope of garnering the coveted title: Queen of the Whole Wide World. The film culminates in scenes from the event itself - both on-stage and in the cramped dressing rooms of the Hollywood theater in Los Angeles.

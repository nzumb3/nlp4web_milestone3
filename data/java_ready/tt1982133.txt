Ned Rorem: Word & Music
###BREAK###
A portrait on the Pulitzer Prize-winning composer whose diaries have set a new standard for candor in their form. The viewer is given a fist-hand view of the music and literary world of Paris and New York from the late 1940's to the present. Edward Albee, Allen Ginsberg, Paul Bowles, Tim Page, John Corigliano, and Edmund White are all interviewed; a mini-portrait is given of James Holmes, a musician and Rorem's life partner who, during the making of the film, died of AIDS.

Women on the Front Line
###BREAK###
This essential documentary film focuses on Iranian women's rights activists who are on the forefront of a decentralized but surprisingly powerful movement. These women are part of the largest, non-violent movement in the world that survives within the heart of a bitterly anti-female theocratic state. In this film, the first of its kind, these activists speak of their struggle for gender equality, and the price they have to pay for it. They also speak of their inspiring achievements in a state where misogyny is the order of the day.

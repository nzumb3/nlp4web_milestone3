Evoque: Reality Show
###BREAK###
EVOQUE REALITY SHOW is a film about youth, about modern art, nature and hypnosis. It tells the tale of a group of artists and a scientist who decide to retire to a house immersed in the beauty of the Abruzzo National Park, an Italian national reserve. EVOQUE REALITY SHOW is a neo-realist film, which plays with the language of television and transforms it into pure cinema. Artists, researchers and intellectuals, instead of soubrettes, the ignorant and TV stars!

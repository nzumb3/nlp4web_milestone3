Guy is out of touch with emotions, Julie is desperate to conceive a child and the planet is being dumped with the waste of 7 billion people. All seem quite normal problems until the suspicions of a strange new disease start to filter into the everyday discomforts of Guy and Julie's life. With dark-edged humour this wonderfully absurd thriller offers a quirky solution for the state of the planet.

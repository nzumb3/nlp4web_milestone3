Innocent
###BREAK###
A French-Greek co-production, filmed in Paris, in which the forty-year-old Maxim is released from prison after five years in prison. As he tries to adjust to life on the outside, he accidentally meets a Parisian taxi-driver who commits suicide right before his eyes. Without a pause he takes the dead cabbie's place behind the wheel and starts making the rounds of the city, transporting passengers (Jean-Pierre LÃ©aud plays the role of a client who recites Cavafy throughout the entire ride). He feels the air of freedom, a lord of Paris and master of himself, up to the moment that he meets young Anies, and his life falls into new paths. In the end, he takes off, destination unknown.

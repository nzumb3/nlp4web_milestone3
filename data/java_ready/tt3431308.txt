Mad About Hats
###BREAK###
Our documentary aims to recount, in fact, the history of a revolution. That of an object which, given its permanently symbolical nature, is a reflection of the epochs it traverses. Originally a token of the social hierarchies of an aristocratic and, subsequently, bourgeois society, the hat was, for a long time, a tool of etiquette. Afterwards it transformed itself into a product of the industrial era and of the 20th-century industrial aberrations when its manufacture became a pretext for the exploitation of man by man to the point of mental alienation, given the fact that the mercury used in the production of felt ruined not only the physical but also the mental health of thousands of workers in the sector. Has the hat, in our times, transformed itself into an eccentric, sophisticated luxury item, or does it simply succeed in helping its wearers to express their personality ?

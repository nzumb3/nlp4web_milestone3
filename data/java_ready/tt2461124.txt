The Road to Fame
###BREAK###
China's top drama academy stages the American musical "Fame"-China's first official collaboration with Broadway-as the graduation showcase for its senior class. During the eight-month rehearsal, five students compete for roles, struggle with pressure from family and authority, and prepare to graduate into China's corrupt entertainment industry. Part of China's single-child generation, they were spoiled growing up but are now obliged to carry on the failed dreams of their parents. They must confront complex social realities and their own anxieties, and, in the process of staging "Fame," negotiate their own definitions of and paths to success in today's China.

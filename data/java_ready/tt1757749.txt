Fast Talk
###BREAK###
WHEN WORDS LEAVE YOU BREATHLESS College debaters now speak at unintelligible speeds. Some claim the benefits are clear: More arguments per minute that an opposing team needs to rebut. But is there a dark side to fast talk? To answer this question, filmmaker Debra Tolchinsky spends a year following the Northwestern University debate team, as the students try to fast talk their way to another championship. A documentary that will make you question the speed of your own life and keep you talking.

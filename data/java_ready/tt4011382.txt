Leave/Stay: London
###BREAK###
London, UK has been recently counted among the 5 biggest Hungarian (!) cities with its population of Hungarians estimated between 150-300 thousand people, of whom most have migrated in the recent ten years. Leave/Stay: London, the first feature length piece of an intended series about the Hungarian and Eastern European "new mobility" of youth features six characters living the immigrant life in this almost utopistic metropolis. Attila, the driver swinging between Budapest and London weekly, Csaba, chef, entrepeneur and family man, Luca, teacher, classical and pop musician, Tobi, student, Niki, stripper, and Mark, traditional Chinese doctor represent a good chunk of Hungarian migrant society. The well-structured, quick-paced and visually stunning movie is concerned about their lives, struggels, success and failures of the immigrants' lives.

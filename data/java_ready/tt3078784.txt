Yoga Advocate
###BREAK###
Based on the book of the same name, Yoga Advocate is yoga as you've never seen it before brought to life with computer graphics, Latin guitar and the unique (and sometimes comical) insight of Yogi Aaron DeEspana. With more than 50 years' experience practicing and teaching yoga in a previous life, Aaron sees Yoga Advocate as a way to give back to a world that has given him so much grief.

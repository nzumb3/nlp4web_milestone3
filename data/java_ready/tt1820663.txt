Show/Choir
###BREAK###
Shot in 2005 and 2006, 'show/choir' follows a year in the lives of the Chesterton High School Sandpipers, a singing, dancing choir from a Northwest Indiana town that competes all over the Midwest against other talented performers. During the year, frustrations, dreams, and hopes come bubbling forth. Surprising triumphs and unexpected defeats abound, and the immense talent and zest for life that these average high schoolers possess shine through it all.

In a Race Against Time
###BREAK###
In A Race Against Time follows Daniel Okabe, an accomplished amateur marathon runner from Mbale, Uganda, over a period of six months in 2011. The film chronicles his training and performance in the Honda Los Angeles Marathon, the Boston Marathon, and the Orange County Marathon, while simultaneously attempting to raise enough funding to stay in the country and earn a college degree before his Student Visa expires. In addition to examining the culture clash that's inherent within his assimilation into Southern California lifestyle, this documentary also encapsulates the incredible life experience that he's enjoying, both studying and racing abroad here in the U.S. His inspirational story is one of hope and a commentary on the impact that each of us can have on the world around us.

American Icon
###BREAK###
The film chronicles the Naked Cowboy's attempts at stardom through interviews, lifestyle footage, television appearances and public performances. His journey starts in a small suburb outside Cincinnati, Ohio where he builds not only a unique icon persona, but also a philosophy of personal empowerment that he strives to pass on to anyone who will listen. Through song and public performances, the Naked Cowboy has built a cult-like status leading him to several appearances on national television programs such as MTV, CNN and The Howard Stern Show to name a few. With over a hundred performances on New York?s Times Square alone, there seems to be nothing that will deter John Robert Burke from becoming the next American Icon.

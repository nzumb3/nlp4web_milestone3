Days and Nights in an Indian Jail
###BREAK###
This film goes inside Tihar Central Jail in Delhi, the largest prison in South-East Asia. Filmed over a period of a year, it focuses on the lives of a handful of characters. Laxmi is serving life for the murder of her husband's mistress. She thinks about him all the time, even though he has not visited her for five years. Then one day, he turns up, but he is no longer the man she had killed for. Bhabhuti, his wife, Prempatta, and their son, Rama Shankar are all serving life sentences as a result of India's unique dowry laws. Their youngest daughter, Pushpa's, future is uncertain as she is at an age when she must leave the jail. There is a choice of either sending her to the village or to a boarding school where a charity has found a place for her. The film charts the conflicts that arise in the family as Pushpa's time of departure approaches.

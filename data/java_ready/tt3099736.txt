Tito on Ice
###BREAK###
To promote their book BOSNIAN FLAT DOG, Swedish comics artists Max Andersson and Lars Sjunnesson tour the countries of former Yugoslavia with a mummyfied Marshal Tito in a refrigerator. Watching border controls turn into improvised snapshot sessions, admiring mutant iron-curtain Disney toys, buying souvenir grenade shell handicrafts and discovering sniper art in blown-out apartments, they find that truth may indeed be stranger than fiction. Max Andersson's feature film debut operates on multiple levels to achieve a rare synthesis of form and content. The combination of animated crumbling, fragmentary garbage characters and grainy black and white super 8 mixed with documentary MiniDV looks like nothing else but seems perfectly natural. A roller coaster ride through a parallel universe where all borders are disintegrating - at the same time tragic, poetic and hilariously funny.

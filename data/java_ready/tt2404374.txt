Martin Lax is 86 years old and is struggling with aging and his past. As he goes about his daily routines, he recounts his memories with capricious wit and moody nostalgia to his 20-year-old grandson. We hear how the past inserts its haunting presence, with humor and sadness, into his everyday life. From the small town of Caraseu, to the gates of Auschwitz, to the pool at the Jewish Community Center in Cleveland, Fools Never Grow Old is the portrait of a man looking back as his life draws to a close.

Santa Cruzin'
###BREAK###
A true-life documentary about five Santa Cruz friends trying to live the life of their dreams. Meet Timmy, a spiritual day-trader, Frog, who's building an illegal treehouse, Willow, who wants to be a fairy, Florinse, who lives in a graveyard and talks to ghosts, and Pluto, the lonely surfer. Will he ever find love? Will our heroes ever really be free? Can they make it through on dumpster-diving and yoga? Everything's possible - in Santa Cruz! It's a wild, magical ride featuring music by over fifteen local artists.

We're Here for a Good Time, Not a Long Time
###BREAK###
Writer/Director David Gledhill wrote a screenplay about a man losing his soul-mate. He then lost his soul-mate for real, but continued to make the film. 'We're here for a good time, not a long time' is a story of love, lost and a list. David follows the instructions on a list that was left for him to follow once his partner had gone. He gets Barry the dog and his camper van and sets off to the Lake District. But what next?

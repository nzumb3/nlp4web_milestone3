Waiting for the Light to Change
###BREAK###
The independent documentary film, "Waiting for the Light to Change," is a cautionary tale examining the tormented life of a man at the end of his rope; grappling with severe alcohol addiction, the untimely death of his cancer-stricken sister, remorse over the physical abuse of his three children, and years of false starts and empty promises. The story unfolds as Regis, determined to resuscitate an all but forgotten music career, embarks on a riotous journey out west to find redemption in a life soured by decades' worth of self-destructive behavior. Retracing every step along the way, Regis discovers for the first time the true meaning of family and friends. From his rundown apartment in Russelton, PA, through the legendary streets of Woodstock and the Honkey Tonk bars of Nashville, to a semblance of hope found in the recording studios of Hollywood, comes a man who is given the opportunity to choose a better life. Although most of the world has never heard of him, Regis' songs linger in the hearts of his few remaining followers.

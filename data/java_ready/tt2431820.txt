Everything's Bigger: Adam Pacitti's Accidental Guide to Texas
###BREAK###
'Everything's Bigger: Adam Pacitti's Accidental Guide to Texas' is a documentary about a documentary gone wrong. Originally a follow-up to 'Pinfall: A Professional Wrestling Documentary', this was meant to be broadcast on British television as an insight into my wrestling career. When I arrived in Texas I wasn't allowed to wrestle. Improvising, I decided to make a new documentary about the Lone Star State. From competitive eating and handguns to cowboys and conspiracy theorists, Everything's Bigger is pretty unique. More importantly, whilst in Texas I met someone pretty special.

Breathe
###BREAK###
Martin Khodabakhshian (9-Time Emmy Award-winning ESPN producer) directs and produces this fascinating documentary that truly goes to new depths in the search for man's physical and mental limits. Breathe follows New Zealander, William Trubridge as he attempts to break his own world record in the extreme sport of Freediving. William attempts to dive completely unaided to a depth of 300ft, almost to the bottom of the deepest blue hole in the world - "Dean's Blue Hole" in the Bahamas.

Confessors and Traitors
###BREAK###
In the nearly half century after World War II in Hungary the communist dictatorship applied every possible means to persecute Christian churches. Hundreds of innocent priests and monks were imprisoned; others were roped in the network as agents of the State Security Services. The documentary is an authentic, valid and emotional testimony about the victims and the traitors of this era. Cathartic destinies and dramatic events of the past are recalled through the memories of the survivors, reports of state security agents and conversations tapped by the secret services. Contemporary newsreels, extract from private diaries, previously unknown documents, reports of secret agents, observation photos of the State Security Services and short reconstruction scenes evoke this historical period. The structure of the film based parallel on the memories of the victims and the reports of the agents of the secret police. The memories of the witnesses of the era and the documents are built organically into the intensive visual world of the film. Dynamic camera movements, steadicam-, aerial- and cinejib-shots present the stations in the lives of confessors and traitors: the scenes of prisons, court rooms, monasteries and secret ordinations.

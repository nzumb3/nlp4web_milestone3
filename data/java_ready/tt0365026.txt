Burma: Anatomy of Terror
###BREAK###
Burma: Anatomy of Terror juxtaposes the extreme beauty of the land and culture of Burma (once known as "The Golden Land") and present day Burma (renamed the Union of Myanmar), ruled for the past four decades by an illegitimate military regime called SLORC. Presenting an arrant portrait of the severe reality of a country in consistent crisis, the film exposes the many atrocities committed by the SLORC, including genocide, forced labor, torture and extra-judicial execution and forced relocation.

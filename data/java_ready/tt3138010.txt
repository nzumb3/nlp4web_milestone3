In viaggio con Cecilia
###BREAK###
Summer 2012. Two Italian women directors on a journey want to tell through a film on the road the changes that have occurred in their region, their homeland, and the main issues of the films shot by one of them, Cecilia, about fifty years ago. The film goes through places and ages and the archival footage interacts with the images of the present. The journey becomes the chance to face with the questions that were the core of Cecilia's search: how to approach the industrialization that drags up Italy and its people from an obsolete dimension, meantime throwing it in a cruel and contradictory dimension. Answers will be found meeting the people, through personal perspectives on a public interest theme.

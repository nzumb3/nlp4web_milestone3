Dear Mr. Fidrych
###BREAK###
It's 1976 in Detroit. Twelve-year-old poet Marty Jones wants to be a baseball star. Motivated by the quirky success of Mark 'The Bird' Fidrych, Marty writes a poem to the Detroit Tigers' star rookie pitcher. Fidrych writes back, propelling Marty on a winning streak. Thirty years later, Marty is an advertising executive in a mid-life slump. Can a father-son road trip in search of The Bird help Marty reconnect with his family and his youthful optimism?

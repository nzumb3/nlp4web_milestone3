Alice beyond the abyss
###BREAK###
Multiforo Alicia is a space that constantly seeks to trigger rebellion, questioning, resistance, reflection and finally generate a self-managed organization for the inhabitants of Mexico City. It is the place where the 'others' not within the market culture mainstream, fit in. This documentary tells us what is this place, who inhabit and what's the purpose of the existence of these kind of cultural spaces.

The Chester Kids
###BREAK###
THE CHESTER KIDS tells the story of two young men, Stu and Harry, best friends since high school who are now clinging to whatever remains of their friendship since Stu left Chester for college. Home for the summer Stu quickly falls back into old patterns with Harry leading the way, spending their days hanging by the pool with beers and bongs and their nights throwing house parties - getting loaded. In Stu's search for a life he once led a good time quickly turns into one bad decision too many. A very bad decision.

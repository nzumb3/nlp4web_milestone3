Wicked Funny 2
###BREAK###
In 2009, filmmaker Lisa Romagnoli documented the burgeoning comedy scene of Manchester, NH, in her short film 'Wicked Funny'. Three years later, she has checked back in with the comics from the first film to see how their comedy careers have developed. 'Wicked Funny 2' explores the challenges of developing from an open mic performer into a true comedian. Stand-up comedy is an art form not easily mastered, and the long journey the comics take leads them through frustration, failure, and self-examination. The film showcases the raw talent that exists in these comics, as the comics themselves reevaluate their own aspirations as they encounter the many hurdles that arise on the journey to becoming a successful comedian.

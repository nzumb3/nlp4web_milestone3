The story of Taliya's quest for finding love in the estranged world of Internet dating, based on a mouse, a keyboard and Photoshop tricks. In this comic-tragic voyage with the guidance of her flat-mate (extravagantly & cynically gay), she wanders from hope to humiliation.She drinks 45 cups of coffee (mostly soy latte) and gets involved with a few men & Husky puppy. This movie portrays the aspects that are well known to every single who plays the romantic internet game in order to snatch the ultimate prize: True Love. The movie contains a feminist message and uses an unusual combination of methods such as documentation, poetry and acting; as may be expected of a film that describes the modern, yet chaotic, world of Internet dating.

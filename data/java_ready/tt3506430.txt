Colombian Gold: 400 Years of Music from the Soul
###BREAK###
A musical odyssey through Colombia's Caribbean Coast, examining the region's rich musical heritage, which can be seen as an expression of the mixture of African, Native Indigenous, and European cultures. Nowhere is this more evident than in the port cities of Cartagena de Indias and Barranquilla, where for the past 80 years a unique cultural mix has produced a boom of musical creativity, fed largely by the region's fertile maritime connections and the advent of radio and recording technology.

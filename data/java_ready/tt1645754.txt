Get a Job
###BREAK###
To save his job as an employment agent, former musician William (Willie K) must get a job for Merton (Eric Gilliom), a bumbling man-child who surfs every day in a place where there are no waves. Meanwhile, William's long-time girlfriend, Laura (Carolyn Omine), cooks up a half-baked scheme to drag her man to the altar. Fueling the fun is a colorful cast of islanders including a traffic cop (Augie T), a tourist (Jake Shimabukuro), and unemployed musician (Mick Fleetwood), ans cameos by Willie Nelson and Pat Simmons of the Doobie Brothers. Written/directed by Maui's Brian Kohne, Get A Job 'is a name droppers delight - a who's who of Hawaiian musicians and entertainers" (Hawaii Tribune-Herald) with a tropical soundtrack by the award-winning Barefoot Natives. It's a multi-cultural plate-lunch of surprise and hilarity certain to leave you smiling and hungry for more!

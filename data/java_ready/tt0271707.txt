Peaceful Exit
###BREAK###
Anyone who has watched one in pain will know the agonising plight and moral dilema of Jim and Bronwyn Stewart. Severe brain damage has left their 2-year-old son Ian in a living hell: he can barely see, is almost deaf, has fits and is in constant pain. Doctors can do nothing for him and his prognosis is 5 years maximum. Jim and Bronwyn care for him night and day, but they would like to end their child's suffering humanely - by lethal injection. But in Britain, euthanasia is illegal.

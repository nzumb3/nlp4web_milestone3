Broadcast: A Man and His Dream
###BREAK###
This engaging documentary tells the story of Ralph Epperson, a tobacco farmer's son who grew up in the foothills of southwestern Virginia in the 1920s and 30s. Discovering radio as a young boy, he was fascinated by this new technology and driven to learn all he could about transmitting sound through airwaves. With a strong faith in God and his community, and a passion for regional music, he dreamed of having a radio station of his own. That dream came true in 1948 when WPAQ 740AM, Mt. Airy, NC went on the air and "the voice of the Blue Ridge" was born. His efforts inspired most of his family to follow him out of the tobacco fields and into the emerging field of radio broadcasting. Today more than 150 radio stations around the nation owe their beginnings to Ralph and his dream. His broadcasts enabled generations of musicians to develop and pass along the ages-old tradition of Blue Ridge style string music that still endures and entertains today.

Shot on super 8, the film appears like a journey, a dream along the Narmada river in India, between myths of Progress and myths of the river. "Dams are the temples of modern India," declared Nehru as the country proclaimed its independence. Construction on a vast complex of dams is soon to be completed on the Narmada river. A social struggle is organized. As we cross the Narmada River valley, we encounter the inhabitants, beliefs and convictions brought into conflict as this river undergoes great transformation.

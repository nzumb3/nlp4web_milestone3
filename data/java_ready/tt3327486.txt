New Hires
###BREAK###
There's three reasons Omaha, Nebraska is the Detroit Motor City of customer service. The phone lines are run underground because of Offutt Air Force Base. The locals don't have accents and they're known for being genuinely nice. New Hires is a coming of age adventure comedy following a group of friends working at the only place that would hire them, a telemarketing outsourcer that does Internet tech support.

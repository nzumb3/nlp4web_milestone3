In the collective imagination, the West has been for a long time,a legendary destination for the people of Quebec. What is fascinating about this social phenomenon is that it persists even after many years. In this 'road movie' documentary, the director has taken some young Quebecers to learn more about the journey of initiation. Quebec to BC, he gave them a voice and leaves with this movie a trail of large memory on the phenomenon. A sociological portrait of what the majority of young people can live on their summer journey across the continent.

Kacho Komplo
###BREAK###
A documentary about the Université de Moncton student bar in New-Brunswick. Witness to the social and political upheaval of the late 60's and the cultural explosion that followed, the Kacho Komplo closed its doors in 1996. In this delirious happening composed of both archived and recent footage, Marie-Jo Thério and the band Les Païens let loose combining poetry and music.

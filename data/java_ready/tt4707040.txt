Golden Hut
###BREAK###
Thirteen-year-old Emilke lives in his mountain hut in a place called Hidegs√©g in Gyimes, Transylvania. From early spring to the first snowfall he grazes cows, makes cheese from the milk, and only sees his parents when they go up to the mountain pasture and takes the cheese home. These meetings are rare and short. The only companions for the boy are the cows and the dogs. The hours, days, weeks, spring, summer and autumn melt into each other in his solitude.

Short Life
###BREAK###
Many ballet and dance films have been made. Incredibly, none tell the true story. Through the artists themselves and an unprecedented array of genius work by legendary choreographers, Twyla Tharp, George Balanchine, Susan Marshall, Edward Liang, William Forsythe and more, we feel the beauty and pain and truth distilled in the short life of a dancer. It is the most honest and thorough ballet film ever made. Rehearsal and performance footage is interwoven as never before. Access and immersion goes to the core. Stunning to watch, with implications for us all as we each struggle to find fulfillment in our own short life.

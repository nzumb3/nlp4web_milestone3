The Upside Down Book
###BREAK###
Imagine a book that is so toxic that rigorous hand washing is required after coming into contact with it. This book is a 1938 edition of Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler's political manifesto. Karen and Fred Mandell of Boston, filmmaker Hinda Mandell's parents, have displayed this book upside down on their bookshelf for decades. Fred Mandell's uncle, a Jewish-American soldier, brought home the book from Germany at the end of WWII. With only a bare bones inscription on the inside cover, the filmmakers investigate the power of family lore as they track down the original owners of the Mein Kampf. 'The Upside Down Book' seeks to build bridges between two different families nearly 70 years after the end of WWII.

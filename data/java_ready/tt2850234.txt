Sons of the Sand: The Strini Moodley Interview
###BREAK###
This documentary traces the Strini Moodley story, from early childhood through an interview with family, onto his own experiences as a student activist and playwright. He was banned and then arrested with 13 others, tried under Section 6 of the notorious Terrorism Act and incarcerated on Robben Island in 1976. Sons of the Sand - The Strini Moodley Interview is his last known filmed interview, some of which takes place with Moodley revisiting Robben Island, recalling the continuous battles members of the black consciousness movement waged against the prison administration. Intercut with reminiscing from comrades and family, he is remembered as someone who fought for liberation and a democratic country.

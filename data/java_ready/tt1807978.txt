Bhoot and Friends
###BREAK###
After Raghav's examination, his America-based cousins, Igloo and Roma, come for a visit. The trio then travel to their grandmother's house in Pratapgarh where Raghav introduces his cousins to his polio-stricken friend, Ali, who is quite uninhibited, and almost alienates himself from the visitors. Then things change when they find out that Andrew Gomes and his goons have abducted Ali's father. Their quest to locate him will lead them to confront the abductors as well as get them stranded in a dreaded forest - known to be haunted by a ferocious ghost.

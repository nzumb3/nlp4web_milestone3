As a college senior, Sarah (Alix Kermes) suffers from a broken heart after her boyfriend cheats on her and leaves her. Across campus, Danny (Clayton Snyder) is mending a broken heart of his own after his girlfriend slept with one of his fraternity brothers. While their roommates are having fun with debauchery and sexual promiscuity, Sarah and Danny stay in their respective apartments never to look for love again thanks to the infidelities of their exes. But when their roommates both independently convince them to head to the Gamma Bash with Tiny (David Otunga), Liz (Shelley Regner) Melanie (Amber Rose), and Joe (Cody Calafiore), they realize that college is not only about hot sex and drunken nights. When Sarah and Danny wake up in bed next to each other, they both ask the question... What happened last night?

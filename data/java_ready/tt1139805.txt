The veterinary assistant Ulla have taken her job only for the opportunity to race on the small roads of Värmland. The big farmer's daughter Birgitta dreams about Paris but instead becomes Ulla's map-reader. Roffe has his car workshop across the yard from Eivors café where he is a diligent visitor. Eivor runs the café on the days and sings in the dance-band "Roffes with Eivor" on the evenings. The veterinary, Krook, is the district's big ladies-man. The local newspaper's editor Melin plays the drums in "Roffes with Eivor". Kenta, who works at Roffe's garage, also plays in Roffes dance-bands. Kenta is hugely in love in Ulla, but isn't equally delighted in her interests for car sport.

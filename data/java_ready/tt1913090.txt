Once Upon a Time in the West Bank
###BREAK###
Inspired by his Grandmother's work as a Christian peace activist in Occupied Palestine, Director Nick Gibb travels to Hebron, in The West Bank, to film her work and meet the extended network of peace activists - Muslims, Jews, and Christians - that she works alongside. 'Once Upon A Time In The West Bank' is an evocative, dramatic look at inter-faith co-operation in the quest for a lasting peace in the Land of Abraham, and at the people who see peacemakers as anarchists and traitors, and are willing to risk everything to prevent that peace.

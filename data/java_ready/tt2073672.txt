The Crumbles
###BREAK###
The Crumbles is an indie rock slice-of-life tragicomedy about Darla and Elisa, two best friends struggling with the ups and downs of being in the world's greatest band - that no one has ever heard of. A talented multi-ethnic cast plays a band of young friends stumbling through an uncertain period in life together and coming into their own. The timeless story addresses the universal themes of friendship, artistic passion and commitment. Yet it is also timely, with its own fresh take on pop culture. The film is an artistic collaboration by professional filmmakers who want to tell a story about the passion for life and music. Los Angeles band Quetzal has produced the soundtrack exclusively for The Crumbles.

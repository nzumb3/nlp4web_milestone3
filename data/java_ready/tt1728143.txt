The Land of No Evil
###BREAK###
After 35 years under the Stroessner dictatorship, the corrupt Colorado Party (the only political party allowed after the democratic transition) ruled Paraguay for 17 years. In 2008, Fernando Lugo, a former bishop running for president, represented the country's hope to finally build a better future. This film chronicles the quixotic struggle of Mart√≠n Almada, an internationally recognized human rights activist who discovered the Archives of Terror, as he fights to expose the links between the old dictatorial system and the corrupt democratic government that future president Lugo will inherit.

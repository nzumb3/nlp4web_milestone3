Hunting for Herschell
###BREAK###
It's a story as American as apple pie. Two star-struck boys write a screenplay to honor their great idol, a famous filmmaker who is visiting their small town. They do everything in their power to show it to him, including sneaking into events the filmmaker is attending, posing as caterers, and even brutally murdering anyone who gets in their way. Ok, so maybe it's not as American as apple pie, but that's exactly what happened to the famed Godfather of Gore, Herschell Gordon Lewis. The ink on the newly written screenplay was barely dry when 24 year-old Thomas Montero and Eddie Gagliano began their relentless rampage throughout South Florida, leaving in their wake a cast of cookie-cutter victims perfect for any horror movie. In a gesture of almost divine irony, Mr. Lewis literally uses religion as a defense making him one of the most unique Bible-Thumpers in history.

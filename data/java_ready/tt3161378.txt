City of Tales
###BREAK###
Summer 2012, London: the hyperreal cityscape seems permanently lodged in a fresco forged from David Peace's worst nightmares. Anxiously compelled by their own relentlessly restless daemon Band of Holy Joy ditch the streets and hit the studio to sculpt a trash electronic sequel to their lost never-released 1985 cassette City of Tales. With this comes sequential art house short films to comprise a dark and desperate musical feature film that follows the story of City of Tales. Film set to 5 sequential parts: Traders losses double, I have travelled the buses late at night, Empty Purse Found in Hotel Lobby, Spit like a Porn Star, It just beats up their heart, he said.

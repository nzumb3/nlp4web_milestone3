Moto na Maji
###BREAK###
Moto na Maji documents how an extraordinary international group of religious leaders, social advocates, environmentalists, and artists gathered with local communities at the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, the cradle of humanity, to offer prayers for an awakening of compassion and altruism. An ancient Buddhist ceremony was adapted by Shinnyo-en, the Japanese Buddhist order, to be shared and to be meaningful for everyone. As the clergy, artists, and local communities collaborated, they realized a transcendence of difference and spirit of harmony. The film shares their experience, as sung in Swahili: 'Mother Africa, home to the human soul, we all have one heart, one love. We are all family. We your children return with a gift: a ceremony of fire (awakening).'

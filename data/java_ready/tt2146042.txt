Else to Where

With China's gradual opening up, more and more foreigners are beginning to travel, work, or even settle in China. Beijing, as China's cultural center, with her unique charm attracts people from all over the world. Chinese culture forms an interesting intercourse with the various cultures visitors bring from overseas. We selected foreign girls as the main subjects. I hope we can help the audience to acquire a deeper understanding of this special group by showing their status and attitude to life. Four girls from different countries, with different backgrounds and personalities, they all have distinctive features. Some of their stories make you laugh, some of them make you sigh. I believe the audience will be interested in the exotic customs in Beijing.

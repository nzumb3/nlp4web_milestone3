The wise grandpa and witty granddaughter bless the city with bamboo shoots, while their own home in a rural village is torn down to give way for the high speed railway. They meet other people also jeopardized by the so called development, for example an old artist left homeless because of factory revitalization, the middle class striving for a living, the young generation born in the 1990s. They all try to hold on to the city's collective memory and every living tree.

East
###BREAK###
Sometimes, life takes the most unexpected of turns. When their parents are killed in a tragic accident, Elva and Sammy run away from home; heading East to find a better life. But things don't go to plan and all too soon they're in need of help. Then they meet Tristant, a French man on a journey of his own, who takes them under his wing. In the short time that they have together, an extraordinary bond begins to grow between them in a story which reminds us that life is about the journey, not the destination, and that love is more beautiful, more delicate and sometimes more unexpected than we can ever describe.

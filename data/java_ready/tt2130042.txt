Glitter Dust: Finding Art in Dubai
###BREAK###
Dubai is a city at the cross hairs of explosive growth and crushing economic collapse. The feature documentary Glitter Dust: Finding Art in Dubai follows the city's cultural capital. Three artists come to terms with the true--political and social oppression--and the artificial--indoor ski slopes in the desert. Delightful hand-drawn animations interplay with live footage; art and life are truly intertwined. In turns funny and poignant, this unauthorized documentary explores the human labor, both artistic and otherwise, behind the flash of Dubai.

The present documentary aims to reconstruct in a poetic way the collective trajectory of the members of the Association Paulo Freire, who built under a joint effort, in about ten years, housing for one hundred families in Cidade Tiradentes, on the eastern edge of the city of Sao Paulo. The narrative follows the long process of building construction, since the issue of the land for housing, focusing, in a special way on the paths of some characters. The experience of these people on the task force has as background the transformations in Brazilian society since the late 80s until today.

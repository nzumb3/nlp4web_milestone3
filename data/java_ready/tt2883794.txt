Against the Tide
###BREAK###
Against the Tide reveals the unique lifestyles of retirees, mariners, and misfits who live aboard their boats illegally in Eagle Harbor, the scenic gem of Bainbridge Island, WA. Long a refuge for liveaboards with limited means or wishing for a simpler way of life, Eagle Harbor is a state-owned body of water surrounded by an affluent community torn about whether to drive them out. When Washington state ruled that people anchoring in public waters could only live aboard their boats in the same location for thirty days this decades-old community became guilty of criminal trespass. The liveaboards refuse to move their homes and race against time to see whether Bainbridge Island will allow them to be evicted by the heavy hand of the state.

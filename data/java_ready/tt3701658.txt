Harvest
###BREAK###
Hank Colby moves slow and automatic. A new fence needs digging, wood needs splitting, and wild ginseng grows in the mountains around his home. Harvest shows Hank as he confronts the relentless flow of change. Daily rituals begin to falter when old age, the elusiveness of ginseng, and the specter of faded youth interrupt his day-to-day. Harvest is a film that explores the anti-narrative attributes of cinema and invites the viewer to let their mind wander through the world of this Appalachian mountain man as he arrives at a point in life that we all must face.

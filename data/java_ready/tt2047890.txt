The Woodcarver
###BREAK###
Unable to cope with the squabbles of his divorcing parents, fifteen-year-old Matthew Stevenson takes it out on his church. The old and godly widower whose woodcarvings Matthew trashed takes in the kid as a worker to help repair the damage, which also provides Matthew a quiet harbor in which to consider WWJD (What would Jesus do?). That phrase gets back to and influences his parents as well, and the family that was once disintegrating after turned from God mends.

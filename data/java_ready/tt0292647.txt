Andrew is a real loner. He works as an illustrator at a news paper and his life is pretty okay. But he has one big problem. He is shy. Very shy. Especially with girls. Andrew moves to a small town way up north to isolate himself from the rest of the world. One day he runs into the lovely Sannah. She gets quite curious about this man, who is not like anyone she's ever met before. She soon finds out it's hard to get to know him, or even to get nearby him! Andrew is infatuated with Sannah and fantazises about her but believes there's no chance she will like him if she gets to know him, so he decides it's better they never meet for real...

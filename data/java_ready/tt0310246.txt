This satiric folk comedy offers a moral message. Following Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution, Mrs. Karafiátová (Helena Ruzicková) starts up a travel agency with her family. Their goal is to attract western tourists to their beloved country under the slogan 'Get Away from Europe.' Due to their good-natured naiveté and unwillingness to be dishonest they land themselves in a mess of trouble.

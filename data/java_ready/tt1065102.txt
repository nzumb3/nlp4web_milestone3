Onderhuids tells the separate story of two people, each starting a new office job. Although Gerard and Christine have many exciting plans and ideas, they cannot seem to connect with their respective fellow colleagues. Why is everyone against them? Slowly but surely they lose grip of their lives, inside and outside of the office... Intimately, we follow Gerard's and Christine's changing life, based on personal interviews with real victims of office-harassment.

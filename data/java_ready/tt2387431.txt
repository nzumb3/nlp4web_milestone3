Now heist a man abandoned by society, but he possesses a gift: the perfect photographic memory, but having perfect recall isn't all it's cracked up to be. A covert government agency headed by Rez's old mentor Haycock - played by Anthony Murphy (Charlie Casanova, Dawn of the Dragonslayer) has stolen a device called 'Titus'; a machine that has the ability to send a person eight hours into the future, but only for a short period. The organisation is making millions by recording advance knowledge of the stock market, heisting the future eight hours at a time. One day Rez leaps forward in time and witnesses a nuclear explosion. As he jumps back to his own time-line, events begin to spiral out of control as he only has eight hours to discover the cause, save his estranged daughter and a city, unaware it's about to be destroyed.

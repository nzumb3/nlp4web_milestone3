Waiting for Change
###BREAK###
Bradley finds out that our government is not doing much in the way of helping Homless. He sees that most homeless people are lazy and wont doing any thing to get a job and change. However he does meet people that have no choice and are stuck being homeless. Many people with jobs and house have mixed feelings about it and don't know how they can help. It seems the only answer is in small organized groups that change will be done to the homeless people.

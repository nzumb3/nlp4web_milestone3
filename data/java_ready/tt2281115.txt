When the Rodeo comes to Doomadgee, there is palpable excitement. With a community of over 1,200, the rodeo is an annual event that doubles the population and has everyone talking. We witness the community collectively pulling the event together. The riders, the animals, the spectators, the commentators, the side-shows and the stall vendors each take their place on the Rodeo stage. The documentary is based in the outback Queensland town of Doomadgee. Our storyteller, Alec Doomadgee, grew up in the bush. Not only does he share his name with his home country but he cares passionately for the community and improving the lives of his people, particularly the youngsters. Alec understands the positive impact the Rodeo brings to his people and has been going to the Rodeo for as long as he can remember. But this year he wants to really get to know the young riders and help where he can. Some will be riding in their first rodeo while others are already aspiring champions with a real chance at not just Indigenous rodeo, but Australian and even international championships. As the documentary builds to the riding events, we inter-cut with back-stories to develop interest and tension in our key characters. We discover where the riders live; what they do for a living; how they got into Rodeo; what their first ride was like; how they prepare for an event; what they love about Rodeo and what their aspirations are. The history of Australian Rodeo is interwoven with the characters own history. The rodeo rider is often associated with Wild West Cowboys; commonly portrayed in a male, non-Indigenous world. However, this film reveals there is an exciting Indigenous Rodeo scene in Australia; which not only has a positive effect on the community but is also cultivating champion worthy, male and female, rodeo talent.

Hold Me Thrill Me Kiss Me
###BREAK###
Eli is a burglar who is caught in the act by Twinkle, a crazy heiress who coerces him into a sexual relationship. Their violent break-up at the altar makes him a fugitive in search of a new identity. He lands in a trashy trailer park where he touches the lives of several dysfunctional residents. Two of them are adult buxom woman, who's somewhat interested in Eli, and her young teen sister, who's still a virgin. The impressionable teen falls for Eli hard to which he reciprocates, so the kid decides to run away with him even if it means getting her big sister out of the way first.

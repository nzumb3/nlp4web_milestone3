The Boars Head Documentary
###BREAK###
The film itself is a weird and wonderful look at how important a community run venue is to the community it serves. The award-winning Boars Head in Kidderminster is not only a public house, but also an art gallery and one of the few music venues left in the region. It tells the story of Sid & Sandra, their slightly eccentric punters, plus a vibrant assortment of indie bands, poets and DJs that regularly perform there. The venue is also home to a unique art gallery above the pub that exhibits the work of many up-and-coming and established artists. The film features live performances from The Cracked Actors, Stiff Joints, OPM, Drongos For Europe and many more. There is also an exclusive interview with Ranking Roger from the Beat. What Bazz and Mike have found most pleasing is the willingness of everyone who has been involved in this film and this itself proves that community venues do still exists and can still remain the heart of a community even when society is going through such difficult times.

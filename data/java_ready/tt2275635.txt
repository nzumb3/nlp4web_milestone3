Decade of Dominance
###BREAK###
Every year the world's best paddleboarders gather in Hawaii to contest the World Championship of Paddleboarding. To claim the world title the winner must cross one of the world's most treacherous bodies of water, the 32 mile Ka'iwi channel, aptly named the 'channel of bones'. Since 2002 Jamie Mitchell has made the world title his an incredible nine times. One more victory would cap off a perfect decade of dominance in one of the world's toughest events. Decade of Dominance follows Jamie as he prepares for and contests the most important race of his life. To win he will have to overcome not only the competition but also the 'channel of bones' and all that she can throw at him. Directed by Brent Deal.

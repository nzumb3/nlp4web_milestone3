The World Again

There are five of them: Maria, Eleni, Giorgos and Yannis. They are around fifteen years old and so far everything has gone wrong. They are all kids from institutions. Everything, except for their friendship. So, when the time comes that Eleni wants to track down her mother at all costs, they all set off on the journey together. In search of their personal past they will rediscover "the distant past of the world". So these unlucky creatures will end up becoming the favorites of gods, the ones who will find, through the power of friendship, the road that leads to beauty.

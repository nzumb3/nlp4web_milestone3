Engels: On My Way... Someway, Somehow
###BREAK###
This film is about Engels, the artist. He was born in Haiti. He has lived and worked in Brooklyn, New York for the past 25 years. His journey is truly remarkable in that he has always done his art. No day job. This film will explore this remarkable journey from Haiti to him recently being asked to the Florence Biennale. It will also explore how Engels creates himself for the world stage and how he shares with so many his personal enchanting world while also creating a true sense of community. He gives us a chance to be apart of his art; a connection that is not high-tech and fast paced but rather experiential, meaningful and requires participation.

Be Home Soon: Letters from My Grandfather
###BREAK###
A documentary about war and faith, love and loss, family myth and legacy - based on family letters from the patriarch who volunteered as a Chaplain in WWII in the Philippines, survived the Bataan Death March and died as a Japanese Prisoner of War. More poem than biopic or World War II documentary, Be Home Soon is a beautifully told and gorgeous lyrical testament which touches a universal nerve in its exploration of war and devotion - a meditation in motion on grace, memory and healing. Using letters, archival footage and stills, animation and present day footage, the film is poignant, thought-provoking and historically informative.

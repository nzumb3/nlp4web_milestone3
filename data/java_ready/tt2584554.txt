A Viagem Auton√≥mica
###BREAK###
The theme of autonomy chosen for the final piece of the theater course lead Goncalo Cabral on a journey looking for figures, documents, institutions and aspirations that defined the essential moments of the construction of the autonomous regime in the Azores. With a backpack and his old motorcycle, he traveled throughout the 9 islands to consult files, meet characters and protagonists. This Autonomous journey builds a play of what it was, and of what it still is, to live in the Azores. It is a geographical and sentimental journey made by a young man looking for the history of his homeland, its collective identity and the definition of what it means to be Azorean.

Engel mit nur einem Fl√ºgel
###BREAK###
Six members of the Gothic-Scene and the ghost of a pink bathrobe try to manage everyday life. They are confronted with problems, everybody knows (making the dishes, non-smoking areas, shopping and the own death). The movie is a persiflage to the prejudice about members of the Gothic-Scene. The characters make the stereotypes come true and because of that, everything they try to do, becomes a disaster.

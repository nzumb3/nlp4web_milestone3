Some 9 years ago, Walter Karl is convicted for the brutal murder of 11-year-old Annie Gordon and sentenced to 17 years in prison. Now, out early for good behaviour, his release sends shock waves through the city. The result is a marvelous moral contemplation of society's standards, citizen's rights, courage for the sake of love and the path to redemption.

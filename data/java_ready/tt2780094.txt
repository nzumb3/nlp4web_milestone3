Haunted House: Demon Poltergeist
###BREAK###
For those who think that Ghosts and Spirits aren't real, this is a Ghost Investigation that will change their minds forever. The team from Haunted Events UK are called in to a 400 year old, three story, Victorian house on old High Street in Sutton Town, England - allegedly the most haunted area of Britain. Abandoned by the previous occupier due to alarming Poltergeist activity, the team enters the house to find it a wreck, strewn with objects scattered by the entities dwelling within its walls. Quickly, the team's medium is in touch with the Poltergeist who makes its presence known as a chair slides across the floor before their eyes, not once, but several times and on command. Unnerved but determined, the team moves around the house only to be bombarded by flying objects, lifting tables and two members of the team are even pushed to the floor. A never before filmed series of events occur, making this one of the most terrifying ghost hunts you will ever see. Witness flying objects, noises, thermal heat sources and experience strange forces working to warn the team to leave the residence by pushing over an investigator and leaving behind an actual thermal apparition.

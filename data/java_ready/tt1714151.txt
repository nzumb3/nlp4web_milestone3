Three Shadows
###BREAK###
An ancient vampire, an immortal man, and a mysterious old house. These are the terrors we face in Director Ansel Faraj's Gothic horror trilogy. Kevin Shayer stars in all three, as Nosferatu, the vampire who has lived for over 900 years searching for his lost love in the first tale Nosferatu Beyond Death; Then as the elusive Dorian Grey, who's true rotting visage is displayed on a painting hidden away from prying eyes in The Picture of Dorian Grey, from Oscar Wilde's novel; and finally as Abner Whateley, a young man who inherits a decaying mansion which harbors something not altogether human in The Shuttered Room, based on the story by H.P. Lovecraft. Three Shadows is a journey into the forgotten horrors of old.

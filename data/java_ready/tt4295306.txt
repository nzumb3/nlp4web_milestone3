Living Dot Com shows how a different approach to work must be taken in this new economy in order to succeed. Jobs maybe disappearing but, for many reason discussed in this movie, there has never been an easier or better time to start a business. Creativity is king as many tasks that were expensive (and good jobs) in the past are now low cost due to automation and outsourcing. This documentary gives an intimate look into the lives of successful Internet entrepreneurs. You will discover how it is now possible to earn over a million dollars a year online, work from the beach during winters, close deals while at a BBQ, or run a business from an IPhone. This new wave of entrepreneurs truly leverage technology to live a 21st century lifestyle or, as they call it, the "Dot Com Lifestyle."

Frammenti Della Vita: Jefferson Rubin
###BREAK###
Filmed in Italy and Colorado, this documentary, produced by CPT12PBS, reveals the fascinating life story of neo-classical sculptor Jefferson Rubin. Jefferson named the male and female torsos that he created Frammenti. His work was at once classical and contemporary. Jefferson D. Rubin was a brilliant young artist whose humanistic and classical art embraced the poetry of sculpture that descends from ancient and Renaissance antecedents. A Colorado native, he studied and worked in the United States and Italy, and was founder, director, and principal teacher of La Scuola Classical Sculpture School in Denver. Rubin exhibited in galleries and museums across the country and abroad, and his rare pieces are prized in many private collections. He died in a tragic mountain accident in August 1995 at the age of 36.

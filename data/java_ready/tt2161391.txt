Knight Knight
###BREAK###
Camelot is closed, King Arthur is dead and the Round Table is no more. Trainee knights GILBERT (a highly-strung hypochondriac) and EDGAR (an up-beat Christian) find themselves wandering the land in the company of a MYSTERIOUS KNIGHT in search of money, adventure and comfortable underwear. When the mysterious knight dies (mysteriously) Gilbert and Edgar find themselves in possession of a letter addressed to him from a certain KING KENDRICK, entreating him to help rescue his recently kidnapped daughter KATRINA. The letter comes with a bag of gold. Gilbert and Edgar act at once... they spend the gold. One pair of pants and a saint's kneecap later, the two knights are once again on their uppers. Whilst drowning their sorrows in a village grog shack, however, the two men get wind of an employment opportunity in the local castle of KING VINCENT of Essex. They make their way to the castle and are immediately hired as security guards. Their jobs, however, are a little less than chivalrous, as it transpires that their main duty is to guard the recently abducted Princess Katrina, King Vincent's bride-to-be. Far from being the damsel in distress of legend Princess Katrina is in fact a violent, foul-mouthed bully who harangues Gilbert into agreeing to help rescue her. Edgar, meanwhile, is approached by Katrina's altogether more pleasant (and comely) sister RACHAEL who appeals to Edgar's sense of decency and he too agrees to help. Sworn to secrecy, the two hapless knights begin separate (and misguided) plans to rescue Princess Katrina whilst trying to avoid the various unpleasant inhabitants of the castle. Can the two knights escape this casserole of intrigue? Can they rescue the Princess and put pay to the wicked king? KNIGHT KNIGHT is a tale of saddle-sore knights, castle politics and black pudding. A tale of love, friendship and adventure that didn't quite make it into the history books.

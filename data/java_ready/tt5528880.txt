Lives Well Lived
###BREAK###
What is the definition of a Life Well Lived? We asked forty people aged 75-100 with a collective life experience of 3000 years who shared with us their secrets, wit, and wisdom. Forty voices, one shared history of lives well lived. The Lives Well Lived project captures the images, ideas and ideals of those who are proving that aging is something to cherish, not dread. That retirement doesn't mean you retire from life. And that growing older doesn't mean growing silent.

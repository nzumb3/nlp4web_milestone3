Forbidden Peace
###BREAK###
Almost daily, we are bombarded with images from Israel; graphic portrayals of violence permeate our media and our minds. Yet these pictures don't tell the whole story. Beyond the bloodshed and despite decades of hostility, Israelis and Palestinians are joining hands and forging a peace agreement long thought forbidden. While the world cries out for a solution to end the conflict that grips the Middle East, these people have found true peace, not in a political plan, but in a person ...... Forbidden Peace offers a powerful, poignant and positive perspective you are unlikely to find anywhere else...straight from the hearts of Israelis and Palestinians who have put their trust in Jesus and found true shalom. You are invited to join them as they share how, despite fierce opposition, they have chosen to follow Jesus and how He has brought about reconciliation in every sense of the word.

More Than the Rainbow

As it chronicles the life and times of street photographer and former cabbie Matt Weber, More Than The Rainbow becomes a vibrant conversation about the photographic medium, artistic expression and NYC. Set to wonderful jazz and drenched in evocative images, the film is bittersweet and nostalgic from beginning to end.

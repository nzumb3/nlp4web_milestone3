Call from the Other Shore
###BREAK###
Maruvili (Call from the Other Shore) is an attempt of a poet-turned-filmmaker to portray the life and poetic idiom of one of his great predecessors, Attoor Ravivarma who is a distinct genius during the Modernist era of Indian poetry.  Avoiding the usual descriptive forms, the film evolves through multiple layering of visualizations that includes various landscapes, festivals and journeys connected with Attoor's poetic world, a number of gatherings and conversations of Attoor critics and two generations of poets who are influenced or inspired by him, readings and audio-visual performances of Attoor poems by poets and theatre personalities using diverse styles and devices and so on. Multi-facet visual representations of this 90 minutes' Documentary span from Attoor Ravivarma's early memories to the live recordings of Video Conferences by fellow writers across the globe.

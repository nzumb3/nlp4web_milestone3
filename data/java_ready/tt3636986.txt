Women & Spirit: Catholic Sisters in America
###BREAK###
A documentary featuring interviews with historians, journalists and sister. This film brings to life the inspiring, virtually untold, 300-year story of Catholic women religious who have greatly and at times sacrificially contributed to the American landscape. It examines the courage (mostly quiet but at times outspoken), entrepreneurial spirit, and indomitable faith exercised by these women during many dramatic moments in U.S. history.

Night Shift
###BREAK###
"When 'Office Time' employee, Lee, volunteers to switch over from days to the night shift with his best friend, lazy but well-intentioned slacker, James, he finds more than he bargained for! The new night crew tandem is faced with quitting employees, Psychotic customers, mutual feelings for the brash and vivacious Constance, keeping their meddling friends at bay, and trying to get a little bit of work done! Nothing the night shift has to offer is more difficult, however, than avoiding the watchful eye of their overbearing manager, Brock. When James and Lee get put together on the "Night Shift", they learn one thing that's certain. They have a lot to learn about each other in this comedy that's funny day or night!"

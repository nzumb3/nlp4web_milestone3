The Fired Workers
###BREAK###
When the nationwide general strike in Korea hit world news this year, video activists at Labor News Production were hard at work recording events around the country. The Fired Workers, a new documentary from this group, projects the voices of workers fired for their activities in the labor union or political movements since the 1980s. Opening with the shocking 1991 suicide of a fired activist, interviews and footage of demonstrations, hunger strikes, and other acts of protest show how the struggle against government control and corporate abuse took place.

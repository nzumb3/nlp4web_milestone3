Dragons of Camelot
###BREAK###
The Kingdom of Camelot is plunged into darkness after the death of noble King Arthur, as the reign of his cruel sorceress sister, Morgan, begins. Commanding three deadly dragons with her dark magic, she hunts the remaining Knights of the Round Table to the ends of the Earth. Galahad realises that in order to succeed, they must find his father, Lancelot, who has been in exile for years. Only then will they be able to journey back to Camelot, defeat Morgan and her dragons, and rescue the Lady Guinevere and the wizard, Merlin.Â Galahad, Lancelot, Percival and the other brave knights of the ancient order of legend make their perilous journey across hundreds of miles of treacherous terrain, facing hardships and danger at every turn, on an epic quest based on the classic tale of King Arthur and his loyal knights.

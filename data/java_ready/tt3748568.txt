"De Pleintjes" is a documentary about Antwerp's street football culture. Rough areas such as Het Kiel, Borgerhout, Deurne and Stuivenberg are the backdrops to the social lives of thousands of youngsters. It's these areas where they grow up, learn about the world, and above all, dream of a better future.

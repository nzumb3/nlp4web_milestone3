Lunar Girl
###BREAK###
A music driven feature tinged with magic and special effects. Lunar Girl is the story of 'Bebette' a young naive dreamer. When her artistic and unconventional behaviour is interpreted by the authorities as disruptive and antisocial, she is projected from the beauty and security of her dream world into a bleak and sometimes frightening reality.

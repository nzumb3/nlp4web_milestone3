Greening of the Bronx
###BREAK###
The Bronx, NY is the poorest congressional district in the United States, with the highest poverty, unemployment, and asthma (including death by asthma) rates in the State of New York. Environmental justice groups like Sustainable South Bronx are working to try to reduce health, economic, and environmental injustice problems in the Bronx through 'green jobs' programs that positively impact individuals' lives and the community. This documentary will follow participants as they go through the SSBX 'BEST ECO' and 'B4B' training programs and follow their lives as they try to make the hopeful jump to a better life for themselves and the Bronx community.

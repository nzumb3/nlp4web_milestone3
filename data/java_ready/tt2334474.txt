Earhart's Electra: Eyewitness Accounts of What Happened to Amelia Earhart's Plane
###BREAK###
In June of 1944, US Marines liberating Saipan found Amelia Earhart's Electra. This film features a few of them, interviewed at different times over the past ten years (3 have since passed). The research in the documentary reflects a 20 year journey that included working on Diane Keaton's TNT film, as well as Hilary Swank's Fox Feature "Amelia." The story of what happened to Earhart and her plane has never been fully told, at least on film, and this is the first time these men were interviewed on camera about what they saw.

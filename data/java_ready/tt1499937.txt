###BREAK###
Ibrahim left his family to try his luck in Tehran. But in this asphalt jungle where everything can be bought and sold a dream can easily become a nightmare. Involved into the traffic of new-born children, Ibrahim plunges into the city seedy areas, in Tehroun. This film noir gives a caustic portrait of modern Iran.

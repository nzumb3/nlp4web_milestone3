874 Miles
###BREAK###
Thirty-something Londoner, Will Parker's, average life is shattered when he receives a terminal diagnosis. With little time remaining, Will abandons everything to embark on a voyage of self-discovery. Following in his Father's footsteps (or bike-tracks), Will attempts to complete what his Father failed to finish: a bicycle journey from Land's End in Cornwall to John O'Groats in the Scottish Highlands. Will's final desperate wish is to make it from sea to sea - 874 Miles.

Naturens Klovner: 10 Ã¥r med Fisjing!
###BREAK###
From the time they were "little rascals", the fishing-buddies Geir Kjernet and Lars-Erik Lie have spent most of the summer on fishing trips. This documentary brings ten years of fishing in 60 minutes. Battle against the elements, scary insects, annoying - small fish, and nature itself. They are indeed "the clowns of nature". This film brings you the best and wildest fishing adventures. Big pike, trout, grayling and whitefish from Trysil and Engerdal in Norway, and in some of the big lakes just across the Swedish border. Clowns of Nature goes all the way.

The Polar Explorer
###BREAK###
Sought by explorers for centuries as a possible trade route, Canada's Northwest Passage was first navigated by Norwegian Roald Amundsen in 1903-1906, a true polar explorer. Amundsen was the first man to reach the South Pole as well. Until 2009, the Arctic pack ice prevented regular marine passage throughout most of the year, but climate change has reduced the pack ice, and this Arctic shrinkage has made the waterways more navigable. Mark Terry's latest polar adventure explores the Passage on a three-week scientific expedition taking place on the aptly named icebreaker, the Amundsen. Studying the effects of climate change in this Arctic region, in general, and discovering new life on the ocean seabed and other previously inaccessible areas of the Arctic seas, in particular, is the focus of this one-hour HD documentary. This historic journey, featuring the work of many of the world's foremost polar scientists, is the highlight of a film that also compares and contrasts these findings with the latest studies being conducted at the other end of the earth - Antarctica. New scientific discoveries being made related to climate change this year in Antarctica are included to provide a unique comparison of current climate change research at both ends of the earth. In addition to showing how warmer temperatures are affecting the speed of melting glaciers, icebergs, pack ice and floes, an examination of the drastically changing eco-systems in both areas is presented. The film and its findings were invited by the United Nations Environment Programme to present to delegates attending COP16, the Climate Change Conference in Cancun in December, 2010. Will this film influence policy-makers and result in a new resolution being adopted? This question is answered in the film's dramatic conclusion.

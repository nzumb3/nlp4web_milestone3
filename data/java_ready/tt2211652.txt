Sober
###BREAK###
We all have those people in our lives that are full of themselves. They think that they know everything there is to know or that they're always right. Meet Calandra Johnston, a freshman at Stratum High School. After an embarrassing rejection in middle school, Calandra is looking forward to a new start. She hopes that she'll finally find love. Instead, she finds Glen Holbrooke, a thoughtful boy who seems to say the things everyone else is too afraid to. The two become close friends and Calandra is hopeful about their future. But it seems like Glen doesn't want to be a part of Calandra's fantasy. One moment, they're the best of pals, and the next he's humiliating her. Something's off about him. Glen is hiding something. And when Calandra can't figure it out, she cuts him out of her life. After all, he didn't really matter, right? Everyone has their problems. Everyone has their desires that they will do anything to satisfy. Everyone has an opinion on what's right and what's wrong. But all too often, people get lost in that. They say things and do things that they don't really mean. They act like they're drunk, and sometimes they end up hurting the people they care about. So I offer you a new approach. A new way of thinking where instead of judging others, we act out of compassion. Where instead of intoxicating ourselves with our own opinions we are... sober.

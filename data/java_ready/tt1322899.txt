Chasing the Devil: Inside the Ex-Gay Movement
###BREAK###
This is the Ex-Gay Movement, one of the most politically incorrect subcultures in America. Form the face of the Ex-Gay Movement, charismatic reparative therapist Richard Cohen, to John Sterback, inspired to embrace his own reorientation, to the Ex-Gay ministries where Joanne Highley preaches to Peterson Toscano that demons are the cause of homosexuality, and exorcisms are the preferred form of treatment. With unprecedented access, award-winning filmmakers Bill Hussung and Mishara Canino-Hussung provide an empathetic and at times devastating portrait of those who claim homosexuality is a sin that can be healed. Chasing the Devil reveals the extreme lengths that some people will go to deny the truth to enable them to fit into a culture that shuns them.

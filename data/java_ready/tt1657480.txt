Uncle Louie
###BREAK###
Benny Miccicci is in trouble with a demonic loan-shark. He is reluctant to get his girlfriend, Bernice, involved in his dilemma, however she comes to his rescue by invoking help from his dark side. Uncle Louie, a notorious hit-man from Buffalo, long dispatched from this earth, is summoned to help his hapless nephew and take charge of his situation... sort of... Uncle Louie is a dark comedy... An urban fairy tale. It deals with hope, despair and family secrets. This Indie Film invokes the slight-of-hand of Voodoo, Christianity, Eastern Mysticism and answers, or presumes to answer, the riddles of the cosmos.

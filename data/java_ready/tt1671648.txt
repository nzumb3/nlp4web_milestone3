Mirror of Happiness
###BREAK###
This is a story about love and economics situated in Istanbul. Two anti-heroes run away to Istanbul from Paris. They are momentarily embraced by the Turkish fashion scene. Then hunted down by unknown assassins. Then seek a new kind of paradise by the sea. However their paradise is polluted. Or perhaps everything is a fiction of their imagination, and they never leave their hotels. Ghosts as doubles of the two main characters are featured. Dancers create allegorical scenarios that relate to the narrative of the film. In the beginning it appears to be loosely based on the Jean-Luc Godard film, 'Pierrot Le Fou.' But other stories are quickly woven into the plot.

Electric Signs
###BREAK###
ELECTRIC SIGNS is a poetic and timely documentary about signs, screens and the urban environment. The film examines our public spaces, which have become highly controlled and dominated by advertising, and makes connections between light, perception, and the culture of attractions in today's consumer society. Understanding this economy of signs is vital for understanding the culture of cities.

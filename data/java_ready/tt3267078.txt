Tanzt! 3D
###BREAK###
"DANCE! 3D" Why do people become professional dancers? What unites and distinguishes hip-hop, break-dance and ballet? Is a city like e.g. Dortmund having a motion by its own? And are the people who live in it influenced by this motion? Choreographer XinPengWang is searching for the "beat" of the city in which he lives in and is trying to bring this "beat" on stage. DANCE! Is a story about joy, fear and the passion for dancing!

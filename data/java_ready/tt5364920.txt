###BREAK###
Yuva is a young rebel, who aims to be the boss of everyone. Street-smart and intelligent, he does not want to be the Good Samaritan like Bhagat Singh that his mother wants him to be. His dreams and aspirations make him take some 'wrong' choices. But, his journey makes him understand what's good and what's not.

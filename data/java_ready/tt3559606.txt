###BREAK###
One Band Indivisible is an intimate portrait of the trials and tribulations of the students in a the charismatic show-style high school marching band of an historically African-American high school in Durham, North Carolina. The documentary focuses on four students and captures hot summer band camps, nerve wracking auditions, the routine of practices, the excitement of half time shows at football games, glittering national championships and the fan fare of street parades. Funding is tough but the parents make it happen, and the band director pulls it all together.

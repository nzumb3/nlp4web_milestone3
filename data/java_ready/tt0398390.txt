White Rainbow is the story of four remarkable women and their struggle to overcome the stigma and brutal reality of widowhood in modern Indian society. In the story, the protagonist Priya, is an educated, affluent young woman who is tragically widowed. Despondent, alone and desperate, she seeks unlikely solace in Vrindavan, the "city of widows." Priya meets the streetwise Roop who has spent 30 years making her own way in this temple town with its dirty secrets. She encounters gentle Mala tragically disfigured by her mother-in-law and young Deepti, forced into servitude and an underground sex trade run by the Panda priest. Together, this disparate group forms a deep bond and begin to see the power of their own conviction to take charge of their own fate. But, their journey is not without adversity and tragedy from a system dominated by men who prosper from the exploitation of India's most disenfranchised citizens. In the end, Priya comes to realize that, "Her destiny was to change their fate!"

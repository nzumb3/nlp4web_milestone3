Periphery
###BREAK###
Periphery: Videos 1-3 are the first installments in an ongoing documentary project chronicling the personal experiences of Americans - New Yorkers mostly - and their specific responses to world events. The first part was filmed 5 weeks after September 11, 2001 and part two was filmed in July of 2002. The project evolved as a response to what can be described as media complicity in creating a seemingly endless war, a war that is inextricably linked to private interests but is couched in patriotic fervor. The video explores how ordinary people - not WTC workers, widows or firemen - cope with the new, immediate aspects of a changed world.

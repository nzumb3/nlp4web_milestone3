Warm Beer, Lousy Food is the untold story of America's first comedy club, the Crazy Country Club in Brooklyn, and its founder and self-proclaimed nut, Lou Burdo. The film includes rare footage of the club throughout its nearly 50 year history and testimonials from the founder, staff, and patrons, breathing life back into a storied institution that, despite having been shuttered long ago, continues to live on for the many people who were forever changed by this wonderful and crazy place.

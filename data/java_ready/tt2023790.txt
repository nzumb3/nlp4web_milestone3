Organized around the principle of a tidal wave, the content of the video was shot with the participation of more than 170 visitors during a three-month residency at Recess Activities, Inc., a unique artist program/ gallery space in Manhattan.

The resulting video is a complex but cohesive experimental narrative about the experience of being overwhelmed. It is made up of interviews, reenactments, and performances conceived of in collaboration with visitors.

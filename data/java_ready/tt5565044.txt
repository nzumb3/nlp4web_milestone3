Loosely based on the "Cassandra" myth, in which a woman's predictions are not heeded, this feature film follows the comic misfortunes of a woman named Sandy as she seeks a job and possibly love. As a novice fortune-teller, Sandy superstitiously finds good-luck symbols in everyday life and believes that omens determine the path to take. Though she meets many odd characters to whom she gives accurate counsel, she unfortunately misreads her own future and greets the unexpected with continued trepidation. Even after a number of ridiculous job interviews and disastrous dates, she sustains her positive outlook despite things not being what they appear.

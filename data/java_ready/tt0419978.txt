Mothers and Daughters
###BREAK###
A black comedy set in the contrasting worlds of a dilapidated North London council house, a middle class dinner party in a Fulham mansion block and an expensive psychiatrist's couch. Drug fuelled sex with a vicar and lustful longings for other women, are there some things a girl shouldn't share with her mother?

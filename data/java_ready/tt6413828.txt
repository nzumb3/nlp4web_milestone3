Karenina & I
###BREAK###
Norwegian actress GØRILD MAUSETH is challenged by the almost impossible task of playing ANNA KARENINA in a language she never spoke and in the author's home country. She embarks on a journey to learn Russian and discover the real reasons why Tolstoy (LIAM NEESON) wrote the novel. What Gørild does not know is that Anna Karenina will become the role of her life and change her forever.

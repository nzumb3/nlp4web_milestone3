Palace of Glass
###BREAK###
A docu-fiction set around an international children's film festival in India. A festival of films, for kids. So we have kids, coming in from all across the state to the capital to watch films. They will be taken around the city, to various cinemas, multiplexes, open air screenings and near dead theatres. Teachers in charge, the girls and boys, the media, theatre crew with their extra hours...got us thinking, this is a great setting for some 'slice of life'.

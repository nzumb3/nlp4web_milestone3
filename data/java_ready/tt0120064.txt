Sapatos Pretos
###BREAK###
Dalila is a middle-age, married woman who is still attractive, too attractive, for her rural husband - who is proud to show her off, but awfully jealous of her. Her trips to the capital to see a doctor (she thinks she has breast cancer) put her in contact with flashy clothes, and shoes, and then she goes wild. She will lead a young truck driver into lust, and worse sins, as Dalila progresses from white shoes to red shoes, and then, fatal black shoes.

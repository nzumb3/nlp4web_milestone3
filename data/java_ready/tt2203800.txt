White Buffalo: An American Prophecy
###BREAK###
From the opening scene - the appearance of a Divine Feminine Spirit to the Lakota centuries ago - WHITE BUFFALO: An American Prophecy follows the journey of four brothers. In their search for both the Indigenous wisdom of Turtle Island and a greater personal understanding and inner peace, they are an EVERYfamily. Invited into Sweat Lodges in Arizona and South Dakota, engaging in Pipe ceremonies with their Native hosts, the Brothers talk and argue and question among themselves. They listen to the wisdom of the Grandmothers on Pine Ridge Reservation, participate in a Fire Ceremony with Mayan Emissaries, and are blessed by Hopi Elders and a Chasidic rabbi. They speak with Cynthia Hart-Button, founder of the Sacred World Peace Alliance Founder, who guards a herd of White Buffalo in Bend, Oregon. The Brothers commune at the spot where Crazy Horse and Sitting Bull used to pray atop Bear Butte, South Dakota. They encounter Lightning, a Sacred White Buffalo, on a luxury resort in Pennsylvania. They spend a day on the Texas ranch with Sitting Bull's great-great grandson, Arby Little Soldier, and the White Buffalo Lightning Medicine Cloud, whose brief life is so brutally extinguished. Will the Brothers achieve their own family healing? Can the family of mankind learn to live in peace, harmony, and mutual respect? The film ends where it began - with the promised return of White Buffalo Calf Woman. WHITE BUFFALO: An American Prophecy is funny and tragic. It confronts a disintegrating social order with the hopeful vision of a new and harmonious epoch. It informs as well as entertains. In challenging viewers to embark on their own journey, WHITE BUFFALO: An American Prophecy aspires to contribute to the spiritual acceleration of the planet and the mending of the sacred hoop. For after all, are we not all Indigenous to this small planet?

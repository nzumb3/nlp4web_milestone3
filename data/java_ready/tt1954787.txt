Roger Pelerin, là où l'on s'arrête en passant
###BREAK###
Roger Pelerin, is a brilliant artist who left the city to establish himself on the Island of Nepawa, in the deepest corners of Abitibi, to live an atypical life and work on his craft without selling out. Over the course of four seasons, we see him labor his masterpiece: a magnificent book of prints illustrating the story of his island, its simple and honest residents, and its natural beauty - a source of profound inspiration. The result is a beautiful portrait of an uncompromising artist and his very human experiences of ups and downs, small setbacks and infinite joys.

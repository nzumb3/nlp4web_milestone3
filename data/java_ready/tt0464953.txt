Craig Wilson is a forty-five year old corporate attorney in Bangkok, Thailand. He attended Yale University and Harvard Law School. Craig also happens to be an amateur boxer who routinely fights opponents half his age. Affectionately dubbed "farang ba", he does this despite having had his entire colon removed, having to wear an ileostomy bag, and having defeated cancer.

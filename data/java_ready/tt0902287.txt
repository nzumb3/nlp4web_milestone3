###BREAK###
GRINDIN' is an over the top comedy about T.O., a successful working actor who falls from Hollywood grace in the midst of livin' it up. With an inability to focus on his artistic pursuits, T.O. is constantly distracted by everything "fun under the sun." Surrounded by a cast of hilarious yet distracting characters and fearing he may never see the view from the top again, T.O. searches for the inspiration that will motivate him to once again unleash his talent and set the Hollywood scene on fire. T.O. learns that throughout it all, some things, like hard work and a will to triumph, will always remain the winning formula for success.

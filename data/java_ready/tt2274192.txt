Danger Falls
###BREAK###
A western about Adam, the son of a wealthy railroad tycoon, kidnapped by two men named Steve - who are followed through the woods by bounty hunters, lawmen and Adam's lover (riddled with guilt over his possible involvement in the abduction). Things take a strange turn when supernatural forces intervene, and a deserted village is discovered on the other side of a waterfall - at which point it becomes more of a mad scientist film about a deranged clockmaker.

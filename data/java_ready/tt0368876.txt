Moving Malcolm
###BREAK###
Over a year after bit actress Liz Woodward leaves him at the altar, comedy writer Gene Maxwell is still having trouble dealing with the situation and his life. Writing "Fear Knot", a novel about letting go of one's fears to be able to tie the knot, which he obviously wrote for Liz but which she has yet to read, probably didn't help. Unexpectedly, Liz, who he has not seen since that day, returns with an unusual request: help her father, Malcolm Woodward, move from his dingy basement suite into an apartment, as she has a movie assignment in Prague during when he has to move. After initially feeling the request unreasonable considering the circumstances, Gene agrees on what he considers compassionate grounds for Malcolm. Through it all, Gene has to deal with: what he thinks Liz's return means, which he, deep in his heart, hopes is a reconciliation; the advice of his overbearing parents, George and Gisha, and of his best friend, dance instructor Herbert; and cantankerous ex-pat Brit Malcolm himself, who initially does not want Gene around, but who ends up relying and confiding in the one person who is there for him during his own time of need, especially as he deals with a secret he does not want Liz of all people to know.

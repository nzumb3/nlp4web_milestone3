God's Forgotten Town
###BREAK###
Julia, a reporter for a paranormal magazine is sent to investigate strange phenomena in a Spanish 'ghost town.' She and her small film crew go to Manas√©s, an abandoned village where all the inhabitants disappeared under mysterious circumstances, just weeks before the end of the Second World War. All the villagers disappeared one night shortly after a German plane crashed nearby. Julia had always been a skeptic, but having recently witnessed a suicide-homicide of a mother and daughter who had claimed to be haunted by spirits, she is now sensitive to the supernatural and soon witnesses the horrors that happened on that night in 1945. But will they happen again?

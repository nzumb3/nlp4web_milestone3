Lexicon Devil
###BREAK###
Lexicon Devil tells the story of one of Los Angeles' seminal punk bands: The Germs, and their iconic singer Darby Crash. The Germs did not single handedly created a West Coast Punk sound or that they never progressed past smeared peanut butter and noisy sets, but they surely claimed their stake in the punk rock history. Lexicon Devil is an oral history of a time just past glitter and right before hardcore, of a place where for the first time, a generation of kids stood up to take what they believed they were owed a stage and an audience.

Huang jin dao shi
###BREAK###
a kung fu master coming from the tradition of the HEAVEN AND EARTH SOCIETY, rents a loft to teach his students. Coinciding with his open mind, sooner starts contacts with previous occupants, a ghost wedlock, both higly skilled in chinesse boxing, but with a opressed wife that slowly evolves to a much better situation. I really wouldnt put this movie in the horror category. Though ghosts and doubtful magics, this is a good martial arts show, with a satiric eye about human weakness and nobilities.

Captivity with Dignity
###BREAK###
Over a span of six years, filmmaker Phil Lee documented the unique philosophies and techniques of renowned animal behaviorist, Louis Dorfman as he worked with a variety of exotic big cats at the International Exotic Animal Sanctuary in Boyd, Texas. Armed with only a calm demeanor, and a small spray bottle of vinegar, Dorfman enters into the enclosures of wild predators, and establishes unbelievable relationships. Many of these cats have been abused or neglected earlier in life, so their stress and agitation levels toward humans is understandable. Dorfman uses absolutely no discipline or rewards in creating these bonds, only trust, affection and respect, treating these extraordinary creatures with the dignity they deserve.

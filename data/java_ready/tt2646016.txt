Youths of Shasha
###BREAK###
The documentary talks about the situation of the music-talented youth in Shashamane, Ethiopia. This is a piece of land that Haile Selassie gave to all Rastafarian people who decided to come back to Africa. They haven't a studio or some distribution that can support them. Because they love and need to express themselves by music, they keep doing it, facing obstacles. This documentary is a part of a larger project: to establish the first music school and recording studio in Shashamane.

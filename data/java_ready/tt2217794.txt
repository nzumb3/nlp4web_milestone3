###BREAK###
Pearson Constantino was preparing to fulfill his lifelong dream of bicycling across the United States when he was hit from behind by an SUV. Despite his helmet, Pearson suffered serious injuries including a shattered femur, a crushed vertebra, and head trauma. The Long Bike Back follows his recovery and his exciting bike ride across America with his brother Pete advocating for safer roads and reminding people of the joy of riding a bicycle. Pearson and Pete's cross-country journey covers the length of historic US Route 20. Along the way, Pearson encounters many unexpected challenges including record high temperatures, flooding, food poisoning, inhospitable drivers, poor road conditions, crashes, detours, flat tires, and new injuries which inspire him to recommit to what matters most.

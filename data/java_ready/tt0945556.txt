Finding Kraftland
###BREAK###
After the death of his brother, a Hollywood film music agent drags his son through an obsessive quest to recapture his own childhood through a globe-trotting trek riding hundreds of roller coasters, collecting thousands of toys and transforming their home into "Kraftland," a shrine to Disneyland and American Consumer Culture. A love story between father and son emerges via an almost maniacal pursuit of happiness.

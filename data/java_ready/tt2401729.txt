Jeff, a street promoter, works to recruit audience members for free movie screenings in New York City. He faces constant rejection and outright hostility from some of the people he encounters and struggles to maintain his dignity in a seemingly indifferent universe. Jeff attempts to ease his loneliness with Linda, a mysterious woman he meets online, and matches wits with Seth, a fellow recruiter who educates him on the cutthroat realities of street promotion.

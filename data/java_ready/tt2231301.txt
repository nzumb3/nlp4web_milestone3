Into the Twilight Haze
###BREAK###
A psychological exploration of the cross-generational female reaction to the Twilight books and movies. The documentary examines the mass interest in Twilight and what it means in terms of male-female dynamics today (what men want, what women want, our differences, and why it is often still so hard to understand one another). So, while it starts out looking at this Twilight phenomenon, it is also an exploration into the human psyche with regards to our needs/desires for intimacy, love, sex, connection, self-growth, and our inter-relationship struggles.

'Mary' chronicles the final months in the life of Mary Evans, a former 1950s American d√©butante and downtown Los Angeles barfly. Mary's life was plagued by alcoholism, abusive husbands, failed suicide attempts, and deteriorating health - but somehow through it all, she managed to keep her sense of humor and took life in stride. This documentary was filmed ten years ago by her grandson, Brennan Howard, and was just recently completed.

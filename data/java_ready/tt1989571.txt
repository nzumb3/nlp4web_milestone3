Oktay and Ayse, with their affair kept hidden, find the happiness they have been craving after so long. And they can only keep their happiness if Ayse goes to Paris with Oktay. Ayse, with the prospect of being happy for the first time, and amongst all the things she knew as life, now has to make a choice.

The Clinic
###BREAK###
The Clinic is a film about an underground treatment center for the broken hearted. Two filmmakers are on the pursuit of the infamous Dr. William J. Slater, PhD., best-selling author of "Screw Moving On" and "I'm OK, You're the One F$$*ed in the Head." The doctor is a tough man to catch. Through his group of loyal followers, the filmmakers document Dr. Slater's unconventional techniques for getting over a failed relationship - such as Stalker Therapy and Abduction Therapy, to name a few. As they learn more about the doctor, they are drawn deeper and deeper into a twisted world of abuse and really angry people where nothing is as it seems. "The Clinic" explores the motives of a few desperate people who have a hard time letting go.

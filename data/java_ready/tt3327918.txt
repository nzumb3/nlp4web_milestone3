Five Blocks Away
###BREAK###
Anthony Seton lives the modern definition of the perfect life. Young and handsome, with a successful job and an active social scene, everything that today's society covets seems well within his grasp. But when a series of circumstances challenges the foundations of that world, he realizes that life as defined by secular truths may not be much of a life at all-and that the real answer is a lot closer than he thinks.

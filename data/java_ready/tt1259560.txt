After 28 years in the game, the life of an iconoclastic racehorse owner is transformed when his "big horse" finally arrives. The owner and his longtime trainer enjoy the season of a lifetime as their champion horse propels them to racing's most prestigious events culminating in the world championships. At the end of the horse's racing career, plans are finalized to retire him to stud and collect on a ten million dollar sales offer but the equine gods intervene at the last minute to turn this would-be fairy tale upside down.

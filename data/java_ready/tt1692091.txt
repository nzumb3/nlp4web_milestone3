A 12-years old russian boy, who miraculously survives a terrible car crash where all his family died, is looking for the killer-driver, who intentionally provoked the accident. He could never expect that on this journey he would find his soul-mate, fly to the dark side of the Moon and learn how to live without casting any shadows. Learn that every single man on Earth is born for a great purpose - to perform a heroic exploit, to change our world for good and become a master of his own destiny. To prevent a holy war of jihad against Russia and to ruin terrorist plans - to assassinate the President of Russia, to take USA Olympic team hostage and then execute them along with 150000 people during Olympic Games-2014 held in Russia. Learn that nothing in our world happens by chance. Chance is the pseudonym of God when he does not want to sign. However He cannot leave our planet unattended.

There are hundreds of workers in Portugal to whom the protection of the law at a labour and civilian level is not recognised. This situation does not have to do with legal issues but with cultural, social and moral circumstances. Although there is a high number of clients requiring their services, their profession or business in which it is included are not considered legal. In a society of services where everything can be bought and sold, they claim their job is just another one among many. For that reason, in a similar way to what happened in other countries, they demand the end of the discrimination, the change of the law and the social power that has been denied to them. They are the sex workers and above all they claim their right to be listened to.

Marginalized members of Italian society gather in a meeting and welcome center. They have experienced drugs, prison and homelessness. Talking about their existence, singing and living life, they show that humanity is not lost. A visionary, poetic film referencing the masters of Italian cinema such as Pasolini and Bellocchio. A vibrant work that puts the sadness of the world to song.

INERTIA OF THE PAST A Film about March 27th 1941 "Inertia of the Past" is a full-length documentary film about the event that is probably the single most important event in the XX century history of Serbia and Belgrade. Also, this is one of the rare dates of the XX century of Europe that Serbia can claim. On that March 27th 1941, the people of Belgrade said "NO" to Hitler - an act unthinkable in the conquered Europe of that time. On that day, the army performed a coup against Yugoslavia joining the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. The film deals with the genesis of events that led to such a Serbian reaction.

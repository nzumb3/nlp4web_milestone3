Transcalar Investment Vehicles
###BREAK###
A financier is awoken from a nightmare to learn that a disaster has triggered the investment vehicle called Prometheus. This precipitates an intensive work session with a political speechwriter to prepare for the imminent initial public sale of shares. Prometheus's designer, the late founder of the bank who is remembered as the Hippie, has also left behind a daughter in her aesthetic reveries. In this tale of the relationship between generations and nations and visions and investments, the Financial, the National and the Formal, seek the story of a new global economy with the funked-out radar of their professional language games. A bioeconomic and metaphoric thriller deploying many filmic languages, Transcalar Investment Vehicles is a myth about the creation of The Solar Sea Economy.

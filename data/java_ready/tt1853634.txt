Out of the Blue: The Story of the Santa Cruz Surfing Club
###BREAK###
This film covers surfing's inception in Polynesia, to its arrival on the Mainland in 1885, and the formation of various surf clubs along the California coast in the 1930's. The most northern of these clubs would be in the chilly waters of Santa Cruz, where a small group of kids on the beach in the 1930's began to notice a group of college boys from Southern California riding the waves in town. Building their own boards and heading out to sea without any formal instruction, this unique group of young men would help each other to overcome the elements and form close friendships that have lasted a lifetime.

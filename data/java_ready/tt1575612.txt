Laundromat Days
###BREAK###
Simon O'Reilly's LAUNDROMAT DAYS offers a unique and enigmatic look at the interconnection of Montreal's people and their sub-subcultures. Indifferent to the architectural and technological marvels that surround them, a motley group of characters move through life, out of touch with the other souls sharing the city. Alienation and a series of disjointed relationships intersect amid the occasional insights of lonely street philosophers and the warm-yet-mundane hum of laundry machines. Like socks and jocks thrown thoughtlessly into a dryer, stories tumble together in a way that's lucid yet chaotic, building up toward one glum youth's self-fulfilling prophecy.

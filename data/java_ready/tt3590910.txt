Legends of Magdalen
###BREAK###
Gregory B. Gallagher and Parafilms are producing a documentary film on the marine mysteries of the Magdalen Islands, the Qu√©bec archipelago in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence, North America's tempestuous inland saltwater sea. Over 700 sunken ships are documented by Leonard Clark and three generations of his family in the village of Old Harry. Leonard is the ultimate amateur archaeologist; devoting his life to studying the history of the Magdalen Islands, the provenance of the legions of shipwrecks, and clues of sunken treasure forfeited by the sea. Along this singular path, Leonard Clark shares historical facts and sunken treasure lore with Mario Cyr, a local Madelinot and world-renowned underwater cameraman. Today, history buffs, adventurers, and locals alike find numerous antique coins, wood relics, and other artefacts from centuries of European shipwrecks along the beaches of the Magdalen Islands. Our film delivers the narratives of both historical and living legends of these remote red-sand atolls!

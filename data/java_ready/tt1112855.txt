Luxemburg, USA
###BREAK###
In the 19th century, America was the land of hope and the future for millions of Europeans. Thousands of peasants from Belgium and Luxembourg set off for adventure in America, at the edges of the known world. They built homes and reconstructed living areas modeled after life back home. They clung to their identities and language and called their towns Belgium, Luxemburg, Rollingstone... Luxemburg, USA is a contemporary portrait of the Midwest, of America's conservative rural heartland, seen through the prism of a specific community, that of the Luxembourg immigrants' descendents, their lives today, and their history.

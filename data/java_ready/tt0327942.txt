In & Out of Focus
###BREAK###
A documentary seven years in the making about women in the film business and how they balance, children, love lives and career--or how they don't. What began as an audio-visual recording of the nine months of director Jacqueline Liebman's pregnancy as she and her boyfriend dealt with the fact that they were totally unprepared as parents. She felt a loss of identity. Successful filmmakers were asked how they balanced a family and a career. Contributors include: director Mimi Leder, editor Anne V. Coates, producer Gail Katz and director Claudia Weill.

In the age of Facebook and digital communication, a remarkable group of British teenagers have chosen to define themselves through one of the most ancient, and potent, forms of culture out there - the spoken poem. 'We Are Poets' intimately follows the lives and words of the UK's multi-ethnic noughties generation as the Leeds Young Authors poetry team prepare for a transformational journey of a lifetime, from the red bricked back streets of inner city North England, to a stage in front of the White House at Brave New Voices - the world's most prestigious poetry slam competition. Anyone tempted to dismiss today's youth as politically apathetic better pay heed - here is electrifying evidence to the contrary.

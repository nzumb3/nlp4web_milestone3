The White Elephant
###BREAK###
Somebody passed by one day: 'Mama, does the Post really work? If I leave this letter with you, will it ever arrive?' I told him: 'of course it will'. He started laughing. 'I know for sure it will never reach its destination.' WHITE ELEPHANT is a documentary about the Central Post-Office and its employees in Kinshasa, DR Congo. This grandiose relic of the colonial past has trapped its employees in a frozen timewarp from which they are planning their escape. From past to present, through the cracks in the walls, and leaks in the ceilings, we glimpse present-day Congo.

10/10
###BREAK###
If 20/20 is hindsight then '10/10' is living through the moment uncertain how to proceed. Over the course of one day, ten Angelenos will confront pivotal moments that will determine the rest of their lives for better or worse. From relationships with those they love to enacting vengeance upon those who have done them wrong, each will run an 'emotional gauntlet' that will define them before the sun sets over the City of Angels.

Granito
###BREAK###
In a startling loop of time and memory, Granito shows how a Filmmaker's first documentary has been instrumental to indict Guatemalan ex-dictator Ríos Montt. In January 2012, after 30 years of legal impunity, former Guatemalan general and dictator Efraín Ríos Montt was indicted by a Guatemalan court for crimes against humanity. Decades after the events, he was charged with committing genocide against the country's poor, Mayan people in the 1980s becoming the first former head of state to be tried in his own country for genocide. "Granito: How to Nail a Dictator" reveals the thirty year struggle to bring Guatemala's ex-dictator Ríos Montt to justice for genocide against the Mayan population. Part political thriller, part memoir, Yates transports us back in time through a riveting, haunting tale of genocide and returns to the present with a cast of characters joined by destiny and the quest to bring a malevolent dictator to justice. As if a watchful Maya god were weaving back together threads of a story unraveled by the passage of time, forgotten by most, our characters become integral to the overarching narrative of wrongs done and justice sought that they have pieced together, each adding their granito, their tiny grain of sand, to the epic tale.

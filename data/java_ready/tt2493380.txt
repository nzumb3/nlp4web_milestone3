Luc de Heusch, une pens√©e sauvage
###BREAK###
Thanks to his questioning of the world, the ethnologist and film-maker, Luc de Heusch allows us to enter his thoughts, thoughts that are both scientific (structuralist) and poetic (surrealist). Building bridges between different cultures, his films and books attest to the diversity that exists within the realm of reality, and this diversity allows the very distinct worlds of art, war, cooking, theatre, magic and love to communicate with one and other with incredible ease.

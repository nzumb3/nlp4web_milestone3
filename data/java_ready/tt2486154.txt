Among Women
###BREAK###
To be a good wife in Zambia, girls are initiated: they are locked up in a house for 7 days to learn everything a woman needs to know for the rest of her life. Afterward they become part of the women's group that supports them throughout their marriage. Four years ago filmmaker Kim Brand came to Zambia for the first time. The older women of the village took her hand and showed her a world that was completely new to her: a world of rituals and intimacy and of a group of women that support each other when necessary. Back in Holland, Kim couldn't get this out of her head. She had to go back.

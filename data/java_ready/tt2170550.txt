Always Together: Chinese-Jamaicans In Reggae
###BREAK###
From pioneer soundsystem operator Tom 'The Great Sebastian' Wong in the 1940s to contemporary dancehall masters Black Chiney, Chinese-Jamaicans have played an integral part in the music scene on the island since even before Jamaica cut its first domestic record in the 1950s. The stories of Leslie Kong, the first producer to record Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, and Desmond Dekker; Byron Lee, the bandleader that became Jamaica's ambassador to the world; and Patricia Chin, co-founder of VP Records are important but often overlooked pieces of reggae history. Through extensive original interviews and archival footage, Always Together: Chinese-Jamaicans in Reggae Music weaves together the history of the Chinese immigrants with the little-known stories of these unsung giants.

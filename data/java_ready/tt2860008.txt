Fifty Lakes One Island
###BREAK###
Fifty Lakes One Island is an exploration of the inland lakes on Isle Royale, a wilderness island in the northwest waters of Lake Superior. Fifty Lakes One Island differs from the predictable flora and fauna nature documentary in its attempt to discover the power of time alone in the wild. Filmmaker George Desort brings the viewer on a transcendental journey through the woods and waters of Isle Royale over two, 40-day adventures.

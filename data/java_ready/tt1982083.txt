Century of Light
###BREAK###
The world famous Centennial Light Bulb in Livermore's Fire Station 6 has burned almost continuously since it was first lit in the year 1901. In that time, it has seen war and peace, depression and prosperity, and a countless number of human events. Since being acknowledged by the Guinness Book of World Records in 1972, the 4-watt dynamo has received on-going press about its extraordinary lifespan, as each passing year marks a new milestone. From a technical standpoint, the Centennial Bulb may be considered a mere artifact comprised simply of glass, metal, and filament. But given its history, its incredible ability to endure, and the overwhelming sense of sentiment it creates, there is more to this tiny relic than merely its manufacturing.

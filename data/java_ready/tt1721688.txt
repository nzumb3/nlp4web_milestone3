Steampunk
###BREAK###
Willie Norrister is the undefeated champion in the bare knuckle boxing ring. Jonathan 'Stars' Starsmore is an unlicensed doctor of a sort-- the only kind most people in Stoatpamphlet can afford. Ghery is a singer in a bar who dreams of better things. And Hennison is the mysterious man in black. Willie and Stars find themselves on the bad side of the under lord of Stoatpamphlet-- a notorious kingpin by the name of Merrin. Hang on for a wild ride as they navigate assassins, crooked bookies, sky pirates, and the law as they try to survive in the twisted world of Steampunk.

The Black O
###BREAK###
OMAHA, NE--A study conducted by the Violence Prevention Center out of Washington, DC placed Nebraska first for having the highest Black homicide rate in the U.S. last year; and second in the present year. Identifying the root causes of crime can be a grueling task, especially when it is obscured by other apparent problems. Producers Shelly "The Artist" Hollis and his brother, Omaha native and author, Sheldon Hollis, hope to zoom in on the main causes of Black-on-Black crime in a new documentary called The Black O. The documentary will chronicle Omaha's history of Black crime through featured interviews of Omaha residents living in high crime and poverty stricken areas; along with merchants, civil leaders, convicts, law officers and victims' families. Additionally, Shelly is also hoping to speak one-on-one with Mayor Jean Stothert to discuss her views on the topic. The Black O documentary is intended for educational purposes to help deter juvenile crime and delinquency, reduce potential gang involvement and to help protect Omaha youth from becoming statistics.

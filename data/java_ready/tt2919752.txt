###BREAK###
Nipe Jibu is a Swahili musical which tells the story of a young woman living in a dream world. Ndoto is an orphan facing one of the biggest decisions in her life: whom she should marry. Torn between a grandmother who wants to please the spirits of the ancestors and friends who encourage her to decide for herself, Ndoto becomes more and more wrapped up in fear. Will she choose the modern world and lose her heritage? Will she marry the rich old man in the village - an arrangement that will please the ancestors and make Grandma rich? Or will she risk losing everything to follow a spirit her friends say is more powerful?

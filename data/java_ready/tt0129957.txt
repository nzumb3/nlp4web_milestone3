###BREAK###
Described by Amy Taubin in The Village Voice, as "an exceptionally intelligent and moving documentary that explores Corra's twelve year old autistic son George, who uses his own video camera to make a movie within the movie. In fact, the film is about how we define normalcy." George had its American theatrical premiere at The Screening Room, New York and was shown at the Museum of Modern Art, New York, The National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C., The Gaga Film Festival, Berlin Germany. It aired on HBO in July 2000.

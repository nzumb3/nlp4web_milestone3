The Long Night
###BREAK###
November 2012, my brother passed away from a six-month fight with cancer and all I can think of is the past. With grief grabbing at every thought all I could do is record my thoughts, in narration, a freeze-frame of my current soul and psyche. Moving from my parents to a lack of religious belief and how it feels to be alone, The Long Night became a closer look than I'm comfortable with. Looking inward isn't about always finding positive but it can be about acknowledging and finding a place for the shadow. At a length of an hour and fifteen minutes The Long Night became my first feature film. To better appreciate The Long Night the viewers will have to better understand themselves.

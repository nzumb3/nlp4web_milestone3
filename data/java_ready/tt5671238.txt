Violin
###BREAK###
China has been through a dramatic urbanization as its economy grows. Thousands of young farmers are joining the labor force in cities leaving their children at home with their senior parents. It has created a special group in the vast rural areas - they are called 'left-behind children.' Ru Lin, Xi is one of the 'left-behind children.' Designated as the class leader, Xi has been adored and trusted by Teacher Sun. Sun is an old school elementary school teacher who strictly stuck to Chinese traditional value. Returning found property has always been taught as a virtue in the class. Xi handed in a violin to Sun right after she found it at the riverside by chance. Sun highly complimented Xi's action, which makes both of them very proud. However, Xi began to feel regret once she noticed what a beautiful sound the violin could make. After struggling, she went to Sun to have the violin back since no owner had been found. To Sun, a student's confrontation is intolerant. He began to think Xi as the class role model is rotting mentally. Xi also became devastated for Sun's mistrust as Sun has been the father figure. She decided to take all the efforts to find the violin's owner to gain back Sun's trust. As the story progressed, Xi became more and more confused and suspicious of the adult's world and its game rules, which eventually led to rebellion.

Cross your heart and hope to die! Can you honestly swear that at least once in your life you have not thought that robbing a bank is a good idea?

His sister Louise (7) thinks he's too childish, but can't resist the game of robbing a bank. Together they can pull off just about anything. Getting away with it is the hard part.

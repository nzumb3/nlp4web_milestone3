Chun-Je and her father's strong bond is tested when signs of political corruption starts surfacing from the shadows. They both witnessed, as citizens, a series of dark events that followed after the election of president Lee Myong-bak in 2007. For the first time in history, a past president committed a suicide. A fraudulent presidential election due to NIS intervention took place. The crash of the Sewol ferry killed 304 people, with the source of the cause unrevealed.

However, Chun-Je has chosen to remain in Korea. Along with a small number of conscious and brave individuals, she stands in protest against the evil regime, demanding the truth. Justice vs. Power.

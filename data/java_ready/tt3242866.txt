Some People Don't Get Football, I Don't Get Those People

Football is not just a game, it's a way of life. If you love football you need to watch this film. If you don't get football then you need to watch it even more. Controversial football author and stand-up comedian Eddy Brimson steps out with the England fans to explain the importance of football in an age when greed and money appear to dominate the sport. But to the fans football is so much more. It's about pride, passion and above all identity. And our identity is not for sale. This film shows a love for the beautiful game that many never get to see; the highs, the lows, the elation and the despair. The fans are the true heroes of the sport. Without them football is dead, and yet with them football is beautiful.

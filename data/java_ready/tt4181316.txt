Wukong is the most representative figure of Beijing opera. He also occupies a prominent place in this film. His appearance with his broken magic stick symbolizes the despair and powerlessness of the teacher who lost his disciple, who abandoned the family opera. Beijing opera adapts popular music. At the beginning and end of the film, Wukong waves his stick, announcing a new act of jingju about to begin.

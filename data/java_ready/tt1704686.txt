Agadez, the Music and the Rebellion
###BREAK###
Tuareg nomads have lived in the Sahara Desert for centuries, connecting North Africa and West Africa with their Camel Caravans. They are fiercely independent and have become famous for their rebellions, fighting to protect their freedom and culture. Omara Moctar, known as 'Bambino' is a young musician who has become a cult hero in Niger and represents a new generation of Tuareg. He is becoming known as one of the great guitar players of West Africa. After several years of exile, he has returned to his home town, Agadez, a remote center of Tuareg culture at the edge of the Sahara. With the Sultan's blessing, he recently had a concert outside the Grande Mosque to celebrate their culture and their transition to the modern world.

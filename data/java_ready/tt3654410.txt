Les États-Désunis du Canada
###BREAK###
You think Quebeckers are the only Canadians who aspire to independence? Wrong. There are separatists all over the country, from sea to sea. The word "separation" is the same in English and French. And it's pronounced just as well with the accent of the British Columbia elite, rich Alberta cowboys, humble farmers of Saskatchewan and disillusioned fishermen of Newfoundland and Labrador. Although they are marginal, some western separatists have even founded their own political party. Disunited States of Canada, a documentary by the producers of Gentilly Or Not To Be, set off to meet these enfants terribles who want to re-draw the borders. These men and women, whom we never hear in the media, express a general malaise from coast to coast and make us examine fundamental questions about our country. What is a country? What is a nation? And what about Quebec?

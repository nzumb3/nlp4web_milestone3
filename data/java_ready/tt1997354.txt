Exley
###BREAK###
Where magic realism meets the Odyssey, Exley is the story of one man's journey to himself. A rent-cheque away from being a bum, Exley finds himself thrust into a perilous journey when his estranged mother calls to tell him that she is dying and needs him by her bedside on the other side of the world. In one day he encounters more obstacles than most men meet in a lifetime. This comic misadventure shatters our concrete notions of how we define ourselves.

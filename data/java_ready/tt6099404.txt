###BREAK###
After 16 years without winning any significant title, Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras won the Paulista Championship on June 12, 1993. The team experienced a period of fasting when he won the final against Corinthians, after bitter defeat in the first match of the decision. Led by coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo, the game only ended in injury, and the feet of the idol Evair, from the penalty spot, left the 4th goal. From there, Palmeiras back to his successful track record of titles.

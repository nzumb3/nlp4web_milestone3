The Mark
###BREAK###
Italy, today. Mark Draveni, 19, disgustingly wealthy, is the charismatic leader of a teenager brotherhood, the Demons. The Demons are bloodthirsty and lethal, albeit quite outlandish. Among them there's a martial arts master (Berserk), a hip hop madman nicknamed Spike, the cooler-than-ice computer whiz called Conan, and the gorgeous ninja woman Kite. All of his sheer power, though, can't give Mark the strenght to face his lovely girlfriend Giulia, 18. Giulia's pregnant and resolute to keep the baby, a prospect that makes Mark to freak out. After the umpteenth furious fight with Giulia, Mark is seduced by a new schoolmate: the malicious blondie Serena Cursi. Serena is morbidly fascinating in her natural coldness. Mark and Serena have wild sex, but Serena soon vanishes. Sometime later, Mark meets Uncle J., former best friend of the Dravenis, just released out of prison. He desperately warns Mark against Serena and her unbreakable curse. It's an eerie circle of blood which dates back to the 80's, he says. The symbol of this curse is a black stigmata on the right hand of whomever becomes Serena's lover. Urban legend stuff? Maybe... and maybe not! As Uncle J. horribly dies and Serena begins stalking Giulia, Mark finds help from a shady reported, Enrico Artale, who's somehow connected to Serena...

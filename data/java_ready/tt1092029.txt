First Time Godfather
###BREAK###
Brought up in California, offspring of an important political family, 11 year old Alex travels to Crete in order to baptize the baby child of a local cacique and parliamentary candidate. He will be a GODFATHER FOR THE FIRST TIME in order to prove to everybody and mainly to his father that he is a worthy son. His foreign looks, his difficulty with Greek language, the Cretan's particularities and the tests he has to go through in order to be accepted as a worthy son of the Leader, create a comedy with a political background, existential distresses and tragicomic situations. His first baptism-initiation in the art and tricks of politics will mark him for the rest of his life.

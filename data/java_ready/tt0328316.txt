The journalist Célio Rocha has been living a serious problem in the breast of his family for years: his father used all his savings to buy an apartment from the father of his childhood friend Otávio Sabóia, indeed a corrupt constructor who never delivered the building to the owners. When the father of Otávio commits suicide, Célio is assigned for an interview with Otávio, and is invited by Otávio to participate in a scheme in Cayman Islands, where he would receive five millions dollars. However, Célio has a breakdown when his father dies, and believed God assigned him to make Otávio give away all the money he has on behalf of the homeless.

The Black Truth is based on a true story. The film highlights the cruelty and inhumane treatment to women in the name of Witch Hunting. This is an old age ritual, which is now used for exploiting women on petty excuses. The film also highlights the social system and political laxity of not framing tough laws to abolish this menace. Surprisingly Government of India after 65 years of Independence has still not made a central law to overcome this problem. The film goes through all the plots and ploys of framing women a Witch and taking advantage of the situation how they exploit women mentally and sexually.

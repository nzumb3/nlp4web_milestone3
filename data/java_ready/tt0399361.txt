Missy
###BREAK###
A mix between "The Twilight Zone" and "Of Mice and Men": tells the tale of two friends who have purchased a run-down cargo ship in an effort to regain freedom in their lives by traveling across the galaxy. Soon their friendship disintegrates and trouble arises between them. Pranks turn to fistfights and arguments turn to threats. Cabin fever in deep space.

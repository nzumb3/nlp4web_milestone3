Abductee
###BREAK###
Atsushi Chiba, aged 50, wakes up one day half-dead. He's tied up in a container, being shifted somewhere. Inside the container lies a mysterious stone which doesn't give him even the slightest clue as to who the perpetrator might be, nor any idea of the fate that awaits him. As the container makes its way from truck to ship, he discovers he is one of the 200 other abductees. The container continues to make its way from ship to train, and his explanations of the situation go from "human trafficking" to "international terrorism". He begins to recall what he truly used to be, and realized what is really important in his life.

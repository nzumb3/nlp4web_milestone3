College Fright Night
###BREAK###
What's college without beer, babes, and vampires?!? Campus life (or lack thereof) is about to take on a whole new meaning when the University, and potentially the rest of the world, finds itself in danger from an army of the undead. Alex and Brock are your typical small college jocks dealing with an annoying residence assistant, wacko monster obsessed professor, head case for a coach, and of course lots of drunken women. Their lives get flipped upside down when a suspension from the football team saves them from being turned into blood sucking minions. But with the authorities not buying their story, the pair must round up the few locals that do and hope they alone can stop a growing number of vampires, zombies, and even a werewolf before they turn everyone in town into a world conquering monster militia.

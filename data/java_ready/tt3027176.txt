###BREAK###
Miso has been told that she's not a good actress because she's not a slut. She's skeptical of not succeeding as an actress though she's done her best like model student. She's made a sacrifice a lot while she's been acting since her childhood. Suddenly she feels an impulse to deviate from her common daily life. Therefore, she's made an attempt to date with Jungwoo even if she's not quite used to it, but she's getting worn out because he's been a bit suffocating her. He drank some wax and created a scene by threatening to commit suicide so as to change her mind, and unlike other actresses, her daily life which has been common gets gloomy and shady.

Killing Winston Jones
###BREAK###
Long-suffering gym teacher Ethan is the glue that holds his eccentric family together. But when his father gets locked in a bitter contest with his old rival, Washington, both former phys-ed teachers, over whose name will be on the new high school gym, Ethan finds his life -- and his family -- spiraling out of control. The fact that the school's principal, Ethan's old rival for beautiful Virginia, is conniving behind the scenes to win Virginia and destroy Ethan's family, is getting on Ethan's very last nerve. But Ethan might be just the guy to snatch victory -- and Virginia -- from the jaws of defeat.

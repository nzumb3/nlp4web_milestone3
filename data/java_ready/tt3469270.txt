Fetish Subculture Documentary
###BREAK###
There are a lot of perceptions about fetishism. We were curious, we had questions, we have gotten answers. We hope to demystify fetishism by using the fetish community's point of view. This documentary is aimed to serve as a first contact between the fetish world and the general public. Our main interests are: fetish passion, community, modelling, observers, designers, and events. This English language documentary contains some sensual images (we are talking about fetishism after all...) but none of them feature nude modeling nor are they degrading. These are only there to support the speech.

Lovember
###BREAK###
An odd young couple - a nurse and a street musician - meet first as the witnesses of accident. Troubles pursue them and they decide to challenge fate in an extraordinary way - by giving birth to a new God. Dialogue-free, the film is threaded through with the music of Prokofiev.

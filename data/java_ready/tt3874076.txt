The Rainbow Kid
###BREAK###
The Rainbow Kid is a gritty coming of age story that follows Eugene, a teenager with Down syndrome, on the journey of his life. Obsessed with everything rainbows, whether it's their beauty, their symbolism, or the myths that surround them, this obsession acts as an escape from his real life, which is a mess: he's bullied at school, the girl he likes doesn't notice him, and his mother is terminally ill. Worse, he discovers that he and his mom are on the verge of being evicted. Eugene decides to take matters into his own hands. He'll find the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Eugene will save the day. An optimistic Eugene sets out on an adventure across rural Ontario and encounters a host of larger than life characters: an alcoholic dowser, a burned-out punk rocker, and a special needs girl with a disturbing home life. As he struggles to adapt and understand the worrisome situations he finds himself in, a strange thing happens: He begins to experience rainbow mythologies first hand, but the line between fact and fiction soon blur together. Eugene's odyssey becomes more and more dangerous, but he forges head, taking the challenges head on.

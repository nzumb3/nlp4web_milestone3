I's
###BREAK###
I's is an exploration of the not-too-distant future, at a time when civilization stands on the threshold of a phenomenon known as the technological singularity. The film explores a world where we are constantly connected online, but completely disconnected in person, pushing the limits of human interface design and interaction. Poignant, tense, and often beautiful, I's follows a bike messenger's journey to reconnect with his estranged sister in the last five days of our current reality.

The Illusionauts
###BREAK###
Unlikely events shake France. All the heroes from the books of famous novelist Jules Verne were brought to life and, without knowing it, began to cause chaos and destruction. But when the new French president and the minister of culture conceive to re-release a novel by the great writer, they accidently corrupt everything within, using a device called 'The Imaginasium'. Only a team of 4 talented children can save France now, as they're sent into the stories in order to return all of them back on track and put the heroes of Jules Verne's novels back to the pages from whence they came.

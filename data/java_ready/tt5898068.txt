The Egg
###BREAK###
A portrait of two people thrown together by circumstance and a bit of larceny. Chiao-Dahn might be a low-level gang member, but he's also a first-class goofball-more likely to break out dancing than to break the law. Ordered to kidnap and bring the beautiful but slightly spoiled Yumi to San Francisco, the seemingly hapless Chiao-Dahn soon finds himself at LAX, with no idea how to get to S.F. and saddled with a kidnapping victim who would rather go shopping than cooperate.

Lebbeus Woods + Steven Holl: The Practice of Architecture
###BREAK###
Architects Lebbeus Woods and Steven Holl have been friends for many years. Both are theorists but Woods has been preoccupied with the pursuit of a visionary architecture, intentionally, not waiting or searching for commissions, in contrast to Holl whose buildings can be found in many parts of the world. This order of things is interrupted now that Holl has commissioned Woods to design a four-story pavilion for his large-scale multi complex "Sliced Porosity Block" in Chengdu, China. We suggested that they meet and talk about their different ways of approaching the practice of architecture. They got together in Woods' workspace in downtown Manhattan. In the early days of their friendship they would more likely have met at the Square Diner in Tribeca which featured all you can eat bean soup for one dollar.

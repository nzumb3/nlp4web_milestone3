Plain Jane the Shockumentary
###BREAK###
Jane was born with Osteogenesis Imperfecta, a condition which is manifested by extremely brittle bones. In this film Jane takes common notions about disabled people and turns them upside down. Part interview, part music video, part animation, and part reenactment, this film explores new territory in the realm of human experience; a triumph of the will as Jane overcomes obstacles and destroys popular myths and social taboos. This fast paced film is loaded with dark comedy, eclectic music and harsh realities.

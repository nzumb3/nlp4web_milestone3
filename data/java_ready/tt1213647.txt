Het leven uit een dag
###BREAK###
What if you lived your entire life in one day? And you'd have, but one time, to enjoy each moment: the first kiss, going to school, growing up, making love. In Marc de Cloe's Life in One Day, Benny and Gini fall head over heels for each other in a place where a lifetime indeed exists in a single day. But they can't fathom their love ever ending. They hatch a seemingly clever plan to game the system, and ultimately spend eternity together. Their destination? Hell. Well it all sounds good in theory.

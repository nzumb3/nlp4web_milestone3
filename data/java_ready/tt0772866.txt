No Cross, No Crown
###BREAK###
"NO Cross, NO Crown" is a timely and engaging feature documentary that explores New Orleans, a town that contributed to the fabric of American identity, yet only after it was hit by one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history, did it become apparent that the country never truly knew her. A place that once founded such an integral aspect of our culture has now been destroyed and abandoned, its people displaced. Can New Orleans come back with so many musicians overwrought with recovery?

The Discreet Charm of the Hipster Class

There are 10 million games in the naked city - board games, mind games, gender games, drinking games, video games, gaming the system, mating games, role-playing games, and games of chance. A nuclear scientist practices for her baton competition. Video game addiction fractures a lesbian couple. An alienated office worker plays games of life and death. Everyone plays games, whether they know it or not. We humans have come up with many ways to pass the vacant hours. Two actors try on different roles in order to connect to their characters. An alienated dwarf with a gambling addiction talks to his bookie, an equally alienated creature, who is late for yoga. A group of friends gathers to play a board game and gossip. Some hospital orderlies go into a back room to play a drinking game with an imaginary ball. What draws them all together? Each game provides us with a glimpse into our diversions - light and dark.

Mystery Play
###BREAK###
Sadie and Jude arrive independently at a house in Hampstead, London, both to meet a man called Shelby, who has promised to help them. Sadie believes him to be a therapist, who can help her summon the courage to leave her abusive boyfriend, while Jude believes him to be a financial adviser who might just be able to lend him the money he so desperately owes his landlord. The truth gradually starts to emerge about the mysterious Mr Shelby, who is neither counsellor nor financial adviser, but something more... much more.

In Waiting
###BREAK###
In Waiting is a documentary that explores the story of a Taiwanese mother and daughter whose dynamic resemble comedic duos such as Laurel and Hardy. The impeding plans for the future of this pair are haunted by the youngest member's foreshadowing gaze behind the camera. As we drift through Los Angeles with them, we see the unspoken daughter quietly reckon with the recursions of their daily life. The cycles of care and dependence are observed in waiting for what is both present, and what is to come of this family dynamic in a forever foreign land.

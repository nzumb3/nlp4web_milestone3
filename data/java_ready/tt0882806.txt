Sugar Boxx
###BREAK###
Sugar State Women's Prison. An Everglades hellhole where innocent girls are forced to slave in the swamps by day then turn tricks for the warden by night. A prison camp where corruption, brutality, and sexual abuse are all part of the daily routine. But when reporter Valerie March goes undercover inside Sugar State, that's when the powder keg really explodes! Follow Valerie through prison life - catfights, knife fights, rape, whippings, prostitution, and the "hot box" - before she and her fellow inmates take bloody, unforgettable revenge on their captors. Inspired by the great women-in-prison films of the past, SUGAR BOXX takes everything one step further... SUGAR BOXX has it all! SUGAR BOXX stars Geneviere Anderson (CSI Miami) as the smart-ass reporter, Kitten Natividad (Russ Meyer's UP!) as the lusty matron, and The'la "Rain" Brown (Flavor Of Love) as a hilariously foul-mouthed hooker. Also features Tura Satana (Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!), Jack Hill (writer/director Foxy Brown, Coffy), and Jacqueline Scott (Charley Varrick, Macabre). Original music by Johnnie Rotten Jr featuring Steven Adler (Guns-N-Roses) and Chip Z'Nuff (Adler's Appetite).

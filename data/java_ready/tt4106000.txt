Empirica
###BREAK###
Empirica is a neo Americana road film about two estranged brothers, one over medicated and the other home from war in the Middle East. They leave their home in North Carolina on an all out cross country scramble in a beat up 57 Chevy to make a new life for themselves in what they believe to be the land of opportunity: California. They left for freedom, though what they found...they'll never forget.

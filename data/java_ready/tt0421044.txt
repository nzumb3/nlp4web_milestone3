Beauty in Chaos
###BREAK###
Beauty in Chaos is a profound and stirring drama about the consequences of artistic obsession in war. A graphic poignant examination of aesthetics and their relationship to conflict, the film follows one man's struggle to reform himself and come to understand his symbiotic relationship to those around him, and to learn to interact with them eye to eye, not just from behind the lens of his camera.

Marcela is a ballroom dance instructor. All seems to go well in her small world. One day she discovers that something strange is occurring with her parents: Gloria, her mother, has started to become absent, talks about strange happenings in her everyday home life, and has mental gaps. Almost at the same time, Nacho, her father, loses his job and with this his self-esteem. Now she knows that the relationship between the three was false and she wants to tell them so many things. But she won't be able to, at least not in a conventional way. Marcela is willing to challenge the rules of life in order to regain a small portion of the happiness lost.

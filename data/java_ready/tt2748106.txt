Stage Door Canteen Does Chicago
###BREAK###
This is the story of a 20+ year old big band from Cape Cod. During a train trip from Boston to Chicago they share their stories - sometimes very intimate about themselves and what they think about the others in the band. Cut into the movie are scenes from the journey and their incredible music and sound.

On the Edge
###BREAK###
There are nights when those who sleep on the streets of inner city Johannesburg fear nothing more than having a South African police officer take their blankets at night. The homeless community in inner city Johannesburg have endured xenophobia and continuous police harassment in a supposedly 'post-racial,' progressive South Africa. They have been forced to suffer in silence. This documentary film explores how the legacy of apartheid lingers in the midst of a police force renown for violence and human rights abuses. Unfortunately, the most vulnerable of the population suffer the brunt of this condition--the homeless and immigrant communities.

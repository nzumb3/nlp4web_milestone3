The Beatles Story
###BREAK###
From humble origins in the British seaside town of Liverpool, The Beatles rose to become the biggest group in the history of popular music, establishing England as one of rock roll's great strongholds and creating together a sound that at once celebrated rock's past while pointing to any number of innovative directions it would take in the future. An hour-long documentary with newsreel footage of the Fab Four in their heyday and new interviews with music historians and musicians who worked along side the Beatles, 'The Beatles: The Beatles Story' paints a picture of their rise to stardom and the pressures that eventually pulled the group apart. Interview subjects include members of the Swinging Blue Jeans and rock journalists Charles Shaar Murray and Jon Savage. While 'The Beatles: The Beatles Story' features extensive footage of the four members of the group being interviewed, this documentary contains no music or performances from the band.

The Earth Sangha is a community of activists, students of environmental issues, practitioners of meditation, and other people interested in creating environmentally sustainable ways of life. Members believe that there is a close connection between their own well- being and the health of the lives and land around them. Members recognize that all life is profoundly interdependent and express this understanding by building healthier relationships between people and the lands they inhabit. This film takes a closer look at their conservation activities throughout the Washington DC metro area as well as abroad.

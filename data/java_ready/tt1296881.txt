After breaking up with her boyfriend on Valentine's Day, Jenny shares a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to New York with a love-damaged group of passengers - a pilot with anger management issues, some oversexed flight attendants, a hip-hop superstar trying to keep it real in coach and a handsome young professor who's been unlucky in romance. Along with a tiny dog named Kaz, these strangers buckle up for love's bumpy ride.

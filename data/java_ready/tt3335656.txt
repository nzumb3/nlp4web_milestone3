Queer Artivism
###BREAK###
Queer Artivism offers an insight into five different queer film festivals through video footage and interviews with the organizers. With this it gives people who do not have the opportunity to visit various queer film festivals, a chance to experience at least five by going to just one film festival/screening. Additionally it is a tribute to queer film festivals and presents different points of view on the current status of queer film festivals and queer films. It is also a tribute to filmmakers, festival organizers and all the people who usually remain unseen, but without whom queer film festivals and films would not exist. Throughout the documentary interviewees (festival organizers, filmmakers and musicians) share their personal stories and elaborate on the importance of queer film festivals and queer film, opening a new space for discussion, reflection and evaluation of queer film festivals and queer film in today's society.

Together
###BREAK###
Together takes a look inside the reality and fidelity of a single man, living in New York City, running a business from his cramped apartment. Free rent, offered by his know-it-all landlords in exchange for custom software, turns out to be a hard bargain. Smattered with characters that are just pure funny, this tragic comedy is a reality ride for anyone who has ever been in a relationship. A romantic dinner unravels when Steven and Sandra reflect on the circumstances that brought them to where they currently sit...literally at the dinner table.

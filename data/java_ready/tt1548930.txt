Chocolate City Burning: The Untold Story of "Dot-Com" A documentary chronicling one of the most prominent crews to emerge from Washington DC's graffiti-boom of the 1990's. The film follows an oddly mixed group of three friends; Sime, Demon and Mega, as they gained notoriety throughout the city in the late 90's for doing enormous, elaborate, three dimensional murals. Eventually the crew would spread out to other cities, and the three founding members grew older and father apart. Demon moved to Japan for many years as a world class industrial designer, Mega would spend the next many years in courtrooms and rehabs and Sime continues to live, paint and bomb in Washington DC. Now all in their 30's, their interviews and reflections on their youth make very clear that, when all was said and done, graffiti was about more than painting, it was a coming of age and a crossing of worlds.

Dear Daddy
###BREAK###
A feature length documentary about the life long effects of fatherlessness on women. The film follows the dramatic journeys of eight young women from the tough city streets of Washington, DC as they struggle to overcome poverty, poor educational systems, no healthcare, and the most difficult life circumstance they have been dealt... the absence of their fathers. Dear Daddy is not only about the struggles to survive and navigate as a young woman of color, but at its core, it's about the importance of a father's role in the lives of their daughters.

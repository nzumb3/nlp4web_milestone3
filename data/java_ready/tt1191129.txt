Thomas is a teacher in a 1974-established Government-run Primary School in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and lives with his wife, and a daughter. He has a number of students, including some who are disabled, who regularly attend his classes by boat from a number of nearby islands. Everything changes after the devastating December 2004 Tsunami strikes the islands - killing his entire family, as well as several students. Struggling with their loss, continuing to attend a now empty school, he keeps on searching for his students with hopes of finding someone still alive.

Toque de Queda
###BREAK###
In Guatemala, violence is contagious. The neighbors of Villas de La Esperanza, in fear of an eventual invasion of those infected by violence, arm themselves and patrol nights, risking their lives for the safety of their families. But battling violence with violence only spreads the contagion, and the neighbors will soon realize that the greatest danger is not what lurks outside their secure gated community. The real danger lies within. In Guatemala, violence is contagious, and we are all infected.

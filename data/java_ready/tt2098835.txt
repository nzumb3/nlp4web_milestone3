The Fairies Christmas Ballet
###BREAK###
Recorded live in High Definition at Sydney's magnificent State Theatre during The Fairies recent national tour and transformed into a one-hour family-friendly film, The Fairies Christmas Ballet features new songs, old fairy favourites (including 'Jump Jump Star' and 'The Silly Song') and gorgeous Christmas Carols; a lively script and beautifully choreographed dancing, set against a magical backdrop of thousands of fairy lights sparkling from a giant Christmas tree. Best fairy friends Harmony and Rhapsody, and Fairy Princess Minuet, will delight their fairy fans as they dance on their tippie toes ("en pointe"). Add some serious Christmas rocking by Barnaby, twisting by Elf, magic by Wizzy and an appearance by Santa carrying a sackful of goodies and this film will have children singing, dancing and smiling in cinema locations all around Australia. See The Fairies Christmas Ballet exclusively at Event, Greater Union, Birch Carroll & Coyle and Village Cinemas Victoria from December 1. All tickets just $8*. This film is exempt from classification.

Yirmiyahu
###BREAK###
A piece of stretched cloth and a few planks of plywood which Yermiyahu put together to enlarge his one-room apartment, is all that separates his family's home from the bustling streets that surround his house in the Shapira neighborhood in southern Tel Aviv. The streets here are filled with all types of people: immigrants, foreign workers, Sudanese refugees and Palestinian cooperatives. Amongst them are quit a few junkies, prostitutes and alcoholics; a completely different image then the one you get when you hear the words:" Tel Aviv". Yermiyahu, his wife and two children are not the only ones living in their home. In one if the rooms lives Velra, who as a result of his handicap and drinking, is relived that Yermiyahu takes care of him and gives him a room to sleep in. In the storage room lives Gora, Yermiyahu's cousin, who's a burden on the family due to his drug habit. Misha, a former boxer, is asking to join the others, and is willing to sleep in the yard. Of course, Yermiyahu accepts him without thinking twice. In honor of the new "recruit" Misha makes and effort to stop drinking. Yermiyahu is about to leave, his wife Tanya is fed up with this scary neighborhood. Misha is not shy about his great desire to move with them to Be'er Sheva. He quits drinking, cleans, cooks, and does everything in his power to be liked by Yermiyahu and his family. Yermiyahu, the neighborhood's "sheriff", collects his belongings and his family and moves. The Shapira neighborhood seems the same, only it is missing one of its residents, and as a result several people must return to loneliness.

The Fortune You Seek Is in Another Cookie
###BREAK###
From the silence among mummies in a Chilean desert to youth street riots in Istanbul, the occupied Cinecitt√† film studios in Rome and a demonstration in Chile. Like a flaneur who sees the world with the poetic gaze of an outsider, the film's nameless narrator travels around the world in search of happiness. Not as a sentimental feeling, but as an idea and practice which nonetheless turns out to be just as volatile as the images that his buzzing 16mm camera capture in beautiful and gritty scenes. Images that turn their back on him, but which through visions and encounters and with a silent fury initiate him (and us) to a fundamental, human search for meaning, cohesion, knowledge and freedom. It could easily have become a pretentious affair, but Johannes Gierlinger turns the abstract concepts upside down in a politically down-to-earth film, which above all is about resistance. His debut, 'The Fortune You Seek is in Another Cookie' is a dizzying experience in the essayistic tradition of Chris Marker and the early explorers. A film for anyone who yearns to see the world anew.

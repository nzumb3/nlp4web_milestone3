Crazy for Love
###BREAK###
On his 21st birthday, in front of mom, dad, sis, and guests, Max tries to hang himself. It's his eighth suicide attempt, seeking a peaceful white light. Sent back to an asylum, Max falls in love at first sight with Grace, also suicidal, with a teddy bear she treats as her child. Max courts her, proposes, they marry, and he makes it his mission to give her reasons to live. They escape and he seeks various cures for her: the beauty of nature, living with his family, and consulting a shaman, a faith healer, and a self-help coach. Grace's demons trump the cures. Max is at wit's end. Will he fail? Is there to be no white light? A visit to Grace's institutionalized mother gives Max a clue.

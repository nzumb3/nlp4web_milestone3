Independent Draper
###BREAK###
This is the story of Taylor, whose occupation, and last name are both Draper. Drapes/blinds are not only his trade, but his passion, and it dates back several generations to when his Great-great Grandfather was given the last name based on his life's work. But times have changed, and there are no independent Drapers anymore. Now drapers work for big companies who care very little about customer service and expertise. How can a man of Taylor's pride work independently while companies can do things faster and cheaper? Become wise to the cut-throat nature of an industry that you never knew existed. With a budget of $46, Independent Draper is as independent a film as you will find. It's charm is Taylor's charm: Independent, poor, and proud.

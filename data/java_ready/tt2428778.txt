The Sun's Only Rival
###BREAK###
'The Sun's Only Rival' is a character study of the Light-bulb Lady and her family. She is an iconic Portland business owner. We focus on her personal eccentricities, her sons, their peculiar obsessions, and their outlandish window displays. Kay Newell has owned Sunlan Lighting for more than 20 years. She is a fixture on the street and her business remains timeless in a changing neighborhood.

The documentary is developed from two perspectives: the documentary itself, based upon the travel of an expert of waste and a disbelieving Senator, and the introduction based upon the dialogue between a father and his daughter concerning wastes and the chance to reduce them. In order to convince the skeptical Senator that we can achieve great results in terms of economy, wealth and way of living reducing wastes, the expert shows a lot of good practices already put in place through Italy, from North to South, such as washable diapers, the recycling process of plastic and paper, the composting process, the water, milk, wine and detergents consumed on draught, and some cities that implemented a Zero Waste environmental policy. Will the expert be able to demonstrate the senator that to reduce our waste is something that can cope with our standards of life and modern habits, not destroying economy and wealth?

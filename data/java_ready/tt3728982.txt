150 Years of Kane: A Student Journey
###BREAK###
Starting in June, 2012 ten students from the Kane Area Middle School (Kane, Pennsylvania) began working on the documentary "150 Years of Kane: A Student Journey." Component One focused on discovering the history of Kane. With guidance from author P.J. Piccirillo, students interviewed local residents and historians, visited historical sites and looked at historical newspapers, brochures and old maps. After learning the basics of videography from filmmaker, John C. Lyons, students shot footage as they did their research. The final product will be a documentary showcasing the students' discoveries about Kane along the way. This video will be one of three major projects being produced for Kane's 150th celebration in 2014. The students next worked with P.J. Piccirillo and John C. Lyons to edit and distribute the final project.

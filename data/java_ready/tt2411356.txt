The Goddess Gift 2011
###BREAK###
Middle aged woman - Shelley leaves Idaho for NYC to study tango, after a divorce. Shelley has an idea for a dance project. Millions of fireflies meet in a grove of trees in Borneo all blinking individually. By midnight they are all blinking in sync. Shelley wants to use this as a metaphor for how artists can create world peace. Shelley receives a gift from Athena - a crystal that has healing powers. As she begins to work on the project, she is challenged by unknown forces in the Shadow side, Big business, and petty thugs. At stake are the lost crystal of Atlantis and making a positive vibrational shift on December 21, 2012, the end of the Mayan calender.

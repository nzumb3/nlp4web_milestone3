Make or Break
###BREAK###
Urbanisation, computerization, mass production are hall marks of the 21C.. These so called 'progressions' all carry major side effects. They remove us as humans from the tactile creative beings we once were! They shift the emphasis away from what is hand made, tactile and real to a virtual, impersonal, non-tactile environment. 'Make or Break' highlights a diverse group of individuals, true champions of individuality, and creativity. Their inherent sense of aesthetics craves no attention but is an extremely important counter-balance to the global forces that continue to neutralize our natural sensibilities our desire for beauty. This stylized documentary begins where most of human life ends up and it travels in symphonic celebratory form through nine individual, talented channels to a point of human perfection.

Rising: The Art and Life of John Waddell
###BREAK###
Rising: The Art and Life of John Waddell is the inspiring story of an artist who resists modern trends to stay true to the human form, the painful losses that decision cost him and the immeasurable treasures he gained. Told by 15 models including the filmmaker, in rarely filmed nude modeling sessions, the film chronicles the moving story of a determined, prolific American sculptor working on the periphery of the contemporary art world for 50 years, shunning commercial success and media attention, enduring enormous personal setbacks and thriving without the help of critics. Rising is a journey into Waddell's unique artistic process that distills the essence of the energetic artist-model exchange into sculpture that champions the human spirit and asserts the beauty of individual differences.

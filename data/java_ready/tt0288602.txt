Arregui, la noticia del d√≠a
###BREAK###
This dramatic comedy addresses the terrible degree of disintegration Argentina has reached. Corrupt justice, unemployment, an absence of prospects for young people, accelerated decadence in the standard of living, increasing violence, a lack of ethics - all part of day-to-day life in the country. The story revolves around the life of Leopold, a middle-class father; his wife Isabel working for a decadent comedian; Beto, the son, a taxi driver; and Martita, the daughter, a divorced and unemployed hairdresser. All live in 'harmony' in a 40 square-meter apartment. One day Leopoldo takes it upon himself to donate blood. The next day, he is summoned once more to the hospital. His life is about to change, and radically so.

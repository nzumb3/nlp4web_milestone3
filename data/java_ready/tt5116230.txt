The Rebound
###BREAK###
Miami is a city known for its sports and diversity. For the Miami Heat Wheels it is a city of opportunity, second chances, and a call to win - against all odds. The Rebound is a real account of the Heat Wheels' quest during the year following a defeat at the national championships. Like many other community-supported wheelchair basketball programs across the nation, the players push their way through each season - often unsure if they'll have what it takes to make it to the next step. First time filmmakers Shaina Allen (Director) and Michael Esposito (Producer) step deep inside the lives of three players as they endure and respond to adversity. Friends, family, and pride hang in the balance as these men find an extraordinary gift in the hand life has dealt. They hope for an education, a big break, and a new life. The cameras don't stop when the players leave the court: the film follows them through the trials of daily life with a disability. With each victory, the team gets closer to the idea that anything - even a shot at the national championship title - is possible.

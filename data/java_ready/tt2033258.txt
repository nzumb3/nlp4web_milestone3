###BREAK###
The story of five young Afghans in Kunduz, a city in the Afghan war: Mirwais, 10, who speaks of war and peace like an adult. Nazanin, a local reporter who fights for women's right while wearing a burka. Hasib, a student and activist for democracy, who dreams of free and fair elections. Ghulam and Khatera, who are shooting a film in the middle of the armed conflict. A look into the minds of a young generation who lives in constant fear of Taliban attacks and the consequences of the foreign military's presence. Daily life suddenly switching to disrupting realities. Nonetheless, all five dream of a modern society, like their counterparts in the Arab world. But will the wishes of these young Afghans be heard?

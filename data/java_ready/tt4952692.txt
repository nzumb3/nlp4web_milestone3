Aji-Bi
###BREAK###
'Aji, Akhti, come, sister', this is how Mareme, in her twenties, calls up to potential female customers, among the passers-by of the old Casablanca, to put them false eyelashes on and do rasta braids. Mareme is an 'Aji-bi', a street-hairdresser living in a small community of Senegalese women, all stranded in Casablanca. Tossed between settling down and transiting to Europe, these young women try to find their way to survive in generous and hostile Moroccan society.

Egyptian film director Yehia encounters his first love Ginger as he was being celebrated in New York. Back then they were 19 years old. The American Dream was the thing of the 20th century.

Yehia finds out that he had begotten an American child, a boy. Through a boisterous epic in which heroes love, sing, dance, laugh and cry, Youssef Chahine reconsiders his past and his ambiguous relationship to America which he loved so much.

Something More Than Sound
###BREAK###
'Something more than Sound' explores the process of making music as well as the space required by the artist to make it. The documentary takes an in-depth look into how and why a musician creates art and how external environmental factors effect both the creative process and the artist's psyche. In a cathartic manner, the performative compulsion to share these sounds with a community draws the musician out from the isolated, individualized home while still allowing for the creator to maintain the levels of comfort and safety achieved within the home, but now on display in a public arena. 'Something more than Sound' portrays the many varied homes in which the musician lives: physical, mental, communal, and transcendent.

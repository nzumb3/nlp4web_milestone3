Meesha Madhavan
###BREAK###
Madhavan is a petty thief who has a crush on Bhageerathan Pillai's daughter, Rugmini. Bhageerathan Pillai on the other hand considers him as his arch rival. Initially Rugmini also dislikes Madhavan, plans a couple of traps to trap Madhavan, but a turn of events finds a 2-way bonded love between the two. Then comes Eppan Pappachi, the new C.I who dislikes Madhavan very much. A lot of comedy scenes (exclusively from Dileep) follow. Then one day the idol of the village goddess disappears. Everyone suspects Madhavan, but (as usual) Madhavan is innocent. Madhavan is arrested, but he escapes and starts his secret investigation only to discover a bigger conspiracy than what seems........

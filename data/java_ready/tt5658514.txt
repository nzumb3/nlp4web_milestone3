En film om fotboll

"How can you have played football for 20 years!?" It is a question writer/director Beate Grimsrud tries to find the answer to, when she explores her lifelong fascination for the sport of football, both inside and outside the field. It is a story of blood, sweat and tears in the fight for results and recognition. It is an unusual and humoristic film about girls, women and the fighting spirit

Taming the Horse
###BREAK###
The documentary features Dong, a young man migrated from the wind-blown plains of Inner Mongolia to a densely populated Southern China, with his parents, during China's economic reform. Young Dong's spirited ideals were at odds with the values of a rapidly modernizing society in the early throws of consumerist frenzy and is spiritually alienated and socially troubled. When a good old friend and filmmaker returns to the city with a video camera in hand on the eve of Dong's 30th birthday, something in him stirs and he begins pouring out the interior landscape he had so long kept sealed away.

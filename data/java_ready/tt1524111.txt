City of the Dawn
###BREAK###
City of the Dawn is a documentary film exploring Auroville, an experimental city created to be a living embodiment of human unity. This laboratory for the future wants to transcend all that separates human beings, religion, politics, money, race, social position, creed, etc., and find new ways to coexist that benefit all. Here, citizens from 40 nations live their lives dedicated to this aspiration for a place where a more-conscious human family lives and shares and supports one another as part of one planet.

You can only hear 'No' so many times before you do something utterly absurd. Graham Marshall thought submitting a 3 track demo to a record company was boring so he had an idea... A singer/songwriter from Linwood Scotland; Graham, along with his trusty companion armed with a camera, both set out to conquer the streets of the U.K in this mammouth musical adventure. Filmed over a period of 7 days, Graham busked an amazing 18 gigs, covering 1500 miles from John O'Groats in north east Scotland, to Land's End in Southwest England. Graham set out to prove that the 'Talent Show' isn't the only way to go if you want to 'Make it'.

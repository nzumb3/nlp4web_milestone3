Sandy (Lorraine Toweel) is a happily married therapist until one of her patients (Jack Douglas) has a terrible dream about her future. On one dark night after a happy date with her husband John (Richard Delamore), John suffers a violent death. Sandy finds it hard to focus on her work and has to get away from her life to deal with the tragedy that haunts her mind - reliving the scariest moments of that fateful night. Sandy goes on a physical and spiritual journey to test for the supernatural - she has to know if God exists. However, the murderer (played by Michael O'Grady) is still at large and continually seeks the ideal opportunity to take her life. Shot in New South Wales, primarily in Sydney's western suburbs, the film incorporates additional rising talent such as Harley Johnston, Jay Kallaway and Mitch Christen as police officers, Wassim Hawat as the Teacher, Melissa Davis, Alyssa Jane and Samantha Walsh as therapy patients.

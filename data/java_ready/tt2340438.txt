I Love This Place
###BREAK###
I LOVE THIS PLACE is about my backyard - a special patch of coastline - From Bondi Beach to the tiny and intimate Clovelly. The essence of Sydney's culture in four beaches next to the city. It's not a travelogue, or a surf movie, or a 'reality' beat-up, it's a layered, impressionistic portrait of this distinctive slice of seashore, and its people. in the next 72 minutes you won't find a single interview, but a great bespoke soundtrack by composer David Roberts. Beaches are like theatre - people from a multitude of cultures are the players on this stage a small expanse of coast. I LOVE THIS PLACE shows how the sheer nature of location defines people's personalities. How our interaction to place is personal and intimate.

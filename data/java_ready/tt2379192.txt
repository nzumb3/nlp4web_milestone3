Nove Crônicas para um Coração aos Berros
###BREAK###
Larissa is no longer in love with Mário; Leopoldo does not know whether to stay or go; Júlio still lives with his mother; Simone is tired of being a hooker; Vanise is reminded of what it means to be a woman; Philipp does not want to go back home; Carol carries a graveyard of memories with her; André wants to make a different kind of sound; Denise decided to have new experiences while there is still time. In this surprising mosaic of human relationships and day-to-day situations, men and women of different ages feel a pressing need to reinvent themselves. As they cross each other's paths in a city that has stopped in time, they all are, each in their own way, at a turning point in their lives.

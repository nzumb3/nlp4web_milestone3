Fool's Gold: California Raodtrip in an Election Year
###BREAK###
America's West: where the good life includes sustainable income, development of land use, the rise of a town, and the horror of its crash and burn. FOOLS GOLD: CALIFORNIA ROAD TRIP in an ELECTION YEAR, features America's dream of a better tomorrow; while asking what is the nature of our "work" and how does that impact us, our surroundings and the environment? We are drawn into a bizarre mix that includes a mining town, its adjoining attraction of unique prehistoric rock formations used by Hollywood for science-fiction movie sets, a salt lake bed and the mineral wealth of borax incorporated, along with personal stories of elderly residents who experienced the live-work experiment that eventually resulted in a mass layoff and exodus. The edit weaves together different genres revealing actions, desires, and mindsets similar to those who gravitated to the West during the era of Manifest Destiny. Scientific and historic facts about the Gold Rush, the 1980's and current times, entwine with the story of Cain's intention towards his brother Abel, and Zombies found in many horror movies, that nonetheless, parallels human desire and its habits of consumption.

Goa Is Not India
###BREAK###
Goa is not India, says Leon about the quaint village Arambol Beach situated in North Goa - a place well known as a meeting point for neo-hippies, where people are searching for health and new inspiration in life, and where dropouts spend their time relaxing and chilling at the beach. With a cheerful touch of irony the Austrian film maker Rudolf Gottsberger paints the loving pictures of five dropouts, who are stranded in Arambol: a panorama of dreams, wishes and desires, sometimes even the search for spiritual enlightenment. But the documentary also sheds light on the smaller and larger challenges of everyday life, its protagonists have to deal with... but just to enjoy shanti times again, as Elena, the Russian owner of the Hempcafe in Arambol describes.

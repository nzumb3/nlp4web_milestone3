DocoBANKSY
###BREAK###
Understanding how plastic any notion of truth and value can be, when the subject of an interview can be manipulated into saying anything the film-maker wants, when a guy with a spray can has more relevance to the world of art than its most famed and moneyed exponents. Even the opinion people have of the work is contradictory, favored by their prejudices. docoBANKSY gleefully picks up on these contradictions, playing opposing soundbites over the same graffiti. docoBANKSY adds another layer onto the absurdity by making the point that the film is not even his own work, simply something that he has found and redistributed.

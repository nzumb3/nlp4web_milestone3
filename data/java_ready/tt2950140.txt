A Woman's Deeper Journey Into Sex
###BREAK###
A Woman's Deeper Journey Into Sex follows Private Detective Lacey's quest to determine whether women need emotional connection for good sex. As Lacey travels from Australia to North America, the UK and Jamaica, she investigates women paying for sex, rent-a-dreads, women's uptake of porn and romance dependency. She also dips into her Dictionary intermittently on matters such as women's social history. With memorable characters including ex-Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss, porn star Jesse Jane, Miss Cougar International and a range of ordinary women, this fast-paced film, written in verse, blends documentary, drama, animation and graphics to peep into the world of female sexuality.

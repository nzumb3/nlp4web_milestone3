Vincent del Toro is a young man with a dream. He is a determined entrepreneur who has just started his eco-friendly business in California, Del Toro Green Motor Company. Del Toro specializes in converting vintage cars into electric vehicles. When he's about to sell his first fleet, Vincent realizes that the licensing bureau will not grant him the certification he needs to sell his converted vehicles as road worthy. Vincent is highly in debt. Without the government certification, he cannot sell the cars and repay his bank loan. The bank gives him 45 days to resolve his financial problems. After that period, they will seize his cars. Desperate to avoid financial failure, Vincent returns home to Michigan to purchase licensed motor and obtain further financing. However no other bank will lend him money, as he has no other collateral. He randomly meets Bill, a former high school friend who is now running a prosperous construction business. Vincent decides to seek help from Bill, only to learn that Bill's business is not in fact construction but marijuana grow-ops. A single crop of M39 could fix all of Vincent's financial problems within 39 days. But appearances can be deceiving... Bill proves to be unstable and his position differs significantly from what he originally presented. All of which will have extreme consequences for Vincent.

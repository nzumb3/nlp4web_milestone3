Obsession and lust are a recipe for disaster in this psychological thriller directed by Polish born Director Mariusz Kotowski. Ryan (David Lago) is an insecure, lonely bank teller who is fated to always want what he cannot have. When the power driven, sexually aloof Angelica (Lisa Marie Lamendola) struts into his bank, his bizarre infatuation is set into high gear. Desperate to know everything about her, Ryan stumbles upon the perfect opportunity to position himself in a place of power and silent possession. He is hired by the needy, empty-nester Dolores (Cyndi Williams) to be her part-time maintenance man and surrogate son, as she sets him up in her dead son's apartment with a window directly across from his object of desire. From this new voyeuristic vantage point, Ryan's passion plummets safely down the barrel of a telescope. At a coward's distance, he witnesses the revolving door of suitors unqualified for his beloved's affections. Finally, convinced he is the only one to bring Angelica true happiness, he makes his move only to realize that he himself has unknowingly been the object of obsessive examination, which results in a staged tragic final escape. A provocative sexually charged game of cat and mouse where one never knows who laid the trap.

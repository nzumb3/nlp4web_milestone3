CHAD Exodus
###BREAK###
This film gives a brief overview of the Bororro tribe's exodus across a vast region of Central Africa as they congregate in a part of Chad's Sahel region for their annual celebration of an incredible event called Gerewol. Although this is something they have been carrying out peacefully for thousands of years, recently their way of life is under threat because of ethnic/religious changes sweeping across the region.

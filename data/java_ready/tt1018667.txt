Angels Can't Help But Laugh

Actress Terri J. Vaughn sits down with 25 of Hollywood's African-American actresses to discuss how they deal with being in today's entertainment industry. While media floods unrealistic ideas to the general public about these women, this documentary allows viewers a candid, unscripted exposure into the minds and hearts of these actresses. Ms. Vaughn sincerely removes these women from the characters we know, and reveals the essence of real women. These actresses open up to talk about their fears, disappointments, successes, families, and careers. The state of "Black Hollywood" is in a serious quandary, and these women hold no tongues when discussing their plights and obvious issues that are often quieted. Yet in that same moment of seriousness, each actress is able to relish in the splendor they bring to our television and film screens

El Rey
###BREAK###
Stefan and Adi have been friends and band mates for years. Sick of life in Austria, they embark on a musical adventure through Latin America. On an old school bus transformed into their home on wheels, we ride with them as they meet locals, exchange songs and discover music that is more than just frivolous diversion. Through the eyes of our maverick musicians, we are exposed to some of the hardship and injustice people face each and every day. The Austrians experience how music transcends and uplifts during the road trip. Music can never be dispossessed, embrace life through music.

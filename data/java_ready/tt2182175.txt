The Great Chameleon
###BREAK###
You know you're a marked man when you're released from jail and the entire police force knows it. So it is for Joe Murky (Victor Altomare), a charismatic master of alternate identities, who walks out of the penitentiary with the cops still obsessing over the "cold case" of the stolen money he stashed before his incarceration. The heat is on. But - aided by his longtime pal and "pro" Max - Joe has a more personal motivation than money. Sometime during Joe's prison term, his niece Shawna has gone missing. And it soon becomes obvious that her fate and the police's interest in him are intertwined. On Joe's tail almost from the moment of his release is his police case worker Officer Curry (Robert Davi) and Katy Simm (Monique Zordan). There are dollar signs in their eyes, blinding them to Joe's plan to turn the tables on his pursuers. Joe wants answers. He's especially curious about the cop on Shawna's case, Det. Pendell and his sudden decision to drop the investigation. Peeling away the layers of corruption seems like a tall order for two men - but not when one of them is capable of appearing in any disguise and any persona imaginable. He is a one-man army of identities. The Great Chameleon is a crime story with mordant laughs, and family fun.

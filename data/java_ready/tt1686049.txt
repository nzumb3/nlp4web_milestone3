Higher Education
###BREAK###
University, the one place in Australia and every country, where people from every kind of culture and challenge connect. This film tells the story of six students, refugees and outsiders surviving state homes, mental illness, rural poverty, war and genocide to achieve their dreams and possibilities. Their backgrounds range from white and Aboriginal Australian to Afghani and one survivor of a genocide of a little known people called Oromians in Ethiopia. Dramatic and daring, their stories are shared with one another - and intimately with the audience. Boldly visual, Higher Education is a film from their own point of view.

The Physical Body 2
###BREAK###
The Physical Body 2 is the powerful follow up to the groundbreaking documentary The Physical Body: Indian Wrestling and Physical Culture. In this second volume, we examine the intense competition training routines leading to participation in the Dangals or wrestling competitions. The documentary remains the only exclusive intimate first hand look at the training inside the Akharas as one prepares to take part in competition as well as the actual Dangal matches not only fiercely contested for money but for prestige and as a dominant symbol of a rigorous, perfected way of life.

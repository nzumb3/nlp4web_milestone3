An outraged reverend buys a public access station that specializes in what he considers pornographic broadcasting (shows include "Conspiracy Of The Week" and "Eat Me" all on Channel 69) ran by his daughter and her friends. The teens seize the station, however and seek public support for their efforts. However, when no one seems to be paying attention they start an all nude broadcast that gets them national exposure.

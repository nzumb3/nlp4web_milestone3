Black Cain
###BREAK###
Humanity is separated by individual situations and personalities. Some people are bound by faith, while others are bound by the blood running through their veins. In the inner city of Atlanta, two brothers cross each other's paths unexpectedly when they both arrive at their mother's house for different reasons...one brother back from college ends up being a product of society turning to drugs as a way to solve his problems, while the other comes back wreaking havoc, murdering, robbing and ultimately making a huge mistake that alters the lives of everyone he loves. With every "Cain" there's an "Abel", but in this game of life and death, who will come out on top in the end?

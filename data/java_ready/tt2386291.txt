Deadly Revisions
###BREAK###
Horror writer and filmmaker Grafton Torn awakens from a coma to find himself with a bum leg and a large section of his memory missing. To aide in the doctor's orders of rest and relaxation, Grafton goes to a remote cabin in the woods. There, with the help of a hypnotherapist and medication, Grafton tries to piece together the missing memories. But nightmares haunt him...nightmares that blend possible memories with characters from his own horror films...nightmares that happen while he's awake!

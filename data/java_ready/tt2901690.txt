A Strange Course of Events
###BREAK###
Forty-something Saul is a melancholic dreamer, with a tendency to run whenever things go wrong. He returns to Haifa one day for a reckoning with the father he has not seen in five years. But getting along with an airy-fairy mother-in-law with a penchant for new age, a daughter on the verge of adolescence and a father who's been converted to Yoga is not easy. After a fateful slip, Saul will find his place as son, a father and more.

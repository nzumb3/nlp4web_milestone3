Hunting for Hunger
###BREAK###
A documentary demonstrating that by harvesting white-tail deer each season, we maintain a healthy deer population while preventing crop damage to farmers. Venison is donated through a national program called Farmers and Hunters Feeding the Hungry which pays for the processing of deer meat to be given to hot meals programs, Salvation Army branches, churches, and other charities who provide meal assistance to people who are hungry. In addition to these benefits, hunting deer offers many other benefits to our community such as reducing automobile collisions with deer on Ohio roadways, effecting motor vehicle insurance premiums and claims, providing a better nutritional source of meat, and contributing to a significant portion of Ohio's economy.

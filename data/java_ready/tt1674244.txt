Brick by Brick
###BREAK###
Brick by Brick is a modern dramedy. Just as someone can help to tear your wall of life down one brick at a time, you can also rebuild into a more fortified structure one brick at a time. The main character, Shelia (She-Lee-ah) is confronted with and addresses the importance of maintaining positively intact mental health, and how not to be afraid to get help (professional) in a time of crisis. Our thinking is: Prayer is good, however, getting counseled should not hurt. This film shows that Shelia cannot catch a break if she tried. She learns that when family members and work-mates have it out for you, you can't do enough to get even with them. So, just stand back and watch Karma unfold.

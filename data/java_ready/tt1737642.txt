One Revolution intimately captures Chris Waddell's very human journey to dare greatly and ultimately to live fully. This film chronicles the heart and spirit behind an extraordinary achievement as it documents the first almost entirely unassisted paraplegic ascent of 19,340-foot Mt. Kilimanjaro. Featuring Chris Waddell, thirteen-time Paralympic medalist, five years removed from his final international competition and Tajiri Mungaya, a Tanzanian porter who's leg was amputated after a tragic rockslide on the slopes of Kilimanjaro, Chris begins the journey seeking international visibility for disabled athletes with Tajiri who is determined to return to the mountain that stole his leg and his livelihood. By using a modified handcycle Chris painstaking pulls himself through Kilimanjaro's diverse and beautiful landscape inches at a time. As he doggedly continues up the mountain he is besieged by rocks, cold, darkness, dust, altitude, fatigue, equipment failures, and fear. His determination and the emotional support of traveling companions the only respite in a seemingly impossible journey. Together they attempt to break two world records and become the first Tanzanian amputee and the world's first paraplegic to make it to the summit of Kilimanjaro without being pushed, pulled, or carried.

Josh and Sam hit the road for one wild trip in this action-packed comedy. On the way from Washington, D.C., to New Orleans for the annual Mardi Gras celebration, the friends accidentally run over a dangerous escaped convict deep in the heart of Dixie. And it looks like the boys will never make it to the big party on Bourbon Street when the local backwoods sheriff mistakes them for drug traffickers. Ethan Suplee, Kevin Connolly and Coolio star.

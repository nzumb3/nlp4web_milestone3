The Jamboree
###BREAK###
Three women find themselves as unwilling participants in a sadistic game of life or death. These new 'Contestants' must question morality and be willing to do anything that is necessary to survive and save their captive loved ones. Their biggest threats are the twisted murderous minds of the 'Hunting Parties' tracking them down...Nobody escapes this game without blood on their hands. Kill or be killed. Welcome to the Jamboree.

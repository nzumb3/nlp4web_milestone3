A - Di√°logo sin fronteras
###BREAK###
Two women meet after more than twenty years when they both attended the same Armenian school: the stories of Adriana Kalaidjian and Ana Arzoumanian took different directions, but once again cross paths when they engage in a dialogue that will not only structure the film, but will go around family and historical events that have deeply influenced and marked their lives: the Armenian genocide, the question of identity, the military dictatorship in Argentina and their relationships with others. A - Armenia and Argentina, the Triple A and Ararat, Ana and Adriana... One single letter with many hidden meanings - revealed in one film of the stories of two lives and two countries.

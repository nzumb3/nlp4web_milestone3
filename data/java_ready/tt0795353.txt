Celebrity Art Show
###BREAK###
What happens to that creative energy and the unrestricted, non self-censored, free-flow of ideas that reflects who we really are as we transition into adulthood? It seems that in this cyber-focused world of rational thinking, the creative spirit is lost in the over-13 population, or sadly, even in the over-kindergarten group; And so, the Celebrity Art Show has been developed to bring that creative spirit back to young audiences and to show them the fun and stimulating aspects of art; and to hopefully, instill a sense of importance in their creative side that they can take with them into adulthood. By showcasing personal artwork of community celebrities, the documentary aims to inspire young audience members to tap into their own artistic potential. The best of the work will be placed in a worldwide traveling exhibit where it will be open to the public. At the completion of the tour, all of the artwork will be auctioned off, and the profits from both the tour and the auction will be donated to a charity that supports youth and the further appreciation of art.

Desde las aguas

Villa Santo Domingo de Soriano was founded in 1624 by the first Europeans in the Banda Oriental (which is now Uruguay). This documentary re-discovers the settlement with a visit to its inhabitants and its houses, on the banks of the silent Rio Negro. The reality of this place is a reflection of a country's identity, as it tries to recover what it once was without giving up the will to prosper.

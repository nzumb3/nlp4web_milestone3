The Florida Suite
###BREAK###
The Florida Suite is a poetic documentary that tells the story of Andrew Graham, a retired attorney who lives in a log cabin in the middle of his 12-acre citrus grove, located near the shores of the Indian River, Florida. There, living with his three friendly dogs, he tends his fruit and takes care of his 90 year old mother, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease. The film is structured to, and takes it's name from, Frederick Delius' Florida Suite, a beautiful, four-movement tone poem. The film is about nurturing, as Graham takes care of his organic citrus, his dogs, and his mother; and of nature's healing power.

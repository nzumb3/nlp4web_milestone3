Chernobyl
###BREAK###
The document shows Chernobyl Exclusion Zone in 30 years after the nuclear power plant failure. Although there are a lot of documentary films about that disaster, none of them pay attention to how the tragedy affected the lives of ordinary people - displaced residents of Pripyat. The filmmakers managed to get to the direct witnesses of the events from the past and confront their memories of working in a dynamic power plant and living in a vibrant Pripyat with the present image of the wild and mysterious Exclusion Zone.

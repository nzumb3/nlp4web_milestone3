On Being Sane
###BREAK###
This movie is a personal journey of myself coming to terms with the diagnosis of Bipolar. The film starts with my initial question, 'Am I really Bipolar, and if so what does that mean for my future?'- After a 40 minute narrative of a study of myself and psychiatry, I come to my own conclusion. Not only is this film filled with the most recent information available about psychiatry, it also dives deep into what real people go through every day with these disorders. I end up becoming an activist, and the film stands to help the world understand mental illness better.

Das Werwolfspiel
###BREAK###
After 25 years Rosa returns to her family's vacation home in the middle of nowhere. Standing deep in the woods it hides dark and well kept secrets of her youth, that she's finally willing to confront. As well as her former 'playmates'. As soon as the role play 'The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow' starts, old habits and patterns of behaviour are re-established. The game, however, seems to develop a dynamic of it's own and claims some victims.

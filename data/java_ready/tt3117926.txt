A Bad Summer for Tomatoes
###BREAK###
"My Little Tomatoes" seems a cute nickname from a father to his motherless children, but after the death of the household cat instigates the telling of an old family fairytale, the name takes on a more literal meaning. Six-year old Sam and nine-year old Maggie bicker over the truth of the tale (and most everything else) until a sudden accident kills their dad. As strange things begin to happen on the farm, Maggie struggles beneath the onslaught of new adult responsibility while her brother throws all of his efforts into trying to bring their father back to life, by means of the fairytale's promise... A Bad Summer for Tomatoes is a story of sibling rivalry, magic, birth/death, and the importance of family to all of us.

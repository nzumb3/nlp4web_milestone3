Herbeast Comes to Life
###BREAK###
An over-the-top comedy about Herbeast Katzenmoyer, a talented but troubled cook who wants to be a chef. Just 25, an emotional immature Herbeast goes on a surrealistic journey to find his biological family with the help of his sweet and supportive girlfriend, Isabelle. Adding to the confusion would be Herbeast's psychologically damaged and potentially dangerous therapist, Barry Berenson, the emotionally unaware adoptive family, the Katzenmoyer's, the lecherous and extorting adoption agency director, Brian Berkowitz, his former porn-queen mother, and a frozen floating penis. Will Herbeast be able to find his way through this psychotic mess?

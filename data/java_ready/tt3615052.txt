A modern take on one of Warhol's seminal films, this documentary chronicles the life of the New Empire State Building in Las Vegas through one full night, including sunset and sunrise. 13 hours long, this journey is viscerally fulfilling, and shows an impressive range of light and shadow around the skyscraper situated at the New York New York Casino. Truly representative of the new Empire worshiped by modern US society in the new century, eschewing the old matriarch in the Big Apple.

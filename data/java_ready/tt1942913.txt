Lost on Purpose
###BREAK###
Our story takes place in the fertile, San Joaquin Valley. Fueled by gin and sheer determination, Elizabeth James (Ms. Liz) operates her third generation dairy farm outside the region's domineering co-ops. To help keep the place afloat, she's employed five renegade ranch hands. These boys have put a pin in responsibility and opted to stretch out the party as long as possible. Unfortunately, women, booze, and fisticuffs can only lead to one outcome: trouble. With the dairy farm reporting its third straight deficit year, Ms Liz is attracting some unwanted attention. Delbert Furgeson, the owner of the area's largest co-op, is pushing to buy her out. This only incenses the prideful Ms Liz and starts a volatile feud between the two. Sharing the narrative are the ranch hands. Randel and Rooker Lee are brothers caught in the crossfire of their parents' separation. Leslie Williams and Jackie Remmington are aspiring musicians, trying not to get caught up in their own success. Wade Kitchanski is at ends with his father, striving to find his own path outside the family paint business. As the boys struggle to find direction, Ms Liz and Delbert Furgeson launch into a full-blown war. When the dust settles, we realize it's not simply a story about winners and losers or finding your way. It's about purpose: to find what you believe in, through change, through loss, even if it's the small things. Then hold on to it and fight for it, because in the end that's all you have.

Ten thousand injured children pass every year through the spartan front room of this Trauma Unit in Cape Town. It is an extraordinary patient load for the relatively small staff of doctors and nurses here, who are exposed to the very worst of trauma through the experiences of their little patients, victims often of car accidents, family violence and fires which rage through townships. But this relatively modest hospital room is a place of hope, and has a life cycle of its own. We follow two exceptionally skilled women doctors who are on the front line of this trauma epidemic.

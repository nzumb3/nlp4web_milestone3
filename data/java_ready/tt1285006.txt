Requiem for Fanny
###BREAK###
Requiem for Fanny recreates the world of Felix Mendelssohn, to the musical accompaniment of his beautiful String Quartet No. 2. In a period setting, actors and dancers perform around and about the musicians, evoking the composer's happy childhood and sophisticated milieu, as well as his close relationship with Goethe and his symbiotic relationship with his sister Fanny, herself a major composer.

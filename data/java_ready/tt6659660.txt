The Grizzly Truth
###BREAK###
Documentary that objectively investigates the arguments made for and against grizzly bear hunting. First Nations, environmentalists, scientists and ecotourism operators are fighting a battle to ban the grizzly hunt in British Columbia, meanwhile grizzly hunting may soon become a reality in the Greater Yellowstone as grizzly bears are delisted from the Endangered Species Act. It also takes a closer look at the conflict between hunters and grizzly bear viewing operations. It reveals the real reason behind Timothy Treadwell's death in "Grizzly Man" and dispels the myth of the dangerous and ferocious grizzly bear by talking to famed naturalist Charlie Russell about his study of grizzlies in Russia. Charlie Russell was friends with Timothy Treadwell and did more than anyone to keep him alive but is now sadly compared to Timothy. Both Charlie and Timothy wanted to show that bears are not as dangerous as commonly believed but their message has been skewed by the media and Werner Herzog's documentary "Grizzly Man".

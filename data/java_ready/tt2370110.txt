Park City
###BREAK###
PARK CITY is the story of a filmmaking team that loses their movie and their minds. JOEY, an ambitious and jaded director, and HANNAH, a savvy producer, hit the road to the Sundance Film Festival with the 35mm film print of their movie, HEARTS AND CASH, in the trunk of Joey's battered Prius. They've invited along their melodramatic lead actress, JILL, who insists upon bringing her cat everywhere she goes; as well as their glorified production assistant, DAVE, who documents their Sundance Adventure on his iPhone. The team hits a few road blocks along the way, running out of gas in the middle of the desert and too strapped for cash to afford a hotel room in Vegas. When they arrive in Park City, they attempt to mingle at an industry mixer where Hannah is scheduled to meet a Hollywood producer, Mr. Cohn. He's less interested in her pitch as he is in Jill, who quickly seduces him as a means to earn some star power. Disillusioned by their failure to fit in at the party, Hannah, Joey, and Dave hit a local dive bar. After one too many shots and bad pick-up lines, all three of them black out. The next morning, Hannah wakes in a bathtub full of nachos in a wealthy family's ski lodge. Neither she nor Joey have any memory of how they got there. When Joey and Hannah check the trunk of the car, they discover that their film print is missing... and it's supposed to screen in four hours. The team must re-trace their booze-hazy steps from the night before in an attempt to find their film.

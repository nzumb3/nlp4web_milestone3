GalileoMobile: In the Land of Beauty
###BREAK###
GalileoMobile is a purely non-profit initiative run by astronomers, educators, and science communicators. It is a traveling science education program that brings astronomy closer to young people around the world, and mainly across regions that have little or no access to outreach actions. By organizing astronomy-related activities in schools and villages, they aim at fostering a will of learning through the exciting wonders of our Universe. On September 2013, GalileoMobile went in Uganda. An international team, formed of four GalileoMobile members (from Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Brazil), two film producers (from Italy), a local collaborator and a driver (from Uganda), shared a van that departed every day from Kampala to visit schools. 'GalileoMobile in the Land of Beauty' is the story of that amazing adventure.

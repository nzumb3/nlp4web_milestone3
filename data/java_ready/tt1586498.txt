Down: Indie Rock in the PRC
###BREAK###
Notes from The Underground explores the indie rock music scene in China today, from rock clubs to outdoor concerts and festivals in Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, and Hunan. This film identifies some of the hottest bands making up the emerging indie rock scene in China today. It features interviews with band members, music promoters, club owners, and other people who are deeply invested in building up China's indie rock music scene. Put into the context of China's astonishing rise as a globalizing country, focusing on the disenchantment of youths who resist being thrust into the mainstream of culture and society, the film touches on universal themes of alienation and angst, while also highlighting the power of rock music to plumb the depths of the human soul and to bring people together as one.

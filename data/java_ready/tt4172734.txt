Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century
###BREAK###
Critics place Berenice Abbott at the head of her class. She was one of the greatest American photographers of the 20th Century. From her portraits of the avant-garde taken in Paris during the 1920's, to her documentation of New York in the 1930's, to her science photography of the 1950s, and her studies of small-town America, Abbott's genius is in the incredible range of her work. Filmed during her 91st and 92nd years, the open-hearted Abbott takes us on a guided tour of her century. The tour teaches history, perseverance, courage, and single-minded dedication to one's chosen field. A brilliant film about a brilliant American artist!

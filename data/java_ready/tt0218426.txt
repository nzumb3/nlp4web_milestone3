June is trying to hold on to her career, her beauty, her children and her most recent love, Robert - a tender but slightly confused younger man. To escape the world, June makes frequent trips through the car wash, singing her heart out. June's twelve year old daughter Adele - an amazingly mature adolescent surrounded by amazingly adolescent adults - tries to make sense of the emotional upheaval surrounding her. Within her weird extended family, Adele learns about loyalty, betrayal, forgiveness and what to expect from love.

Goodbye Gauley Mountain: An Ecosexual Love Story
###BREAK###
What happens when we change our relationship from Earth as Mother to Earth as Lover? This is the story of how two ecosexuals, Beth Stephens and Annie Sprinkle, came to marry the Appalachian Mountains and join the fight to abolish mountain top removal (MTR). Documenting a trip back to Beth's hometown of Gauley Bridge, West Virginia, the film examines how small communities face destruction for short-term corporate gain and the brave activists who put their own bodies on the line to try to stop it. Featuring extreme tree hugging, rock kissing, and skinny-dipping, it shows how the fight against environmental injustice can be a little more sexy, fun, hopeful, and diverse.

Awake in the Dream
###BREAK###
Awake In The Dream gently takes its audience "by their hand and heart" and guides them into the recognition of their inherent divine creative power. Awake transports its message through internationally well known spiritual leaders, visionaries and scientists and the radically honest and touching story of the filmmaker herself. The beautiful images and the soundtrack alone would make it worth to see the movie. It gives astonishing and easy to follow answers to the most crucial questions of humanity "Who are we really?" "What is the sense of life?" "How can I find happiness?" Many simple and easy to apply tools within the movie allow the audience to find their old sabotaging mechanisms and to transform them.

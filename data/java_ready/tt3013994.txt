###BREAK###
The Freeport Rifle and Revolver Association has taught children gun safety and marksmanship for the past 25 years, attracting families and gun enthusiasts several towns and counties away to its range in western Long Island. Now with America's unique gun culture under the microscope following several mass shootings - including the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 young children murdered on Dec. 14, 2012 - the range and its dedicated families find themselves part of a vocal movement against gun control measures. 'Junior Shooters' is a thought-provoking look at the cultural divide between two cultures and America's obsession with firearms.

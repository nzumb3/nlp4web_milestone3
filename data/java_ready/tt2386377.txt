Zama Zama
###BREAK###
In South Africa's gold mining region is the subterranean dimension of the Zama Zama, illegal miners that make a living by mining the ore in both operational and abandoned mine shafts. Zama Zama is the personal narrative of two brothers - Malcolm, a successful businessman in the mining industry and his long lost brother Joseph, one of those who work in the underground tunnels - playing off against the tension of the mines' punitive actions against these miners. The plot revolves around moral choices: social standing and success versus loyalty to and love of family.

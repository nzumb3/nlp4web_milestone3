Sapna (Kajol) was a frequent visitor to the Saigal mansion as her father was the most trusted driver of the family. She envied the rich, and wanted to be like them. When she is reminded of her social status by the super rich brat Vicky Saigal (Saif Ali Khan), she leaves town to make something of herself. Now she is back as a successful and wealthy model and Vicky sees her in a different light and falls for her. The problem is that his elder brother Vijay (Akshay Kumar) is already in Love with the same girl.

Where the Sea Used to Be
###BREAK###
Two brothers meet up for the obligatory Christmas Eve pint and find themselves spending that day together. They don't discuss the big issues. The mysteries of the universe are not uncovered. No great wounds are healed nor sins forgiven. But gradually we learn everything important there is to know about these two men, their pasts and their futures. There are a few jokes and a song or two. Nobody gets too drunk. But the boys do meet Santy. Briefly. And their Auntie Betty cooks them a fry.

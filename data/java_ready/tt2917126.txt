39 Days Of Jack
###BREAK###
When Jack was sent to prison in 1994, his daughter was two years-old. Since then, he's dreamed of the day he would be released. He's dreamed of the day he could be a father again. Seventeen years later, today is that day, and we're there to see it. We aim to follow Jack for the first 90 days after his release as he attempts to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and reintegrate into society. But things don't go as planned, and the documentary comes to an abrupt halt on day 39.

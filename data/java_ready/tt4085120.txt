Of the Iron Range
###BREAK###
Of the Iron Range documents a cultural event in a small midwestern town (Cuyuna, MN) that once held the nation's supply of iron ore. Every year, people from across the region gather for a dynamic, convivial social performance where hundreds of wood ticks are gathered and raced. Deeply symbolic and rich in human observation, Of the Iron Range offers a portrait of one of America's once-thriving industrial sites.

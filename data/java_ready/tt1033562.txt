A downright untruthful affair... But what's going on in most people's minds when seeing this movie is: What on earth is it all about? What about if the Euro is ruled by some curious esoteric freaks with the big moneys in their hands? And what, if the coin would be a symbol for the twelve stars and so on? Maybe you think, our conspiracy story concerning the Euro is a little bit too curious - but what if the reality here in the hearth of Europe would be a little bit like that?

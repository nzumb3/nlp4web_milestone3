Domestic Differences
###BREAK###
Beginning with an April 1994 address by Nelson Mandela the week prior to the first democratic elections in South Africa, this documentary takes an intimate look at the lives of an affluent white family, the Silbermans, and their live-in black domestic employee, Frances Mncam. The personal portraits are combined with an examination of the effects of the pending historic general election. A brief discussion of the political parties in the election, and the political climate in general, is included, but the focus is on the personal lives and opinions.

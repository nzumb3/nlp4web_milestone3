He has played for three decades, and claims "To be known as a sore thumb, has it's downsides." Often, he has paid for "fame" with loneliness. And In times where the old 68ers have become career oriented, his political tenacity has been impressive. Violinist Klaus is one of the few "reliable spoil-sports".

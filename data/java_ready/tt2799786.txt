Invisible Las Vegas II
###BREAK###
What are the challenges and issues facing West Las Vegas today? How, in general, does this relate to the larger African-American community in the city, now dispersed throughout, and the decidedly multicultural Las Vegas of the 21st Century? Through interviews with local residents, police, educators, activists, and clergy, Invisible Las Vegas Part II tells the heretofore untold story of modern, post-segregation West Las Vegas. With stunning cinematography, original historical research and heartfelt testimony, this latest documentary from Desert Rose Productions brings the tragedy and triumph, the struggle and love that drives this American community to life.

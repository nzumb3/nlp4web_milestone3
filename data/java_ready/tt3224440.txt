Road to Kabul
###BREAK###
Hindu-Kush Mountains, with peaks of 7000 meters before dark expanses as the red spice on the Silk Road. ISAF soldiers, people of the rural districts, the Red Cross, police and army in the capital region. The Road to Kabul is a journey into today's Afghanistan, a country struggling to rise from the ashes of an endless war. And then in the history of the Italian army through the two world wars. From the bloody trenches of the first conflict to the infinite steppes of the desperate retreat from Russia, to fight again in the resistance to Nazism and Fascism. And back to Afghanistan, among the rural districts of the region of Kabul. A cycle of war and mountains, to understand the present by looking at the future, with an ancient heart.

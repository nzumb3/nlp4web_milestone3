Frying Tonight
###BREAK###
Filmed over two years, Frying Tonight is a warm and uplifting slice of life from behind the counter of a typical, high street family fish and chip shop. We follow a young and ambitious fish frier, Zohaib, who goes to extraordinary lengths to convince his parents to let him takeover and modernize their aging business. His journey takes him to the final of a prestigious industry competition and a date with royalty, but is it enough to convince his parents to hand over the keys to the shop? Along the way we gain a unique insight into a British institution that is facing uncertain times and see how the Leeds-based National Federation of Fish Friers is helping to shape the future of the industry.

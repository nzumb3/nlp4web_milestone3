About the Bells
###BREAK###
While trying to complete the greatest commission of his life, small-town artist Caleb Bell unexpectedly finds himself in a mid-life crisis. Struggling to keep his life in order, he turns to his eccentric family for support - including his overly protective wife, Marie; apathetic and sardonic son, Cameron; environmental-activist daughter, Autumn; and genius six-year-old child, Jackson. As he attempts to reassemble the various pieces of his personal and professional life, Caleb soon discovers that neither art nor family are as elementary as he once suspected.

###BREAK###
It all starts with an accident. A badly managed meeting between a car and a motorbike. A meeting, in fact, of several destinies. Those of a couple in meltdown, a disillusioned young man, a young girl in search of enchantment, and a crotchety old man. In the end, the accident turns out to be the accident of life, which you either give up, or you don't.

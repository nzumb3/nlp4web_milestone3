The African Burial Ground: An American Discovery
###BREAK###
The African Burial Ground: An American discovery is a four part series designed for in-classroom use by young adults, principally US high school students. A general audience interested in the history of the African American experience in New York, urban archeology or social activism will also find these programs fascinating. Part One, The Search, explores the search and discovery of the African Burial Ground in Lower Manhattan. It examines the archeological dig that resulted in unearthing the remains of some 400 African men, women and children. Part Two, a History, presents the never-before-told-story of the history of Africans and African Americans in New York City from 1613 until July 4th, 1827 -- NYC's Emancipation Day. Part Three, Politics and the People, documents the impact of local citizens upon the African Burial Ground. Witnessing the conflict between "the people" and an agency of the United States Government, this segment highlights an essential and important civics lesson: how citizens can change the course of history. Part Four, An Open Window, presents the long-range impact of the African Burial Ground and its greater cultural effect on art, literature, history, science and education in the United States.

My Best Friend: A Story of Human Animal Bonding
###BREAK###
'My Best Friend' is about love, but, it is also about responsibility, saying goodbye, and grieving. Even though this film faces the subject of death and dying, it is not meant to be a sad film, but a tribute to the love and close bond we have with our animals.

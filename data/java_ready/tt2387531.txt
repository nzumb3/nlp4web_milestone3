Mondo Banana
###BREAK###
Deep in the forests of Sumatra, a Finnish sea captain seeks an elusive banana. In a Kolkata kitchen, Bengali chefs prepare scrumptious banana stalk curries. As the sun blazes in Kuala Lumpur, a Chinese exorcist calls forth an evil banana spirit... MONDO BANANA is a documentary adventure about bananas - and people. Whisking the viewer off on an international journey through the vibrant world of human-banana relationships, the film explores the personal, cultural, and environmental importance of one of the world's favorite fruits. Shot on location in China, Finland, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand, and featuring an eclectic cast of people who have been touched by this remarkable fruit, MONDO BANANA cooks up a delicious banana-flavored medley of puppetry, culinary demonstrations, exorcisms, scientific research, performance art, anthropology, underground film, and dragon-dancing to peel away the secrets of human-banana relations and celebrate the age-old connection between people and plants.

In 1986, a widowed man comes back to his home town in Argentina, Rosario. His seven year old son was recovered from "false parents" by the deceased mother's family, with whom he now lives: his maternal grandmother and aunt. The man tries to readjust to his new reality, and that of his friends and family, two years after his wife's disappearance, and after his own departure from town. While attempting to construct a relationship with the son he'd never seen, the man makes up with his own father, and old friends. But he never forgets his wife, her strange disappearance, and mysterious death.

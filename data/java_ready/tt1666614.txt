December Art
###BREAK###
In 2001, Bancroft piloted an initiative program enabled to create subtle, exciting works of art through a system developed by Artistic Realization Technologies (A.R.T.). The system makes it possible for medically disabled and mentally fragile people access to painting, photography, music and sculpture. The documentary follows three students involved with the program behind closed doors at the Bancroft School at Voorhees Pediatric Facility.

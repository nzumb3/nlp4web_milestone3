Le Degr√© 6 du Voyageur
###BREAK###
I have long dreamed of leaving a monotonous life to hit the road but I've never done it until the day I met Greg. Greg adopted the travel as a lifestyle and made me share his daily life spent on the road. In his philosophy of travel, Greg has established five different degrees equivalent to five different ways to travel. I realized over the adventures and encounters that have been made on the roads of Eastern Europe, India and the United States that there was a sixth degree; a degree that, when it reaches you, change your perception of the world and its multiple realities. A sixth degree that transports you or destroys you.

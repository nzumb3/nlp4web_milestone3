'Ortigueira: Echoes at Land's End' is a documentary featuring the Celtic music festival of Ortigueira. Since 1978, this small coastal town in northern Galicia (Spain) has been the host of an annual international gathering of Celtic music and dance. In the summer of 2012, the Grozdanova sisters of El Jinete Films documented the magical atmosphere, and through the stories of festival founders, locals and visiting musicians, they tell the story of this unique festival and its harboring community.

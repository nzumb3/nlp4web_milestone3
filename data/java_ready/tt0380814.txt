What Ever Happened to Alice
###BREAK###
Alice, whose soul has split between good and evil, cradles a baby that whimpers but never reveals its face. Haunting cries echo within her boarded up house in the windy desert. Alice imprisons Rebecca and jerks her into a mad ghostly mind- game through a murderous past and explosive future where both meet their fates.

Of One Blood
###BREAK###
An aim to put an end to suicide bombing with the thought that if our children were doing it, we would put a stop to it: An apparently normal suburban white LA 20 year old girl, radical feminist poet. Her painter mother died in an auto accident, and she now lives with her father, who is a clown. She dresses secretly in a Muslim shash to gain access to a French businessman explosives dealer. In a twist, she betrays him, grieves her father, showing the hopelessness that leads to it and the pain that's left behind, in her misguided obsessive effort to free the women of the middle east from oppression. Music plays a great part in the movie, with a soundtrack album of original music by the filmmaker. It is shot in a faux doc style and is meant to appear real, with interviews of the actors breaking the fourth wall and cameos by director Wim Wenders and painter Patrick Morrison discussing the student movement of the sixties in the U.S. and in Europe, inserted in homage to Godard. This is a very small movie about a very big subject and is experimental in nature.

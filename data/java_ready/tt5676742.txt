My Dream, My Right
###BREAK###
Za'atari Film Workshop was an initiative, cosponsored by Voices of the Children and Save the Children, that included a 3-week filmmaking experience for Syrian refugee teens in the Za'atari refugee camp in Jordan. Using camera phones as their recording device, this workshop provided the basics of documentary film making. The end result of the workshop is nine documentary shorts filmed entirely by the teens on a subject of their choosing. In addition, each film is scored independently by music composition students at McNally Smith College of Mucis in St. Paul, MN USA. Their film, 'My Dream, My Right', is a collective of all nine independently produced films. The workshop was their first experience in film making.

Lantos Tamas (Antos Gemes) is a sick, burnt out, one-hit wonder who realizes on a late autumn day that his life, which is unstoppably passing by, got to a dead end and he decides to press the stop button on his dubious life-story's VHS tape and tries to rewind it to the very spot where everything was nice and beautiful. He escapes from the life of the busy city streets, the sugar-free bio-foods, the forbidding medical reports and of course the women, hoping that he'll be able to compose the BIG HIT which will bring him the desired fame and help him to become a shining star for eternity. So he tries to get back on track to his lost childhood happiness in the lake-side house of his most beautiful memories.

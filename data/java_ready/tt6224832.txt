Armenia
###BREAK###
"Armenia" is a cinematic interweaving of film, literature and history. The day after his fiftieth birthday, Haig Boghos (Alain Croubalian), a world-weary singer embarks on a personal journey revisiting his family's history of genocide, exile, and diaspora. His journey leads from his current hometown Basel, to his childhood home Marseille to Armenia-the homeland of his forefathers. Haig's odyssey culminates in the discovery of a mass grave- the last resting place of many of the victims of the Armenian Genocide-including Haig's great-grand parents. Circling themes of family, identity, and spirituality, Armenia is a geographical, historical and psychological journey into one man's mind and into the collective consciousness of a troubled country and its people. However, Haig Boghos' odyssey is not solely a personal journey, it is much rather the journey of an archetype, a universal tale of displacement and forlornness that will resonate with everyone who feels a sense of spiritual homelessness.

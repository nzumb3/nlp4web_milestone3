Inuit Cree Reconciliation
###BREAK###
Filmmakers Zacharias Kunuk and Neil Diamond join forces on a journey to the remote site where their ancestors once clashed to celebrate 200 years of peace. Elders recount dramatic stories of battles, heroes and peacemaking from two different cultural perspectives. Coupled with incredible footage and a fantastic soundtrack, the film depicts the modern complexities of two communities living together in Canada's Far North and an age-old conflict between the Cree and Inuit that lasted more than a century.

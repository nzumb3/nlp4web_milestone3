Camouflage
###BREAK###
Promiscuity. Drug culture. Violence. Growing up in America. Growing up in Harlem. Things are rough all over especially for Jason Robbie. A 19 year old Harlemite trying to find his way a year after leaving high school. With a dubious source of income, family problems, and a roving eye for the ladies, Jason struggles with trying to better his life and prospects for college. Having a family member struggling with substance abuse is never easy. That, along with the pressures of an un-supportive school system, a pervasive drug culture, and omnipresent sexual distractions, makes it even more difficult for Jason. Does he pursue a career in the military as his Uncle Cash urges or follow his mom's lone piece of good advice: "Go to college"? Does he continue consuming his parade of female conquests or settle into the nurturing bosom of one good woman? "Camouflage" is a cinematic collage capturing the essence of a very specific time and place in "pre-gentrified" Harlem: before Starbucks, Mac stores and million dollar condos. It offers a window into the otherwise private subculture of urban youth through its documentary style narrative examining a few weeks in the life of 19-year old Jason Robbie. Sex, Drugs & Video games: self-medicating distractions that keep millions of young people from focusing on positive, attainable goals. Can Jason break the cycle for himself? "Camouflage" is a racy, sometimes shocking, portrait of a young man swimming through a lifestyle with him as our willing but sometimes reluctant guide.

Let's Be Out, The Sun Is Shining
###BREAK###
A film about a shy Indian-American receptionist named DIYA with romantic notions of love who falls in love with a charismatic but arrogant Brooklyn bartender PADDY to whom everyone is disposable and no relationship is meant to last. When Paddy rejects Diya for another woman, Diya immerses herself in his world of struggling actors and musicians who live potentially displaced in Bushwick, Brooklyn. Though Diya's protective older brother and uncle do not understand her need to "change the pattern" of her life, the magnetism and passion of this new circle of friends teaches Diya a few important lessons about lust, love and staying true to oneself.

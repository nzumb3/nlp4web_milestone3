"Can you describe yourself?" "Odenwald-Gay... or Gollum... or Klaus! 60 years old... gay... slave!" A documentary portrait of Klaus Johannes Wolf, who decided to live as a slave. Chained to his bed, he talks about his decision to be a slave, his parents and what it means to be naked. Finally he leaves everything behind to go to a slave camp, to put the finishing touches on his slave's life and become the perfect servant. Director's statement To be a slave in modern society is very similar to being a documentarian. It's about trying to attain the greatest possible freedom within your own set limits.

No.9
###BREAK###
No. 9 is the often amusing and quirky story of Gordon McIsaac's passion for a midget. A midget is a type of racing car used on oval speedway tracks. No. 9 was built in Alameda, California in 1935, the same year Gordon was born in New Zealand. Gordon is an artist and collector. He has never worked because of an accident at birth which left him with a nervous condition. He has never married and still lives in the same house he grew up in, with only a giant seagull for company. Over the years he has gradually converted the tiny backyard shed into an amazing museum of speedway memorabilia, now fabled throughout the world. No. 9 is a very different kind of love story.

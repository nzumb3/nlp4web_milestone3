The Fight to Forgive
###BREAK###
Forced to fight in Liberia's civil war, six former child soldiers now battle for peace in post-conflict Liberia. Trading their weapons for cameras and soccer balls, these ex-combatants train as grassroots peacebuilders and re-enter their villages after years of trauma and isolation. In THE FIGHT TO FORGIVE young Liberians discover that their future and a lasting peace for their developing nation depend on one final personal battle--the fight to forgive both themselves and the adults who forced them to kill.

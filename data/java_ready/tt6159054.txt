Between Land and Sea
###BREAK###
This documentary introduces the audience to surfing on the wild Atlantic coast in the west of Ireland. Filmed in and around Lahinch in County Clare, near the spectacular Cliffs of Moher, the film shows how Ireland has become a prime surfing location since about the year 2000, and how the sport has changed the sleepy town and provided new business opportunities for its inhabitants.

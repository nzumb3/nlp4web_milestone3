Do the Math
###BREAK###
The fossil fuel industry is killing us. They have five times the amount of coal, gas and oil that is safe to burn - and they are planning on burning it all. Left to their own devices, they'll push us past the brink of cataclysmic disaster - life as we know it will be irrevocably altered forever. Unless we rise up and fight back. DO THE MATH chronicles "America's leading environmentalist" Bill McKibben in a David-vs-Goliath battle to fight the fossil fuel industry and change the terrifying math of the climate crisis. Bill McKibben is going after Big Oil, Big Coal, and Big Gas directly - energizing a movement like the ones that overturned the great immoral institutions of the past century - such as Apartheid in South Africa. Putting his body on the line to stop the Keystone XL Pipeline and leading universities and institutions to divest in the corporations destroying our livelihoods, McKibben is uniting the growing global majority that view the climate crisis as the most important moral issue of the day. The film also features a veritable who's who of the climate movement including Dr. James Hansen (Frmr. Director, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies), Naomi Klein (Author, The Shock Doctrine), Van Jones (CNN Correspondent & Author, The Green Collar Economy) Lester Brown (President, Earth Policy Institute), Michael Brune (Executive Director, Sierra Club), Bobby Kennedy Jr. (President, Waterkeeper Alliance) Majora Carter (Founder, Sustainable South Bronx), Phil Radford (Executive Director, Greenpeace), James Gustave Speth (Co-Founder of NRDC), among others.

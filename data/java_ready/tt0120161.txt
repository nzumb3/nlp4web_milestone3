Maggie travels to Italy with great faith, as her last hope to heal her terminal illness, and meets Mike, an atheist concert pianist who helps her along her way. Ironically even the church itself doesn't believe in the healing powers of the statue, but Maggie's faith is so great it changes the life of everyone around her.

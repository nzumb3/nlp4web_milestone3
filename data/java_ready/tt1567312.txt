Gelecekten Bir Gün
###BREAK###
Tolga (Hayrettin Karaoguz), having struggled with bad luck all his life, believes he is a total loser and the unluckiest man in the whole world. Following an unsuccessful presentation of his new project at work, he is fired. Believing he has ruined his last chance to win over the love of his life (Hande Subasi), he commits suicide. After he dies, he is met by two angels (Rasim Öztekin and Arda Kural), who, as a punishment, show Tolga scenes from how his life would have been in the future if he had not committed suicide.

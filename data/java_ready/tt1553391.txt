Through Their Eyes
###BREAK###
It is usually a small district. Everyone knows one another and is in one another's business. For a long time, the Vietnamese believed that birth defects and deformities are debts for the wrong-doing people committed in their past lives- a karmic justice. There is a level of submission and acceptance to one's pre-destined fate. However, when neighbors begin to see common symptoms among their children, it becomes hard to believe everyone has the same destiny. The film captures resilient families hardened by their experiences with their affected loved ones. They tell their stories, struggles, hardships, successes, efforts and failures.

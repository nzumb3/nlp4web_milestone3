What if the 2013 NSA spying scandal was just the tip of the iceberg? With compelling insight from insiders, researchers, government representatives, lawyers, doctors and environmentalists, film-maker Josh del Sol takes us on a journey of revelation and discovery, questioning corporate and government actions toward in-home surveillance, extortion and eroding rights in the names of "smart" and "green." What you don't know *can* harm you. But what you'll discover will surprise, unsettle and empower you to challenge the status quo.

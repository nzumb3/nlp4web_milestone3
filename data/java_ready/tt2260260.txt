Re-enactors
###BREAK###
Jed Hankley lives to relive. From civil war battles to old western shootouts, Jed stops at nothing to create the most 'historical' re-enactments. When Jed is offered his dream job, a temp tour-guide at the Milltown Pioneer Village, he must set aside his differences with his old rival, Douglas Marshall-Pickett, to create the most 'authentic' experience possible. But will Jed and Doug's hardcore re-enacting standards clash with the cushy lifestyle of the Pioneer Village campers? For Jed and Doug the summer has now become 1866; for the campers, it's become a living nightmare.

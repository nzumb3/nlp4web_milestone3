John is an African immigrant who lives in Turin. He left his native Nigeria to follow a dream - to become a professional soccer player in Europe. When he returns to Lagos after a four-year absence, he revisits the haunts of his childhood, returning to the desolate area from which he had departed, a "street footballer" in search of fortune.

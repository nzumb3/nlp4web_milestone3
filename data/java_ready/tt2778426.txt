Hostival: The Festival Hostel
###BREAK###
Summer 2009. Hostival, The Festival Hostel undertook it's biggest summer tour since it's inception four years prior. Three major European festivals were attended, bringing with them, blood, sweat and tears. Our documentary crew was there to follow them every step of the way. The Running of the Bulls in Pamplona, Semana Grande in San Sebastian, and Oktoberfest in Munich. Sun, fun, beaches, travel, sangria, beer, girls, bikinis, and so much more. No one travels like Hostival travels.

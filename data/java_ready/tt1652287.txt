35 and Ticking
###BREAK###
Centers around the lives of Victoria, Zenobia , Clevon, and Phil -- all friends approaching the age of 35 and struggling to build the families they've always dreamed of. While Zenobia (Parker, "Soul Food," "Brown Sugar") is still looking for a man, Victoria (Jones, "Castle," "One on One") is married to a man who doesn't want children. Clevon (comic Hart, "Not Easily Broken," "40 Year-Old Virgin"), meanwhile, is too geeky to get a woman, and Phil (Keith Robinson, "Dreamgirls") is already married with children, but his wife is not very interested in being a mother. All four of them try to rectify their romantic lives and futures while their biological clocks tick away.

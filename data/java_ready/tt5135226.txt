DC Fashion Week: The Documentary
###BREAK###
"DC Fashion Week: The Documentary" goes beyond the runway by telling the story of everyone involved through interviews with participating models, designers and organizers. Directed by Ian Balina, Executive Producer and founder of Fusion Video, the film features exclusive interviews from Miss DC World 2015, Shannon Lynch, an aspiring model and actress walking in fashion week, and Executive Director, Ean Williams, the founder of DC Fashion Week. "Having spent over four years on the sidelines filming DC Fashion Week, nobody can appreciate more than I just how much effort goes into putting together a fashion week," said Balina. "Making this film was truly a labor of love for me as I initially started out as an audience member before being compelled to become involved as a videographer. I have met lots of amazing people from all walks of life trying to make it in the fashion industry, and I hope to share their story as inspiration for others that would like to follow their paths."

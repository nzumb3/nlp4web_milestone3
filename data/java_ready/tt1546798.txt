Crude Sacrifice takes a look at how one northern community, Fort Chipewyan is affected by the exploitation of Canada's rich Tar Sands development, and how Canada is dealing with their concerns. The health of the land and the people living near the world's largest construction project is discussed by leading scientists and the Aboriginal Peoples. Although this town is located near the earth's second largest fresh water delta, they can no longer drink the water, or eat the fish and other game food which sustained them for thousands of years. The film examines the state of our democracy.

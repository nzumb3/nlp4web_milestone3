Into Ardak's House: The Eagle Hunter
###BREAK###
Summer of 2015, living in Berlin, I had to leave my apartment of the Wedding neighborhood. The situation of finding an apartment in Berlin is not the easiest one and after having been rejected by many letting agents I just decided to: 'what a heck, I am going to Mongolia'. And took a camera with me to make my first documentary: A portrait of a Kazakh family in the mountains of western Mongolia subsisting from their herd as winter approaches. Their lifestyle makes us rethink what it means to live in a self-sufficient way, depending only on ourselves with just the barest of necessities. Theirs is a culture and tradition that makes us reconsider our own modern city lives. Having seen the results, i know I need to improve a lot but, it is a very nice beginning, of something big, beautiful.

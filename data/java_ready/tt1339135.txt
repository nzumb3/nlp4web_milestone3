A Northern Town
###BREAK###
Kempsey is a town haunted by the ghosts of it's past. As the white witnesses to this history have grown old, many have found themselves doing what they never could have imagined: moving in with black people. Yet, at Booroongen Djugun aged care facility, white people and Aboriginal people are living together... and they're talking. A Northern Town peels back more than 100 years of history as the residents of Booroongen - both black and white - relate tales that lay bare the truth of history and break the tragic divisions of the past.

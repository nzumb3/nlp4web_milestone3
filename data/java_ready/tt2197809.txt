Amor cr√≥nico
###BREAK###
The flamboyant Cuban-born / New York based singer CuCu Diamantes on her tour around Cuba. It is an independent Cuban/ U.S. project produced by Sarah Green ("The Tree of Life", "Frida") and Grammy award winner Andres Levin. The film interweaves footage of live music performances with a fictional love story narrative. An energetic display of Cucu Diamantes' glamorous performance style with a fresh Latin pop soundtrack and a comical twist, "Amor Cronico" is a unique portrait of a Cuban artist traveling back to her roots.

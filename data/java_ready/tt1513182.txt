Moonwatcher
###BREAK###
Moonwatcher is a feature documentary about the life of Dan Richter, a man of all seasons: a mime, artist, production manager, raconteur, and adventurer. As part of the intellectual artistic elite and counter-culture he collaborated with some of the most creative and influential minds of the day. But what started the Hippie movement as a celebration of love and peace lead Dan into the radical drug underground of the 70s. Intimate interviews uncover the self-destructive nature of addiction and his personal alienation, but Dan overcame the subversive undertow of his earlier soul seeking and chose the road of recovery and reconciliation.

The 1st Annual Carney Awards
###BREAK###
They are memorable, illustrious, noteworthy and unforgettable. Yet when award season rolls around every year, they are all but forgotten. You may not know their names, but you know their faces. They are character actors, and they are the mainstay and backbone of every film and television show. Named after one of the greatest character actors of all time, Art Carney has appeared in over a hundred films and television shows. He has received seven Emmy Awards, a Golden Globe and an Oscar for his performance in 'Harry and Tonto.' Yet he will be most remembered for his role as Ralph Kramden's goofy neighbor in the 'Honeymooners'... Ed Norton. The Hollywood community credited Jackie Gleason with the success of Art Carney, but Gleason quickly corrected everyone and said, "you got it all wrong pal, I didn't make Art Carney... he made me." The Best Supporting Actor/Actress category for all the other award shows was originally created to recognize this talented group of performers. However, as time went on, those roles went to leading men and women, pushing the character actor aside... until now.

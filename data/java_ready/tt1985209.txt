Tamar: Source to Sound
###BREAK###
A dawn to dusk journey down the river Tamar capturing the sights and sounds of summer along the Devon/Cornwall border. The film was originally made for the ICCI 360 festival, a panoramic film festival held in Plymouth in September 2010. It was made to be shown on five different HD screens in a special dome with surround sound. I didn't have any budget and shot the film over about 4 days on a DSLR. The score was composed especially although the composer had only seen a few rushes beforehand. I have now re-edited the film and made a single screen version.

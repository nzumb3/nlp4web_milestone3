Project Zemph
###BREAK###
A recovered missing child, Ze, works closely with a post-traumatic psychotherapist, Dr. Gabriel Liam, to discover the events which took place over the weekend in which Ze disappeared. While Ze claims to have wild memories of rituals, trickery, and the macabre, Liam is convinced that Ze's experience is an imaginatively embellished memory of a painful and frightful weekend with his estranged father and stepmother.

Angus Buchan's Ordinary People
###BREAK###
The backbone of the story is Angus Buchan - at the 2009 Mighty Men Conference - sharing his simple but rock solid faith with a few hundred thousand men. We experience his on-stage heart attack and the resulting personal insight he received from God regarding his own ministry. In the vast crowd we find three typical men - all in the process of being touched by the Holy Spirit through Angus's words. We find Andre Cloete - a twenty something man who became ensnared in alcohol abuse and a wasted life - due to his broken relationship with his 'strictly religious' and absent father. Then there is John Peters - a middle aged panel beater from Bethlehem who's business, family relationships and health have been spiraling down to the brink of collapse. Lastly we meet Lucky Nzimande - a young, black criminal who naively attempts to hi-jack the vehicle of two ex special-forces policemen en route to the Mighty Men Conference. The film tells the dramatic story of the three men's journeys and experiences leading up to the 2010 MMC. Their respective stories are cleverly interwoven with the anointed message and ministry of Angus Buchan.

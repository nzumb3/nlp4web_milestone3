Wildly popular TV talk show host Bobby Bishop has a nervous breakdown during an on-camera interview with a pop starlet, with whom he makes a rather crude observation and offer. This lapse of taste sets off a series of scandals in his off-camera life, which his beleaguered agent is helpless to stop. Desperate for love, Bobby rushes to New York City to find his former girlfriend, Lily, who doesn't even like his show, and neither does her cross-dressing boyfriend. Can true love straighten out the messes that are these folks' lives?

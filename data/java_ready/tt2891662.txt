Not Forgotten
###BREAK###
Nothing in Ukraine seems the same from day to day. As the cold winds blow, so do the rules. A child who is on the Autism Spectrum in Ukraine can find no place in society. Thus begins the story of NOT FORGOTTEN, a feature documentary that exposes the untold story of Autism in Ukraine. This timely documentary discusses and educates its audience about what can be done to aid and educate professionals and parents who suffer from cultural shame and rejection. Whether in Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa or the Americas, every child has definitive value. In Eastern Europe, and particularly Ukraine, the culture does not value children with disabilities, nor has a place for them in society.

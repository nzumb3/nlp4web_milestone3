I Do, Maybe?
###BREAK###
Brad and Monica are excited about their upcoming wedding, but every time they turn around something happens. If it's not the baby mama drama with Cindy, the in-laws and their opinions and feuds, the step child, the friends who can't mind their own business and think they are giving you the right advice or the unforeseen accidents, they probably wouldn't doubt their decision to marry. Can their love be strong enough to pull them through the dilemmas? When all the smoke clears and the truth is out, will there be a "happily" ever after?

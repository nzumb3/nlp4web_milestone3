Traditionally, romantic comedies work hard to create "meet cute" situations where the featured couple first come together. Here Maggie Cheung and Roy Cheung "meet cute" when he, as a triad gangster, keeps her, as an insurance sales agent, from completing a sale to a hapless fellow who may not last long enough to make his first monthly payment. Maggie, however, does not appreciate Roy's interference; to placate her, he offers to buy a policy. In short order he is attacked by rivals and ends up, somewhat implausibly, in Maggie's care. The script by Chau Ting (later a co-writer of The Storm Riders and three Young and Dangerous films) tosses logic out the window, but fans of Maggie will no doubt enjoy her performance. Veronice Yip has a small yet indelible role as a friend of Maggie, and Michael Wong has a brief cameo.

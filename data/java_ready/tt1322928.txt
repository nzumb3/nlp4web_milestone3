In Good Faith
###BREAK###
In Good Faith is a documentary chronicling the building of New England's largest mosque in Boston. Through the film, the make-up of the community is seen, and their relationship to the res of the city's community of faith. Highlighted in the project are the Muslim community's responses to questions and concerns about Islam and their society, the evolution of two major lawsuits that delayed the construction of the mosque, and the supporting work done with the supporting religious communities to foster dialogue and partnerships between the faiths. The film draws from exclusive one on one interviews with leaders of the Islamic Society of Boston, American Jewish Committee, Hebrew College, and the Archdiocese of Boston.

Comando e controllo
###BREAK###
'Comando e Controllo' is a documentary that tells of life under Emergency Control. The actions and the history of the Civil Protection are investigated starting with L'Aquila after the earthquake. With the strict control over the media, the information system and the citizens. With the constructions of only 4500 new apartments, which were not enough for the people and that are completely disconnected from the previous social structure. With wild, unregulated outsourcing. With a disaster capitalism that is based on the definition of 'Emergency control'. In Italy the definition of 'Emergency' has been extended to any normal, democratic activity. And any normal and democratic activity can be managed as a 'special situation'.

Beyond the Myth: A Film About Pit Bulls and Breed Discrimination
###BREAK###
Beyond the Myth is a film about dogs commonly referred to as "pit bulls" and those who love and defend these breeds. It explores the contributing factors behind the public's generalized fear of "pit bulls," and examines the conflict existing between advocates and opponents of breed discriminatory laws, as carried out in three cities that ban pit bull-type dogs: Denver, Miami, and Cincinnati-along with San Francisco, which requires the animals to be spayed and neutered.

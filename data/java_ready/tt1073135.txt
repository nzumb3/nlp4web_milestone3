Orange Revolution
###BREAK###
Orange Revolution chronicles Ukraine's 2004 presidential campaign, from one candidate's poisoning to the intimidation of voters, acid-bombing of ballot boxes, and the political pressure put on election officials to count votes a certain way. The government's contempt for the people's choice brings nearly a million citizens into the streets of Kyiv for a 17-day around-the-clock protest. With music, interviews, and rare footage of the demonstrations, this film captures the spirit and determination of the most successful political protest of the decade, and raises a timely question: Just how far would you go to protect your vote?

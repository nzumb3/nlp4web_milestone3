The Avenue
###BREAK###
As cities across Canada and the United States are faced with the urban flight epidemic, city cores have become a place somewhat of a wasteland. Neglected buildings, decreased populations, and increased crime, lay in the wake of urban sprawl and the lure of the suburbs. No longer willing to sit back and watch their neighborhood fall further into disrepair, residents living in Edmonton's inner city created grassroots initiatives as a way of taking back their neighborhoods. The film follows their process over the course of one year revealing their community spirit and the power people have when they come together for change. But can they revitalize their neighborhood without falling into the pitfalls of gentrification?

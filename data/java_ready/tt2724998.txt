The Bigger Picture
###BREAK###
A director's often questionable way of making a film he wants to see, even if it's not the film he brought people on set to make, results in a mind-bending roller-coaster that tugs at every emotional string in your body. The Bigger Picture is composed entirely of raw behind the scenes footage making you question your perception on the borders between fiction and reality.

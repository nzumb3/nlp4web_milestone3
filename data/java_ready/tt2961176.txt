Seeds of Hope
###BREAK###
This documentary film is about a Buddhist monk from Taiwan who set up orphanages in Africa to rear and educate the orphans whom left by their parents died from poverty, war, and diseases(HIV-AIDS or related illness). I documented the daily living of the orphan children and interviewed people who are involved with the project. I spent three and half months, visited 3 orphanages located in 3 African countries in Malawi, Lesotho, and Swaziland.

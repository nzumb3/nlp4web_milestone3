Letters from Parliament Square
###BREAK###
On 2 June 2001, Brian Haw, English protester and peace campaigner, began the Parliament Square Peace Campaign before the 2001 US attacks and became a symbol of the anti-war movement over the policies of both the United Kingdom and the United States in Afghanistan and Iraq. Activists lived for almost thirteen years 24/7 in the peace camp. The film is a conversation with activist Barbara Tucker who lived there seven years.

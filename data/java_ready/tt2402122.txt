In the Wake of Love
###BREAK###
"In the Wake of Love" is a very personal and in depth documentary feature on the profound effects Alzheimer's diseases has on the family and on the self. The film follows the daily life of Jean Higgins, a widow in her late seventies, who now lives with her son's family as she struggles with the advancement of the disease. This is not your typical documentary on Alzheimer's disease. "In the Wake of Love" is a special movie which ditches many conventional documentary conventions, such as narration and titles, in favor of a more impressionist journey through emotional existence. "In the Wake of Love" will make you laugh and make you cry, but more importantly it will imbue you with a sense of wonder and purpose, and inspire your very perceptions on love and existence.

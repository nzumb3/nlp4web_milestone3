Miles Berret is ripped awake in his prison cell. Guards rush past Miles cell in the dark as he hears gunfire, screaming and then... the horrible, sickening screams of a man being torn apart. Something is loose in the prison, and it's killing everyone, one by one. Working with Anthony, the inmate who shares a common cell wall, Miles discovers that the thing outside the cell is connected to him - and it's coming. If he wants to survive the night, he must find a way out. But how...?

Apartment 13
###BREAK###
Pixel is a young woman who lands the job of a lifetime. By entertaining people through the eyes of several cameras installed within her apartment. In the process she gets to live there for free. Only catch is the cameras are streaming video through the Internet all day. Although there are designated 'safe zones' in the apartment where no one can see her, most of the apartment is viewable by anyone subscribed to the website. Tack is the I.T. guy who keeps a close eye of the business and its subscribers. Francesca is the young entrepreneur and the owner of the website using money from sources she should have never borrowed from. With all the elements in place Apartment 13 will boil down to a life and death struggle with a beautiful young woman trapped within its walls. Every corner could be a trap, every camera could be weapon, everyone and anyone could be the enemy.

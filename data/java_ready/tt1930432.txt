After the First Fall, Metadox stands alone against the chaos and violence of the Dark Times, but they hide a silent secret: The true source of their power is the Shard Sensitive Lorem, whose consciousness is imprisoned within a resonator called the Automa Construct. Set in the same world as Archon Defender, this film follows the quest of a young woman, Desmerelle, as she confronts Lorem to free her twin sister Phaetra from the machine.

Dear Betrayed Friends
###BREAK###
Andor Czettl in his early sixties, visits the declassified Communist archives one day to read the reports filed about him. He realizes the shocking fact that his very best friend János Pásztor was an informer and was writing reports on him for decades. Writer-director Sára Cserhalmi's first feature focuses rather on the contradictory relationship of the two protagonists then the bare act of the problem, and in the meantime reflecting to those chapters of Hungary's recent past that are still unclear. How can an informer live with himself? How can the one who was reported on cope with the current state? Dear Betrayed Friends confronts the audience with this overly sensitive subject that has never been told before in Hungary.

Willa Mae, the Church Lady Vampire Slayer
###BREAK###
Fueled by the dynamic talents of a sexy cast of Hollywood newcomers and described as Soul Train meets Ann Rice, this horror tale in the tradition of the popular TV series, Buffy The Vampire Slayer, is a throwback to the blaxploitation horror films of the seventies. Willa Mae is a no-nonsense African-American grandmother and church lady. She is not only trying to pull her broken family together, but finds herself defending family and friends against a vampire invasion in her town.

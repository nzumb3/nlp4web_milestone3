La Experiencia Barriga
###BREAK###
Miguel Barriga is the frontman of Sexual Democracia, a Chilean band with 12 released albums that was a pioneer in the fusion of pop rock with pachanga, tropical, folklore and comedy. Throughout 2006, a group of inexperienced filmmakers (two Chileans, a Peruvian and an American) follows Barriga in order to know all that universe the musician and showman built after half a century of an artistic career, where irreverence and irony were standards in its form of creation.

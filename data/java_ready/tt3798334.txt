Everything Has Value
###BREAK###
This short film documents the experiences of artists who are homeless and their efforts to build a cooperative to support and sell their work. They are aided in this effort by a class in the UNCG Bryan School of Business (Social Entrepreneurship) in developing business plans and in marketing and selling their work along with two retired businessmen who have established an Empowerment Fund for seed monies. Not only is there a financial incentive to create art but through interviews we learn of the therapeutic side of the creation process and the community that has grown organically from the venture.

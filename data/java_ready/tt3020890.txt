The Befuddled Box of Betty Buttifint
###BREAK###
'The Befuddled Box of Betty Buttifint' is a touching examination of a fractured memory. Janis Pugh's experimental film, made in collaboration with the Central School of Speech and Drama, portrays an elderly woman living within her own confused mind. Using the vivid landscape of her memories, Pugh's film blurs the line between reality and fantasy, and between real memories and symbols of Betty's past. Featuring a lead performance from Illona Linthwaite as a woman struggling to make sense of her life, it is a moving, poetic take on the life, loves and losses of a person whose world is fading away.

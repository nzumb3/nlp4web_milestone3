Rumors have it that the spirits of these deceased Indians still roam The Pinelands chasing out anyone that comes into their territory. Deep in the heart of The Pinelands lies a dark past. Sarah Cooper discovers that dark past when her and her husband get lost during a trip to visit family. The terror escalates when a child appears in the woods following Sarah.

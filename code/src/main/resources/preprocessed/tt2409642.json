But the boy finds out that he has to do something more than the rest of the members of the group are required- he has to satisfy the landlord sensually as well. The wife of the landlord cannot stand this new 'rival' of hers and conspires to kill the boy.","genres":["Drama"," Musical"],"stems":["A","teenag","boy","is","hire","along","with","the","music","group","of","his","father","by","a","Zamidar","(","landlord",")","for","entertain","him","until","the","annual","flood","is","over","in","the","Haor","region","of","East","Bengal",".","But","the","boy","find","out","that","he","has","to","do","someth","more","than","the","rest","of","the","member","of","the","group","are","requir","-","he","has","to","satisfi","the","landlord","sensual","as","well",".","The","wife","of","the","landlord","can","not","stand","this","new","'","rival","'","of","her","and","conspir","to","kill","the","boy","."],"lemmas":["a","teenage","boy","be","hire","along","with","the","music","group","of","he","father","by","a","zamidar","-lrb-","landlord","-rrb-","for","entertain","he","until","the","annual","flood","be","over","in","the","Haor","region","of","East","Bengal",".","but","the","boy","find","out","that","he","have","to","do","something","more","than","the","rest","of","the","member","of","the","group","be","require","-","he","have","to","satisfy","the","landlord","sensually","as","well",".","the","wife","of","the","landlord","can","not","stand","this","new","'","rival","'","of","hers","and","conspire","to","kill","the","boy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A teenage boy","teenage boy is","boy is hired","is hired along","hired along with","along with the","with the music","the music group","music group of","group of his","of his father","his father by","father by a","by a Zamidar","a Zamidar (","Zamidar ( landlord","( landlord )","landlord ) for",") for entertaining","for entertaining him","entertaining him until","him until the","until the annual","the annual flood","annual flood is","flood is over","is over in","over in the","in the Haor","the Haor region","Haor region of","region of East","of East Bengal","But the boy","the boy finds","boy finds out","finds out that","out that he","that he has","he has to","has to do","to do something","do something more","something more than","more than the","than the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the members","the members of","members of the","of the group","the group are","group are required","are required -","required - he","- he has","he has to","has to satisfy","to satisfy the","satisfy the landlord","the landlord sensually","landlord sensually as","sensually as well","The wife of","wife of the","of the landlord","the landlord can","landlord can not","can not stand","not stand this","stand this new","this new '","new ' rival","' rival '","rival ' of","' of hers","of hers and","hers and conspires","and conspires to","conspires to kill","to kill the","kill the boy"],"2grams":["A teenage","teenage boy","boy is","is hired","hired along","along with","with the","the music","music group","group of","of his","his father","father by","by a","a Zamidar","Zamidar (","( landlord","landlord )",") for","for entertaining","entertaining him","him until","until the","the annual","annual flood","flood is","is over","over in","in the","the Haor","Haor region","region of","of East","East Bengal","But the","the boy","boy finds","finds out","out that","that he","he has","has to","to do","do something","something more","more than","than the","the rest","rest of","of the","the members","members of","of the","the group","group are","are required","required -","- he","he has","has to","to satisfy","satisfy the","the landlord","landlord sensually","sensually as","as well","The wife","wife of","of the","the landlord","landlord can","can not","not stand","stand this","this new","new '","' rival","rival '","' of","of hers","hers and","and conspires","conspires to","to kill","kill the","the boy"]}

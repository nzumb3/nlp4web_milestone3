{"title":"Two Hundred Thousand Dirty","plot":"Welcome to the monotonous, oppressive modern American byproduct of suburban sprawl: the urban strip-mall. Native to this environment and products of outdated pop culture are Rob (Mark Greenfield) and Manny (Coolio), the unsuccessful, unrefined and uncouth sales force behind Affordable Mattress. When new employee Isabelle (Rocío Verdejo) is hired in hopes of improving dismal sales, some things do change and after recruiting fellow strip-mall burnout Martin (C. Clayton Blackwell), she's got everyone working together to split a common goal - 200,000 dollars.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Welcom","to","the","monoton",",","oppress","modern","American","byproduct","of","suburban","sprawl",":","the","urban","strip-mal",".","Nativ","to","this","environ","and","product","of","outdat","pop","cultur","are","Rob","(","Mark","Greenfield",")","and","Manni","(","Coolio",")",",","the","unsuccess",",","unrefin","and","uncouth","sale","forc","behind","Affordabl","Mattress",".","When","new","employe","Isabell","(","Rocío","Verdejo",")","is","hire","in","hope","of","improv","dismal","sale",",","some","thing","do","chang","and","after","recruit","fellow","strip-mal","burnout","Martin","(","C.","Clayton","Blackwel",")",",","she","'s","got","everyon","work","togeth","to","split","a","common","goal","-","200,000","dollar","."],"lemmas":["welcome","to","the","monotonous",",","oppressive","modern","american","byproduct","of","suburban","sprawl",":","the","urban","strip-mall",".","native","to","this","environment","and","product","of","outdated","pop","culture","be","Rob","-lrb-","Mark","Greenfield","-rrb-","and","Manny","-lrb-","Coolio","-rrb-",",","the","unsuccessful",",","unrefined","and","uncouth","sale","force","behind","Affordable","Mattress",".","when","new","employee","Isabelle","-lrb-","Rocío","Verdejo","-rrb-","be","hire","in","hope","of","improve","dismal","sale",",","some","thing","do","change","and","after","recruit","fellow","strip-mall","burnout","Martin","-lrb-","C.","Clayton","Blackwell","-rrb-",",","she","be","get","everyone","work","together","to","split","a","common","goal","-","200,000","dollar","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Welcome to the","to the monotonous","the monotonous ,","monotonous , oppressive",", oppressive modern","oppressive modern American","modern American byproduct","American byproduct of","byproduct of suburban","of suburban sprawl","suburban sprawl :","sprawl : the",": the urban","the urban strip-mall","Native to this","to this environment","this environment and","environment and products","and products of","products of outdated","of outdated pop","outdated pop culture","pop culture are","culture are Rob","are Rob (","Rob ( Mark","( Mark Greenfield","Mark Greenfield )","Greenfield ) and",") and Manny","and Manny (","Manny ( Coolio","( Coolio )","Coolio ) ,",") , the",", the unsuccessful","the unsuccessful ,","unsuccessful , unrefined",", unrefined and","unrefined and uncouth","and uncouth sales","uncouth sales force","sales force behind","force behind Affordable","behind Affordable Mattress","When new employee","new employee Isabelle","employee Isabelle (","Isabelle ( Rocío","( Rocío Verdejo","Rocío Verdejo )","Verdejo ) is",") is hired","is hired in","hired in hopes","in hopes of","hopes of improving","of improving dismal","improving dismal sales","dismal sales ,","sales , some",", some things","some things do","things do change","do change and","change and after","and after recruiting","after recruiting fellow","recruiting fellow strip-mall","fellow strip-mall burnout","strip-mall burnout Martin","burnout Martin (","Martin ( C.","( C.

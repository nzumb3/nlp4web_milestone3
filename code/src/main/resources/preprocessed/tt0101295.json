{"title":"Alice in Wondertown","plot":"A satire about the life of the Cuban people. Alicia, a culture instructor, is sent to a small town \"Maravillas\", which is itself an exaggerated, but very ingenious reflection of the real Cuba. The adventures that she has there are almost as crazy and senseless as the ones lived by the other Alice (in Wonderland), reflecting the indoctrination, coercion, absolutims, and many other everyday problems in Cuban society.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","satir","about","the","life","of","the","Cuban","peopl",".","Alicia",",","a","cultur","instructor",",","is","sent","to","a","small","town","\"","Maravilla","\"",",","which","is","itself","an","exagger",",","but","veri","ingeni","reflect","of","the","real","Cuba",".","The","adventur","that","she","has","there","are","almost","as","crazi","and","senseless","as","the","one","live","by","the","other","Alice","(","in","Wonderland",")",",","reflect","the","indoctrin",",","coercion",",","absolutim",",","and","mani","other","everyday","problem","in","Cuban","societi","."],"lemmas":["a","satire","about","the","life","of","the","cuban","people",".","Alicia",",","a","culture","instructor",",","be","send","to","a","small","town","``","Maravillas","''",",","which","be","itself","a","exaggerated",",","but","very","ingenious","reflection","of","the","real","Cuba",".","the","adventure","that","she","have","there","be","almost","as","crazy","and","senseless","as","the","one","live","by","the","other","Alice","-lrb-","in","Wonderland","-rrb-",",","reflect","the","indoctrination",",","coercion",",","absolutim",",","and","many","other","everyday","problem","in","cuban","society","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A satire about","satire about the","about the life","the life of","life of the","of the Cuban","the Cuban people","Alicia , a",", a culture","a culture instructor","culture instructor ,","instructor , is",", is sent","is sent to","sent to a","to a small","a small town","small town \"","town \" Maravillas","\" Maravillas \"","Maravillas \" ,","\" , which",", which is","which is itself","is itself an","itself an exaggerated","an exaggerated ,","exaggerated , but",", but very","but very ingenious","very ingenious reflection","ingenious reflection of","reflection of the","of the real","the real Cuba","The adventures that","adventures that she","that she has","she has there","has there are","there are almost","are almost as","almost as crazy","as crazy and","crazy and senseless","and senseless as","senseless as the","as the ones","the ones lived","ones lived by","lived by the","by the other","the other Alice","other Alice (","Alice ( in","( in Wonderland","in Wonderland )","Wonderland ) ,",") , reflecting",", reflecting the","reflecting the indoctrination","the indoctrination ,","indoctrination , coercion",", coercion ,","coercion , absolutims",", absolutims ,","absolutims , and",", and many","and many other","many other everyday","other everyday problems","everyday problems in","problems in Cuban","in Cuban society"],"2grams":["A satire","satire about","about the","the life","life of","of the","the Cuban","Cuban people","Alicia ,",", a","a culture","culture instructor","instructor ,",", is","is sent","sent to","to a","a small","small town","town \"","\" Maravillas","Maravillas \"","\" ,",", which","which is","is itself","itself an","an exaggerated","exaggerated ,",", but","but very","very ingenious","ingenious reflection","reflection of","of the","the real","real Cuba","The adventures","adventures that","that she","she has","has there","there are","are almost","almost as","as crazy","crazy and","and senseless","senseless as","as the","the ones","ones lived","lived by","by the","the other","other Alice","Alice (","( in","in Wonderland","Wonderland )",") ,",", reflecting","reflecting the","the indoctrination","indoctrination ,",", coercion","coercion ,",", absolutims","absolutims ,",", and","and many","many other","other everyday","everyday problems","problems in","in Cuban","Cuban society"]}

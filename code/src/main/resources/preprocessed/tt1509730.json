{"title":"30 Days in the Bowl","plot":"Set in the city of the 'new' New Orleans, producer Michael Agresta and his crew of three young filmmakers set out over a period of thirty days in the summer of 2009 to capture a fresh perspective on the renewal of hope and vitality in a city that calls the arts and entertainment its thriving pulse. A glimpse into the heart of creative flair and laissez-faire that gives New Orleans (Katrina who?) a character all its own.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["Set","in","the","citi","of","the","'","new","'","New","Orlean",",","produc","Michael","Agresta","and","his","crew","of","three","young","filmmak","set","out","over","a","period","of","thirti","day","in","the","summer","of","2009","to","captur","a","fresh","perspect","on","the","renew","of","hope","and","vital","in","a","citi","that","call","the","art","and","entertain","it","thrive","puls",".","A","glimps","into","the","heart","of","creativ","flair","and","laissez-fair","that","give","New","Orlean","(","Katrina","who","?",")","a","charact","all","it","own","."],"lemmas":["set","in","the","city","of","the","'","new","'","New","Orleans",",","producer","Michael","Agresta","and","he","crew","of","three","young","filmmaker","set","out","over","a","period","of","thirty","day","in","the","summer","of","2009","to","capture","a","fresh","perspective","on","the","renewal","of","hope","and","vitality","in","a","city","that","call","the","art","and","entertainment","its","thriving","pulse",".","a","glimpse","into","the","heart","of","creative","flair","and","laissez-faire","that","give","New","Orleans","-lrb-","Katrina","who","?","-rrb-","a","character","all","its","own","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Set in the","in the city","the city of","city of the","of the '","the ' new","' new '","new ' New","' New Orleans","New Orleans ,","Orleans , producer",", producer Michael","producer Michael Agresta","Michael Agresta and","Agresta and his","and his crew","his crew of","crew of three","of three young","three young filmmakers","young filmmakers set","filmmakers set out","set out over","out over a","over a period","a period of","period of thirty","of thirty days","thirty days in","days in the","in the summer","the summer of","summer of 2009","of 2009 to","2009 to capture","to capture a","capture a fresh","a fresh perspective","fresh perspective on","perspective on the","on the renewal","the renewal of","renewal of hope","of hope and","hope and vitality","and vitality in","vitality in a","in a city","a city that","city that calls","that calls the","calls the arts","the arts and","arts and entertainment","and entertainment its","entertainment its thriving","its thriving pulse","A glimpse into","glimpse into the","into the heart","the heart of","heart of creative","of creative flair","creative flair and","flair and laissez-faire","and laissez-faire that","laissez-faire that gives","that gives New","gives New Orleans","New Orleans (","Orleans ( Katrina","( Katrina who","Katrina who ?","who ? )","a character all","character all its","all its own"],"2grams":["Set in","in the","the city","city of","of the","the '","' new","new '","' New","New Orleans","Orleans ,",", producer","producer Michael","Michael Agresta","Agresta and","and his","his crew","crew of","of three","three young","young filmmakers","filmmakers set","set out","out over","over a","a period","period of","of thirty","thirty days","days in","in the","the summer","summer of","of 2009","2009 to","to capture","capture a","a fresh","fresh perspective","perspective on","on the","the renewal","renewal of","of hope","hope and","and vitality","vitality in","in a","a city","city that","that calls","calls the","the arts","arts and","and entertainment","entertainment its","its thriving","thriving pulse","A glimpse","glimpse into","into the","the heart","heart of","of creative","creative flair","flair and","and laissez-faire","laissez-faire that","that gives","gives New","New Orleans","Orleans (","( Katrina","Katrina who","who ?","? )","a character","character all","all its","its own"]}

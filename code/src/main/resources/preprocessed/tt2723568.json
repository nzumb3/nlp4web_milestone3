{"title":"Ilai","plot":"Ilai follows the story of a little Girl lost in a bustling metropolis. She doesn't speak the city's language and wanders about its hostile streets to find a way to her home. Lost and forlorn, she instinctively lures a kind baker, three young rag-picking boys and a feisty old woman into her search. Ilai encapsulates the lives of these reclusive characters as they zealously bond and set off unwittingly on a circular journey.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ilai","follow","the","stori","of","a","littl","Girl","lost","in","a","bustl","metropoli",".","She","doe","n't","speak","the","citi","'s","languag","and","wander","about","it","hostil","street","to","find","a","way","to","her","home",".","Lost","and","forlorn",",","she","instinct","lure","a","kind","baker",",","three","young","rag-pick","boy","and","a","feisti","old","woman","into","her","search",".","Ilai","encapsul","the","live","of","these","reclus","charact","as","they","zealous","bond","and","set","off","unwit","on","a","circular","journey","."],"lemmas":["Ilai","follow","the","story","of","a","little","Girl","lose","in","a","bustling","metropolis",".","she","do","not","speak","the","city","'s","language","and","wander","about","its","hostile","street","to","find","a","way","to","she","home",".","Lost","and","forlorn",",","she","instinctively","lure","a","kind","baker",",","three","young","rag-picking","boy","and","a","feisty","old","woman","into","she","search",".","Ilai","encapsulate","the","life","of","these","reclusive","character","as","they","zealously","bond","and","set","off","unwittingly","on","a","circular","journey","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Ilai follows the","follows the story","the story of","story of a","of a little","a little Girl","little Girl lost","Girl lost in","lost in a","in a bustling","a bustling metropolis","She does n't","does n't speak","n't speak the","speak the city","the city 's","city 's language","'s language and","language and wanders","and wanders about","wanders about its","about its hostile","its hostile streets","hostile streets to","streets to find","to find a","find a way","a way to","way to her","to her home","Lost and forlorn","and forlorn ,","forlorn , she",", she instinctively","she instinctively lures","instinctively lures a","lures a kind","a kind baker","kind baker ,","baker , three",", three young","three young rag-picking","young rag-picking boys","rag-picking boys and","boys and a","and a feisty","a feisty old","feisty old woman","old woman into","woman into her","into her search","Ilai encapsulates the","encapsulates the lives","the lives of","lives of these","of these reclusive","these reclusive characters","reclusive characters as","characters as they","as they zealously","they zealously bond","zealously bond and","bond and set","and set off","set off unwittingly","off unwittingly on","unwittingly on a","on a circular","a circular journey"],"2grams":["Ilai follows","follows the","the story","story of","of a","a little","little Girl","Girl lost","lost in","in a","a bustling","bustling metropolis","She does","does n't","n't speak","speak the","the city","city 's","'s language","language and","and wanders","wanders about","about its","its hostile","hostile streets","streets to","to find","find a","a way","way to","to her","her home","Lost and","and forlorn","forlorn ,",", she","she instinctively","instinctively lures","lures a","a kind","kind baker","baker ,",", three","three young","young rag-picking","rag-picking boys","boys and","and a","a feisty","feisty old","old woman","woman into","into her","her search","Ilai encapsulates","encapsulates the","the lives","lives of","of these","these reclusive","reclusive characters","characters as","as they","they zealously","zealously bond","bond and","and set","set off","off unwittingly","unwittingly on","on a","a circular","circular journey"]}

{"title":"Home Court","plot":"In this exploration of the power of sports, foreigners from 5 continents find an unlikely family in New York City through an Olympic sport that few people in America know about: team handball. The squad seeks to defend its national title and cement its reputation as the 'world's handball club,' a group of friends that speak a common language on and off the court. Although most are European, members also come from Senegal, China, Colombia, Japan, Egypt and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, the only homegrown American strives to make Team USA and represent his country.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"," Family"],"stems":["In","this","explor","of","the","power","of","sport",",","foreign","from","5","contin","find","an","unlik","famili","in","New","York","Citi","through","an","Olympic","sport","that","few","peopl","in","America","know","about",":","team","handbal",".","The","squad","seek","to","defend","it","nation","titl","and","cement","it","reput","as","the","'","world","'s","handbal","club",",","'","a","group","of","friend","that","speak","a","common","languag","on","and","off","the","court",".","Although","most","are","European",",","member","also","come","from","Seneg",",","China",",","Colombia",",","Japan",",","Egypt","and","the","Dominican","Republ",".","Meanwhil",",","the","onli","homegrown","American","strive","to","make","Team","USA","and","repres","his","countri","."],"lemmas":["in","this","exploration","of","the","power","of","sport",",","foreigner","from","5","continent","find","a","unlikely","family","in","New","York","City","through","a","Olympic","sport","that","few","people","in","America","know","about",":","team","handball",".","the","squad","seek","to","defend","its","national","title","and","cement","its","reputation","as","the","'","world","'s","handball","club",",","'","a","group","of","friend","that","speak","a","common","language","on","and","off","the","court",".","although","most","be","european",",","member","also","come","from","Senegal",",","China",",","Colombia",",","Japan",",","Egypt","and","the","Dominican","Republic",".","meanwhile",",","the","only","homegrown","American","strive","to","make","Team","USA","and","represent","he","country","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In this exploration","this exploration of","exploration of the","of the power","the power of","power of sports","of sports ,","sports , foreigners",", foreigners from","foreigners from 5","from 5 continents","5 continents find","continents find an","find an unlikely","an unlikely family","unlikely family in","family in New","in New York","New York City","York City through","City through an","through an Olympic","an Olympic sport","Olympic sport that","sport that few","that few people","few people in","people in America","in America know","America know about","know about :","about : team",": team handball","The squad seeks","squad seeks to","seeks to defend","to defend its","defend its national","its national title","national title and","title and cement","and cement its","cement its reputation","its reputation as","reputation as the","as the '","the ' world","' world 's","world 's handball","'s handball club","handball club ,","club , '",", ' a","' a group","a group of","group of friends","of friends that","friends that speak","that speak a","speak a common","a common language","common language on","language on and","on and off","and off the","off the court","Although most are","most are European","are European ,","European , members",", members also","members also come","also come from","come from Senegal","from Senegal ,","Senegal , China",", China ,","China , Colombia",", Colombia ,","Colombia , Japan",", Japan ,","Japan , Egypt",", Egypt and","Egypt and the","and the Dominican","the Dominican Republic","Meanwhile , the",", the only","the only homegrown","only homegrown American","homegrown American strives","American strives to","strives to make","to make Team","make Team USA","Team USA and","USA and represent","and represent his","represent his country"],"2grams":["In this","this exploration","exploration of","of the","the power","power of","of sports","sports ,",", foreigners","foreigners from","from 5","5 continents","continents find","find an","an unlikely","unlikely family","family in","in New","New York","York City","City through","through an","an Olympic","Olympic sport","sport that","that few","few people","people in","in America","America know","know about","about :",": team","team handball","The squad","squad seeks","seeks to","to defend","defend its","its national","national title","title and","and cement","cement its","its reputation","reputation as","as the","the '","' world","world 's","'s handball","handball club","club ,",", '","' a","a group","group of","of friends","friends that","that speak","speak a","a common","common language","language on","on and","and off","off the","the court","Although most","most are","are European","European ,",", members","members also","also come","come from","from Senegal","Senegal ,",", China","China ,",", Colombia","Colombia ,",", Japan","Japan ,",", Egypt","Egypt and","and the","the Dominican","Dominican Republic","Meanwhile ,",", the","the only","only homegrown","homegrown American","American strives","strives to","to make","make Team","Team USA","USA and","and represent","represent his","his country"]}

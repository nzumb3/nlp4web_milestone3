{"title":"Max's Dreaming","plot":"A hospitalized amnesiac boy, victim of an abduction gone wrong, brings police detective Mark Bryce (Friels) and nurse Rose (Picot) together. Both have 'baggage' -- she a recently widowed and somewhat demented father, George (Myles), living at home; Mark a divorce with only part-time access to his two children, plus a demanding and increasingly frustrating job. Over the next 24 hours the lives of this pair intersect as they each try to coax some memories from the boy (named 'Max' by Mark), while George struggles with his failing mental capacity and visions of his late wife and her dead first husband.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["A","hospit","amnesiac","boy",",","victim","of","an","abduct","gone","wrong",",","bring","polic","detect","Mark","Bryce","(","Friel",")","and","nurs","Rose","(","Picot",")","togeth",".","Both","have","'","baggag","'","--","she","a","recent","widow","and","somewhat","dement","father",",","Georg","(","Myle",")",",","live","at","home",";","Mark","a","divorc","with","onli","part-tim","access","to","his","two","children",",","plus","a","demand","and","increas","frustrat","job",".","Over","the","next","24","hour","the","live","of","this","pair","intersect","as","they","each","tri","to","coax","some","memori","from","the","boy","(","name","'","Max","'","by","Mark",")",",","while","Georg","struggl","with","his","fail","mental","capac","and","vision","of","his","late","wife","and","her","dead","first","husband","."],"lemmas":["a","hospitalize","amnesiac","boy",",","victim","of","a","abduction","go","wrong",",","bring","police","detective","Mark","Bryce","-lrb-","Friels","-rrb-","and","nurse","Rose","-lrb-","Picot","-rrb-","together",".","both","have","'","baggage","'","--","she","a","recently","widow","and","somewhat","demented","father",",","George","-lrb-","Myles","-rrb-",",","live","at","home",";","Mark","a","divorce","with","only","part-time","access","to","he","two","child",",","plus","a","demand","and","increasingly","frustrating","job",".","over","the","next","24","hour","the","life","of","this","pair","intersect","as","they","each","try","to","coax","some","memory","from","the","boy","-lrb-","name","'","max","'","by","Mark","-rrb-",",","while","George","struggle","with","he","fail","mental","capacity","and","vision","of","he","late","wife","and","she","dead","first","husband","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A hospitalized amnesiac","hospitalized amnesiac boy","amnesiac boy ,","boy , victim",", victim of","victim of an","of an abduction","an abduction gone","abduction gone wrong","gone wrong ,","wrong , brings",", brings police","brings police detective","police detective Mark","detective Mark Bryce","Mark Bryce (","Bryce ( Friels","( Friels )","Friels ) and",") and nurse","and nurse Rose","nurse Rose (","Rose ( Picot","( Picot )","Picot ) together","Both have '","have ' baggage","' baggage '","baggage ' --","' -- she","-- she a","she a recently","a recently widowed","recently widowed and","widowed and somewhat","and somewhat demented","somewhat demented father","demented father ,","father , George",", George (","George ( Myles","( Myles )","Myles ) ,",") , living",", living at","living at home","at home ;","home ;

{"title":"Must Come Down","plot":"Ashley is in his late-twenties, Holly is in her early-twenties. They're both very much lost in their individual quarter-life crises. Ashley quit his job to travel in search of clarity. He ventures to his childhood home with plans of breaking-and-entering for the nostalgic rush. Along the way he meets Holly, who, after a short-lived relationship with her restaurant manager, also finds herself jobless and aimless. The film chronicles Holly and Ashley's brief, odd, hysterical commiseration as grown-up children stumbling through life's final bout of growing pains.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Ashley","is","in","his","late-twenti",",","Holli","is","in","her","early-twenti",".","They","re","both","veri","much","lost","in","their","individu","quarter-lif","crise",".","Ashley","quit","his","job","to","travel","in","search","of","clariti",".","He","ventur","to","his","childhood","home","with","plan","of","breaking-and-ent","for","the","nostalg","rush",".","Along","the","way","he","meet","Holli",",","who",",","after","a","short-liv","relationship","with","her","restaur","manag",",","also","find","herself","jobless","and","aimless",".","The","film","chronicl","Holli","and","Ashley","'s","brief",",","odd",",","hyster","commiser","as","grown-up","children","stumbl","through","life","'s","final","bout","of","grow","pain","."],"lemmas":["Ashley","be","in","he","late-twenty",",","Holly","be","in","she","early-twenty",".","they","be","both","very","much","lose","in","they","individual","quarter-life","crisis",".","Ashley","quit","he","job","to","travel","in","search","of","clarity",".","he","venture","to","he","childhood","home","with","plan","of","breaking-and-entering","for","the","nostalgic","rush",".","along","the","way","he","meet","Holly",",","who",",","after","a","short-lived","relationship","with","she","restaurant","manager",",","also","find","herself","jobless","and","aimless",".","the","film","chronicle","Holly","and","Ashley","'s","brief",",","odd",",","hysterical","commiseration","as","grown-up","child","stumble","through","life","'s","final","bout","of","grow","pain","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ashley is in","is in his","in his late-twenties","his late-twenties ,","late-twenties , Holly",", Holly is","Holly is in","is in her","in her early-twenties","They 're both","'re both very","both very much","very much lost","much lost in","lost in their","in their individual","their individual quarter-life","individual quarter-life crises","Ashley quit his","quit his job","his job to","job to travel","to travel in","travel in search","in search of","search of clarity","He ventures to","ventures to his","to his childhood","his childhood home","childhood home with","home with plans","with plans of","plans of breaking-and-entering","of breaking-and-entering for","breaking-and-entering for the","for the nostalgic","the nostalgic rush","Along the way","the way he","way he meets","he meets Holly","meets Holly ,","Holly , who",", who ,","who , after",", after a","after a short-lived","a short-lived relationship","short-lived relationship with","relationship with her","with her restaurant","her restaurant manager","restaurant manager ,","manager , also",", also finds","also finds herself","finds herself jobless","herself jobless and","jobless and aimless","The film chronicles","film chronicles Holly","chronicles Holly and","Holly and Ashley","and Ashley 's","Ashley 's brief","'s brief ,","brief , odd",", odd ,","odd , hysterical",", hysterical commiseration","hysterical commiseration as","commiseration as grown-up","as grown-up children","grown-up children stumbling","children stumbling through","stumbling through life","through life 's","life 's final","'s final bout","final bout of","bout of growing","of growing pains"],"2grams":["Ashley is","is in","in his","his late-twenties","late-twenties ,",", Holly","Holly is","is in","in her","her early-twenties","They 're","'re both","both very","very much","much lost","lost in","in their","their individual","individual quarter-life","quarter-life crises","Ashley quit","quit his","his job","job to","to travel","travel in","in search","search of","of clarity","He ventures","ventures to","to his","his childhood","childhood home","home with","with plans","plans of","of breaking-and-entering","breaking-and-entering for","for the","the nostalgic","nostalgic rush","Along the","the way","way he","he meets","meets Holly","Holly ,",", who","who ,",", after","after a","a short-lived","short-lived relationship","relationship with","with her","her restaurant","restaurant manager","manager ,",", also","also finds","finds herself","herself jobless","jobless and","and aimless","The film","film chronicles","chronicles Holly","Holly and","and Ashley","Ashley 's","'s brief","brief ,",", odd","odd ,",", hysterical","hysterical commiseration","commiseration as","as grown-up","grown-up children","children stumbling","stumbling through","through life","life 's","'s final","final bout","bout of","of growing","growing pains"]}

{"title":"The Music of Erica Zann","plot":"William is a down on his luck druggie in Paris. He takes a room in a seedy boarding house after being mugged for drugs in the street. As the pain of withdrawl racks his feeble body, he hears a strange and wonderful cure coming from the room above his: The sound of a violin. The instrument is played by a girl painfully shy, mute and terrified to open the window in her garret room, for to open it means destruction for her. originally performed as a play, the film version captures all of the atmosphere, mystery and fear of the play. E. Dale Smith playes the luckless William, while the role of Erica Zann is played by two actresses: One represents the mute violinist herself, the other the voice within yearning to get out.","genres":["Drama"," Musical"],"stems":["William","is","a","down","on","his","luck","druggi","in","Pari",".","He","take","a","room","in","a","seedi","board","hous","after","be","mug","for","drug","in","the","street",".","As","the","pain","of","withdrawl","rack","his","feebl","bodi",",","he","hear","a","strang","and","wonder","cure","come","from","the","room","abov","his",":","The","sound","of","a","violin",".","The","instrument","is","play","by","a","girl","pain","shi",",","mute","and","terrifi","to","open","the","window","in","her","garret","room",",","for","to","open","it","mean","destruct","for","her",".","origin","perform","as","a","play",",","the","film","version","captur","all","of","the","atmospher",",","mysteri","and","fear","of","the","play",".","E.","Dale","Smith","play","the","luckless","William",",","while","the","role","of","Erica","Zann","is","play","by","two","actress",":","One","repres","the","mute","violinist","herself",",","the","other","the","voic","within","yearn","to","get","out","."],"lemmas":["William","be","a","down","on","he","luck","druggie","in","Paris",".","he","take","a","room","in","a","seedy","board","house","after","be","mug","for","drug","in","the","street",".","as","the","pain","of","withdrawl","rack","he","feeble","body",",","he","hear","a","strange","and","wonderful","cure","come","from","the","room","above","he",":","the","sound","of","a","violin",".","the","instrument","be","play","by","a","girl","painfully","shy",",","mute","and","terrify","to","open","the","window","in","she","garret","room",",","for","to","open","it","mean","destruction","for","she",".","originally","perform","as","a","play",",","the","film","version","capture","all","of","the","atmosphere",",","mystery","and","fear","of","the","play",".","E.","Dale","Smith","playe","the","luckless","William",",","while","the","role","of","Erica","Zann","be","play","by","two","actress",":","one","represent","the","mute","violinist","herself",",","the","other","the","voice","within","yearning","to","get","out","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["William is a","is a down","a down on","down on his","on his luck","his luck druggie","luck druggie in","druggie in Paris","He takes a","takes a room","a room in","room in a","in a seedy","a seedy boarding","seedy boarding house","boarding house after","house after being","after being mugged","being mugged for","mugged for drugs","for drugs in","drugs in the","in the street","As the pain","the pain of","pain of withdrawl","of withdrawl racks","withdrawl racks his","racks his feeble","his feeble body","feeble body ,","body , he",", he hears","he hears a","hears a strange","a strange and","strange and wonderful","and wonderful cure","wonderful cure coming","cure coming from","coming from the","from the room","the room above","room above his","above his :","his : The",": The sound","The sound of","sound of a","of a violin","The instrument is","instrument is played","is played by","played by a","by a girl","a girl painfully","girl painfully shy","painfully shy ,","shy , mute",", mute and","mute and terrified","and terrified to","terrified to open","to open the","open the window","the window in","window in her","in her garret","her garret room","garret room ,","room , for",", for to","for to open","to open it","open it means","it means destruction","means destruction for","destruction for her","originally performed as","performed as a","as a play","a play ,","play , the",", the film","the film version","film version captures","version captures all","captures all of","all of the","of the atmosphere","the atmosphere ,","atmosphere , mystery",", mystery and","mystery and fear","and fear of","fear of the","of the play","E.

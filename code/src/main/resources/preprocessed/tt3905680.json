{"title":"Our Land","plot":"Our Land is about four people from different faith backgrounds who find common ground in pursuing forgiveness in the midst of conflict. As peace talks in Israel and Palestine continue to fail, and the situation only worsens, many people resort to apathy, fear, or harmful resistance. The region seems hopeless, but a closer look reveals otherwise. Our Land tells the story of four individuals living in Israel and Palestine, and how the deeply rooted pain of the conflict has affected their lives. The film reveals the hope these four individuals refuse to give up. Each goes against society by choosing another way - to love and forgive their neighbor. It's not easy, but they're determined to make small steps toward restoration.","genres":["Biography"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["Our","Land","is","about","four","peopl","from","differ","faith","background","who","find","common","ground","in","pursu","forgiv","in","the","midst","of","conflict",".","As","peac","talk","in","Israel","and","Palestin","continu","to","fail",",","and","the","situat","onli","worsen",",","mani","peopl","resort","to","apathi",",","fear",",","or","harm","resist",".","The","region","seem","hopeless",",","but","a","closer","look","reveal","otherwis",".","Our","Land","tell","the","stori","of","four","individu","live","in","Israel","and","Palestin",",","and","how","the","deepli","root","pain","of","the","conflict","has","affect","their","live",".","The","film","reveal","the","hope","these","four","individu","refus","to","give","up",".","Each","goe","against","societi","by","choos","anoth","way","-","to","love","and","forgiv","their","neighbor",".","It","'s","not","easi",",","but","they","re","determin","to","make","small","step","toward","restor","."],"lemmas":["we","Land","be","about","four","people","from","different","faith","background","who","find","common","ground","in","pursue","forgiveness","in","the","midst","of","conflict",".","as","peace","talk","in","Israel","and","Palestine","continue","to","fail",",","and","the","situation","only","worsen",",","many","people","resort","to","apathy",",","fear",",","or","harmful","resistance",".","the","region","seem","hopeless",",","but","a","closer","look","reveal","otherwise",".","we","Land","tell","the","story","of","four","individual","live","in","Israel","and","Palestine",",","and","how","the","deeply","rooted","pain","of","the","conflict","have","affect","they","life",".","the","film","reveal","the","hope","these","four","individual","refuse","to","give","up",".","each","go","against","society","by","choose","another","way","-","to","love","and","forgive","they","neighbor",".","it","be","not","easy",",","but","they","be","determine","to","make","small","step","toward","restoration","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Our Land is","Land is about","is about four","about four people","four people from","people from different","from different faith","different faith backgrounds","faith backgrounds who","backgrounds who find","who find common","find common ground","common ground in","ground in pursuing","in pursuing forgiveness","pursuing forgiveness in","forgiveness in the","in the midst","the midst of","midst of conflict","As peace talks","peace talks in","talks in Israel","in Israel and","Israel and Palestine","and Palestine continue","Palestine continue to","continue to fail","to fail ,","fail , and",", and the","and the situation","the situation only","situation only worsens","only worsens ,","worsens , many",", many people","many people resort","people resort to","resort to apathy","to apathy ,","apathy , fear",", fear ,","fear , or",", or harmful","or harmful resistance","The region seems","region seems hopeless","seems hopeless ,","hopeless , but",", but a","but a closer","a closer look","closer look reveals","look reveals otherwise","Our Land tells","Land tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of four","of four individuals","four individuals living","individuals living in","living in Israel","in Israel and","Israel and Palestine","and Palestine ,","Palestine , and",", and how","and how the","how the deeply","the deeply rooted","deeply rooted pain","rooted pain of","pain of the","of the conflict","the conflict has","conflict has affected","has affected their","affected their lives","The film reveals","film reveals the","reveals the hope","the hope these","hope these four","these four individuals","four individuals refuse","individuals refuse to","refuse to give","to give up","Each goes against","goes against society","against society by","society by choosing","by choosing another","choosing another way","another way -","way -

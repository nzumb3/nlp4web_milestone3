{"title":"A Walk to Beautiful","plot":"\"A Walk to Beautiful\" tells the story of five women in Ethiopia suffering from devastating childbirth injuries. Rejected by their husbands and ostracized by their communities, these women are left to spend the rest of their lives in loneliness and shame. We follow each of these women on their journey to a special hospital in Addis Ababa where they find solace for the first time in years, and we stay with them as their lives begin to change. Through the intimate experiences all five share, we are no longer in the heart of Africa-we are in the hearts of these women. The trials they endure and their attempts to rebuild their lives tell a universal story of hope, courage, and transformation.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","A","Walk","to","Beauti","\"","tell","the","stori","of","five","women","in","Ethiopia","suffer","from","devast","childbirth","injuri",".","Reject","by","their","husband","and","ostrac","by","their","communiti",",","these","women","are","left","to","spend","the","rest","of","their","live","in","loneli","and","shame",".","We","follow","each","of","these","women","on","their","journey","to","a","special","hospit","in","Addis","Ababa","where","they","find","solac","for","the","first","time","in","year",",","and","we","stay","with","them","as","their","live","begin","to","chang",".","Through","the","intim","experi","all","five","share",",","we","are","no","longer","in","the","heart","of","Africa-w","are","in","the","heart","of","these","women",".","The","trial","they","endur","and","their","attempt","to","rebuild","their","live","tell","a","univers","stori","of","hope",",","courag",",","and","transform","."],"lemmas":["``","a","walk","to","Beautiful","''","tell","the","story","of","five","woman","in","Ethiopia","suffer","from","devastating","childbirth","injury",".","reject","by","they","husband","and","ostracize","by","they","community",",","these","woman","be","leave","to","spend","the","rest","of","they","life","in","loneliness","and","shame",".","we","follow","each","of","these","woman","on","they","journey","to","a","special","hospital","in","Addis","Ababa","where","they","find","solace","for","the","first","time","in","year",",","and","we","stay","with","they","as","they","life","begin","to","change",".","through","the","intimate","experience","all","five","share",",","we","be","no","longer","in","the","heart","of","africa-we","be","in","the","heart","of","these","woman",".","the","trial","they","endure","and","they","attempt","to","rebuild","they","life","tell","a","universal","story","of","hope",",","courage",",","and","transformation","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\"

{"title":"The Muses of Bashevis Singer","plot":"Many books, biographies and articles have been written about the life and work of Isaac Bashevis Singer. An exclusive discovery of the filmmakers brings to light a hitherto unknown chapter of his life. In the mid 1960's Bashevis Singer established an army of female translators - more than forty women - who helped spread his work. He chose his translators carefully, was inspired by their presence, often falling in love with them. Nine of the women who were intimately familiar with the man and work are still here. Theirs will be the only voices heard in the film, as they allow us a glimpse into his complex personality and personal life.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Mani","book",",","biographi","and","articl","have","been","written","about","the","life","and","work","of","Isaac","Bashevi","Singer",".","An","exclus","discoveri","of","the","filmmak","bring","to","light","a","hitherto","unknown","chapter","of","his","life",".","In","the","mid","1960","'s","Bashevi","Singer","establish","an","armi","of","femal","translat","-","more","than","forti","women","-","who","help","spread","his","work",".","He","chose","his","translat","care",",","was","inspir","by","their","presenc",",","often","fall","in","love","with","them",".","Nine","of","the","women","who","were","intim","familiar","with","the","man","and","work","are","still","here",".","Their","will","be","the","onli","voic","heard","in","the","film",",","as","they","allow","us","a","glimps","into","his","complex","person","and","person","life","."],"lemmas":["many","book",",","biography","and","article","have","be","write","about","the","life","and","work","of","Isaac","Bashevis","Singer",".","a","exclusive","discovery","of","the","filmmaker","bring","to","light","a","hitherto","unknown","chapter","of","he","life",".","in","the","mid","1960","'s","Bashevis","Singer","establish","a","army","of","female","translator","-","more","than","forty","woman","-","who","help","spread","he","work",".","he","choose","he","translator","carefully",",","be","inspire","by","they","presence",",","often","fall","in","love","with","they",".","nine","of","the","woman","who","be","intimately","familiar","with","the","man","and","work","be","still","here",".","theirs","will","be","the","only","voice","hear","in","the","film",",","as","they","allow","we","a","glimpse","into","he","complex","personality","and","personal","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Many books ,","books , biographies",", biographies and","biographies and articles","and articles have","articles have been","have been written","been written about","written about the","about the life","the life and","life and work","and work of","work of Isaac","of Isaac Bashevis","Isaac Bashevis Singer","An exclusive discovery","exclusive discovery of","discovery of the","of the filmmakers","the filmmakers brings","filmmakers brings to","brings to light","to light a","light a hitherto","a hitherto unknown","hitherto unknown chapter","unknown chapter of","chapter of his","of his life","In the mid","the mid 1960","mid 1960 's","1960 's Bashevis","'s Bashevis Singer","Bashevis Singer established","Singer established an","established an army","an army of","army of female","of female translators","female translators -","translators -

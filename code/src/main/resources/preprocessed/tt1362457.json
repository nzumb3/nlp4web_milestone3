{"title":"One Day in Africa","plot":"In Kenyan offices and Malian farms, in Moroccan tea houses and Nigerian huts normal people of various backgrounds go about their day. For them, life in the developing world isn't about desperate squalor or improbable triumph; it's a complex, imperfect existence at odds with the stunning pictures beamed out from African safaris or the sad stories written to spur donations to Western aid groups. On a single day at the messy juncture of tradition and modernity, six people from different geographic and cultural backgrounds describe six versions of the African story.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Kenyan","offic","and","Malian","farm",",","in","Moroccan","tea","hous","and","Nigerian","hut","normal","peopl","of","various","background","go","about","their","day",".","For","them",",","life","in","the","develop","world","is","n't","about","desper","squalor","or","improb","triumph",";","it","'s","a","complex",",","imperfect","exist","at","odd","with","the","stun","pictur","beam","out","from","African","safari","or","the","sad","stori","written","to","spur","donat","to","Western","aid","group",".","On","a","singl","day","at","the","messi","junctur","of","tradit","and","modern",",","six","peopl","from","differ","geograph","and","cultur","background","describ","six","version","of","the","African","stori","."],"lemmas":["in","kenyan","office","and","malian","farm",",","in","moroccan","tea","house","and","nigerian","hut","normal","people","of","various","background","go","about","they","day",".","for","they",",","life","in","the","develop","world","be","not","about","desperate","squalor","or","improbable","triumph",";","it","be","a","complex",",","imperfect","existence","at","odds","with","the","stunning","picture","beam","out","from","african","safari","or","the","sad","story","write","to","spur","donation","to","western","aid","group",".","on","a","single","day","at","the","messy","juncture","of","tradition","and","modernity",",","six","people","from","different","geographic","and","cultural","background","describe","six","version","of","the","african","story","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["In Kenyan offices","Kenyan offices and","offices and Malian","and Malian farms","Malian farms ,","farms , in",", in Moroccan","in Moroccan tea","Moroccan tea houses","tea houses and","houses and Nigerian","and Nigerian huts","Nigerian huts normal","huts normal people","normal people of","people of various","of various backgrounds","various backgrounds go","backgrounds go about","go about their","about their day","For them ,","them , life",", life in","life in the","in the developing","the developing world","developing world is","world is n't","is n't about","n't about desperate","about desperate squalor","desperate squalor or","squalor or improbable","or improbable triumph","improbable triumph ;","triumph ; it","; it 's","it 's a","'s a complex","a complex ,","complex , imperfect",", imperfect existence","imperfect existence at","existence at odds","at odds with","odds with the","with the stunning","the stunning pictures","stunning pictures beamed","pictures beamed out","beamed out from","out from African","from African safaris","African safaris or","safaris or the","or the sad","the sad stories","sad stories written","stories written to","written to spur","to spur donations","spur donations to","donations to Western","to Western aid","Western aid groups","On a single","a single day","single day at","day at the","at the messy","the messy juncture","messy juncture of","juncture of tradition","of tradition and","tradition and modernity","and modernity ,","modernity , six",", six people","six people from","people from different","from different geographic","different geographic and","geographic and cultural","and cultural backgrounds","cultural backgrounds describe","backgrounds describe six","describe six versions","six versions of","versions of the","of the African","the African story"],"2grams":["In Kenyan","Kenyan offices","offices and","and Malian","Malian farms","farms ,",", in","in Moroccan","Moroccan tea","tea houses","houses and","and Nigerian","Nigerian huts","huts normal","normal people","people of","of various","various backgrounds","backgrounds go","go about","about their","their day","For them","them ,",", life","life in","in the","the developing","developing world","world is","is n't","n't about","about desperate","desperate squalor","squalor or","or improbable","improbable triumph","triumph ;","; it","it 's","'s a","a complex","complex ,",", imperfect","imperfect existence","existence at","at odds","odds with","with the","the stunning","stunning pictures","pictures beamed","beamed out","out from","from African","African safaris","safaris or","or the","the sad","sad stories","stories written","written to","to spur","spur donations","donations to","to Western","Western aid","aid groups","On a","a single","single day","day at","at the","the messy","messy juncture","juncture of","of tradition","tradition and","and modernity","modernity ,",", six","six people","people from","from different","different geographic","geographic and","and cultural","cultural backgrounds","backgrounds describe","describe six","six versions","versions of","of the","the African","African story"]}

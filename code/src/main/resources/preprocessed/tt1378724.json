{"title":"Love Lived on Death Row","plot":"Four Syriani siblings whose father was sentenced to die for the murder of their mother in 1990 and Meg Eggleston, who became their father's friend and spiritual advisor through letters to him in prison. Orphaned and estranged, the Syriani children lived with hate, anger and confusion as the man they could only refer to as 'Him Him' lived on North Carolina's death row. But in 2004 they collectively decided to visit him in prison, seeking answers so they could move on with their adult lives. What transpired that day was a miracle of forgiveness followed by a journey of healing, restoring family memories and then a battle for his clemency. Love Lived on Death Row's portrait of a family torn apart by tragedy and reunited by another impending tragedy is a powerful examination of not only the healing process, but also of the role capital punishment plays in serving justice.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Four","Syriani","sibl","whose","father","was","sentenc","to","die","for","the","murder","of","their","mother","in","1990","and","Meg","Eggleston",",","who","becam","their","father","'s","friend","and","spiritu","advisor","through","letter","to","him","in","prison",".","Orphane","and","estrang",",","the","Syriani","children","live","with","hate",",","anger","and","confus","as","the","man","they","could","onli","refer","to","as","'","Him","Him","'","live","on","North","Carolina","'s","death","row",".","But","in","2004","they","collect","decid","to","visit","him","in","prison",",","seek","answer","so","they","could","move","on","with","their","adult","live",".","What","transpir","that","day","was","a","miracl","of","forgiv","follow","by","a","journey","of","heal",",","restor","famili","memori","and","then","a","battl","for","his","clemenc",".","Love","Live","on","Death","Row","'s","portrait","of","a","famili","torn","apart","by","tragedi","and","reunit","by","anoth","impend","tragedi","is","a","power","examin","of","not","onli","the","heal","process",",","but","also","of","the","role","capit","punish","play","in","serv","justic","."],"lemmas":["four","Syriani","sibling","whose","father","be","sentence","to","die","for","the","murder","of","they","mother","in","1990","and","Meg","Eggleston",",","who","become","they","father","'s","friend","and","spiritual","advisor","through","letter","to","he","in","prison",".","orphan","and","estrange",",","the","Syriani","child","live","with","hate",",","anger","and","confusion","as","the","man","they","could","only","refer","to","as","'","he","he","'","live","on","North","Carolina","'s","death","row",".","but","in","2004","they","collectively","decide","to","visit","he","in","prison",",","seek","answer","so","they","could","move","on","with","they","adult","life",".","what","transpire","that","day","be","a","miracle","of","forgiveness","follow","by","a","journey","of","healing",",","restore","family","memory","and","then","a","battle","for","he","clemency",".","love","live","on","Death","Row","'s","portrait","of","a","family","tear","apart","by","tragedy","and","reunite","by","another","impending","tragedy","be","a","powerful","examination","of","not","only","the","healing","process",",","but","also","of","the","role","capital","punishment","play","in","serve","justice","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Four

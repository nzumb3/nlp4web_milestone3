{"title":"Nebo za nas 3D","plot":"A 12-years old russian boy, who miraculously survives a terrible car crash where all his family died, is looking for the killer-driver, who intentionally provoked the accident. He could never expect that on this journey he would find his soul-mate, fly to the dark side of the Moon and learn how to live without casting any shadows. Learn that every single man on Earth is born for a great purpose - to perform a heroic exploit, to change our world for good and become a master of his own destiny. To prevent a holy war of jihad against Russia and to ruin terrorist plans - to assassinate the President of Russia, to take USA Olympic team hostage and then execute them along with 150000 people during Olympic Games-2014 held in Russia. Learn that nothing in our world happens by chance. Chance is the pseudonym of God when he does not want to sign. However He cannot leave our planet unattended.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Adventure"],"stems":["A","12-year","old","russian","boy",",","who","miracul","surviv","a","terribl","car","crash","where","all","his","famili","die",",","is","look","for","the","killer-driv",",","who","intent","provok","the","accid",".","He","could","never","expect","that","on","this","journey","he","would","find","his","soul-mat",",","fli","to","the","dark","side","of","the","Moon","and","learn","how","to","live","without","cast","ani","shadow",".","Learn","that","everi","singl","man","on","Earth","is","born","for","a","great","purpos","-","to","perform","a","heroic","exploit",",","to","chang","our","world","for","good","and","becom","a","master","of","his","own","destini",".","To","prevent","a","holi","war","of","jihad","against","Russia","and","to","ruin","terrorist","plan","-","to","assassin","the","Presid","of","Russia",",","to","take","USA","Olympic","team","hostag","and","then","execut","them","along","with","150000","peopl","dure","Olympic","Games-2014","held","in","Russia",".","Learn","that","noth","in","our","world","happen","by","chanc",".","Chanc","is","the","pseudonym","of","God","when","he","doe","not","want","to","sign",".","Howev","He","can","not","leav","our","planet","unattend","."],"lemmas":["a","12-years","old","russian","boy",",","who","miraculously","survive","a","terrible","car","crash","where","all","he","family","die",",","be","look","for","the","killer-driver",",","who","intentionally","provoke","the","accident",".","he","could","never","expect","that","on","this","journey","he","would","find","he","soul-mate",",","fly","to","the","dark","side","of","the","Moon","and","learn","how","to","live","without","cast","any","shadow",".","learn","that","every","single","man","on","Earth","be","bear","for","a","great","purpose","-","to","perform","a","heroic","exploit",",","to","change","we","world","for","good","and","become","a","master","of","he","own","destiny",".","to","prevent","a","holy","war","of","jihad","against","Russia","and","to","ruin","terrorist","plan","-","to","assassinate","the","President","of","Russia",",","to","take","USA","Olympic","team","hostage","and","then","execute","they","along","with","150000","people","during","olympic","games-2014","hold","in","Russia",".","learn","that","nothing","in","we","world","happen","by","chance",".","chance","be","the","pseudonym","of","God","when","he","do","not","want","to","sign",".","however","he","can","not","leave","we","planet","unattended","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A 12-years old","12-years old russian","old russian boy","russian boy ,","boy , who",", who miraculously","who miraculously survives","miraculously survives a","survives a terrible","a terrible car","terrible car crash","car crash where","crash where all","where all his","all his family","his family died","family died ,","died , is",", is looking","is looking for","looking for the","for the killer-driver","the killer-driver ,","killer-driver , who",", who intentionally","who intentionally provoked","intentionally provoked the","provoked the accident","He could never","could never expect","never expect that","expect that on","that on this","on this journey","this journey he","journey he would","he would find","would find his","find his soul-mate","his soul-mate ,","soul-mate , fly",", fly to","fly to the","to the dark","the dark side","dark side of","side of the","of the Moon","the Moon and","Moon and learn","and learn how","learn how to","how to live","to live without","live without casting","without casting any","casting any shadows","Learn that every","that every single","every single man","single man on","man on Earth","on Earth is","Earth is born","is born for","born for a","for a great","a great purpose","great purpose -","purpose -

{"title":"Taarka","plot":"The first film in the Seto language in the world speaks about the brightest heroine of a small people, the folk singer Hilana Taarka, a woman who lived her whole life as an outcast in a small chimney-less hut; as an unmarried mother of children in poverty, begging her bread, doing odd jobs and singing. She always sang the truth, sometimes bitter, sometimes funny, sometimes cruel. She was feared, despised and coveted. Taarka sang throughout her remarkable life, throughout her fate, from a small Seto village to international fame. And she sang well. Really well. Taarka became the Mother of the Song, a legend. But as a woman, as a member of the community, the Seto people never really accepted her. Taarka - a despised woman and a worshiped singer.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["The","first","film","in","the","Seto","languag","in","the","world","speak","about","the","brightest","heroin","of","a","small","peopl",",","the","folk","singer","Hilana","Taarka",",","a","woman","who","live","her","whole","life","as","an","outcast","in","a","small","chimney-less","hut",";","as","an","unmarri","mother","of","children","in","poverti",",","beg","her","bread",",","do","odd","job","and","sing",".","She","alway","sang","the","truth",",","sometim","bitter",",","sometim","funni",",","sometim","cruel",".","She","was","fear",",","despis","and","covet",".","Taarka","sang","throughout","her","remark","life",",","throughout","her","fate",",","from","a","small","Seto","villag","to","intern","fame",".","And","she","sang","well",".","Realli","well",".","Taarka","becam","the","Mother","of","the","Song",",","a","legend",".","But","as","a","woman",",","as","a","member","of","the","communiti",",","the","Seto","peopl","never","realli","accept","her",".","Taarka","-","a","despis","woman","and","a","worship","singer","."],"lemmas":["the","first","film","in","the","Seto","language","in","the","world","speak","about","the","brightest","heroine","of","a","small","people",",","the","folk","singer","Hilana","Taarka",",","a","woman","who","live","she","whole","life","as","a","outcast","in","a","small","chimney-less","hut",";","as","a","unmarried","mother","of","child","in","poverty",",","beg","she","bread",",","do","odd","job","and","singing",".","she","always","sing","the","truth",",","sometimes","bitter",",","sometimes","funny",",","sometimes","cruel",".","she","be","fear",",","despise","and","covet",".","Taarka","sing","throughout","she","remarkable","life",",","throughout","she","fate",",","from","a","small","Seto","village","to","international","fame",".","and","she","sing","well",".","really","well",".","Taarka","become","the","Mother","of","the","song",",","a","legend",".","but","as","a","woman",",","as","a","member","of","the","community",",","the","Seto","people","never","really","accept","she",".","Taarka","-","a","despise","woman","and","a","worship","singer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The first film","first film in","film in the","in the Seto","the Seto language","Seto language in","language in the","in the world","the world speaks","world speaks about","speaks about the","about the brightest","the brightest heroine","brightest heroine of","heroine of a","of a small","a small people","small people ,","people , the",", the folk","the folk singer","folk singer Hilana","singer Hilana Taarka","Hilana Taarka ,","Taarka , a",", a woman","a woman who","woman who lived","who lived her","lived her whole","her whole life","whole life as","life as an","as an outcast","an outcast in","outcast in a","in a small","a small chimney-less","small chimney-less hut","chimney-less hut ;","hut ;

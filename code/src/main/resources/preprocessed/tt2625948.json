In an abandoned asylum, doctors carry out secret experiments on unsuspecting patients who have been taken from their everyday lives and seemingly erased from existence. The experiments, codenamed Limes, are designed to cure violent episodes through new methods of brainwashing and mind manipulation. But as the experimental project begins to fail, chaos ensues in the hospital as patients seek revenge against their captors.","genres":["Action"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["Eeri","mysteri","horror",".","In","an","abandon","asylum",",","doctor","carri","out","secret","experi","on","unsuspect","patient","who","have","been","taken","from","their","everyday","live","and","seem","eras","from","exist",".","The","experi",",","codenam","Lime",",","are","design","to","cure","violent","episod","through","new","method","of","brainwash","and","mind","manipul",".","But","as","the","experiment","project","begin","to","fail",",","chao","ensu","in","the","hospit","as","patient","seek","reveng","against","their","captor","."],"lemmas":["eerie","mystery","horror",".","in","a","abandoned","asylum",",","doctor","carry","out","secret","experiment","on","unsuspecting","patient","who","have","be","take","from","they","everyday","life","and","seemingly","erase","from","existence",".","the","experiment",",","codename","Limes",",","be","design","to","cure","violent","episode","through","new","method","of","brainwashing","and","mind","manipulation",".","but","as","the","experimental","project","begin","to","fail",",","chaos","ensue","in","the","hospital","as","patient","seek","revenge","against","they","captor","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Eerie mystery horror","In an abandoned","an abandoned asylum","abandoned asylum ,","asylum , doctors",", doctors carry","doctors carry out","carry out secret","out secret experiments","secret experiments on","experiments on unsuspecting","on unsuspecting patients","unsuspecting patients who","patients who have","who have been","have been taken","been taken from","taken from their","from their everyday","their everyday lives","everyday lives and","lives and seemingly","and seemingly erased","seemingly erased from","erased from existence","The experiments ,","experiments , codenamed",", codenamed Limes","codenamed Limes ,","Limes , are",", are designed","are designed to","designed to cure","to cure violent","cure violent episodes","violent episodes through","episodes through new","through new methods","new methods of","methods of brainwashing","of brainwashing and","brainwashing and mind","and mind manipulation","But as the","as the experimental","the experimental project","experimental project begins","project begins to","begins to fail","to fail ,","fail , chaos",", chaos ensues","chaos ensues in","ensues in the","in the hospital","the hospital as","hospital as patients","as patients seek","patients seek revenge","seek revenge against","revenge against their","against their captors"],"2grams":["Eerie mystery","mystery horror","In an","an abandoned","abandoned asylum","asylum ,",", doctors","doctors carry","carry out","out secret","secret experiments","experiments on","on unsuspecting","unsuspecting patients","patients who","who have","have been","been taken","taken from","from their","their everyday","everyday lives","lives and","and seemingly","seemingly erased","erased from","from existence","The experiments","experiments ,",", codenamed","codenamed Limes","Limes ,",", are","are designed","designed to","to cure","cure violent","violent episodes","episodes through","through new","new methods","methods of","of brainwashing","brainwashing and","and mind","mind manipulation","But as","as the","the experimental","experimental project","project begins","begins to","to fail","fail ,",", chaos","chaos ensues","ensues in","in the","the hospital","hospital as","as patients","patients seek","seek revenge","revenge against","against their","their captors"]}

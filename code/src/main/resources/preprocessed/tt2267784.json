{"title":"Mississippi I Am","plot":"In 2006, 'NSync's Lance Bass came out publicly as gay. Once the \"most beloved son\" of his home state of Mississippi, he was instantly rejected and his hopes that Mississippi could ever embrace change were dashed. Then in 2010 he heard the story of Constance McMillen, 18, who was suing her school for denying her the right to go to the prom with her girlfriend. Something was shifting even in the most socially conservative states in America. MISSISSIPPI: I AM, examines the relatively new battle on the part of primarily young LGBT people to bring gay civil rights and visibility out in the open and beyond division.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","2006",",","'","NSync","'s","Lanc","Bass","came","out","public","as","gay",".","Once","the","\"","most","belov","son","\"","of","his","home","state","of","Mississippi",",","he","was","instant","reject","and","his","hope","that","Mississippi","could","ever","embrac","chang","were","dash",".","Then","in","2010","he","heard","the","stori","of","Constanc","McMillen",",","18",",","who","was","su","her","school","for","deni","her","the","right","to","go","to","the","prom","with","her","girlfriend",".","Someth","was","shift","even","in","the","most","social","conserv","state","in","America",".","MISSISSIPPI",":","I","AM",",","examin","the","relat","new","battl","on","the","part","of","primarili","young","LGBT","peopl","to","bring","gay","civil","right","and","visibl","out","in","the","open","and","beyond","divis","."],"lemmas":["in","2006",",","'","nsync","'s","Lance","Bass","come","out","publicly","as","gay",".","once","the","``","most","beloved","son","''","of","he","home","state","of","Mississippi",",","he","be","instantly","reject","and","he","hope","that","Mississippi","could","ever","embrace","change","be","dash",".","then","in","2010","he","hear","the","story","of","Constance","McMillen",",","18",",","who","be","sue","she","school","for","deny","she","the","right","to","go","to","the","prom","with","she","girlfriend",".","something","be","shift","even","in","the","most","socially","conservative","state","in","America",".","MISSISSIPPI",":","I","AM",",","examine","the","relatively","new","battle","on","the","part","of","primarily","young","LGBT","people","to","bring","gay","civil","rights","and","visibility","out","in","the","open","and","beyond","division","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

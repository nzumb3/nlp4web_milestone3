{"title":"Family of the Wa'a","plot":"This is the story of a journey, both of a canoe and the men and women who paddled it 1,750 miles across the Hawaiian archipelago. It began with the kuleana, or sacred promise, of a young man to his uncle. But it became a life-changing endeavor. In 1976, Captain Kavika Kapahulehua sailed from Hawaii to Tahiti in a double-hulled canoe. Before he passed away, Kavika asked his nephew, Kimokeo, to continue his voyage and reconnect the entire ancestral archipelago, from the Big Island to the Kure atoll, in a traditional paddling canoe, or wa'a. But before Kimokeo could fulfill his kuleana, he had to remake himself from the tough, beach bully he had become, into a leader of men and women. In the end, Kimokeo and his fellow wa'a paddlers realize they are each on their own path to Kure.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","the","stori","of","a","journey",",","both","of","a","cano","and","the","men","and","women","who","paddl","it","1,750","mile","across","the","Hawaiian","archipelago",".","It","began","with","the","kuleana",",","or","sacr","promis",",","of","a","young","man","to","his","uncl",".","But","it","becam","a","life-chang","endeavor",".","In","1976",",","Captain","Kavika","Kapahulehua","sail","from","Hawaii","to","Tahiti","in","a","double-hul","cano",".","Befor","he","pass","away",",","Kavika","ask","his","nephew",",","Kimokeo",",","to","continu","his","voyag","and","reconnect","the","entir","ancestr","archipelago",",","from","the","Big","Island","to","the","Kure","atol",",","in","a","tradit","paddl","cano",",","or","wa'a",".","But","befor","Kimokeo","could","fulfil","his","kuleana",",","he","had","to","remak","himself","from","the","tough",",","beach","bulli","he","had","becom",",","into","a","leader","of","men","and","women",".","In","the","end",",","Kimokeo","and","his","fellow","wa'a","paddler","realiz","they","are","each","on","their","own","path","to","Kure","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","story","of","a","journey",",","both","of","a","canoe","and","the","man","and","woman","who","paddle","it","1,750","mile","across","the","hawaiian","archipelago",".","it","begin","with","the","kuleana",",","or","sacred","promise",",","of","a","young","man","to","he","uncle",".","but","it","become","a","life-changing","endeavor",".","in","1976",",","Captain","Kavika","Kapahulehua","sail","from","Hawaii","to","Tahiti","in","a","double-hulled","canoe",".","before","he","pass","away",",","Kavika","ask","he","nephew",",","Kimokeo",",","to","continue","he","voyage","and","reconnect","the","entire","ancestral","archipelago",",","from","the","Big","Island","to","the","Kure","atoll",",","in","a","traditional","paddle","canoe",",","or","wa'a",".","but","before","Kimokeo","could","fulfill","he","kuleana",",","he","have","to","remake","himself","from","the","tough",",","beach","bully","he","have","become",",","into","a","leader","of","man","and","woman",".","in","the","end",",","Kimokeo","and","he","fellow","wa'a","paddler","realize","they","be","each","on","they","own","path","to","Kure","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

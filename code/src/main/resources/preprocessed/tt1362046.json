{"title":"Bali by Heart","plot":"In June 2006, eleven musicians from Vancouver joined the twenty-seven members of the gamelan Cudamani in the small village of Pengekosan, center Bali, and prepared for a performance of a new work by Canadian Michael Tenzer, composer and ethno-musicologist. For a month, they had to adjust to a totally new physical and cultural environment, meet certain social and protocol obligations, and perform music in a way that had never been attempted. 'Bali by Heart' explores much more than music. It is also a behind-the-scenes documentary with stories of friendship formed, hardship surmounted, and a moving testimony of how Balinese have understood that their culture is their most precious survival tool.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","June","2006",",","eleven","musician","from","Vancouv","join","the","twenty-seven","member","of","the","gamelan","Cudamani","in","the","small","villag","of","Pengekosan",",","center","Bali",",","and","prepar","for","a","perform","of","a","new","work","by","Canadian","Michael","Tenzer",",","compos","and","ethno-musicologist",".","For","a","month",",","they","had","to","adjust","to","a","total","new","physic","and","cultur","environ",",","meet","certain","social","and","protocol","oblig",",","and","perform","music","in","a","way","that","had","never","been","attempt",".","'","Bali","by","Heart","'","explor","much","more","than","music",".","It","is","also","a","behind-the-scen","documentari","with","stori","of","friendship","form",",","hardship","surmount",",","and","a","move","testimoni","of","how","Balines","have","understood","that","their","cultur","is","their","most","precious","surviv","tool","."],"lemmas":["in","June","2006",",","eleven","musician","from","Vancouver","join","the","twenty-seven","member","of","the","gamelan","Cudamani","in","the","small","village","of","Pengekosan",",","center","Bali",",","and","prepare","for","a","performance","of","a","new","work","by","Canadian","Michael","Tenzer",",","composer","and","ethno-musicologist",".","for","a","month",",","they","have","to","adjust","to","a","totally","new","physical","and","cultural","environment",",","meet","certain","social","and","protocol","obligation",",","and","perform","music","in","a","way","that","have","never","be","attempt",".","'","Bali","by","Heart","'","explore","much","more","than","music",".","it","be","also","a","behind-the-scenes","documentary","with","story","of","friendship","form",",","hardship","surmount",",","and","a","move","testimony","of","how","Balinese","have","understand","that","they","culture","be","they","most","precious","survival","tool","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In June 2006","June 2006 ,","2006 , eleven",", eleven musicians","eleven musicians from","musicians from Vancouver","from Vancouver joined","Vancouver joined the","joined the twenty-seven","the twenty-seven members","twenty-seven members of","members of the","of the gamelan","the gamelan Cudamani","gamelan Cudamani in","Cudamani in the","in the small","the small village","small village of","village of Pengekosan","of Pengekosan ,","Pengekosan , center",", center Bali","center Bali ,","Bali , and",", and prepared","and prepared for","prepared for a","for a performance","a performance of","performance of a","of a new","a new work","new work by","work by Canadian","by Canadian Michael","Canadian Michael Tenzer","Michael Tenzer ,","Tenzer , composer",", composer and","composer and ethno-musicologist","For a month","a month ,","month , they",", they had","they had to","had to adjust","to adjust to","adjust to a","to a totally","a totally new","totally new physical","new physical and","physical and cultural","and cultural environment","cultural environment ,","environment , meet",", meet certain","meet certain social","certain social and","social and protocol","and protocol obligations","protocol obligations ,","obligations , and",", and perform","and perform music","perform music in","music in a","in a way","a way that","way that had","that had never","had never been","never been attempted","been attempted .","attempted .

{"title":"Paradox","plot":"After his wife is killed in a hit-and-run accident by a mysterious Hooded Man, DYLAN BRANDT, a Theoretical Physicist, builds a Quantum Suicide Machine to jump through parallel universes to find another version of his wife. Based on the ancient Greek myth of Orpheus and Eurydice, where a man storms of the Gates of Hades to return his wife to the land of the living, Dylan transverses infinite worlds of the Multi-verse to find his wife. But with every jump, Dylan is thwarted by the efforts of the mysterious Hooded Man. Ignoring the warnings of his mentor, DR. YAMAMOTO, Dylan recklessly jumps into ever more flawed universes, until the rules of physics completely break down, threatening to destroy the universe and everything in it.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Romance"],"stems":["After","his","wife","is","kill","in","a","hit-and-run","accid","by","a","mysteri","Hood","Man",",","DYLAN","BRANDT",",","a","Theoret","Physicist",",","build","a","Quantum","Suicid","Machin","to","jump","through","parallel","univers","to","find","anoth","version","of","his","wife",".","Base","on","the","ancient","Greek","myth","of","Orpheus","and","Eurydic",",","where","a","man","storm","of","the","Gate","of","Hade","to","return","his","wife","to","the","land","of","the","live",",","Dylan","transvers","infinit","world","of","the","Multi-vers","to","find","his","wife",".","But","with","everi","jump",",","Dylan","is","thwart","by","the","effort","of","the","mysteri","Hood","Man",".","Ignore","the","warn","of","his","mentor",",","DR.","YAMAMOTO",",","Dylan","reckless","jump","into","ever","more","flaw","univers",",","until","the","rule","of","physic","complet","break","down",",","threaten","to","destroy","the","univers","and","everyth","in","it","."],"lemmas":["after","he","wife","be","kill","in","a","hit-and-run","accident","by","a","mysterious","Hooded","Man",",","DYLAN","BRANDT",",","a","theoretical","physicist",",","build","a","Quantum","Suicide","Machine","to","jump","through","parallel","universe","to","find","another","version","of","he","wife",".","base","on","the","ancient","greek","myth","of","Orpheus","and","Eurydice",",","where","a","man","storm","of","the","Gates","of","Hades","to","return","he","wife","to","the","land","of","the","living",",","Dylan","transverse","infinite","world","of","the","multi-verse","to","find","he","wife",".","but","with","every","jump",",","Dylan","be","thwart","by","the","effort","of","the","mysterious","hooded","man",".","ignore","the","warning","of","he","mentor",",","DR.","YAMAMOTO",",","Dylan","recklessly","jump","into","ever","more","flawed","universe",",","until","the","rule","of","physics","completely","break","down",",","threaten","to","destroy","the","universe","and","everything","in","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After his wife","his wife is","wife is killed","is killed in","killed in a","in a hit-and-run","a hit-and-run accident","hit-and-run accident by","accident by a","by a mysterious","a mysterious Hooded","mysterious Hooded Man","Hooded Man ,","Man , DYLAN",", DYLAN BRANDT","DYLAN BRANDT ,","BRANDT , a",", a Theoretical","a Theoretical Physicist","Theoretical Physicist ,","Physicist , builds",", builds a","builds a Quantum","a Quantum Suicide","Quantum Suicide Machine","Suicide Machine to","Machine to jump","to jump through","jump through parallel","through parallel universes","parallel universes to","universes to find","to find another","find another version","another version of","version of his","of his wife","Based on the","on the ancient","the ancient Greek","ancient Greek myth","Greek myth of","myth of Orpheus","of Orpheus and","Orpheus and Eurydice","and Eurydice ,","Eurydice , where",", where a","where a man","a man storms","man storms of","storms of the","of the Gates","the Gates of","Gates of Hades","of Hades to","Hades to return","to return his","return his wife","his wife to","wife to the","to the land","the land of","land of the","of the living","the living ,","living , Dylan",", Dylan transverses","Dylan transverses infinite","transverses infinite worlds","infinite worlds of","worlds of the","of the Multi-verse","the Multi-verse to","Multi-verse to find","to find his","find his wife","But with every","with every jump","every jump ,","jump , Dylan",", Dylan is","Dylan is thwarted","is thwarted by","thwarted by the","by the efforts","the efforts of","efforts of the","of the mysterious","the mysterious Hooded","mysterious Hooded Man","Ignoring the warnings","the warnings of","warnings of his","of his mentor","his mentor ,","mentor , DR.",", DR.

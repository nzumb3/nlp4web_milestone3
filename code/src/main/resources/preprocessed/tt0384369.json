{"title":"Before the Fall","plot":"In 1942, Friedrich Weimer's boxing skills get him an appointment to a National Political Academy (NaPolA) - high schools that produce Nazi elite. Over his father's objections, Friedrich enrolls, seeing this as his ticket out of factory life to university and a good salary. During his year in seventh column (fifth form), this innocence is altered as Friedrich encounters hazing, cruelty, death, and the Nazi code. His friendship with Albrecht, the ascetic son of the area's governor, is central to this education; a night in the forest hunting for escaped Russian POWs brings things to a head.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Sport"],"stems":["In","1942",",","Friedrich","Weimer","'s","box","skill","get","him","an","appoint","to","a","Nation","Polit","Academi","(","NaPolA",")","-","high","school","that","produc","Nazi","elit",".","Over","his","father","'s","object",",","Friedrich","enrol",",","see","this","as","his","ticket","out","of","factori","life","to","univers","and","a","good","salari",".","Dure","his","year","in","seventh","column","(","fifth","form",")",",","this","innoc","is","alter","as","Friedrich","encount","haze",",","cruelti",",","death",",","and","the","Nazi","code",".","His","friendship","with","Albrecht",",","the","ascet","son","of","the","area","'s","governor",",","is","central","to","this","educ",";","a","night","in","the","forest","hunt","for","escap","Russian","POWs","bring","thing","to","a","head","."],"lemmas":["in","1942",",","Friedrich","Weimer","'s","boxing","skill","get","he","a","appointment","to","a","national","political","academy","-lrb-","napola","-rrb-","-","high","school","that","produce","nazi","elite",".","over","he","father","'s","objection",",","Friedrich","enroll",",","see","this","as","he","ticket","out","of","factory","life","to","university","and","a","good","salary",".","during","he","year","in","seventh","column","-lrb-","fifth","form","-rrb-",",","this","innocence","be","alter","as","Friedrich","encounter","hazing",",","cruelty",",","death",",","and","the","Nazi","code",".","he","friendship","with","Albrecht",",","the","ascetic","son","of","the","area","'s","governor",",","be","central","to","this","education",";","a","night","in","the","forest","hunting","for","escape","russian","pow","bring","thing","to","a","head","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1942 ,","1942 , Friedrich",", Friedrich Weimer","Friedrich Weimer 's","Weimer 's boxing","'s boxing skills","boxing skills get","skills get him","get him an","him an appointment","an appointment to","appointment to a","to a National","a National Political","National Political Academy","Political Academy (","Academy ( NaPolA","( NaPolA )","NaPolA ) -",") - high","- high schools","high schools that","schools that produce","that produce Nazi","produce Nazi elite","Over his father","his father 's","father 's objections","'s objections ,","objections , Friedrich",", Friedrich enrolls","Friedrich enrolls ,","enrolls , seeing",", seeing this","seeing this as","this as his","as his ticket","his ticket out","ticket out of","out of factory","of factory life","factory life to","life to university","to university and","university and a","and a good","a good salary","During his year","his year in","year in seventh","in seventh column","seventh column (","column ( fifth","( fifth form","fifth form )","form ) ,",") , this",", this innocence","this innocence is","innocence is altered","is altered as","altered as Friedrich","as Friedrich encounters","Friedrich encounters hazing","encounters hazing ,","hazing , cruelty",", cruelty ,","cruelty , death",", death ,","death , and",", and the","and the Nazi","the Nazi code","His friendship with","friendship with Albrecht","with Albrecht ,","Albrecht , the",", the ascetic","the ascetic son","ascetic son of","son of the","of the area","the area 's","area 's governor","'s governor ,","governor , is",", is central","is central to","central to this","to this education","this education ;","education ;

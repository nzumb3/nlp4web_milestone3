{"title":"Maataf kabeer alhajm","plot":"According to some beliefs prevalent in the ancient Palestinian culture, when a Palestinian dreams that s/he is wearing a coat or a dress which is larger than their original size, the interpretation of the dream would be that the Palestinian would be likely to bear over-burdened responsibilities. This case of over-burdened responsibilities is indeed what Palestinians witness these days whether they are living inside or outside the Palestinian lands. The only unjustified excuse for their suffering is Being Palestinians.","genres":["Biography"," History"],"stems":["Accord","to","some","belief","preval","in","the","ancient","Palestinian","cultur",",","when","a","Palestinian","dream","that","s/he","is","wear","a","coat","or","a","dress","which","is","larger","than","their","origin","size",",","the","interpret","of","the","dream","would","be","that","the","Palestinian","would","be","like","to","bear","over-burden","respons",".","This","case","of","over-burden","respons","is","inde","what","Palestinian","wit","these","day","whether","they","are","live","insid","or","outsid","the","Palestinian","land",".","The","onli","unjustifi","excus","for","their","suffer","is","Be","Palestinian","."],"lemmas":["accord","to","some","belief","prevalent","in","the","ancient","palestinian","culture",",","when","a","palestinian","dream","that","s/he","be","wear","a","coat","or","a","dress","which","be","larger","than","they","original","size",",","the","interpretation","of","the","dream","would","be","that","the","Palestinian","would","be","likely","to","bear","over-burdened","responsibility",".","this","case","of","over-burdened","responsibility","be","indeed","what","Palestinians","witness","these","day","whether","they","be","live","inside","or","outside","the","palestinian","land",".","the","only","unjustified","excuse","for","they","suffering","be","be","Palestinians","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["According to some","to some beliefs","some beliefs prevalent","beliefs prevalent in","prevalent in the","in the ancient","the ancient Palestinian","ancient Palestinian culture","Palestinian culture ,","culture , when",", when a","when a Palestinian","a Palestinian dreams","Palestinian dreams that","dreams that s/he","that s/he is","s/he is wearing","is wearing a","wearing a coat","a coat or","coat or a","or a dress","a dress which","dress which is","which is larger","is larger than","larger than their","than their original","their original size","original size ,","size , the",", the interpretation","the interpretation of","interpretation of the","of the dream","the dream would","dream would be","would be that","be that the","that the Palestinian","the Palestinian would","Palestinian would be","would be likely","be likely to","likely to bear","to bear over-burdened","bear over-burdened responsibilities","This case of","case of over-burdened","of over-burdened responsibilities","over-burdened responsibilities is","responsibilities is indeed","is indeed what","indeed what Palestinians","what Palestinians witness","Palestinians witness these","witness these days","these days whether","days whether they","whether they are","they are living","are living inside","living inside or","inside or outside","or outside the","outside the Palestinian","the Palestinian lands","The only unjustified","only unjustified excuse","unjustified excuse for","excuse for their","for their suffering","their suffering is","suffering is Being","is Being Palestinians"],"2grams":["According to","to some","some beliefs","beliefs prevalent","prevalent in","in the","the ancient","ancient Palestinian","Palestinian culture","culture ,",", when","when a","a Palestinian","Palestinian dreams","dreams that","that s/he","s/he is","is wearing","wearing a","a coat","coat or","or a","a dress","dress which","which is","is larger","larger than","than their","their original","original size","size ,",", the","the interpretation","interpretation of","of the","the dream","dream would","would be","be that","that the","the Palestinian","Palestinian would","would be","be likely","likely to","to bear","bear over-burdened","over-burdened responsibilities","This case","case of","of over-burdened","over-burdened responsibilities","responsibilities is","is indeed","indeed what","what Palestinians","Palestinians witness","witness these","these days","days whether","whether they","they are","are living","living inside","inside or","or outside","outside the","the Palestinian","Palestinian lands","The only","only unjustified","unjustified excuse","excuse for","for their","their suffering","suffering is","is Being","Being Palestinians"]}

{"title":"Days of Democracy","plot":"This documentary is a set of interviews with women running for Egypt's Parliament in November of 1995. After a review of recent political history (from 1920 to the institution of women's suffrage in 1956, the election of two women to Parliament in 1957, the increase to 35 female MPs in 1984, and the fall to 10 in 1990), about 20 candidates talk to the camera: incumbents and newcomers; women from the ruling NDP party, from minor parties and independents. This is retail politics: meeting voters in small groups, holding store-front rallies. The candidates have feminist views, and they also champion clean water, better jobs, rebuilding housing after an earthquake, and fair, honest elections.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","is","a","set","of","interview","with","women","run","for","Egypt","'s","Parliament","in","Novemb","of","1995",".","After","a","review","of","recent","polit","histori","(","from","1920","to","the","institut","of","women","'s","suffrag","in","1956",",","the","elect","of","two","women","to","Parliament","in","1957",",","the","increas","to","35","femal","MPs","in","1984",",","and","the","fall","to","10","in","1990",")",",","about","20","candid","talk","to","the","camera",":","incumb","and","newcom",";","women","from","the","rule","NDP","parti",",","from","minor","parti","and","independ",".","This","is","retail","polit",":","meet","voter","in","small","group",",","hold","store-front","ralli",".","The","candid","have","feminist","view",",","and","they","also","champion","clean","water",",","better","job",",","rebuild","hous","after","an","earthquak",",","and","fair",",","honest","elect","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","be","a","set","of","interview","with","woman","run","for","Egypt","'s","Parliament","in","November","of","1995",".","after","a","review","of","recent","political","history","-lrb-","from","1920","to","the","institution","of","woman","'s","suffrage","in","1956",",","the","election","of","two","woman","to","Parliament","in","1957",",","the","increase","to","35","female","mp","in","1984",",","and","the","fall","to","10","in","1990","-rrb-",",","about","20","candidate","talk","to","the","camera",":","incumbent","and","newcomer",";","woman","from","the","rule","ndp","party",",","from","minor","party","and","independent",".","this","be","retail","politics",":","meeting","voter","in","small","group",",","hold","store-front","rally",".","the","candidate","have","feminist","view",",","and","they","also","champion","clean","water",",","better","job",",","rebuild","housing","after","a","earthquake",",","and","fair",",","honest","election","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This documentary is","documentary is a","is a set","a set of","set of interviews","of interviews with","interviews with women","with women running","women running for","running for Egypt","for Egypt 's","Egypt 's Parliament","'s Parliament in","Parliament in November","in November of","November of 1995","After a review","a review of","review of recent","of recent political","recent political history","political history (","history ( from","( from 1920","from 1920 to","1920 to the","to the institution","the institution of","institution of women","of women 's","women 's suffrage","'s suffrage in","suffrage in 1956","in 1956 ,","1956 , the",", the election","the election of","election of two","of two women","two women to","women to Parliament","to Parliament in","Parliament in 1957","in 1957 ,","1957 , the",", the increase","the increase to","increase to 35","to 35 female","35 female MPs","female MPs in","MPs in 1984","in 1984 ,","1984 , and",", and the","and the fall","the fall to","fall to 10","to 10 in","10 in 1990","in 1990 )","1990 ) ,",") , about",", about 20","about 20 candidates","20 candidates talk","candidates talk to","talk to the","to the camera","the camera :","camera : incumbents",": incumbents and","incumbents and newcomers","and newcomers ;","newcomers ;

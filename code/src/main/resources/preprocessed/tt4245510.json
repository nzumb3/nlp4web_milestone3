{"title":"Sasurbari Zindabad","plot":"Mrs. Binodini Roy, a renowned industrialist, wants to marry off her elder daughter Rupa to her business partner's son. Rupa is against the marriage and hence she escapes from her house with the help of her father. On the way to one of her uncle's house, a cabbie tries to rob her belongings. But she is saved by a handsome motor-mechanic named Somu. Somu takes her to her uncle's house where he turns out to be one of his acquaintances. Gradually, Rupa and Somu come close to each other. One day they have a heated argument; but it's precisely after this that they realize their love for each other. They make up and even get married secretly without informing Rupa's mother. Soon, on her father's request, Rupa returns home. Her mother refuses to acknowledge her marriage; instead she decides to marry her off to her former match. On the day of her marriage, just when Rupa had given up all hope; Somu makes a dramatic entry to take charge of his 'sasurbari' (in-laws' house). But is it only his love for Rupa that has brought him here; or does Somu have a secret of his own?","genres":["Drama"," Musical"," Family"],"stems":["Mrs.","Binodini","Roy",",","a","renown","industrialist",",","want","to","marri","off","her","elder","daughter","Rupa","to","her","busi","partner","'s","son",".","Rupa","is","against","the","marriag","and","henc","she","escap","from","her","hous","with","the","help","of","her","father",".","On","the","way","to","one","of","her","uncl","'s","hous",",","a","cabbi","tri","to","rob","her","belong",".","But","she","is","save","by","a","handsom","motor-mechan","name","Somu",".","Somu","take","her","to","her","uncl","'s","hous","where","he","turn","out","to","be","one","of","his","acquaint",".","Gradual",",","Rupa","and","Somu","come","close","to","each","other",".","One","day","they","have","a","heat","argument",";","but","it","'s","precis","after","this","that","they","realiz","their","love","for","each","other",".","They","make","up","and","even","get","marri","secret","without","inform","Rupa","'s","mother",".","Soon",",","on","her","father","'s","request",",","Rupa","return","home",".","Her","mother","refus","to","acknowledg","her","marriag",";","instead","she","decid","to","marri","her","off","to","her","former","match",".","On","the","day","of","her","marriag",",","just","when","Rupa","had","given","up","all","hope",";","Somu","make","a","dramat","entri","to","take","charg","of","his","'","sasurbari","'","(","in-law","'","hous",")",".","But","is","it","onli","his","love","for","Rupa","that","has","brought","him","here",";","or","doe","Somu","have","a","secret","of","his","own","?"],"lemmas":["Mrs.","Binodini","Roy",",","a","renowned","industrialist",",","want","to","marry","off","she","elder","daughter","rupa","to","she","business","partner","'s","son",".","Rupa","be","against","the","marriage","and","hence","she","escape","from","she","house","with","the","help","of","she","father",".","on","the","way","to","one","of","she","uncle","'s","house",",","a","cabbie","try","to","rob","she","belongings",".","but","she","be","save","by","a","handsome","motor-mechanic","name","Somu",".","Somu","take","she","to","she","uncle","'s","house","where","he","turn","out","to","be","one","of","he","acquaintance",".","gradually",",","Rupa","and","Somu","come","close","to","each","other",".","one","day","they","have","a","heated","argument",";","but","it","be","precisely","after","this","that","they","realize","they","love","for","each","other",".","they","make","up","and","even","get","marry","secretly","without","inform","Rupa","'s","mother",".","soon",",","on","she","father","'s","request",",","rupa","return","home",".","she","mother","refuse","to","acknowledge","she","marriage",";","instead","she","decide","to","marry","she","off","to","she","former","match",".","on","the","day","of","she","marriage",",","just","when","Rupa","have","give","up","all","hope",";","Somu","make","a","dramatic","entry","to","take","charge","of","he","'","sasurbari","'","-lrb-","in-law","'","house","-rrb-",".","but","be","it","only","he","love","for","Rupa","that","have","bring","he","here",";","or","do","Somu","have","a","secret","of","he","own","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mrs. Binodini Roy","Binodini Roy ,","Roy , a",", a renowned","a renowned industrialist","renowned industrialist ,","industrialist , wants",", wants to","wants to marry","to marry off","marry off her","off her elder","her elder daughter","elder daughter Rupa","daughter Rupa to","Rupa to her","to her business","her business partner","business partner 's","partner 's son","Rupa is against","is against the","against the marriage","the marriage and","marriage and hence","and hence she","hence she escapes","she escapes from","escapes from her","from her house","her house with","house with the","with the help","the help of","help of her","of her father","On the way","the way to","way to one","to one of","one of her","of her uncle","her uncle 's","uncle 's house","'s house ,","house , a",", a cabbie","a cabbie tries","cabbie tries to","tries to rob","to rob her","rob her belongings","But she is","she is saved","is saved by","saved by a","by a handsome","a handsome motor-mechanic","handsome motor-mechanic named","motor-mechanic named Somu","Somu takes her","takes her to","her to her","to her uncle","her uncle 's","uncle 's house","'s house where","house where he","where he turns","he turns out","turns out to","out to be","to be one","be one of","one of his","of his acquaintances","Gradually , Rupa",", Rupa and","Rupa and Somu","and Somu come","Somu come close","come close to","close to each","to each other","One day they","day they have","they have a","have a heated","a heated argument","heated argument ;","argument ;

{"title":"Niger '66: A Peace Corps Diary","plot":"President John F. Kennedy's 1960s-era call for volunteerism was a well-timed mini-revolution in the midst of a burgeoning cultural shift in America. Promising both adventure and grassroots geopolitical action, the Peace Corps offered a channel for young men who wanted nothing of Vietnam and young women who wanted more than the few professional fields offered them. Niger '66 delivers a fascinating first-person account of the inaugural Peace Corps group, many of whom have dedicated their lives to service as a result of their experience. But when filmmaker Judy Irola and members of the first team return to Niger after nearly 40 years, we and they see, first-hand, towns transformed: houses erected, people healthier, child mortality down. With these accomplishments in mind, Obama's renewed push for volunteerism rings with possibilities for us as a nation today.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Presid","John","F.","Kennedi","'s","1960s-era","call","for","volunteer","was","a","well-tim","mini-revolut","in","the","midst","of","a","burgeon","cultur","shift","in","America",".","Promis","both","adventur","and","grassroot","geopolit","action",",","the","Peac","Corp","offer","a","channel","for","young","men","who","want","noth","of","Vietnam","and","young","women","who","want","more","than","the","few","profession","field","offer","them",".","Niger","66","deliv","a","fascin","first-person","account","of","the","inaugur","Peac","Corp","group",",","mani","of","whom","have","dedic","their","live","to","servic","as","a","result","of","their","experi",".","But","when","filmmak","Judi","Irola","and","member","of","the","first","team","return","to","Niger","after","near","40","year",",","we","and","they","see",",","first-hand",",","town","transform",":","hous","erect",",","peopl","healthier",",","child","mortal","down",".","With","these","accomplish","in","mind",",","Obama","'s","renew","push","for","volunteer","ring","with","possibl","for","us","as","a","nation","today","."],"lemmas":["President","John","F.","Kennedy","'s","1960s-era","call","for","volunteerism","be","a","well-timed","mini-revolution","in","the","midst","of","a","burgeon","cultural","shift","in","America",".","promising","both","adventure","and","grassroot","geopolitical","action",",","the","Peace","Corps","offer","a","channel","for","young","man","who","want","nothing","of","Vietnam","and","young","woman","who","want","more","than","the","few","professional","field","offer","they",".","niger","'66","deliver","a","fascinating","first-person","account","of","the","inaugural","Peace","Corps","group",",","many","of","whom","have","dedicate","they","life","to","service","as","a","result","of","they","experience",".","but","when","filmmaker","Judy","Irola","and","member","of","the","first","team","return","to","Niger","after","nearly","40","year",",","we","and","they","see",",","first-hand",",","town","transform",":","house","erect",",","people","healthier",",","child","mortality","down",".","with","these","accomplishment","in","mind",",","Obama","'s","renew","push","for","volunteerism","ring","with","possibility","for","we","as","a","nation","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["President John F.","John F.

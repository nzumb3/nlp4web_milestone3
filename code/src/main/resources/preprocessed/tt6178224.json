{"title":"We Know Care","plot":"Meet Horace and Mabel Gladstone. When they inherit a mansion, they decide to move in, fix it up, and open a business - of sorts. The bad news is that they have no idea what they're doing. The good news is that they find five senior citizens to help them. However, when Horace's cousin Todd rears his sinister head, everything that Horace holds dear may be lost. Will our heroes' hair-brained scheme raise the money they need quickly enough to help them pass the inspection and keep cousin Todd from getting a little piece of the old girl?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Meet","Horac","and","Mabel","Gladston",".","When","they","inherit","a","mansion",",","they","decid","to","move","in",",","fix","it","up",",","and","open","a","busi","-","of","sort",".","The","bad","news","is","that","they","have","no","idea","what","they","re","do",".","The","good","news","is","that","they","find","five","senior","citizen","to","help","them",".","Howev",",","when","Horac","'s","cousin","Todd","rear","his","sinist","head",",","everyth","that","Horac","hold","dear","may","be","lost",".","Will","our","hero","'","hair-brain","scheme","rais","the","money","they","need","quick","enough","to","help","them","pass","the","inspect","and","keep","cousin","Todd","from","get","a","littl","piec","of","the","old","girl","?"],"lemmas":["Meet","Horace","and","Mabel","Gladstone",".","when","they","inherit","a","mansion",",","they","decide","to","move","in",",","fix","it","up",",","and","open","a","business","-","of","sort",".","the","bad","news","be","that","they","have","no","idea","what","they","be","do",".","the","good","news","be","that","they","find","five","senior","citizen","to","help","they",".","however",",","when","Horace","'s","cousin","Todd","rear","he","sinister","head",",","everything","that","Horace","hold","dear","may","be","lose",".","will","we","hero","'","hair-brained","scheme","raise","the","money","they","need","quickly","enough","to","help","they","pass","the","inspection","and","keep","cousin","Todd","from","get","a","little","piece","of","the","old","girl","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Meet Horace and","Horace and Mabel","and Mabel Gladstone","When they inherit","they inherit a","inherit a mansion","a mansion ,","mansion , they",", they decide","they decide to","decide to move","to move in","move in ,","in , fix",", fix it","fix it up","it up ,","up , and",", and open","and open a","open a business","a business -","business - of","- of sorts","The bad news","bad news is","news is that","is that they","that they have","they have no","have no idea","no idea what","idea what they","what they 're","they 're doing","The good news","good news is","news is that","is that they","that they find","they find five","find five senior","five senior citizens","senior citizens to","citizens to help","to help them","However , when",", when Horace","when Horace 's","Horace 's cousin","'s cousin Todd","cousin Todd rears","Todd rears his","rears his sinister","his sinister head","sinister head ,","head , everything",", everything that","everything that Horace","that Horace holds","Horace holds dear","holds dear may","dear may be","may be lost","Will our heroes","our heroes '","heroes ' hair-brained","' hair-brained scheme","hair-brained scheme raise","scheme raise the","raise the money","the money they","money they need","they need quickly","need quickly enough","quickly enough to","enough to help","to help them","help them pass","them pass the","pass the inspection","the inspection and","inspection and keep","and keep cousin","keep cousin Todd","cousin Todd from","Todd from getting","from getting a","getting a little","a little piece","little piece of","piece of the","of the old","the old girl"],"2grams":["Meet Horace","Horace and","and Mabel","Mabel Gladstone","When they","they inherit","inherit a","a mansion","mansion ,",", they","they decide","decide to","to move","move in","in ,",", fix","fix it","it up","up ,",", and","and open","open a","a business","business -","- of","of sorts","The bad","bad news","news is","is that","that they","they have","have no","no idea","idea what","what they","they 're","'re doing","The good","good news","news is","is that","that they","they find","find five","five senior","senior citizens","citizens to","to help","help them","However ,",", when","when Horace","Horace 's","'s cousin","cousin Todd","Todd rears","rears his","his sinister","sinister head","head ,",", everything","everything that","that Horace","Horace holds","holds dear","dear may","may be","be lost","Will our","our heroes","heroes '","' hair-brained","hair-brained scheme","scheme raise","raise the","the money","money they","they need","need quickly","quickly enough","enough to","to help","help them","them pass","pass the","the inspection","inspection and","and keep","keep cousin","cousin Todd","Todd from","from getting","getting a","a little","little piece","piece of","of the","the old","old girl"]}

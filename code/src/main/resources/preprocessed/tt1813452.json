{"title":"Leave It on the Stage","plot":"Winning the top award at a national competition might seem like the highest possible achievement for the Amazing Technicolor Show Choir. As the next year unfolds, though, this Omaha show choir continues to pursue excellence in singing and dancing. They start out the year as a group of talented individuals, but they have quite a distance to go to be their best as a group. From auditions through the competition season, the 46 students of ATSC push the limits of performance as they figure out what it means to leave it on the stage.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["Win","the","top","award","at","a","nation","competit","might","seem","like","the","highest","possibl","achiev","for","the","Amaze","Technicolor","Show","Choir",".","As","the","next","year","unfold",",","though",",","this","Omaha","show","choir","continu","to","pursu","excel","in","sing","and","danc",".","They","start","out","the","year","as","a","group","of","talent","individu",",","but","they","have","quit","a","distanc","to","go","to","be","their","best","as","a","group",".","From","audit","through","the","competit","season",",","the","46","student","of","ATSC","push","the","limit","of","perform","as","they","figur","out","what","it","mean","to","leav","it","on","the","stage","."],"lemmas":["win","the","top","award","at","a","national","competition","might","seem","like","the","highest","possible","achievement","for","the","amazing","Technicolor","Show","Choir",".","as","the","next","year","unfold",",","though",",","this","Omaha","show","choir","continue","to","pursue","excellence","in","singing","and","dancing",".","they","start","out","the","year","as","a","group","of","talented","individual",",","but","they","have","quite","a","distance","to","go","to","be","they","best","as","a","group",".","from","audition","through","the","competition","season",",","the","46","student","of","ATSC","push","the","limit","of","performance","as","they","figure","out","what","it","mean","to","leave","it","on","the","stage","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Winning the top","the top award","top award at","award at a","at a national","a national competition","national competition might","competition might seem","might seem like","seem like the","like the highest","the highest possible","highest possible achievement","possible achievement for","achievement for the","for the Amazing","the Amazing Technicolor","Amazing Technicolor Show","Technicolor Show Choir","As the next","the next year","next year unfolds","year unfolds ,","unfolds , though",", though ,","though , this",", this Omaha","this Omaha show","Omaha show choir","show choir continues","choir continues to","continues to pursue","to pursue excellence","pursue excellence in","excellence in singing","in singing and","singing and dancing","They start out","start out the","out the year","the year as","year as a","as a group","a group of","group of talented","of talented individuals","talented individuals ,","individuals , but",", but they","but they have","they have quite","have quite a","quite a distance","a distance to","distance to go","to go to","go to be","to be their","be their best","their best as","best as a","as a group","From auditions through","auditions through the","through the competition","the competition season","competition season ,","season , the",", the 46","the 46 students","46 students of","students of ATSC","of ATSC push","ATSC push the","push the limits","the limits of","limits of performance","of performance as","performance as they","as they figure","they figure out","figure out what","out what it","what it means","it means to","means to leave","to leave it","leave it on","it on the","on the stage"],"2grams":["Winning the","the top","top award","award at","at a","a national","national competition","competition might","might seem","seem like","like the","the highest","highest possible","possible achievement","achievement for","for the","the Amazing","Amazing Technicolor","Technicolor Show","Show Choir","As the","the next","next year","year unfolds","unfolds ,",", though","though ,",", this","this Omaha","Omaha show","show choir","choir continues","continues to","to pursue","pursue excellence","excellence in","in singing","singing and","and dancing","They start","start out","out the","the year","year as","as a","a group","group of","of talented","talented individuals","individuals ,",", but","but they","they have","have quite","quite a","a distance","distance to","to go","go to","to be","be their","their best","best as","as a","a group","From auditions","auditions through","through the","the competition","competition season","season ,",", the","the 46","46 students","students of","of ATSC","ATSC push","push the","the limits","limits of","of performance","performance as","as they","they figure","figure out","out what","what it","it means","means to","to leave","leave it","it on","on the","the stage"]}

{"title":"Hanako","plot":"Imamura Hanako is a 22-year-old girl with severe autism. Once a week she attends a painting class, where she paints pictures in oils. Every evening after dinner, she creates what her mother Chisa has named \"food art.\" This may only involve arranging the leftovers from the day's meal on the floor or a tray, but Chisa records the works every day, accumulating some thousands of photographs. The collection of photographs has now been exhibited around the country. Following Hanako's daily life in the routine of the four members of the Imamura family, we watch as a portrait of a \"very ordinary\" family unfold.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Imamura","Hanako","is","a","22-year-old","girl","with","sever","autism",".","Once","a","week","she","attend","a","paint","class",",","where","she","paint","pictur","in","oil",".","Everi","even","after","dinner",",","she","creat","what","her","mother","Chisa","has","name","\"","food","art",".","\"","This","may","onli","involv","arrang","the","leftov","from","the","day","'s","meal","on","the","floor","or","a","tray",",","but","Chisa","record","the","work","everi","day",",","accumul","some","thousand","of","photograph",".","The","collect","of","photograph","has","now","been","exhibit","around","the","countri",".","Follow","Hanako","'s","daili","life","in","the","routin","of","the","four","member","of","the","Imamura","famili",",","we","watch","as","a","portrait","of","a","\"","veri","ordinari","\"","famili","unfold","."],"lemmas":["Imamura","Hanako","be","a","22-year-old","girl","with","severe","autism",".","once","a","week","she","attend","a","painting","class",",","where","she","paint","picture","in","oils",".","every","evening","after","dinner",",","she","create","what","she","mother","Chisa","have","name","``","food","art",".","''","this","may","only","involve","arrange","the","leftovers","from","the","day","'s","meal","on","the","floor","or","a","tray",",","but","Chisa","record","the","work","every","day",",","accumulate","some","thousand","of","photograph",".","the","collection","of","photograph","have","now","be","exhibit","around","the","country",".","follow","Hanako","'s","daily","life","in","the","routine","of","the","four","member","of","the","Imamura","family",",","we","watch","as","a","portrait","of","a","``","very","ordinary","''","family","unfold","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Imamura

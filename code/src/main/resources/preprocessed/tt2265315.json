{"title":"Garifuna in Peril","plot":"A Garifuna language teacher, Ricardo, struggles to preserve his endangered Afro-Amerindian culture by building a language school back in his home village in Honduras, Central America. A business venture with his brother designed to raise money for the school's construction becomes complicated by the expansion plans of a nearby tourist resort into indigenous territory. Historical parallels are invoked as Ricardo's son rehearses a stage play about the Garifuna people's last stand against British colonialism over 200 years ago in their motherland, the island of St. Vincent in the Caribbean. Naturalistically shot, with debut performances by nearly the entire cast, \"Garifuna in Peril\" makes its own history as the first feature film with the majority of dialogue in Garifuna, a language proclaimed by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","Garifuna","languag","teacher",",","Ricardo",",","struggl","to","preserv","his","endang","Afro-Amerindian","cultur","by","build","a","languag","school","back","in","his","home","villag","in","Hondura",",","Central","America",".","A","busi","ventur","with","his","brother","design","to","rais","money","for","the","school","'s","construct","becom","complic","by","the","expans","plan","of","a","nearbi","tourist","resort","into","indigen","territori",".","Histor","parallel","are","invok","as","Ricardo","'s","son","rehears","a","stage","play","about","the","Garifuna","peopl","'s","last","stand","against","British","coloni","over","200","year","ago","in","their","motherland",",","the","island","of","St.","Vincent","in","the","Caribbean",".","Naturalist","shot",",","with","debut","perform","by","near","the","entir","cast",",","\"","Garifuna","in","Peril","\"","make","it","own","histori","as","the","first","featur","film","with","the","major","of","dialogu","in","Garifuna",",","a","languag","proclaim","by","UNESCO","as","a","Masterpiec","of","the","Oral","and","Intangibl","Heritag","of","Human","."],"lemmas":["a","Garifuna","language","teacher",",","Ricardo",",","struggle","to","preserve","he","endangered","afro-amerindian","culture","by","build","a","language","school","back","in","he","home","village","in","Honduras",",","Central","America",".","a","business","venture","with","he","brother","design","to","raise","money","for","the","school","'s","construction","become","complicate","by","the","expansion","plan","of","a","nearby","tourist","resort","into","indigenous","territory",".","historical","parallel","be","invoke","as","Ricardo","'s","son","rehearse","a","stage","play","about","the","Garifuna","people","'s","last","stand","against","british","colonialism","over","200","year","ago","in","they","motherland",",","the","island","of","St.","Vincent","in","the","Caribbean",".","naturalistically","shoot",",","with","debut","performance","by","nearly","the","entire","cast",",","``","Garifuna","in","Peril","''","make","its","own","history","as","the","first","feature","film","with","the","majority","of","dialogue","in","Garifuna",",","a","language","proclaim","by","UNESCO","as","a","Masterpiece","of","the","Oral","and","Intangible","Heritage","of","Humanity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A

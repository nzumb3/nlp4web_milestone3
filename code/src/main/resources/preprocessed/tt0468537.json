grassroots democracy in action, democracy under duress in a country still controlled by the authoritarian right-wing party, ARENA.resistance presents salvadoran grassroots popular organization as an alternative to electoral politics, dominated by corporate money and u.s. influence. resistance also examines the economic battlefield, as the 1990's brought a change from a military war to an economic one in the form of neoliberalism, privatization, and structural adjustment programs.includes interviews with howard zinn and vandana shiva, as well as workers, campesinos, and community members most dramatically affected by the neoliberal model.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Resist","as","democraci",",","activ8media","'s","first","documentari","product",",","examin","el","salvador","after","the","revolutionari","war","of","the","1980","'s",".","resist","explor","grassroot","democraci","in","action",",","democraci","under","duress","in","a","countri","still","control","by","the","authoritarian","right-w","parti",",","ARENA.resist","present","salvadoran","grassroot","popular","organ","as","an","altern","to","elector","polit",",","domin","by","corpor","money","and","u.s.","influenc",".","resist","also","examin","the","econom","battlefield",",","as","the","1990","'s","brought","a","chang","from","a","militari","war","to","an","econom","one","in","the","form","of","neoliber",",","privat",",","and","structur","adjust","programs.includ","interview","with","howard","zinn","and","vandana","shiva",",","as","well","as","worker",",","campesino",",","and","communiti","member","most","dramat","affect","by","the","neoliber","model","."],"lemmas":["resistance","as","democracy",",","activ8media","'s","first","documentary","production",",","examine","el","salvador","after","the","revolutionary","war","of","the","1980","'s",".","resistance","explore","grassroot","democracy","in","action",",","democracy","under","duress","in","a","country","still","control","by","the","authoritarian","right-wing","party",",","arena.resistance","present","salvadoran","grassroot","popular","organization","as","a","alternative","to","electoral","politics",",","dominate","by","corporate","money","and","u.s.","influence",".","resistance","also","examine","the","economic","battlefield",",","as","the","1990","'s","bring","a","change","from","a","military","war","to","a","economic","one","in","the","form","of","neoliberalism",",","privatization",",","and","structural","adjustment","programs.includes","interview","with","howard","zinn","and","vandana","shiva",",","as","well","as","worker",",","campesino",",","and","community","member","most","dramatically","affect","by","the","neoliberal","model","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Resistance

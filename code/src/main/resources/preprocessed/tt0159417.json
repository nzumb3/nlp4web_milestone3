{"title":"Edgar's Lunch","plot":"L.R. Brane loves his life - his car, his apartment, his job, but especially his girlfriend, Vespa. One day while showering, Vespa runs out of shampoo. L.R. runs across the street to a convenience store to buy some more, a quick trip of no more than a few minutes. When he returns, Vespa is gone and every trace of her existence has been wiped out. L.R.'s life becomes a tortured existence as one strange event after another occurs to confirm in his mind that a conspiracy is working against his finding Vespa.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["L.R.","Brane","love","his","life","-","his","car",",","his","apart",",","his","job",",","but","especi","his","girlfriend",",","Vespa",".","One","day","while","shower",",","Vespa","run","out","of","shampoo",".","L.R.","run","across","the","street","to","a","conveni","store","to","buy","some","more",",","a","quick","trip","of","no","more","than","a","few","minut",".","When","he","return",",","Vespa","is","gone","and","everi","trace","of","her","exist","has","been","wipe","out",".","L.R.","'s","life","becom","a","tortur","exist","as","one","strang","event","after","anoth","occur","to","confirm","in","his","mind","that","a","conspiraci","is","work","against","his","find","Vespa","."],"lemmas":["L.R.","Brane","love","he","life","-","he","car",",","he","apartment",",","he","job",",","but","especially","he","girlfriend",",","Vespa",".","one","day","while","shower",",","Vespa","run","out","of","shampoo",".","L.R.","run","across","the","street","to","a","convenience","store","to","buy","some","more",",","a","quick","trip","of","no","more","than","a","few","minute",".","when","he","return",",","Vespa","be","go","and","every","trace","of","she","existence","have","be","wipe","out",".","L.R.","'s","life","become","a","tortured","existence","as","one","strange","event","after","another","occur","to","confirm","in","he","mind","that","a","conspiracy","be","work","against","he","finding","Vespa","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["L.R.

{"title":"Een handvol bijen","plot":"It is early spring; a beekeeper opens one of his hives. Except for a handful of dead honeybees, the box is empty. Since 2002 bee mortality rates have doubled all over the Northern hemisphere. 'Handful of bees' shows three Dutch beekeepers who try to prevent the bees from becoming extinct. One tries to achieve this through research, the other through selection for resistance to varroa mites and the third through organic beekeeping. An observational documentary containing intriguing images of bees in the hive, in the open air and during artificial insemination, about the relationship between bees and mans desire to control nature.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["It","is","earli","spring",";","a","beekeep","open","one","of","his","hive",".","Except","for","a","hand","of","dead","honeybe",",","the","box","is","empti",".","Sinc","2002","bee","mortal","rate","have","doubl","all","over","the","Northern","hemispher",".","'","Hand","of","bee","'","show","three","Dutch","beekeep","who","tri","to","prevent","the","bee","from","becom","extinct",".","One","tri","to","achiev","this","through","research",",","the","other","through","select","for","resist","to","varroa","mite","and","the","third","through","organ","beekeep",".","An","observ","documentari","contain","intrigu","imag","of","bee","in","the","hive",",","in","the","open","air","and","dure","artifici","insemin",",","about","the","relationship","between","bee","and","man","desir","to","control","natur","."],"lemmas":["it","be","early","spring",";","a","beekeeper","open","one","of","he","hive",".","except","for","a","handful","of","dead","honeybee",",","the","box","be","empty",".","since","2002","bee","mortality","rate","have","double","all","over","the","Northern","hemisphere",".","'","handful","of","bee","'","show","three","Dutch","beekeeper","who","try","to","prevent","the","bee","from","become","extinct",".","one","try","to","achieve","this","through","research",",","the","other","through","selection","for","resistance","to","varroa","mite","and","the","third","through","organic","beekeeping",".","a","observational","documentary","contain","intriguing","image","of","bee","in","the","hive",",","in","the","open","air","and","during","artificial","insemination",",","about","the","relationship","between","bee","and","man","desire","to","control","nature","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["It is early","is early spring","early spring ;","spring ; a","; a beekeeper","a beekeeper opens","beekeeper opens one","opens one of","one of his","of his hives","Except for a","for a handful","a handful of","handful of dead","of dead honeybees","dead honeybees ,","honeybees , the",", the box","the box is","box is empty","Since 2002 bee","2002 bee mortality","bee mortality rates","mortality rates have","rates have doubled","have doubled all","doubled all over","all over the","over the Northern","the Northern hemisphere","Northern hemisphere .","hemisphere .

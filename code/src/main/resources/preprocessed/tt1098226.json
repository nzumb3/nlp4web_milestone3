{"title":"Adrift in Tokyo","plot":"Takemura has no friends and no family. He's a student but he doesn't have any particular ambitions. In other words, he isn't going anywhere fast. Were all this not enough, the sorry sad sack has a debt of 800,000 yen. Fukuhara, a surly debt collector with a glorious mullet, is on his case. After roughing Takemura up, he gives him an ultimatum-72 hours to pay up, or else. Takemura barely has his wits about him again when he runs across Fukuhara a second time, and this time the thug has a different proposal-a walk. That's right, in exchange for a million yen, Takemura must accompany Fukuhara on a walk across the city of Tokyo. Starting in a distant corner of the city, they begin their trek towards downtown, striking up a conversation. It's at this point that Fukuhara admits that he's recently killed his wife, and intends to turn himself in at Kasumagaseki police station-because, he says, it's the finest in town. The pair's itinerary, however, is hardly a quick and direct one. The disparate duo drift here and there, hanging out and coming across a host of eccentric personalities, creatures of the urban jungle's various habitats. As their walking, talking and trading truths continues, the arrangement between Takemura and Fukuhara starts to transform into friendship.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Takemura","has","no","friend","and","no","famili",".","He","'s","a","student","but","he","doe","n't","have","ani","particular","ambit",".","In","other","word",",","he","is","n't","go","anywher","fast",".","Were","all","this","not","enough",",","the","sorri","sad","sack","has","a","debt","of","800,000","yen",".","Fukuhara",",","a","sur","debt","collector","with","a","glorious","mullet",",","is","on","his","case",".","After","rough","Takemura","up",",","he","give","him","an","ultimatum-72","hour","to","pay","up",",","or","els",".","Takemura","bare","has","his","wit","about","him","again","when","he","run","across","Fukuhara","a","second","time",",","and","this","time","the","thug","has","a","differ","proposal-a","walk",".","That","'s","right",",","in","exchang","for","a","million","yen",",","Takemura","must","accompani","Fukuhara","on","a","walk","across","the","citi","of","Tokyo",".","Start","in","a","distant","corner","of","the","citi",",","they","begin","their","trek","toward","downtown",",","strike","up","a","convers",".","It","'s","at","this","point","that","Fukuhara","admit","that","he","'s","recent","kill","his","wife",",","and","intend","to","turn","himself","in","at","Kasumagaseki","polic","station-becaus",",","he","say",",","it","'s","the","finest","in","town",".","The","pair","'s","itinerari",",","howev",",","is","hard","a","quick","and","direct","one",".","The","dispar","duo","drift","here","and","there",",","hang","out","and","come","across","a","host","of","eccentr","person",",","creatur","of","the","urban","jungl","'s","various","habitat",".","As","their","walk",",","talk","and","trade","truth","continu",",","the","arrang","between","Takemura","and","Fukuhara","start","to","transform","into","friendship","."],"lemmas":["Takemura","have","no","friend","and","no","family",".","he","be","a","student","but","he","do","not","have","any","particular","ambition",".","in","other","word",",","he","be","not","go","anywhere","fast",".","be","all","this","not","enough",",","the","sorry","sad","sack","have","a","debt","of","800,000","yen",".","Fukuhara",",","a","surly","debt","collector","with","a","glorious","mullet",",","be","on","he","case",".","after","rough","Takemura","up",",","he","give","he","a","ultimatum-72","hour","to","pay","up",",","or","else",".","Takemura","barely","have","he","wit","about","he","again","when","he","run","across","Fukuhara","a","second","time",",","and","this","time","the","thug","have","a","different","proposal-a","walk",".","that","be","right",",","in","exchange","for","a","million","yen",",","Takemura","must","accompany","Fukuhara","on","a","walk","across","the","city","of","Tokyo",".","start","in","a","distant","corner","of","the","city",",","they","begin","they","trek","towards","downtown",",","strike","up","a","conversation",".","it","be","at","this","point","that","Fukuhara","admit","that","he","be","recently","kill","he","wife",",","and","intend","to","turn","himself","in","at","Kasumagaseki","police","station-because",",","he","say",",","it","be","the","finest","in","town",".","the","pair","'s","itinerary",",","however",",","be","hardly","a","quick","and","direct","one",".","the","disparate","duo","drift","here","and","there",",","hang","out","and","come","across","a","host","of","eccentric","personality",",","creature","of","the","urban","jungle","'s","various","habitat",".","as","they","walking",",","talking","and","trading","truth","continue",",","the","arrangement","between","Takemura","and","Fukuhara","start","to","transform","into","friendship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Takemura

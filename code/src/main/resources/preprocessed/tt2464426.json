{"title":"Rebels: James Meredith and the Integration of Ole Miss","plot":"On October 1, 1962 James Meredith became the first black student enrolled at the University of Mississippi. His journey to Ole Miss began with the state of Mississippi's denial and open defiance of the federal court's mandate of his admission. It ended on the night of September 30th as thousands of armed protesters rioted against the U.S. Marshals, Mississippi National Guard, and U.S. troops sent by President Kennedy. This is the incredible true story of one man's mission for equality and a state that would do everything in its power to stop him.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","October","1",",","1962","Jame","Meredith","becam","the","first","black","student","enrol","at","the","Univers","of","Mississippi",".","His","journey","to","Ole","Miss","began","with","the","state","of","Mississippi","'s","denial","and","open","defianc","of","the","feder","court","'s","mandat","of","his","admiss",".","It","end","on","the","night","of","Septemb","30th","as","thousand","of","arm","protest","riot","against","the","U.S.","Marshal",",","Mississippi","Nation","Guard",",","and","U.S.","troop","sent","by","Presid","Kennedi",".","This","is","the","incred","true","stori","of","one","man","'s","mission","for","equal","and","a","state","that","would","do","everyth","in","it","power","to","stop","him","."],"lemmas":["on","October","1",",","1962","James","Meredith","become","the","first","black","student","enrol","at","the","University","of","Mississippi",".","he","journey","to","ole","Miss","begin","with","the","state","of","Mississippi","'s","denial","and","open","defiance","of","the","federal","court","'s","mandate","of","he","admission",".","it","end","on","the","night","of","September","30th","as","thousand","of","armed","protester","riot","against","the","U.S.","Marshals",",","Mississippi","National","Guard",",","and","U.S.","troops","send","by","President","Kennedy",".","this","be","the","incredible","true","story","of","one","man","'s","mission","for","equality","and","a","state","that","would","do","everything","in","its","power","to","stop","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["On October 1","October 1 ,","1 , 1962",", 1962 James","1962 James Meredith","James Meredith became","Meredith became the","became the first","the first black","first black student","black student enrolled","student enrolled at","enrolled at the","at the University","the University of","University of Mississippi","His journey to","journey to Ole","to Ole Miss","Ole Miss began","Miss began with","began with the","with the state","the state of","state of Mississippi","of Mississippi 's","Mississippi 's denial","'s denial and","denial and open","and open defiance","open defiance of","defiance of the","of the federal","the federal court","federal court 's","court 's mandate","'s mandate of","mandate of his","of his admission","It ended on","ended on the","on the night","the night of","night of September","of September 30th","September 30th as","30th as thousands","as thousands of","thousands of armed","of armed protesters","armed protesters rioted","protesters rioted against","rioted against the","against the U.S.","the U.S. Marshals","U.S. Marshals ,","Marshals , Mississippi",", Mississippi National","Mississippi National Guard","National Guard ,","Guard , and",", and U.S.","and U.S. troops","U.S. troops sent","troops sent by","sent by President","by President Kennedy","This is the","is the incredible","the incredible true","incredible true story","true story of","story of one","of one man","one man 's","man 's mission","'s mission for","mission for equality","for equality and","equality and a","and a state","a state that","state that would","that would do","would do everything","do everything in","everything in its","in its power","its power to","power to stop","to stop him"],"2grams":["On October","October 1","1 ,",", 1962","1962 James","James Meredith","Meredith became","became the","the first","first black","black student","student enrolled","enrolled at","at the","the University","University of","of Mississippi","His journey","journey to","to Ole","Ole Miss","Miss began","began with","with the","the state","state of","of Mississippi","Mississippi 's","'s denial","denial and","and open","open defiance","defiance of","of the","the federal","federal court","court 's","'s mandate","mandate of","of his","his admission","It ended","ended on","on the","the night","night of","of September","September 30th","30th as","as thousands","thousands of","of armed","armed protesters","protesters rioted","rioted against","against the","the U.S.","U.S. Marshals","Marshals ,",", Mississippi","Mississippi National","National Guard","Guard ,",", and","and U.S.","U.S. troops","troops sent","sent by","by President","President Kennedy","This is","is the","the incredible","incredible true","true story","story of","of one","one man","man 's","'s mission","mission for","for equality","equality and","and a","a state","state that","that would","would do","do everything","everything in","in its","its power","power to","to stop","stop him"]}

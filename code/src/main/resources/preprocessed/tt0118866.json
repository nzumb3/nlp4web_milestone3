This sets the scene for her (mis)adventures with the other \"corporate orphans\", Margaret, Paula and Jane. Led by Margaret, they find subtle ways to lessen the ennui of corporate oppression. The tension escalates when the new permanent hire, Cleo, enters the picture.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Iris","can","best","be","describ","as","a","wallflow",".","She","begin","her","first","day","as","a","temp","for","the","nondescript","Global","Credit","Associat","by","wait","in","a","chair","for","two","hour",".","This","set","the","scene","for","her","(","mis",")","adventur","with","the","other","\"","corpor","orphan","\"",",","Margaret",",","Paula","and","Jane",".","Led","by","Margaret",",","they","find","subtl","way","to","lessen","the","ennui","of","corpor","oppress",".","The","tension","escal","when","the","new","perman","hire",",","Cleo",",","enter","the","pictur","."],"lemmas":["Iris","can","best","be","describe","as","a","wallflower",".","she","begin","she","first","day","as","a","temp","for","the","nondescript","Global","Credit","Association","by","wait","in","a","chair","for","two","hour",".","this","set","the","scene","for","she","-lrb-","mis","-rrb-","adventure","with","the","other","``","corporate","orphan","''",",","Margaret",",","Paula","and","Jane",".","lead","by","Margaret",",","they","find","subtle","way","to","lessen","the","ennui","of","corporate","oppression",".","the","tension","escalate","when","the","new","permanent","hire",",","Cleo",",","enter","the","picture","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Iris can best","can best be","best be described","be described as","described as a","as a wallflower","She begins her","begins her first","her first day","first day as","day as a","as a temp","a temp for","temp for the","for the nondescript","the nondescript Global","nondescript Global Credit","Global Credit Association","Credit Association by","Association by waiting","by waiting in","waiting in a","in a chair","a chair for","chair for two","for two hours","This sets the","sets the scene","the scene for","scene for her","for her (","her ( mis","( mis )","mis ) adventures",") adventures with","adventures with the","with the other","the other \"","other \" corporate","\" corporate orphans","corporate orphans \"","orphans \" ,","\" , Margaret",", Margaret ,","Margaret , Paula",", Paula and","Paula and Jane","Led by Margaret","by Margaret ,","Margaret , they",", they find","they find subtle","find subtle ways","subtle ways to","ways to lessen","to lessen the","lessen the ennui","the ennui of","ennui of corporate","of corporate oppression","The tension escalates","tension escalates when","escalates when the","when the new","the new permanent","new permanent hire","permanent hire ,","hire , Cleo",", Cleo ,","Cleo , enters",", enters the","enters the picture"],"2grams":["Iris can","can best","best be","be described","described as","as a","a wallflower","She begins","begins her","her first","first day","day as","as a","a temp","temp for","for the","the nondescript","nondescript Global","Global Credit","Credit Association","Association by","by waiting","waiting in","in a","a chair","chair for","for two","two hours","This sets","sets the","the scene","scene for","for her","her (","( mis","mis )",") adventures","adventures with","with the","the other","other \"","\" corporate","corporate orphans","orphans \"","\" ,",", Margaret","Margaret ,",", Paula","Paula and","and Jane","Led by","by Margaret","Margaret ,",", they","they find","find subtle","subtle ways","ways to","to lessen","lessen the","the ennui","ennui of","of corporate","corporate oppression","The tension","tension escalates","escalates when","when the","the new","new permanent","permanent hire","hire ,",", Cleo","Cleo ,",", enters","enters the","the picture"]}

{"title":"Mea Maxima Culpa: Silence in the House of God","plot":"Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex Gibney exposes the abuse of power in the Catholic Church and a cover-up that winds its way from the row houses of Milwaukee Wisconsin, through the bare ruined choirs of Ireland's churches all the way to the highest office of the Vatican. By investigating the secret crimes of a charismatic priest who abused over 200 deaf children in a school under his control - the film shows the face of evil that lurks behind the smiles and denials of authority figures and institutions who believe that because they stand for good they can do no wrong.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Oscar-win","filmmak","Alex","Gibney","expos","the","abus","of","power","in","the","Cathol","Church","and","a","cover-up","that","wind","it","way","from","the","row","hous","of","Milwauke","Wisconsin",",","through","the","bare","ruin","choir","of","Ireland","'s","church","all","the","way","to","the","highest","offic","of","the","Vatican",".","By","investig","the","secret","crime","of","a","charismat","priest","who","abus","over","200","deaf","children","in","a","school","under","his","control","-","the","film","show","the","face","of","evil","that","lurk","behind","the","smile","and","denial","of","author","figur","and","institut","who","believ","that","becaus","they","stand","for","good","they","can","do","no","wrong","."],"lemmas":["oscar-winning","filmmaker","Alex","Gibney","expose","the","abuse","of","power","in","the","Catholic","Church","and","a","cover-up","that","wind","its","way","from","the","row","house","of","Milwaukee","Wisconsin",",","through","the","bare","ruin","choir","of","Ireland","'s","church","all","the","way","to","the","highest","office","of","the","Vatican",".","by","investigate","the","secret","crime","of","a","charismatic","priest","who","abuse","over","200","deaf","child","in","a","school","under","he","control","-","the","film","show","the","face","of","evil","that","lurk","behind","the","smile","and","denial","of","authority","figure","and","institution","who","believe","that","because","they","stand","for","good","they","can","do","no","wrong","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Oscar-winning filmmaker Alex","filmmaker Alex Gibney","Alex Gibney exposes","Gibney exposes the","exposes the abuse","the abuse of","abuse of power","of power in","power in the","in the Catholic","the Catholic Church","Catholic Church and","Church and a","and a cover-up","a cover-up that","cover-up that winds","that winds its","winds its way","its way from","way from the","from the row","the row houses","row houses of","houses of Milwaukee","of Milwaukee Wisconsin","Milwaukee Wisconsin ,","Wisconsin , through",", through the","through the bare","the bare ruined","bare ruined choirs","ruined choirs of","choirs of Ireland","of Ireland 's","Ireland 's churches","'s churches all","churches all the","all the way","the way to","way to the","to the highest","the highest office","highest office of","office of the","of the Vatican","By investigating the","investigating the secret","the secret crimes","secret crimes of","crimes of a","of a charismatic","a charismatic priest","charismatic priest who","priest who abused","who abused over","abused over 200","over 200 deaf","200 deaf children","deaf children in","children in a","in a school","a school under","school under his","under his control","his control -","control -

{"title":"Wacky Man: The Rise of a Puppeteer","plot":"Every puppet has a human. The first word Zach Woliner ever spoke was 'Ernie,' the name of the orange half of the famous Sesame Street duo Bert and Ernie. Over the next three decades, his childhood affinity for the Muppets would become a lifelong passion, a hobby, and--if Zach has his way--a career. In 2008, Zach created his own puppet, Wally Wackiman, a Jewish, self-aware character who advocates puppet freedom and equality with humans. Since then, Zach has struggled to balance his art with daily life and turn his aspiration into action. Wacky Man: The Rise of a Puppeteer is a feature-length documentary from director Anthony Desiato (My Comic Shop DocumentARy, By Spoon!) following Zach as he pursues a career in the puppetry industry.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["Everi","puppet","has","a","human",".","The","first","word","Zach","Wolin","ever","spoke","was","'","Ernie",",","'","the","name","of","the","orang","half","of","the","famous","Sesam","Street","duo","Bert","and","Ernie",".","Over","the","next","three","decad",",","his","childhood","affin","for","the","Muppet","would","becom","a","lifelong","passion",",","a","hobbi",",","and","--","if","Zach","has","his","way","--","a","career",".","In","2008",",","Zach","creat","his","own","puppet",",","Walli","Wackiman",",","a","Jewish",",","self-awar","charact","who","advoc","puppet","freedom","and","equal","with","human",".","Sinc","then",",","Zach","has","struggl","to","balanc","his","art","with","daili","life","and","turn","his","aspir","into","action",".","Wacki","Man",":","The","Rise","of","a","Puppet","is","a","feature-length","documentari","from","director","Anthoni","Desiato","(","My","Comic","Shop","DocumentARi",",","By","Spoon","!",")","follow","Zach","as","he","pursu","a","career","in","the","puppetri","industri","."],"lemmas":["every","puppet","have","a","human",".","the","first","word","Zach","Woliner","ever","speak","be","'","Ernie",",","'","the","name","of","the","orange","half","of","the","famous","Sesame","Street","duo","Bert","and","Ernie",".","over","the","next","three","decade",",","he","childhood","affinity","for","the","Muppets","would","become","a","lifelong","passion",",","a","hobby",",","and","--","if","Zach","have","he","way","--","a","career",".","in","2008",",","Zach","create","he","own","puppet",",","Wally","Wackiman",",","a","Jewish",",","self-aware","character","who","advocate","puppet","freedom","and","equality","with","human",".","since","then",",","Zach","have","struggle","to","balance","he","art","with","daily","life","and","turn","he","aspiration","into","action",".","wacky","man",":","the","rise","of","a","Puppeteer","be","a","feature-length","documentary","from","director","Anthony","Desiato","-lrb-","My","Comic","Shop","DocumentARy",",","by","Spoon","!","-rrb-","follow","Zach","as","he","pursue","a","career","in","the","puppetry","industry","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Every puppet has","puppet has a","has a human","The first word","first word Zach","word Zach Woliner","Zach Woliner ever","Woliner ever spoke","ever spoke was","spoke was '","was ' Ernie","' Ernie ,","Ernie , '",", ' the","' the name","the name of","name of the","of the orange","the orange half","orange half of","half of the","of the famous","the famous Sesame","famous Sesame Street","Sesame Street duo","Street duo Bert","duo Bert and","Bert and Ernie","Over the next","the next three","next three decades","three decades ,","decades , his",", his childhood","his childhood affinity","childhood affinity for","affinity for the","for the Muppets","the Muppets would","Muppets would become","would become a","become a lifelong","a lifelong passion","lifelong passion ,","passion , a",", a hobby","a hobby ,","hobby , and",", and --","and -- if","-- if Zach","if Zach has","Zach has his","has his way","his way --","way -- a","-- a career","In 2008 ,","2008 , Zach",", Zach created","Zach created his","created his own","his own puppet","own puppet ,","puppet , Wally",", Wally Wackiman","Wally Wackiman ,","Wackiman , a",", a Jewish","a Jewish ,","Jewish , self-aware",", self-aware character","self-aware character who","character who advocates","who advocates puppet","advocates puppet freedom","puppet freedom and","freedom and equality","and equality with","equality with humans","Since then ,","then , Zach",", Zach has","Zach has struggled","has struggled to","struggled to balance","to balance his","balance his art","his art with","art with daily","with daily life","daily life and","life and turn","and turn his","turn his aspiration","his aspiration into","aspiration into action","Wacky Man :","Man : The",": The Rise","The Rise of","Rise of a","of a Puppeteer","a Puppeteer is","Puppeteer is a","is a feature-length","a feature-length documentary","feature-length documentary from","documentary from director","from director Anthony","director Anthony Desiato","Anthony Desiato (","Desiato ( My","( My Comic","My Comic Shop","Comic Shop DocumentARy","Shop DocumentARy ,","DocumentARy , By",", By Spoon","By Spoon !","Spoon !

{"title":"Elaine Stritch: Shoot Me","plot":"What does it mean to be a performing artist - first, last and always? Broadway legend Elaine Stritch can answer that. At 87, Stritch is still here, dominating the stage in her one woman cabaret act, torturing Alec Baldwin on 30ROCK, giving us her take on aging, her struggle with alcohol and diabetes, and the fear of leaving the follow spot behind. In stolen moments from her corner room at the Carlyle, and on breaks from her tour and work, candid reflections about her life are punctuated with rare archival footage, words from friends (Hal Prince, George C. Wolfe, Nathan Lane, Cherry Jones and John Turturro) and photographs from her personal collection. By turns bold, hilarious and achingly poignant, the journey connects Stritch's present to her past, and an inspiring portrait of a one-of-a-kind survivor emerges.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["What","doe","it","mean","to","be","a","perform","artist","-","first",",","last","and","alway","?","Broadway","legend","Elain","Stritch","can","answer","that",".","At","87",",","Stritch","is","still","here",",","domin","the","stage","in","her","one","woman","cabaret","act",",","tortur","Alec","Baldwin","on","30ROCK",",","give","us","her","take","on","age",",","her","struggl","with","alcohol","and","diabet",",","and","the","fear","of","leav","the","follow","spot","behind",".","In","stolen","moment","from","her","corner","room","at","the","Carlyl",",","and","on","break","from","her","tour","and","work",",","candid","reflect","about","her","life","are","punctuat","with","rare","archiv","footag",",","word","from","friend","(","Hal","Princ",",","Georg","C.","Wolf",",","Nathan","Lane",",","Cherri","Jone","and","John","Turturro",")","and","photograph","from","her","person","collect",".","By","turn","bold",",","hilari","and","ach","poignant",",","the","journey","connect","Stritch","'s","present","to","her","past",",","and","an","inspir","portrait","of","a","one-of-a-kind","survivor","emerg","."],"lemmas":["what","do","it","mean","to","be","a","perform","artist","-","first",",","last","and","always","?","Broadway","legend","Elaine","Stritch","can","answer","that",".","at","87",",","Stritch","be","still","here",",","dominate","the","stage","in","she","one","woman","cabaret","act",",","torture","Alec","Baldwin","on","30ROCK",",","give","we","she","take","on","aging",",","she","struggle","with","alcohol","and","diabetes",",","and","the","fear","of","leave","the","follow","spot","behind",".","in","steal","moment","from","she","corner","room","at","the","Carlyle",",","and","on","break","from","she","tour","and","work",",","candid","reflection","about","she","life","be","punctuate","with","rare","archival","footage",",","word","from","friend","-lrb-","Hal","Prince",",","George","C.","Wolfe",",","Nathan","Lane",",","Cherry","Jones","and","John","Turturro","-rrb-","and","photograph","from","she","personal","collection",".","by","turn","bold",",","hilarious","and","achingly","poignant",",","the","journey","connect","Stritch","'s","present","to","she","past",",","and","a","inspiring","portrait","of","a","one-of-a-kind","survivor","emerge","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What does it","does it mean","it mean to","mean to be","to be a","be a performing","a performing artist","performing artist -","artist - first","- first ,","first , last",", last and","last and always","Broadway legend Elaine","legend Elaine Stritch","Elaine Stritch can","Stritch can answer","can answer that","At 87 ,","87 , Stritch",", Stritch is","Stritch is still","is still here","still here ,","here , dominating",", dominating the","dominating the stage","the stage in","stage in her","in her one","her one woman","one woman cabaret","woman cabaret act","cabaret act ,","act , torturing",", torturing Alec","torturing Alec Baldwin","Alec Baldwin on","Baldwin on 30ROCK","on 30ROCK ,","30ROCK , giving",", giving us","giving us her","us her take","her take on","take on aging","on aging ,","aging , her",", her struggle","her struggle with","struggle with alcohol","with alcohol and","alcohol and diabetes","and diabetes ,","diabetes , and",", and the","and the fear","the fear of","fear of leaving","of leaving the","leaving the follow","the follow spot","follow spot behind","In stolen moments","stolen moments from","moments from her","from her corner","her corner room","corner room at","room at the","at the Carlyle","the Carlyle ,","Carlyle , and",", and on","and on breaks","on breaks from","breaks from her","from her tour","her tour and","tour and work","and work ,","work , candid",", candid reflections","candid reflections about","reflections about her","about her life","her life are","life are punctuated","are punctuated with","punctuated with rare","with rare archival","rare archival footage","archival footage ,","footage , words",", words from","words from friends","from friends (","friends ( Hal","( Hal Prince","Hal Prince ,","Prince , George",", George C.","George C.

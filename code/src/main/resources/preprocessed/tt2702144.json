{"title":"Palisades Parade","plot":"PALISADES PARADE is a portrait of a modern American town set on its signature day, the 4th of July. The film follows the townspeople of Pacific Palisades, Ca., as they celebrate their country and their town with an annual race, house parties, the famous parade, more parties and finally fireworks, all the while exploring the characters and character of this small town that manages to exist within the city of Los Angeles. It is a love letter to a kind of modern day Mayberry that is both privileged and yet down home, and one that is struggling to hold on to its roots and traditions as the very nature of the town is growing and changing in many ways. There are explorations of the past, both illustrious and tragic, as well as examinations of the current state of the economy, the treatment of Veterans, the Optimism of the past and the need for the 'toughening up' of future generations. It's a lot of laughs, a few tears, and a feeling of coming home. Mostly though, PALISADES PARADE is a true slice of Americana and small-town magic.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary","

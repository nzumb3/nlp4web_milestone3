{"title":"When C Goes with G7","plot":"When a heartbroken film school graduate, an unemployed UC Berkeley MBA graduate and a junior high school student converge at the music instruments store of an aspiring musician, quirky thoughts on everything from work and education to love and life emerge against a truly catchy soundtrack. Relationships end and hopes are occasionally dashed in this episodic drama, but few could complain that this isn't a thoughtful attempt to capture the sentiments of growing up in Hong Kong as we know it today.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["When","a","heartbroken","film","school","graduat",",","an","unemploy","UC","Berkeley","MBA","graduat","and","a","junior","high","school","student","converg","at","the","music","instrument","store","of","an","aspir","musician",",","quirki","thought","on","everyth","from","work","and","educ","to","love","and","life","emerg","against","a","truli","catchi","soundtrack",".","Relationship","end","and","hope","are","occasion","dash","in","this","episod","drama",",","but","few","could","complain","that","this","is","n't","a","thought","attempt","to","captur","the","sentiment","of","grow","up","in","Hong","Kong","as","we","know","it","today","."],"lemmas":["when","a","heartbroken","film","school","graduate",",","a","unemployed","uc","Berkeley","MBA","graduate","and","a","junior","high","school","student","converge","at","the","music","instrument","store","of","a","aspiring","musician",",","quirky","thought","on","everything","from","work","and","education","to","love","and","life","emerge","against","a","truly","catchy","soundtrack",".","Relationships","end","and","hope","be","occasionally","dash","in","this","episodic","drama",",","but","few","could","complain","that","this","be","not","a","thoughtful","attempt","to","capture","the","sentiment","of","grow","up","in","Hong","Kong","as","we","know","it","today","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["When a heartbroken","a heartbroken film","heartbroken film school","film school graduate","school graduate ,","graduate , an",", an unemployed","an unemployed UC","unemployed UC Berkeley","UC Berkeley MBA","Berkeley MBA graduate","MBA graduate and","graduate and a","and a junior","a junior high","junior high school","high school student","school student converge","student converge at","converge at the","at the music","the music instruments","music instruments store","instruments store of","store of an","of an aspiring","an aspiring musician","aspiring musician ,","musician , quirky",", quirky thoughts","quirky thoughts on","thoughts on everything","on everything from","everything from work","from work and","work and education","and education to","education to love","to love and","love and life","and life emerge","life emerge against","emerge against a","against a truly","a truly catchy","truly catchy soundtrack","Relationships end and","end and hopes","and hopes are","hopes are occasionally","are occasionally dashed","occasionally dashed in","dashed in this","in this episodic","this episodic drama","episodic drama ,","drama , but",", but few","but few could","few could complain","could complain that","complain that this","that this is","this is n't","is n't a","n't a thoughtful","a thoughtful attempt","thoughtful attempt to","attempt to capture","to capture the","capture the sentiments","the sentiments of","sentiments of growing","of growing up","growing up in","up in Hong","in Hong Kong","Hong Kong as","Kong as we","as we know","we know it","know it today"],"2grams":["When a","a heartbroken","heartbroken film","film school","school graduate","graduate ,",", an","an unemployed","unemployed UC","UC Berkeley","Berkeley MBA","MBA graduate","graduate and","and a","a junior","junior high","high school","school student","student converge","converge at","at the","the music","music instruments","instruments store","store of","of an","an aspiring","aspiring musician","musician ,",", quirky","quirky thoughts","thoughts on","on everything","everything from","from work","work and","and education","education to","to love","love and","and life","life emerge","emerge against","against a","a truly","truly catchy","catchy soundtrack","Relationships end","end and","and hopes","hopes are","are occasionally","occasionally dashed","dashed in","in this","this episodic","episodic drama","drama ,",", but","but few","few could","could complain","complain that","that this","this is","is n't","n't a","a thoughtful","thoughtful attempt","attempt to","to capture","capture the","the sentiments","sentiments of","of growing","growing up","up in","in Hong","Hong Kong","Kong as","as we","we know","know it","it today"]}

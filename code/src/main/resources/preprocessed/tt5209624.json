{"title":"The Fired Workers","plot":"When the nationwide general strike in Korea hit world news this year, video activists at Labor News Production were hard at work recording events around the country. The Fired Workers, a new documentary from this group, projects the voices of workers fired for their activities in the labor union or political movements since the 1980s. Opening with the shocking 1991 suicide of a fired activist, interviews and footage of demonstrations, hunger strikes, and other acts of protest show how the struggle against government control and corporate abuse took place.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["When","the","nationwid","general","strike","in","Korea","hit","world","news","this","year",",","video","activist","at","Labor","New","Product","were","hard","at","work","record","event","around","the","countri",".","The","Fire","Worker",",","a","new","documentari","from","this","group",",","project","the","voic","of","worker","fire","for","their","activ","in","the","labor","union","or","polit","movement","sinc","the","1980s",".","Opene","with","the","shock","1991","suicid","of","a","fire","activist",",","interview","and","footag","of","demonstr",",","hunger","strike",",","and","other","act","of","protest","show","how","the","struggl","against","govern","control","and","corpor","abus","took","place","."],"lemmas":["when","the","nationwide","general","strike","in","Korea","hit","world","news","this","year",",","video","activist","at","Labor","News","Production","be","hard","at","work","recording","event","around","the","country",".","the","Fired","Workers",",","a","new","documentary","from","this","group",",","project","the","voice","of","worker","fire","for","they","activity","in","the","labor","union","or","political","movement","since","the","1980s",".","open","with","the","shocking","1991","suicide","of","a","fire","activist",",","interview","and","footage","of","demonstration",",","hunger","strike",",","and","other","act","of","protest","show","how","the","struggle","against","government","control","and","corporate","abuse","take","place","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["When the nationwide","the nationwide general","nationwide general strike","general strike in","strike in Korea","in Korea hit","Korea hit world","hit world news","world news this","news this year","this year ,","year , video",", video activists","video activists at","activists at Labor","at Labor News","Labor News Production","News Production were","Production were hard","were hard at","hard at work","at work recording","work recording events","recording events around","events around the","around the country","The Fired Workers","Fired Workers ,","Workers , a",", a new","a new documentary","new documentary from","documentary from this","from this group","this group ,","group , projects",", projects the","projects the voices","the voices of","voices of workers","of workers fired","workers fired for","fired for their","for their activities","their activities in","activities in the","in the labor","the labor union","labor union or","union or political","or political movements","political movements since","movements since the","since the 1980s","Opening with the","with the shocking","the shocking 1991","shocking 1991 suicide","1991 suicide of","suicide of a","of a fired","a fired activist","fired activist ,","activist , interviews",", interviews and","interviews and footage","and footage of","footage of demonstrations","of demonstrations ,","demonstrations , hunger",", hunger strikes","hunger strikes ,","strikes , and",", and other","and other acts","other acts of","acts of protest","of protest show","protest show how","show how the","how the struggle","the struggle against","struggle against government","against government control","government control and","control and corporate","and corporate abuse","corporate abuse took","abuse took place"],"2grams":["When the","the nationwide","nationwide general","general strike","strike in","in Korea","Korea hit","hit world","world news","news this","this year","year ,",", video","video activists","activists at","at Labor","Labor News","News Production","Production were","were hard","hard at","at work","work recording","recording events","events around","around the","the country","The Fired","Fired Workers","Workers ,",", a","a new","new documentary","documentary from","from this","this group","group ,",", projects","projects the","the voices","voices of","of workers","workers fired","fired for","for their","their activities","activities in","in the","the labor","labor union","union or","or political","political movements","movements since","since the","the 1980s","Opening with","with the","the shocking","shocking 1991","1991 suicide","suicide of","of a","a fired","fired activist","activist ,",", interviews","interviews and","and footage","footage of","of demonstrations","demonstrations ,",", hunger","hunger strikes","strikes ,",", and","and other","other acts","acts of","of protest","protest show","show how","how the","the struggle","struggle against","against government","government control","control and","and corporate","corporate abuse","abuse took","took place"]}

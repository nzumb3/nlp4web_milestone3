{"title":"Le souper","plot":"France, 1815. After his defeat at Waterloo, Napoleon heads for exile. Royalists occupy Paris and attempt to restore the monarchy. However, the battle doesn't seem to be over. On July 6, Talleyrand, a shrewd politician of flexible convictions, invites chief of police and zealous revolutionary Fouché to supper and tries to convince him to serve the king. Over the meal they insult each other, accuse each other, and, at first sight, look like mortal enemies. But they definitely have one thing in common: they are both power-hungry.","genres":["Drama"," History"],"stems":["Franc",",","1815",".","After","his","defeat","at","Waterloo",",","Napoleon","head","for","exil",".","Royalist","occupi","Pari","and","attempt","to","restor","the","monarchi",".","Howev",",","the","battl","doe","n't","seem","to","be","over",".","On","Juli","6",",","Talleyrand",",","a","shrewd","politician","of","flexibl","convict",",","invit","chief","of","polic","and","zealous","revolutionari","Fouché","to","supper","and","tri","to","convinc","him","to","serv","the","king",".","Over","the","meal","they","insult","each","other",",","accus","each","other",",","and",",","at","first","sight",",","look","like","mortal","enemi",".","But","they","definit","have","one","thing","in","common",":","they","are","both","power-hungri","."],"lemmas":["France",",","1815",".","after","he","defeat","at","Waterloo",",","Napoleon","head","for","exile",".","royalist","occupy","Paris","and","attempt","to","restore","the","monarchy",".","however",",","the","battle","do","not","seem","to","be","over",".","on","July","6",",","Talleyrand",",","a","shrewd","politician","of","flexible","conviction",",","invite","chief","of","police","and","zealous","revolutionary","fouché","to","supper","and","try","to","convince","he","to","serve","the","king",".","over","the","meal","they","insult","each","other",",","accuse","each","other",",","and",",","at","first","sight",",","look","like","mortal","enemy",".","but","they","definitely","have","one","thing","in","common",":","they","be","both","power-hungry","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["France , 1815","After his defeat","his defeat at","defeat at Waterloo","at Waterloo ,","Waterloo , Napoleon",", Napoleon heads","Napoleon heads for","heads for exile","Royalists occupy Paris","occupy Paris and","Paris and attempt","and attempt to","attempt to restore","to restore the","restore the monarchy","However , the",", the battle","the battle does","battle does n't","does n't seem","n't seem to","seem to be","to be over","On July 6","July 6 ,","6 , Talleyrand",", Talleyrand ,","Talleyrand , a",", a shrewd","a shrewd politician","shrewd politician of","politician of flexible","of flexible convictions","flexible convictions ,","convictions , invites",", invites chief","invites chief of","chief of police","of police and","police and zealous","and zealous revolutionary","zealous revolutionary Fouché","revolutionary Fouché to","Fouché to supper","to supper and","supper and tries","and tries to","tries to convince","to convince him","convince him to","him to serve","to serve the","serve the king","Over the meal","the meal they","meal they insult","they insult each","insult each other","each other ,","other , accuse",", accuse each","accuse each other","each other ,","other , and",", and ,","and , at",", at first","at first sight","first sight ,","sight , look",", look like","look like mortal","like mortal enemies","But they definitely","they definitely have","definitely have one","have one thing","one thing in","thing in common","in common :","common : they",": they are","they are both","are both power-hungry"],"2grams":["France ,",", 1815","After his","his defeat","defeat at","at Waterloo","Waterloo ,",", Napoleon","Napoleon heads","heads for","for exile","Royalists occupy","occupy Paris","Paris and","and attempt","attempt to","to restore","restore the","the monarchy","However ,",", the","the battle","battle does","does n't","n't seem","seem to","to be","be over","On July","July 6","6 ,",", Talleyrand","Talleyrand ,",", a","a shrewd","shrewd politician","politician of","of flexible","flexible convictions","convictions ,",", invites","invites chief","chief of","of police","police and","and zealous","zealous revolutionary","revolutionary Fouché","Fouché to","to supper","supper and","and tries","tries to","to convince","convince him","him to","to serve","serve the","the king","Over the","the meal","meal they","they insult","insult each","each other","other ,",", accuse","accuse each","each other","other ,",", and","and ,",", at","at first","first sight","sight ,",", look","look like","like mortal","mortal enemies","But they","they definitely","definitely have","have one","one thing","thing in","in common","common :",": they","they are","are both","both power-hungry"]}

{"title":"Perfect Happiness","plot":"Ainhoa's career as a pianist is put on hold when she's knocked down in the center of Barcelona. Her love life isn't exactly at its best either. Shortly before the accident she met Imanol, but had been incapable of sharing her life with him due to an inability to show her feelings. The origins of her fears lie in the ETA attack she witnessed at the age of 15.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ainhoa","'s","career","as","a","pianist","is","put","on","hold","when","she","'s","knock","down","in","the","center","of","Barcelona",".","Her","love","life","is","n't","exact","at","it","best","either",".","Short","befor","the","accid","she","met","Imanol",",","but","had","been","incap","of","share","her","life","with","him","due","to","an","inabl","to","show","her","feel",".","The","origin","of","her","fear","lie","in","the","ETA","attack","she","wit","at","the","age","of","15","."],"lemmas":["Ainhoa","'s","career","as","a","pianist","be","put","on","hold","when","she","be","knock","down","in","the","center","of","Barcelona",".","she","love","life","be","not","exactly","at","its","best","either",".","shortly","before","the","accident","she","meet","Imanol",",","but","have","be","incapable","of","share","she","life","with","he","due","to","a","inability","to","show","she","feeling",".","the","origin","of","she","fear","lie","in","the","ETA","attack","she","witness","at","the","age","of","15","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Ainhoa 's career","'s career as","career as a","as a pianist","a pianist is","pianist is put","is put on","put on hold","on hold when","hold when she","when she 's","she 's knocked","'s knocked down","knocked down in","down in the","in the center","the center of","center of Barcelona","Her love life","love life is","life is n't","is n't exactly","n't exactly at","exactly at its","at its best","its best either","Shortly before the","before the accident","the accident she","accident she met","she met Imanol","met Imanol ,","Imanol , but",", but had","but had been","had been incapable","been incapable of","incapable of sharing","of sharing her","sharing her life","her life with","life with him","with him due","him due to","due to an","to an inability","an inability to","inability to show","to show her","show her feelings","The origins of","origins of her","of her fears","her fears lie","fears lie in","lie in the","in the ETA","the ETA attack","ETA attack she","attack she witnessed","she witnessed at","witnessed at the","at the age","the age of","age of 15"],"2grams":["Ainhoa 's","'s career","career as","as a","a pianist","pianist is","is put","put on","on hold","hold when","when she","she 's","'s knocked","knocked down","down in","in the","the center","center of","of Barcelona","Her love","love life","life is","is n't","n't exactly","exactly at","at its","its best","best either","Shortly before","before the","the accident","accident she","she met","met Imanol","Imanol ,",", but","but had","had been","been incapable","incapable of","of sharing","sharing her","her life","life with","with him","him due","due to","to an","an inability","inability to","to show","show her","her feelings","The origins","origins of","of her","her fears","fears lie","lie in","in the","the ETA","ETA attack","attack she","she witnessed","witnessed at","at the","the age","age of","of 15"]}

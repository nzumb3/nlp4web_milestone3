In an attempt at normality, he heads to a bar for a night out, where he encounters recently divorced and grieving Tess, abandoned and lonely. Finding solace in each other's brokenness, they withdraw to Peter's apartment and begin a sensual love affair. Days of bliss pass by, and when Tess reluctantly tries to leave to deal with the aftermath of her divorce, Peter proposes an idea: isolate themselves in his apartment to create their own reality - CANDiLAND. Now cut off from the world, the tormented lovers embark on a dogmatic quest for a higher existence. But their possessive love descends into a surreal savagery as Arnie attempts to reconnect with his son and put an end to CANDiLAND.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

{"title":"Var blev ni av? (del 1:) avreglering","plot":"Var blev ni av? (del 1: avreglering) is about the down-build of the former egalitarian Swedish society, once world-famous for the high and even living standard regarding ordinary people, where differences maybe were once smallest in the whole world and for which Sweden became justly famous. Have we left the Swedish model? is the main question put forward in this film. The facts speak: increased unemployment, wider economical gaps and poverty.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Var","blev","ni","av","?","(","del","1",":","avregl",")","is","about","the","down-build","of","the","former","egalitarian","Swedish","societi",",","onc","world-fam","for","the","high","and","even","live","standard","regard","ordinari","peopl",",","where","differ","mayb","were","onc","smallest","in","the","whole","world","and","for","which","Sweden","becam","just","famous",".","Have","we","left","the","Swedish","model","?","is","the","main","question","put","forward","in","this","film",".","The","fact","speak",":","increas","unemploy",",","wider","econom","gap","and","poverti","."],"lemmas":["var","blev","ni","av","?","-lrb-","del","1",":","avregler","-rrb-","be","about","the","down-build","of","the","former","egalitarian","swedish","society",",","once","world-famous","for","the","high","and","even","live","standard","regard","ordinary","people",",","where","difference","maybe","be","once","smallest","in","the","whole","world","and","for","which","Sweden","become","justly","famous",".","have","we","leave","the","swedish","model","?","be","the","main","question","put","forward","in","this","film",".","the","fact","speak",":","increase","unemployment",",","wider","economical","gap","and","poverty","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Var blev ni","blev ni av","( del 1","del 1 :","1 : avreglering",": avreglering )","avreglering ) is",") is about","is about the","about the down-build","the down-build of","down-build of the","of the former","the former egalitarian","former egalitarian Swedish","egalitarian Swedish society","Swedish society ,","society , once",", once world-famous","once world-famous for","world-famous for the","for the high","the high and","high and even","and even living","even living standard","living standard regarding","standard regarding ordinary","regarding ordinary people","ordinary people ,","people , where",", where differences","where differences maybe","differences maybe were","maybe were once","were once smallest","once smallest in","smallest in the","in the whole","the whole world","whole world and","world and for","and for which","for which Sweden","which Sweden became","Sweden became justly","became justly famous","Have we left","we left the","left the Swedish","the Swedish model","is the main","the main question","main question put","question put forward","put forward in","forward in this","in this film","The facts speak","facts speak :","speak : increased",": increased unemployment","increased unemployment ,","unemployment , wider",", wider economical","wider economical gaps","economical gaps and","gaps and poverty"],"2grams":["Var blev","blev ni","ni av","( del","del 1","1 :",": avreglering","avreglering )",") is","is about","about the","the down-build","down-build of","of the","the former","former egalitarian","egalitarian Swedish","Swedish society","society ,",", once","once world-famous","world-famous for","for the","the high","high and","and even","even living","living standard","standard regarding","regarding ordinary","ordinary people","people ,",", where","where differences","differences maybe","maybe were","were once","once smallest","smallest in","in the","the whole","whole world","world and","and for","for which","which Sweden","Sweden became","became justly","justly famous","Have we","we left","left the","the Swedish","Swedish model","is the","the main","main question","question put","put forward","forward in","in this","this film","The facts","facts speak","speak :",": increased","increased unemployment","unemployment ,",", wider","wider economical","economical gaps","gaps and","and poverty"]}

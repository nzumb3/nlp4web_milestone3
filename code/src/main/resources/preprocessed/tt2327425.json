{"title":"Morya","plot":"It was in 1893 when Lokmanya Balgangadhar Tilak gave a public form to the celebration of the festival of Ganpati which made it a genuinely people's festival. He saw in the festival, a way of uniting people for a common cause with the aim to bring about political consciousness under the guise of a religious celebration, with freedom for India being the ultimate goal. In the metro city of Mumbai, there are two adjoining chawls ie 'GaneshChawl' and 'KhatavChawl'. Being situated in the prime locations they have been celebrating the Ganeshotsav with splendor and devotion since the past 40 years. Being the arch rivals that they are, each competes with the other, every year and does their utmost, to prove they're the best. However, this year will be their last opportunity as the entire locality is being purchased by a builder for re-development, and the following year there would be only one Community Ganesh Festival. Each faction pulls out all stops to prove their supremacy.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["It","was","in","1893","when","Lokmanya","Balgangadhar","Tilak","gave","a","public","form","to","the","celebr","of","the","festiv","of","Ganpati","which","made","it","a","genuin","peopl","'s","festiv",".","He","saw","in","the","festiv",",","a","way","of","unit","peopl","for","a","common","caus","with","the","aim","to","bring","about","polit","conscious","under","the","guis","of","a","religi","celebr",",","with","freedom","for","India","be","the","ultim","goal",".","In","the","metro","citi","of","Mumbai",",","there","are","two","adjoin","chawl","ie","'","GaneshChawl","'","and","'","KhatavChawl","'",".","Be","situat","in","the","prime","locat","they","have","been","celebr","the","Ganeshotsav","with","splendor","and","devot","sinc","the","past","40","year",".","Be","the","arch","rival","that","they","are",",","each","compet","with","the","other",",","everi","year","and","doe","their","utmost",",","to","prove","they","re","the","best",".","Howev",",","this","year","will","be","their","last","opportun","as","the","entir","local","is","be","purchas","by","a","builder","for","re-develop",",","and","the","follow","year","there","would","be","onli","one","Commun","Ganesh","Festiv",".","Each","faction","pull","out","all","stop","to","prove","their","supremaci","."],"lemmas":["it","be","in","1893","when","Lokmanya","Balgangadhar","Tilak","give","a","public","form","to","the","celebration","of","the","festival","of","Ganpati","which","make","it","a","genuinely","people","'s","festival",".","he","see","in","the","festival",",","a","way","of","unite","people","for","a","common","cause","with","the","aim","to","bring","about","political","consciousness","under","the","guise","of","a","religious","celebration",",","with","freedom","for","India","be","the","ultimate","goal",".","in","the","metro","city","of","Mumbai",",","there","be","two","adjoining","chawl","ie","'","ganeshchawl","'","and","'","khatavchawl","'",".","be","situate","in","the","prime","location","they","have","be","celebrate","the","ganeshotsav","with","splendor","and","devotion","since","the","past","40","year",".","be","the","arch","rival","that","they","be",",","each","compete","with","the","other",",","every","year","and","do","they","utmost",",","to","prove","they","be","the","best",".","however",",","this","year","will","be","they","last","opportunity","as","the","entire","locality","be","be","purchase","by","a","builder","for","re-development",",","and","the","following","year","there","would","be","only","one","Community","Ganesh","Festival",".","each","faction","pull","out","all","stop","to","prove","they","supremacy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It

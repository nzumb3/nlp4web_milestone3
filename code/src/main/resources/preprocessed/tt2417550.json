{"title":"Fatal","plot":"Korean Redemption and Revenge. Sung-gong has always been a target for school bullies. One day, the bullies drag him to the home of a fellow high school girl named Jang-mi where they take turns raping her and forcing Sung-gong to do the same against his wish. Ten years later, Sunggong encounters Jang-mi again at a church, and thereafter he pursues his life seeking her forgiveness without confessing that he was one of offenders. But, when he realizes that Jang-mi is still traumatized, he seeks out the bullies again.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Korean","Redempt","and","Reveng",".","Sung-gong","has","alway","been","a","target","for","school","bulli",".","One","day",",","the","bulli","drag","him","to","the","home","of","a","fellow","high","school","girl","name","Jang-mi","where","they","take","turn","rape","her","and","forc","Sung-gong","to","do","the","same","against","his","wish",".","Ten","year","later",",","Sunggong","encount","Jang-mi","again","at","a","church",",","and","thereaft","he","pursu","his","life","seek","her","forgiv","without","confess","that","he","was","one","of","offend",".","But",",","when","he","realiz","that","Jang-mi","is","still","traumat",",","he","seek","out","the","bulli","again","."],"lemmas":["korean","redemption","and","revenge",".","sung-gong","have","always","be","a","target","for","school","bully",".","one","day",",","the","bully","drag","he","to","the","home","of","a","fellow","high","school","girl","name","jang-mi","where","they","take","turn","rape","she","and","force","sung-gong","to","do","the","same","against","he","wish",".","ten","year","later",",","Sunggong","encounter","jang-mi","again","at","a","church",",","and","thereafter","he","pursue","he","life","seek","she","forgiveness","without","confess","that","he","be","one","of","offender",".","but",",","when","he","realize","that","jang-mi","be","still","traumatize",",","he","seek","out","the","bully","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Korean Redemption and","Redemption and Revenge","Sung-gong has always","has always been","always been a","been a target","a target for","target for school","for school bullies","One day ,","day , the",", the bullies","the bullies drag","bullies drag him","drag him to","him to the","to the home","the home of","home of a","of a fellow","a fellow high","fellow high school","high school girl","school girl named","girl named Jang-mi","named Jang-mi where","Jang-mi where they","where they take","they take turns","take turns raping","turns raping her","raping her and","her and forcing","and forcing Sung-gong","forcing Sung-gong to","Sung-gong to do","to do the","do the same","the same against","same against his","against his wish","Ten years later","years later ,","later , Sunggong",", Sunggong encounters","Sunggong encounters Jang-mi","encounters Jang-mi again","Jang-mi again at","again at a","at a church","a church ,","church , and",", and thereafter","and thereafter he","thereafter he pursues","he pursues his","pursues his life","his life seeking","life seeking her","seeking her forgiveness","her forgiveness without","forgiveness without confessing","without confessing that","confessing that he","that he was","he was one","was one of","one of offenders","But , when",", when he","when he realizes","he realizes that","realizes that Jang-mi","that Jang-mi is","Jang-mi is still","is still traumatized","still traumatized ,","traumatized , he",", he seeks","he seeks out","seeks out the","out the bullies","the bullies again"],"2grams":["Korean Redemption","Redemption and","and Revenge","Sung-gong has","has always","always been","been a","a target","target for","for school","school bullies","One day","day ,",", the","the bullies","bullies drag","drag him","him to","to the","the home","home of","of a","a fellow","fellow high","high school","school girl","girl named","named Jang-mi","Jang-mi where","where they","they take","take turns","turns raping","raping her","her and","and forcing","forcing Sung-gong","Sung-gong to","to do","do the","the same","same against","against his","his wish","Ten years","years later","later ,",", Sunggong","Sunggong encounters","encounters Jang-mi","Jang-mi again","again at","at a","a church","church ,",", and","and thereafter","thereafter he","he pursues","pursues his","his life","life seeking","seeking her","her forgiveness","forgiveness without","without confessing","confessing that","that he","he was","was one","one of","of offenders","But ,",", when","when he","he realizes","realizes that","that Jang-mi","Jang-mi is","is still","still traumatized","traumatized ,",", he","he seeks","seeks out","out the","the bullies","bullies again"]}

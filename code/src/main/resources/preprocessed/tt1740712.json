{"title":"Video Nasties: Moral Panic, Censorship & Videotape","plot":"A documentary features interviews with filmmakers Neil Marshall ('The Descent', 'Doomsday'), Christopher Smith ('Severance', 'Black Death') and MP Graham Bright as well as rare archive footage featuring James Ferman (director of the BBFC 1975-1999) & Mary Whitehouse. Taking in the explosion of home video, the erosion of civil liberties, the introduction of draconian censorship measures, hysterical press campaigns and the birth of many careers born in blood and videotape, West's documentary also reflects on the influence this peculiar era still exerts on us today.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","documentari","featur","interview","with","filmmak","Neil","Marshal","(","'","The","Descent","'",",","'","Doomsday","'",")",",","Christoph","Smith","(","'","Sever","'",",","'","Black","Death","'",")","and","MP","Graham","Bright","as","well","as","rare","archiv","footag","featur","Jame","Ferman","(","director","of","the","BBFC","1975-1999",")","&","Mari","Whitehous",".","Take","in","the","explos","of","home","video",",","the","eros","of","civil","liberti",",","the","introduct","of","draconian","censorship","measur",",","hyster","press","campaign","and","the","birth","of","mani","career","born","in","blood","and","videotap",",","West","'s","documentari","also","reflect","on","the","influenc","this","peculiar","era","still","exert","on","us","today","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","feature","interview","with","filmmaker","Neil","Marshall","-lrb-","'","the","descent","'",",","'","Doomsday","'","-rrb-",",","Christopher","Smith","-lrb-","'","severance","'",",","'","Black","Death","'","-rrb-","and","MP","Graham","Bright","as","well","as","rare","archive","footage","feature","James","Ferman","-lrb-","director","of","the","BBFC","1975-1999","-rrb-","&","Mary","Whitehouse",".","take","in","the","explosion","of","home","video",",","the","erosion","of","civil","liberty",",","the","introduction","of","draconian","censorship","measure",",","hysterical","press","campaign","and","the","birth","of","many","career","bear","in","blood","and","videotape",",","West","'s","documentary","also","reflect","on","the","influence","this","peculiar","era","still","exert","on","we","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"Harry Brown","plot":"In England, retired Royal Marine Harry Brown spends his lonely life between the hospital, where his beloved wife Kath is terminally ill, and playing chess with his only friend Leonard Attwell in the Barge pub owned by Sid Rourke. After the death of Kath, Len tells his grieving friend that the local gang is harassing him and he is carrying an old bayonet for self-defense; the widower suggests him to go to the police. When Len is beaten, then stabbed to death in an underground passage, Inspector Alice Frampton and her partner Sergeant Terry Hicock are sent to investigate. They pay Harry a visit but don't have good news; the police have not found any other evidence, other than the bayonet, in order to arrest the hoodlums. This mean that should the case go to trial the gang would claim self-defense. Harry Brown sees that justice will not be granted and decides to take matters into his own hands.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["In","England",",","retir","Royal","Marin","Harri","Brown","spend","his","lone","life","between","the","hospit",",","where","his","belov","wife","Kath","is","termin","ill",",","and","play","chess","with","his","onli","friend","Leonard","Attwell","in","the","Barg","pub","own","by","Sid","Rourk",".","After","the","death","of","Kath",",","Len","tell","his","griev","friend","that","the","local","gang","is","harass","him","and","he","is","carri","an","old","bayonet","for","self-defens",";","the","widow","suggest","him","to","go","to","the","polic",".","When","Len","is","beaten",",","then","stab","to","death","in","an","underground","passag",",","Inspector","Alice","Frampton","and","her","partner","Sergeant","Terri","Hicock","are","sent","to","investig",".","They","pay","Harri","a","visit","but","do","n't","have","good","news",";","the","polic","have","not","found","ani","other","evid",",","other","than","the","bayonet",",","in","order","to","arrest","the","hoodlum",".","This","mean","that","should","the","case","go","to","trial","the","gang","would","claim","self-defens",".","Harri","Brown","see","that","justic","will","not","be","grant","and","decid","to","take","matter","into","his","own","hand","."],"lemmas":["in","England",",","retire","Royal","Marine","Harry","Brown","spend","he","lonely","life","between","the","hospital",",","where","he","beloved","wife","Kath","be","terminally","ill",",","and","play","chess","with","he","only","friend","Leonard","Attwell","in","the","barge","pub","own","by","Sid","Rourke",".","after","the","death","of","Kath",",","Len","tell","he","grieving","friend","that","the","local","gang","be","harass","he","and","he","be","carry","a","old","bayonet","for","self-defense",";","the","widower","suggest","he","to","go","to","the","police",".","when","Len","be","beaten",",","then","stab","to","death","in","a","underground","passage",",","Inspector","Alice","Frampton","and","she","partner","Sergeant","Terry","Hicock","be","send","to","investigate",".","they","pay","Harry","a","visit","but","do","not","have","good","news",";","the","police","have","not","find","any","other","evidence",",","other","than","the","bayonet",",","in","order","to","arrest","the","hoodlum",".","this","mean","that","should","the","case","go","to","trial","the","gang","would","claim","self-defense",".","Harry","Brown","see","that","justice","will","not","be","grant","and","decide","to","take","matter","into","he","own","hand","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In England ,","England , retired",", retired Royal","retired Royal Marine","Royal Marine Harry","Marine Harry Brown","Harry Brown spends","Brown spends his","spends his lonely","his lonely life","lonely life between","life between the","between the hospital","the hospital ,","hospital , where",", where his","where his beloved","his beloved wife","beloved wife Kath","wife Kath is","Kath is terminally","is terminally ill","terminally ill ,","ill , and",", and playing","and playing chess","playing chess with","chess with his","with his only","his only friend","only friend Leonard","friend Leonard Attwell","Leonard Attwell in","Attwell in the","in the Barge","the Barge pub","Barge pub owned","pub owned by","owned by Sid","by Sid Rourke","After the death","the death of","death of Kath","of Kath ,","Kath , Len",", Len tells","Len tells his","tells his grieving","his grieving friend","grieving friend that","friend that the","that the local","the local gang","local gang is","gang is harassing","is harassing him","harassing him and","him and he","and he is","he is carrying","is carrying an","carrying an old","an old bayonet","old bayonet for","bayonet for self-defense","for self-defense ;","self-defense ;

{"title":"Hell or High Water: The Story of the Nashville Rollergirls","plot":"This inspirational story follows the Nashville Rollergirls through the loss of their practice space, the move to a new game venue, injuries, relocation of key players, huge financial pressures, and even an epic flood. Ever the underdog, and with a burning in their bellies, the Nashville Rollergirls seek to prove themselves at every turn. And nothing will prevent them from achieving the goals they set. On a quest to succeed athletically on the national stage, and to keep their skater-owned-and operated organization afloat, the Nashville Rollergirls, in true Nashville spirit, refuse to accept 'no', 'can't', or 'won't'. And in true roller derby spirit, they bring 'do-it-yourself' to the next level.","genres":["Biography"," Sport","

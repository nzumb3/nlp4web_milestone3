{"title":"Cancellation Hearts","plot":"Margaret has few options after her girlfriend dumps her - alone and out of work in a week-to-week motel, she is literally going nowhere. On tv, blonde anchorwomen drone, giving quirky factoids and heart-wrenching tragedies equal airplay. Tv-time is fast-paced and alluringly painless - out of desperation, margaret imagines herself the heroine in a daytime tv drama. The heroine's husband has served divorce papers, but rather than submit, she is living on the lam in her suv after abducting their six-year-old son. Margaret's heroine also feels powerless, however this hyped version of herself moves throughout the city facing obstacles and taking action - her television version of herself has an arc and an ending - and margaret is transfixed.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Margaret","has","few","option","after","her","girlfriend","dump","her","-","alon","and","out","of","work","in","a","week-to-week","motel",",","she","is","liter","go","nowher",".","On","tv",",","blond","anchorwomen","drone",",","give","quirki","factoid","and","heart-wrench","tragedi","equal","airplay",".","Tv-time","is","fast-pac","and","allur","painless","-","out","of","desper",",","margaret","imagin","herself","the","heroin","in","a","daytim","tv","drama",".","The","heroin","'s","husband","has","serv","divorc","paper",",","but","rather","than","submit",",","she","is","live","on","the","lam","in","her","suv","after","abduct","their","six-year-old","son",".","Margaret","'s","heroin","also","feel","powerless",",","howev","this","hype","version","of","herself","move","throughout","the","citi","face","obstacl","and","take","action","-","her","televis","version","of","herself","has","an","arc","and","an","end","-","and","margaret","is","transfix","."],"lemmas":["Margaret","have","few","option","after","she","girlfriend","dump","she","-","alone","and","out","of","work","in","a","week-to-week","motel",",","she","be","literally","go","nowhere",".","on","tv",",","blonde","anchorwoman","drone",",","give","quirky","factoid","and","heart-wrenching","tragedy","equal","airplay",".","tv-time","be","fast-paced","and","alluringly","painless","-","out","of","desperation",",","margaret","imagine","herself","the","heroine","in","a","daytime","tv","drama",".","the","heroine","'s","husband","have","serve","divorce","papers",",","but","rather","than","submit",",","she","be","live","on","the","lam","in","she","suv","after","abduct","they","six-year-old","son",".","Margaret","'s","heroine","also","feel","powerless",",","however","this","hyped","version","of","herself","move","throughout","the","city","face","obstacle","and","take","action","-","she","television","version","of","herself","have","a","arc","and","a","ending","-","and","margaret","be","transfix","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Margaret has few","has few options","few options after","options after her","after her girlfriend","her girlfriend dumps","girlfriend dumps her","dumps her -","her -

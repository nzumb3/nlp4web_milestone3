{"title":"One Way Ticket to the Moon","plot":"In the late 1960s, Adam is drafted into the Polish army and sent to serve in the submarine section of the Navy. Along with his older brother Antoni, Adam sets off for the military base in faraway Swinoujscie on the Polish coast. Their journey across Poland lasts several days and allows them for visiting old friends as well as making new ones. Antoni's plan is to make sure that the trip prepares his brother for the harsh life in the army (including losing his virginity) to avoid becoming the laughing stock of the unit.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","late","1960s",",","Adam","is","draft","into","the","Polish","armi","and","sent","to","serv","in","the","submarin","section","of","the","Navi",".","Along","with","his","older","brother","Antoni",",","Adam","set","off","for","the","militari","base","in","faraway","Swinoujsci","on","the","Polish","coast",".","Their","journey","across","Poland","last","sever","day","and","allow","them","for","visit","old","friend","as","well","as","make","new","one",".","Antoni","'s","plan","is","to","make","sure","that","the","trip","prepar","his","brother","for","the","harsh","life","in","the","armi","(","includ","lose","his","virgin",")","to","avoid","becom","the","laugh","stock","of","the","unit","."],"lemmas":["in","the","late","1960",",","Adam","be","draft","into","the","polish","army","and","send","to","serve","in","the","submarine","section","of","the","Navy",".","along","with","he","older","brother","Antoni",",","Adam","set","off","for","the","military","base","in","faraway","swinoujscie","on","the","polish","coast",".","they","journey","across","Poland","last","several","day","and","allow","they","for","visit","old","friend","as","well","as","make","new","one",".","Antoni","'s","plan","be","to","make","sure","that","the","trip","prepare","he","brother","for","the","harsh","life","in","the","army","-lrb-","include","lose","he","virginity","-rrb-","to","avoid","become","the","laughing","stock","of","the","unit","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the late","the late 1960s","late 1960s ,","1960s , Adam",", Adam is","Adam is drafted","is drafted into","drafted into the","into the Polish","the Polish army","Polish army and","army and sent","and sent to","sent to serve","to serve in","serve in the","in the submarine","the submarine section","submarine section of","section of the","of the Navy","Along with his","with his older","his older brother","older brother Antoni","brother Antoni ,","Antoni , Adam",", Adam sets","Adam sets off","sets off for","off for the","for the military","the military base","military base in","base in faraway","in faraway Swinoujscie","faraway Swinoujscie on","Swinoujscie on the","on the Polish","the Polish coast","Their journey across","journey across Poland","across Poland lasts","Poland lasts several","lasts several days","several days and","days and allows","and allows them","allows them for","them for visiting","for visiting old","visiting old friends","old friends as","friends as well","as well as","well as making","as making new","making new ones","Antoni 's plan","'s plan is","plan is to","is to make","to make sure","make sure that","sure that the","that the trip","the trip prepares","trip prepares his","prepares his brother","his brother for","brother for the","for the harsh","the harsh life","harsh life in","life in the","in the army","the army (","army ( including","( including losing","including losing his","losing his virginity","his virginity )","virginity ) to",") to avoid","to avoid becoming","avoid becoming the","becoming the laughing","the laughing stock","laughing stock of","stock of the","of the unit"],"2grams":["In the","the late","late 1960s","1960s ,",", Adam","Adam is","is drafted","drafted into","into the","the Polish","Polish army","army and","and sent","sent to","to serve","serve in","in the","the submarine","submarine section","section of","of the","the Navy","Along with","with his","his older","older brother","brother Antoni","Antoni ,",", Adam","Adam sets","sets off","off for","for the","the military","military base","base in","in faraway","faraway Swinoujscie","Swinoujscie on","on the","the Polish","Polish coast","Their journey","journey across","across Poland","Poland lasts","lasts several","several days","days and","and allows","allows them","them for","for visiting","visiting old","old friends","friends as","as well","well as","as making","making new","new ones","Antoni 's","'s plan","plan is","is to","to make","make sure","sure that","that the","the trip","trip prepares","prepares his","his brother","brother for","for the","the harsh","harsh life","life in","in the","the army","army (","( including","including losing","losing his","his virginity","virginity )",") to","to avoid","avoid becoming","becoming the","the laughing","laughing stock","stock of","of the","the unit"]}

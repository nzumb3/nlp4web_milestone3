{"title":"She Wasn't Last Night","plot":"Beautiful activist Shantel Crockett is slammed by drama as her relationship with Reyna, 10 years her junior, begins to crumble. Young Reyna's dance career goes nowhere, because she can't dance, while she flounders for something to hold on to. To make matters worse, charming player Jack (Jaqueline) is determined to make Reyna hers - if only for one night. Reyna struggles to maintain her relationship with Shantel while remaining open to her attraction to Jack. Shantel is left confused by Reyna's erratic behavior. With her jewelry-making talent on the back-burner, and her mounting feelings of failure in her work supporting LGBTQ Youth, Shantel is forced to face Reyna's despair and decide what kind of life she wants for herself. Shantel's best friend Vanessa encourages her to move on, past the petty drama of her young girlfriend and find meaning her own artistic expressions, and maybe even in a new love. Meanwhile, one of Shantel's youth, Afro-Dominican poet Reggie, struggles to find her own path and discover her own voice. Reggie feels alone and unsure of herself, exploring her talent for poetry and her desire for relationships at the youth group Shantel leads. With the help of a small community of good friends and mentors, both Shantel and Reggie learn lessons they will never forget.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Beauti","activist","Shantel","Crockett","is","slam","by","drama","as","her","relationship","with","Reyna",",","10","year","her","junior",",","begin","to","crumbl",".","Young","Reyna","'s","danc","career","goe","nowher",",","becaus","she","ca","n't","danc",",","while","she","flounder","for","someth","to","hold","on","to",".","To","make","matter","wors",",","charm","player","Jack","(","Jaquelin",")","is","determin","to","make","Reyna","her","-","if","onli","for","one","night",".","Reyna","struggl","to","maintain","her","relationship","with","Shantel","while","remain","open","to","her","attract","to","Jack",".","Shantel","is","left","confus","by","Reyna","'s","errat","behavior",".","With","her","jewelry-mak","talent","on","the","back-burn",",","and","her","mount","feel","of","failur","in","her","work","support","LGBTQ","Youth",",","Shantel","is","forc","to","face","Reyna","'s","despair","and","decid","what","kind","of","life","she","want","for","herself",".","Shantel","'s","best","friend","Vanessa","encourag","her","to","move","on",",","past","the","petti","drama","of","her","young","girlfriend","and","find","mean","her","own","artist","express",",","and","mayb","even","in","a","new","love",".","Meanwhil",",","one","of","Shantel","'s","youth",",","Afro-Dominican","poet","Reggi",",","struggl","to","find","her","own","path","and","discov","her","own","voic",".","Reggi","feel","alon","and","unsur","of","herself",",","explor","her","talent","for","poetri","and","her","desir","for","relationship","at","the","youth","group","Shantel","lead",".","With","the","help","of","a","small","communiti","of","good","friend","and","mentor",",","both","Shantel","and","Reggi","learn","lesson","they","will","never","forget","."],"lemmas":["beautiful","activist","Shantel","Crockett","be","slam","by","drama","as","she","relationship","with","Reyna",",","10","year","she","junior",",","begin","to","crumble",".","Young","Reyna","'s","dance","career","go","nowhere",",","because","she","can","not","dance",",","while","she","flounder","for","something","to","hold","on","to",".","to","make","matter","worse",",","charming","player","Jack","-lrb-","Jaqueline","-rrb-","be","determine","to","make","Reyna","hers","-","if","only","for","one","night",".","Reyna","struggle","to","maintain","she","relationship","with","Shantel","while","remain","open","to","she","attraction","to","Jack",".","Shantel","be","left","confuse","by","Reyna","'s","erratic","behavior",".","with","she","jewelry-making","talent","on","the","back-burner",",","and","she","mounting","feeling","of","failure","in","she","work","support","LGBTQ","Youth",",","Shantel","be","force","to","face","Reyna","'s","despair","and","decide","what","kind","of","life","she","want","for","herself",".","Shantel","'s","best","friend","Vanessa","encourage","she","to","move","on",",","past","the","petty","drama","of","she","young","girlfriend","and","find","mean","she","own","artistic","expression",",","and","maybe","even","in","a","new","love",".","meanwhile",",","one","of","Shantel","'s","youth",",","afro-dominican","poet","Reggie",",","struggle","to","find","she","own","path","and","discover","she","own","voice",".","Reggie","feel","alone","and","unsure","of","herself",",","explore","she","talent","for","poetry","and","she","desire","for","relationship","at","the","youth","group","Shantel","lead",".","with","the","help","of","a","small","community","of","good","friend","and","mentor",",","both","Shantel","and","Reggie","learn","lesson","they","will","never","forget","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Beautiful

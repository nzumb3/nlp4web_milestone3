{"title":"Be or not to be","plot":"Russia, 1999. The last year of President Yeltsin. The crash of market and of the Soviet ideology make a simple worker, a metallurgist, reconsider his place in society. The role of Hamlet produces a turn-over in his mind and helps him find his own answer to the question 'To be or not to be?' His personal interpretation of the Shakespeare's drama helps to realize that the 'sea of troubles' of our existence is not just bad luck, but the hand of God, leading people to the acceptance of divine love. The film is documentary evidence of time and a trip around the small world of a representative of the 'lost generation' at the turn of the millennium.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Russia",",","1999",".","The","last","year","of","Presid","Yeltsin",".","The","crash","of","market","and","of","the","Soviet","ideolog","make","a","simpl","worker",",","a","metallurgist",",","reconsid","his","place","in","societi",".","The","role","of","Hamlet","produc","a","turn-ov","in","his","mind","and","help","him","find","his","own","answer","to","the","question","'","To","be","or","not","to","be","?","'","His","person","interpret","of","the","Shakespear","'s","drama","help","to","realiz","that","the","'","sea","of","troubl","'","of","our","exist","is","not","just","bad","luck",",","but","the","hand","of","God",",","lead","peopl","to","the","accept","of","divin","love",".","The","film","is","documentari","evid","of","time","and","a","trip","around","the","small","world","of","a","repres","of","the","'","lost","generat","'","at","the","turn","of","the","millennium","."],"lemmas":["Russia",",","1999",".","the","last","year","of","President","Yeltsin",".","the","crash","of","market","and","of","the","soviet","ideology","make","a","simple","worker",",","a","metallurgist",",","reconsider","he","place","in","society",".","the","role","of","Hamlet","produce","a","turn-over","in","he","mind","and","help","he","find","he","own","answer","to","the","question","'","to","be","or","not","to","be","?","'","he","personal","interpretation","of","the","Shakespeare","'s","drama","help","to","realize","that","the","'","sea","of","trouble","'","of","we","existence","be","not","just","bad","luck",",","but","the","hand","of","God",",","lead","people","to","the","acceptance","of","divine","love",".","the","film","be","documentary","evidence","of","time","and","a","trip","around","the","small","world","of","a","representative","of","the","'","lost","generation","'","at","the","turn","of","the","millennium","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Russia , 1999","The last year","last year of","year of President","of President Yeltsin","The crash of","crash of market","of market and","market and of","and of the","of the Soviet","the Soviet ideology","Soviet ideology make","ideology make a","make a simple","a simple worker","simple worker ,","worker , a",", a metallurgist","a metallurgist ,","metallurgist , reconsider",", reconsider his","reconsider his place","his place in","place in society","The role of","role of Hamlet","of Hamlet produces","Hamlet produces a","produces a turn-over","a turn-over in","turn-over in his","in his mind","his mind and","mind and helps","and helps him","helps him find","him find his","find his own","his own answer","own answer to","answer to the","to the question","the question '","question ' To","' To be","To be or","be or not","or not to","not to be","to be ?","be ?

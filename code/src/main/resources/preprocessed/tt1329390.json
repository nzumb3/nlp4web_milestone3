{"title":"Long Road North","plot":"This epic journey begins at the most southern tip of Argentina, taking us on a modern day \"Motorcycle Diaries\" through eighteen countries, along the longest road in the world. From the mountains of Patagonia, through Latin American mega-cities and small-town America, to the sparse reaches of the Canadian arctic we get a glimpse of what it would be like to drop everything and hit the open road. In a time when global relations can make the world seem too scary to embrace, we are reminded that the most common thing we share with other parts of the world is humanity.","genres":["Adventure","

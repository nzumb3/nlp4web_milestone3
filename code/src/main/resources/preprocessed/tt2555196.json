{"title":"Moto na Maji","plot":"Moto na Maji documents how an extraordinary international group of religious leaders, social advocates, environmentalists, and artists gathered with local communities at the Great Rift Valley in Kenya, the cradle of humanity, to offer prayers for an awakening of compassion and altruism. An ancient Buddhist ceremony was adapted by Shinnyo-en, the Japanese Buddhist order, to be shared and to be meaningful for everyone. As the clergy, artists, and local communities collaborated, they realized a transcendence of difference and spirit of harmony. The film shares their experience, as sung in Swahili: 'Mother Africa, home to the human soul, we all have one heart, one love. We are all family. We your children return with a gift: a ceremony of fire (awakening).'","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Moto","na","Maji","document","how","an","extraordinari","intern","group","of","religi","leader",",","social","advoc",",","environmentalist",",","and","artist","gather","with","local","communiti","at","the","Great","Rift","Valley","in","Kenya",",","the","cradl","of","human",",","to","offer","prayer","for","an","awaken","of","compass","and","altruism",".","An","ancient","Buddhist","ceremoni","was","adapt","by","Shinnyo-en",",","the","Japanes","Buddhist","order",",","to","be","share","and","to","be","meaning","for","everyon",".","As","the","clergi",",","artist",",","and","local","communiti","collabor",",","they","realiz","a","transcend","of","differ","and","spirit","of","harmoni",".","The","film","share","their","experi",",","as","sung","in","Swahili",":","'","Mother","Africa",",","home","to","the","human","soul",",","we","all","have","one","heart",",","one","love",".","We","are","all","famili",".","We","your","children","return","with","a","gift",":","a","ceremoni","of","fire","(","awaken",")",".","'"],"lemmas":["moto","na","Maji","document","how","a","extraordinary","international","group","of","religious","leader",",","social","advocate",",","environmentalist",",","and","artist","gather","with","local","community","at","the","Great","Rift","Valley","in","Kenya",",","the","cradle","of","humanity",",","to","offer","prayer","for","a","awakening","of","compassion","and","altruism",".","a","ancient","buddhist","ceremony","be","adapt","by","shinnyo-en",",","the","Japanese","Buddhist","order",",","to","be","share","and","to","be","meaningful","for","everyone",".","as","the","clergy",",","artist",",","and","local","community","collaborate",",","they","realize","a","transcendence","of","difference","and","spirit","of","harmony",".","the","film","share","they","experience",",","as","sing","in","Swahili",":","'","Mother","Africa",",","home","to","the","human","soul",",","we","all","have","one","heart",",","one","love",".","we","be","all","family",".","we","you","child","return","with","a","gift",":","a","ceremony","of","fire","-lrb-","awakening","-rrb-",".","'"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Moto na Maji","na Maji documents","Maji documents how","documents how an","how an extraordinary","an extraordinary international","extraordinary international group","international group of","group of religious","of religious leaders","religious leaders ,","leaders , social",", social advocates","social advocates ,","advocates , environmentalists",", environmentalists ,","environmentalists , and",", and artists","and artists gathered","artists gathered with","gathered with local","with local communities","local communities at","communities at the","at the Great","the Great Rift","Great Rift Valley","Rift Valley in","Valley in Kenya","in Kenya ,","Kenya , the",", the cradle","the cradle of","cradle of humanity","of humanity ,","humanity , to",", to offer","to offer prayers","offer prayers for","prayers for an","for an awakening","an awakening of","awakening of compassion","of compassion and","compassion and altruism","An ancient Buddhist","ancient Buddhist ceremony","Buddhist ceremony was","ceremony was adapted","was adapted by","adapted by Shinnyo-en","by Shinnyo-en ,","Shinnyo-en , the",", the Japanese","the Japanese Buddhist","Japanese Buddhist order","Buddhist order ,","order , to",", to be","to be shared","be shared and","shared and to","and to be","to be meaningful","be meaningful for","meaningful for everyone","As the clergy","the clergy ,","clergy , artists",", artists ,","artists , and",", and local","and local communities","local communities collaborated","communities collaborated ,","collaborated , they",", they realized","they realized a","realized a transcendence","a transcendence of","transcendence of difference","of difference and","difference and spirit","and spirit of","spirit of harmony","The film shares","film shares their","shares their experience","their experience ,","experience , as",", as sung","as sung in","sung in Swahili","in Swahili :","Swahili : '",": ' Mother","' Mother Africa","Mother Africa ,","Africa , home",", home to","home to the","to the human","the human soul","human soul ,","soul , we",", we all","we all have","all have one","have one heart","one heart ,","heart , one",", one love","We are all","are all family","We your children","your children return","children return with","return with a","with a gift","a gift :","gift : a",": a ceremony","a ceremony of","ceremony of fire","of fire (","fire ( awakening","( awakening )","awakening ) .",") .

{"title":"10 Things I Hate About Life","plot":"Romantic-comedic about a young woman and a young man (McDonell - 'Prom') who meet and fall in love - just when they are about to kill themselves. Their crazy shared experiences and similar emotional state forms a bond that draws them both into happiness and takes them on a rollercoaster ride of young love in a world where emotions runs high. A thematic sequel to Heath Ledger's '10 Things I Hate About You', you might say this is oddly titled and themed given what happened. The director of the original, and the spin-off TV show, returns following 15 years of TV mediocrity. Evan Rachel Wood has a track record of interesting choices, so this could go either way.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Romantic-comed","about","a","young","woman","and","a","young","man","(","McDonel","-","'","Prom","'",")","who","meet","and","fall","in","love","-","just","when","they","are","about","to","kill","themselv",".","Their","crazi","share","experi","and","similar","emot","state","form","a","bond","that","draw","them","both","into","happi","and","take","them","on","a","rollercoast","ride","of","young","love","in","a","world","where","emot","run","high",".","A","themat","sequel","to","Heath","Ledger","'s","10","Thing","I","Hate","About","You","'",",","you","might","say","this","is","odd","titl","and","theme","given","what","happen",".","The","director","of","the","origin",",","and","the","spin-off","TV","show",",","return","follow","15","year","of","TV","mediocr",".","Evan","Rachel","Wood","has","a","track","record","of","interest","choic",",","so","this","could","go","either","way","."],"lemmas":["romantic-comedic","about","a","young","woman","and","a","young","man","-lrb-","McDonell","-","'","Prom","'","-rrb-","who","meet","and","fall","in","love","-","just","when","they","be","about","to","kill","themselves",".","they","crazy","shared","experience","and","similar","emotional","state","form","a","bond","that","draw","they","both","into","happiness","and","take","they","on","a","rollercoaster","ride","of","young","love","in","a","world","where","emotion","run","high",".","a","thematic","sequel","to","Heath","Ledger","'s","'10","thing","I","hate","about","you","'",",","you","might","say","this","be","oddly","title","and","theme","give","what","happen",".","the","director","of","the","original",",","and","the","spin-off","tv","show",",","return","follow","15","year","of","tv","mediocrity",".","Evan","Rachel","Wood","have","a","track","record","of","interesting","choice",",","so","this","could","go","either","way","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Romantic-comedic about a","about a young","a young woman","young woman and","woman and a","and a young","a young man","young man (","man ( McDonell","( McDonell -","McDonell -

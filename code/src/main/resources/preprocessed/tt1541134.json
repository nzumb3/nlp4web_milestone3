{"title":"The Minutemen Movie","plot":"In a barren desert, surrounded by limitless horizon, there stands a 700 mile perforated barrier separating the haves and the have not's. The sun sets along this rusty fence as a crusty old veteran puffs a cigarette and lowers his binoculars. The day is over, but the cold night is theirs. He lowers the flag, salutes a helicopter passing through the darkness, and settles into his dusty camper for another canned meal alone on Patriot Point.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["In","a","barren","desert",",","surround","by","limitless","horizon",",","there","stand","a","700","mile","perfor","barrier","separ","the","have","and","the","have","not","'s",".","The","sun","set","along","this","rusti","fenc","as","a","crusti","old","veteran","puff","a","cigarett","and","lower","his","binocular",".","The","day","is","over",",","but","the","cold","night","is","their",".","He","lower","the","flag",",","salut","a","helicopt","pass","through","the","dark",",","and","settl","into","his","dusti","camper","for","anoth","can","meal","alon","on","Patriot","Point","."],"lemmas":["in","a","barren","desert",",","surround","by","limitless","horizon",",","there","stand","a","700","mile","perforated","barrier","separate","the","haves","and","the","have","not","'s",".","the","sun","set","along","this","rusty","fence","as","a","crusty","old","veteran","puff","a","cigarette","and","lower","he","binoculars",".","the","day","be","over",",","but","the","cold","night","be","theirs",".","he","lower","the","flag",",","salute","a","helicopter","passing","through","the","darkness",",","and","settle","into","he","dusty","camper","for","another","can","meal","alone","on","Patriot","Point","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a barren","a barren desert","barren desert ,","desert , surrounded",", surrounded by","surrounded by limitless","by limitless horizon","limitless horizon ,","horizon , there",", there stands","there stands a","stands a 700","a 700 mile","700 mile perforated","mile perforated barrier","perforated barrier separating","barrier separating the","separating the haves","the haves and","haves and the","and the have","the have not","have not 's","The sun sets","sun sets along","sets along this","along this rusty","this rusty fence","rusty fence as","fence as a","as a crusty","a crusty old","crusty old veteran","old veteran puffs","veteran puffs a","puffs a cigarette","a cigarette and","cigarette and lowers","and lowers his","lowers his binoculars","The day is","day is over","is over ,","over , but",", but the","but the cold","the cold night","cold night is","night is theirs","He lowers the","lowers the flag","the flag ,","flag , salutes",", salutes a","salutes a helicopter","a helicopter passing","helicopter passing through","passing through the","through the darkness","the darkness ,","darkness , and",", and settles","and settles into","settles into his","into his dusty","his dusty camper","dusty camper for","camper for another","for another canned","another canned meal","canned meal alone","meal alone on","alone on Patriot","on Patriot Point"],"2grams":["In a","a barren","barren desert","desert ,",", surrounded","surrounded by","by limitless","limitless horizon","horizon ,",", there","there stands","stands a","a 700","700 mile","mile perforated","perforated barrier","barrier separating","separating the","the haves","haves and","and the","the have","have not","not 's","The sun","sun sets","sets along","along this","this rusty","rusty fence","fence as","as a","a crusty","crusty old","old veteran","veteran puffs","puffs a","a cigarette","cigarette and","and lowers","lowers his","his binoculars","The day","day is","is over","over ,",", but","but the","the cold","cold night","night is","is theirs","He lowers","lowers the","the flag","flag ,",", salutes","salutes a","a helicopter","helicopter passing","passing through","through the","the darkness","darkness ,",", and","and settles","settles into","into his","his dusty","dusty camper","camper for","for another","another canned","canned meal","meal alone","alone on","on Patriot","Patriot Point"]}

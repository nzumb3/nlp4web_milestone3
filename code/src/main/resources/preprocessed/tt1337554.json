{"title":"This Is Berlin Not New York","plot":"This documentary traces the journey of fifteen young, talented New York Artists to Berlin, as they meet and join forces with their German counterparts. Together, the American and German artists explore artistic ideas and concepts while collaborating on original projects that push conventional boundaries. Original musical scores and animated artwork complement and enhance this provocative examination of western contemporary art and the ongoing tension between commercialism and creativity for its own sake.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","trace","the","journey","of","fifteen","young",",","talent","New","York","Artist","to","Berlin",",","as","they","meet","and","join","forc","with","their","German","counterpart",".","Togeth",",","the","American","and","German","artist","explor","artist","idea","and","concept","while","collabor","on","origin","project","that","push","convent","boundari",".","Origin","music","score","and","anim","artwork","complement","and","enhanc","this","provoc","examin","of","western","contemporari","art","and","the","ongo","tension","between","commerci","and","creativ","for","it","own","sake","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","trace","the","journey","of","fifteen","young",",","talented","New","York","Artists","to","Berlin",",","as","they","meet","and","join","force","with","they","german","counterpart",".","together",",","the","american","and","german","artist","explore","artistic","idea","and","concept","while","collaborate","on","original","project","that","push","conventional","boundary",".","original","musical","score","and","animated","artwork","complement","and","enhance","this","provocative","examination","of","western","contemporary","art","and","the","ongoing","tension","between","commercialism","and","creativity","for","its","own","sake","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary traces","documentary traces the","traces the journey","the journey of","journey of fifteen","of fifteen young","fifteen young ,","young , talented",", talented New","talented New York","New York Artists","York Artists to","Artists to Berlin","to Berlin ,","Berlin , as",", as they","as they meet","they meet and","meet and join","and join forces","join forces with","forces with their","with their German","their German counterparts","Together , the",", the American","the American and","American and German","and German artists","German artists explore","artists explore artistic","explore artistic ideas","artistic ideas and","ideas and concepts","and concepts while","concepts while collaborating","while collaborating on","collaborating on original","on original projects","original projects that","projects that push","that push conventional","push conventional boundaries","Original musical scores","musical scores and","scores and animated","and animated artwork","animated artwork complement","artwork complement and","complement and enhance","and enhance this","enhance this provocative","this provocative examination","provocative examination of","examination of western","of western contemporary","western contemporary art","contemporary art and","art and the","and the ongoing","the ongoing tension","ongoing tension between","tension between commercialism","between commercialism and","commercialism and creativity","and creativity for","creativity for its","for its own","its own sake"],"2grams":["This documentary","documentary traces","traces the","the journey","journey of","of fifteen","fifteen young","young ,",", talented","talented New","New York","York Artists","Artists to","to Berlin","Berlin ,",", as","as they","they meet","meet and","and join","join forces","forces with","with their","their German","German counterparts","Together ,",", the","the American","American and","and German","German artists","artists explore","explore artistic","artistic ideas","ideas and","and concepts","concepts while","while collaborating","collaborating on","on original","original projects","projects that","that push","push conventional","conventional boundaries","Original musical","musical scores","scores and","and animated","animated artwork","artwork complement","complement and","and enhance","enhance this","this provocative","provocative examination","examination of","of western","western contemporary","contemporary art","art and","and the","the ongoing","ongoing tension","tension between","between commercialism","commercialism and","and creativity","creativity for","for its","its own","own sake"]}

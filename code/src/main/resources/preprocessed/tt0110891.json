{"title":"Royal Deceit","plot":"This re-telling of Hamlet goes back to the original Danish source material. The opening scenario remains the same: Hamlet's father murdered by his brother who then weds the widowed mother. Hamlet must discover his strength and leadership that will allow him to regain his rightful throne. Don't expect an ending which matches the Bard's though, this is more like a true Viking epic.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"],"stems":["This","re-tel","of","Hamlet","goe","back","to","the","origin","Danish","sourc","materi",".","The","open","scenario","remain","the","same",":","Hamlet","'s","father","murder","by","his","brother","who","then","wed","the","widow","mother",".","Hamlet","must","discov","his","strength","and","leadership","that","will","allow","him","to","regain","his","right","throne",".","Do","n't","expect","an","end","which","match","the","Bard","'s","though",",","this","is","more","like","a","true","Vike","epic","."],"lemmas":["this","re-telling","of","Hamlet","go","back","to","the","original","danish","source","material",".","the","open","scenario","remain","the","same",":","Hamlet","'s","father","murder","by","he","brother","who","then","wed","the","widow","mother",".","Hamlet","must","discover","he","strength","and","leadership","that","will","allow","he","to","regain","he","rightful","throne",".","do","not","expect","a","ending","which","match","the","Bard","'s","though",",","this","be","more","like","a","true","viking","epic","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This re-telling of","re-telling of Hamlet","of Hamlet goes","Hamlet goes back","goes back to","back to the","to the original","the original Danish","original Danish source","Danish source material","The opening scenario","opening scenario remains","scenario remains the","remains the same","the same :","same : Hamlet",": Hamlet 's","Hamlet 's father","'s father murdered","father murdered by","murdered by his","by his brother","his brother who","brother who then","who then weds","then weds the","weds the widowed","the widowed mother","Hamlet must discover","must discover his","discover his strength","his strength and","strength and leadership","and leadership that","leadership that will","that will allow","will allow him","allow him to","him to regain","to regain his","regain his rightful","his rightful throne","Do n't expect","n't expect an","expect an ending","an ending which","ending which matches","which matches the","matches the Bard","the Bard 's","Bard 's though","'s though ,","though , this",", this is","this is more","is more like","more like a","like a true","a true Viking","true Viking epic"],"2grams":["This re-telling","re-telling of","of Hamlet","Hamlet goes","goes back","back to","to the","the original","original Danish","Danish source","source material","The opening","opening scenario","scenario remains","remains the","the same","same :",": Hamlet","Hamlet 's","'s father","father murdered","murdered by","by his","his brother","brother who","who then","then weds","weds the","the widowed","widowed mother","Hamlet must","must discover","discover his","his strength","strength and","and leadership","leadership that","that will","will allow","allow him","him to","to regain","regain his","his rightful","rightful throne","Do n't","n't expect","expect an","an ending","ending which","which matches","matches the","the Bard","Bard 's","'s though","though ,",", this","this is","is more","more like","like a","a true","true Viking","Viking epic"]}

{"title":"Ma vie en l'air","plot":"An instructor for an airline company, Yann Kerbec, uses flight simulators to evaluate pilots' abilities to handle extreme conditions. But Yann has a small problem: he's afraid of flying, a debilitating panic linked to his birth and which, in his youth, stopped him from following the woman of his dreams to the end of the world. Today Yann is thirty years old. With nostalgia and humor, he reflects upon his trauma and delivers a scathing stocktaking of his love affairs that turned to custard because of his phobia. What, with his crusade to increase airline security and trying to manage his disastrous love life, Yann has reached a crossroads: he must overcome his demons and accept to grow up.","genres":["Comedy","

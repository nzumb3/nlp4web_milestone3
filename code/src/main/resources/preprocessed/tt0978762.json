{"title":"Mary and Max","plot":"In the mid-1970's, a homely, friendless Australian girl of 8 picks a name out of a Manhattan phone book and writes to him; she includes a chocolate bar. She's Mary Dinkle, the only child of an alcoholic mother and a distracted father. He's Max Horowitz, an overweight man with Asperger's, living alone in New York. He writes back, with chocolate. Thus begins a 20-year correspondence, interrupted by a stay in an asylum and a few misunderstandings. Mary falls in love with a neighbor, saves money to have a birthmark removed and deals with loss. Max has a friendship with a neighbor, tries to control his weight, and finally gets the dream job. Will the two ever meet face to face?","genres":["Animation"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["In","the","mid-1970","'s",",","a","home",",","friendless","Australian","girl","of","8","pick","a","name","out","of","a","Manhattan","phone","book","and","write","to","him",";","she","includ","a","chocol","bar",".","She","'s","Mari","Dinkl",",","the","onli","child","of","an","alcohol","mother","and","a","distract","father",".","He","'s","Max","Horowitz",",","an","overweight","man","with","Asperger","'s",",","live","alon","in","New","York",".","He","write","back",",","with","chocol",".","Thus","begin","a","20-year","correspond",",","interrupt","by","a","stay","in","an","asylum","and","a","few","misunderstand",".","Mari","fall","in","love","with","a","neighbor",",","save","money","to","have","a","birthmark","remov","and","deal","with","loss",".","Max","has","a","friendship","with","a","neighbor",",","tri","to","control","his","weight",",","and","final","get","the","dream","job",".","Will","the","two","ever","meet","face","to","face","?"],"lemmas":["in","the","mid-1970","'s",",","a","homely",",","friendless","australian","girl","of","8","pick","a","name","out","of","a","Manhattan","phone","book","and","write","to","he",";","she","include","a","chocolate","bar",".","she","be","Mary","Dinkle",",","the","only","child","of","a","alcoholic","mother","and","a","distract","father",".","he","be","Max","Horowitz",",","a","overweight","man","with","Asperger","'s",",","live","alone","in","New","York",".","he","write","back",",","with","chocolate",".","thus","begin","a","20-year","correspondence",",","interrupt","by","a","stay","in","a","asylum","and","a","few","misunderstanding",".","Mary","fall","in","love","with","a","neighbor",",","save","money","to","have","a","birthmark","remove","and","deal","with","loss",".","Max","have","a","friendship","with","a","neighbor",",","try","to","control","he","weight",",","and","finally","get","the","dream","job",".","will","the","two","ever","meet","face","to","face","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the mid-1970","the mid-1970 's","mid-1970 's ,","'s , a",", a homely","a homely ,","homely , friendless",", friendless Australian","friendless Australian girl","Australian girl of","girl of 8","of 8 picks","8 picks a","picks a name","a name out","name out of","out of a","of a Manhattan","a Manhattan phone","Manhattan phone book","phone book and","book and writes","and writes to","writes to him","to him ;","him ;

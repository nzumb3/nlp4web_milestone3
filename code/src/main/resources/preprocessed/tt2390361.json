{"title":"Enough Said","plot":"A divorced and single parent, Eva (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) spends her days enjoying work as a masseuse but dreading her daughter's impending departure for college. She meets Albert (James Gandolfini) - a sweet, funny and like-minded man also facing an empty nest. As their romance quickly blossoms, Eva befriends Marianne (Catherine Keener), her new massage client. Marianne is a beautiful poet who seems \"almost perfect\" except for one prominent quality: she rags on her ex-husband way too much. Suddenly, Eva finds herself doubting her own relationship with Albert as she learns the truth about Marianne's ex.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["A","divorc","and","singl","parent",",","Eva","(","Julia","Louis-Dreyfus",")","spend","her","day","enjoy","work","as","a","masseus","but","dread","her","daughter","'s","impend","departur","for","colleg",".","She","meet","Albert","(","Jame","Gandolfini",")","-","a","sweet",",","funni","and","like-mind","man","also","face","an","empti","nest",".","As","their","romanc","quick","blossom",",","Eva","befriend","Mariann","(","Catherin","Keener",")",",","her","new","massag","client",".","Mariann","is","a","beauti","poet","who","seem","\"","almost","perfect","\"","except","for","one","promin","qualiti",":","she","rag","on","her","ex-husband","way","too","much",".","Sudden",",","Eva","find","herself","doubt","her","own","relationship","with","Albert","as","she","learn","the","truth","about","Mariann","'s","ex","."],"lemmas":["a","divorce","and","single","parent",",","Eva","-lrb-","Julia","Louis-Dreyfus","-rrb-","spend","she","day","enjoy","work","as","a","masseuse","but","dread","she","daughter","'s","impending","departure","for","college",".","she","meet","Albert","-lrb-","James","Gandolfini","-rrb-","-","a","sweet",",","funny","and","like-minded","man","also","face","a","empty","nest",".","as","they","romance","quickly","blossom",",","Eva","befriend","Marianne","-lrb-","Catherine","Keener","-rrb-",",","she","new","massage","client",".","Marianne","be","a","beautiful","poet","who","seem","``","almost","perfect","''","except","for","one","prominent","quality",":","she","rag","on","she","ex-husband","way","too","much",".","suddenly",",","Eva","find","herself","doubt","she","own","relationship","with","Albert","as","she","learn","the","truth","about","Marianne","'s","ex","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A divorced and","divorced and single","and single parent","single parent ,","parent , Eva",", Eva (","Eva ( Julia","( Julia Louis-Dreyfus","Julia Louis-Dreyfus )","Louis-Dreyfus ) spends",") spends her","spends her days","her days enjoying","days enjoying work","enjoying work as","work as a","as a masseuse","a masseuse but","masseuse but dreading","but dreading her","dreading her daughter","her daughter 's","daughter 's impending","'s impending departure","impending departure for","departure for college","She meets Albert","meets Albert (","Albert ( James","( James Gandolfini","James Gandolfini )","Gandolfini ) -",") -

{"title":"Pausa italiana","plot":"In 1998 it seemed impossible to Balagura to make films in the Ukraine without becoming a slave to television; he therefore left for Italy, the \"country of culture\". With no immigration papers, with a wife and two children, the less agreeable realities of his situation soon caught up with him. In 2004, armed with a basic mini-DV camera borrowed from a friend, in the company of a casual acquaintance who agreed to act as camera operator, he shot 'Pausa Italiana'. From a small village in the Abruzzi region, with which he was well acquainted, he observed the reality surrounding him; he also turned the camera upon his own status as migrant, a situation which no documentarist would be capable of capturing. Permitting himself a rather unusual temporality, he allies the precision of his recordings with a fragmentary narrative of great literary quality. The combination of these two elements gives the film a very particular quality: auto-fiction and ethnography intersect to form an Aristotelian poetic, which avoids any separation between self and other, observer and observed, the real and the cosmic.","genres":["Biography"],"stems":["In","1998","it","seem","imposs","to","Balagura","to","make","film","in","the","Ukrain","without","becom","a","slave","to","televis",";","he","therefor","left","for","Itali",",","the","\"","countri","of","cultur","\"",".","With","no","immigr","paper",",","with","a","wife","and","two","children",",","the","less","agreeabl","realiti","of","his","situat","soon","caught","up","with","him",".","In","2004",",","arm","with","a","basic","mini-DV","camera","borrow","from","a","friend",",","in","the","compani","of","a","casual","acquaint","who","agre","to","act","as","camera","oper",",","he","shot","'","Pausa","Italiana","'",".","From","a","small","villag","in","the","Abruzzi","region",",","with","which","he","was","well","acquaint",",","he","observ","the","realiti","surround","him",";","he","also","turn","the","camera","upon","his","own","status","as","migrant",",","a","situat","which","no","documentarist","would","be","capabl","of","captur",".","Permit","himself","a","rather","unusu","tempor",",","he","alli","the","precis","of","his","record","with","a","fragmentari","narrat","of","great","literari","qualiti",".","The","combin","of","these","two","element","give","the","film","a","veri","particular","qualiti",":","auto-fict","and","ethnographi","intersect","to","form","an","Aristotelian","poetic",",","which","avoid","ani","separ","between","self","and","other",",","observ","and","observ",",","the","real","and","the","cosmic","."],"lemmas":["in","1998","it","seem","impossible","to","Balagura","to","make","film","in","the","Ukraine","without","become","a","slave","to","television",";","he","therefore","leave","for","Italy",",","the","``","country","of","culture","''",".","with","no","immigration","papers",",","with","a","wife","and","two","child",",","the","less","agreeable","reality","of","he","situation","soon","catch","up","with","he",".","in","2004",",","arm","with","a","basic","mini-dv","camera","borrow","from","a","friend",",","in","the","company","of","a","casual","acquaintance","who","agree","to","act","as","camera","operator",",","he","shoot","'","Pausa","Italiana","'",".","from","a","small","village","in","the","Abruzzi","region",",","with","which","he","be","well","acquaint",",","he","observe","the","reality","surround","he",";","he","also","turn","the","camera","upon","he","own","status","as","migrant",",","a","situation","which","no","documentarist","would","be","capable","of","capture",".","permit","himself","a","rather","unusual","temporality",",","he","ally","the","precision","of","he","recording","with","a","fragmentary","narrative","of","great","literary","quality",".","the","combination","of","these","two","element","give","the","film","a","very","particular","quality",":","auto-fiction","and","ethnography","intersect","to","form","a","aristotelian","poetic",",","which","avoid","any","separation","between","self","and","other",",","observer","and","observe",",","the","real","and","the","cosmic","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1998 it","1998 it seemed","it seemed impossible","seemed impossible to","impossible to Balagura","to Balagura to","Balagura to make","to make films","make films in","films in the","in the Ukraine","the Ukraine without","Ukraine without becoming","without becoming a","becoming a slave","a slave to","slave to television","to television ;","television ;

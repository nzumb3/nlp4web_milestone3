{"title":"Adela","plot":"Bolivia, 1945. Two murders have been committed in Hotel Central, the inhospitable meeting point of the mixture of indigenous, Creole and European people who live in San Jacinto, a city of despair. Adela, the attractive owner's wife, blames Maria, one of the servants. But Timar, a young traveler, finds out some information that suggests a very different truth. In an oppressive atmosphere, where escaping seems to be the only thing that matters, Timar will struggle between his feelings for Adela and the injustice of convicting an innocent person. The risk of it is losing the few values he still has; the reward, experiencing love at its most.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Bolivia",",","1945",".","Two","murder","have","been","commit","in","Hotel","Central",",","the","inhospit","meet","point","of","the","mixtur","of","indigen",",","Creol","and","European","peopl","who","live","in","San","Jacinto",",","a","citi","of","despair",".","Adela",",","the","attract","owner","'s","wife",",","blame","Maria",",","one","of","the","servant",".","But","Timar",",","a","young","travel",",","find","out","some","inform","that","suggest","a","veri","differ","truth",".","In","an","oppress","atmospher",",","where","escap","seem","to","be","the","onli","thing","that","matter",",","Timar","will","struggl","between","his","feel","for","Adela","and","the","injustic","of","convict","an","innoc","person",".","The","risk","of","it","is","lose","the","few","valu","he","still","has",";","the","reward",",","experienc","love","at","it","most","."],"lemmas":["Bolivia",",","1945",".","two","murder","have","be","commit","in","Hotel","Central",",","the","inhospitable","meeting","point","of","the","mixture","of","indigenous",",","Creole","and","european","people","who","live","in","San","Jacinto",",","a","city","of","despair",".","Adela",",","the","attractive","owner","'s","wife",",","blame","Maria",",","one","of","the","servant",".","but","Timar",",","a","young","traveler",",","find","out","some","information","that","suggest","a","very","different","truth",".","in","a","oppressive","atmosphere",",","where","escape","seem","to","be","the","only","thing","that","matter",",","Timar","will","struggle","between","he","feeling","for","Adela","and","the","injustice","of","convict","a","innocent","person",".","the","risk","of","it","be","lose","the","few","value","he","still","have",";","the","reward",",","experience","love","at","its","most","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bolivia , 1945","Two murders have","murders have been","have been committed","been committed in","committed in Hotel","in Hotel Central","Hotel Central ,","Central , the",", the inhospitable","the inhospitable meeting","inhospitable meeting point","meeting point of","point of the","of the mixture","the mixture of","mixture of indigenous","of indigenous ,","indigenous , Creole",", Creole and","Creole and European","and European people","European people who","people who live","who live in","live in San","in San Jacinto","San Jacinto ,","Jacinto , a",", a city","a city of","city of despair","Adela , the",", the attractive","the attractive owner","attractive owner 's","owner 's wife","'s wife ,","wife , blames",", blames Maria","blames Maria ,","Maria , one",", one of","one of the","of the servants","But Timar ,","Timar , a",", a young","a young traveler","young traveler ,","traveler , finds",", finds out","finds out some","out some information","some information that","information that suggests","that suggests a","suggests a very","a very different","very different truth","In an oppressive","an oppressive atmosphere","oppressive atmosphere ,","atmosphere , where",", where escaping","where escaping seems","escaping seems to","seems to be","to be the","be the only","the only thing","only thing that","thing that matters","that matters ,","matters , Timar",", Timar will","Timar will struggle","will struggle between","struggle between his","between his feelings","his feelings for","feelings for Adela","for Adela and","Adela and the","and the injustice","the injustice of","injustice of convicting","of convicting an","convicting an innocent","an innocent person","The risk of","risk of it","of it is","it is losing","is losing the","losing the few","the few values","few values he","values he still","he still has","still has ;","has ;

{"title":"Life or Death","plot":"David Kaczynski reveals the untold story of turning in the most sort after criminal in US history, his brother Ted, the notorious Unabomber. Little did anyone foresee that in turning in your own brother, it changes how the game is played. No longer is there an \"us vs. them\". We are one. Piecing his own life back together, David's journey intersects with three others, Gary, Bud and Bill, who together put a face on the death penalty and unexpectedly place the American justice system on trial. In An American Journey we follow these four men as they travel from New York to Texas, from Oklahoma to California on a road that takes them beyond crime and punishment and into their hearts and minds. Now each must learn to make the most of his own disturbing fate.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["David","Kaczynski","reveal","the","untold","stori","of","turn","in","the","most","sort","after","crimin","in","US","histori",",","his","brother","Ted",",","the","notori","Unabomb",".","Littl","did","anyon","forese","that","in","turn","in","your","own","brother",",","it","chang","how","the","game","is","play",".","No","longer","is","there","an","\"","us","vs.","them","\"",".","We","are","one",".","Piec","his","own","life","back","togeth",",","David","'s","journey","intersect","with","three","other",",","Gari",",","Bud","and","Bill",",","who","togeth","put","a","face","on","the","death","penalti","and","unexpect","place","the","American","justic","system","on","trial",".","In","An","American","Journey","we","follow","these","four","men","as","they","travel","from","New","York","to","Texa",",","from","Oklahoma","to","California","on","a","road","that","take","them","beyond","crime","and","punish","and","into","their","heart","and","mind",".","Now","each","must","learn","to","make","the","most","of","his","own","disturb","fate","."],"lemmas":["David","Kaczynski","reveal","the","untold","story","of","turn","in","the","most","sort","after","criminal","in","US","history",",","he","brother","Ted",",","the","notorious","Unabomber",".","Little","do","anyone","foresee","that","in","turn","in","you","own","brother",",","it","change","how","the","game","be","play",".","no","longer","be","there","a","``","we","vs.","they","''",".","we","be","one",".","piece","he","own","life","back","together",",","David","'s","journey","intersect","with","three","other",",","Gary",",","Bud","and","Bill",",","who","together","put","a","face","on","the","death","penalty","and","unexpectedly","place","the","american","justice","system","on","trial",".","in","a","american","journey","we","follow","these","four","man","as","they","travel","from","New","York","to","Texas",",","from","Oklahoma","to","California","on","a","road","that","take","they","beyond","crime","and","punishment","and","into","they","heart","and","mind",".","now","each","must","learn","to","make","the","most","of","he","own","disturbing","fate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["David

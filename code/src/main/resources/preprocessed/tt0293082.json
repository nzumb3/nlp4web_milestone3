{"title":"Delbaran","plot":"Acclaimed director Abolfazl Jalili offers a compassionate story of the young Afghan refugee who lives illegally in Iran. 14-year-old Kaim drifts to the Delbaran crossing on the Afghan-Iran border, where he finds work at a coffee shop frequented by truck drivers. He feels at home in this small oasis of friendliness, though the sounds of war can be heard in the background, violent bandits prowl the roads, and opium is everywhere. As we watch Kaim run from one task to another day after day, we soon realize that we are watching a boy who is being cheated out of his childhood.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Acclaim","director","Abolfazl","Jalili","offer","a","compassion","stori","of","the","young","Afghan","refuge","who","live","illeg","in","Iran",".","14-year-old","Kaim","drift","to","the","Delbaran","cross","on","the","Afghan-Iran","border",",","where","he","find","work","at","a","coffe","shop","frequent","by","truck","driver",".","He","feel","at","home","in","this","small","oasi","of","friendli",",","though","the","sound","of","war","can","be","heard","in","the","background",",","violent","bandit","prowl","the","road",",","and","opium","is","everywher",".","As","we","watch","Kaim","run","from","one","task","to","anoth","day","after","day",",","we","soon","realiz","that","we","are","watch","a","boy","who","is","be","cheat","out","of","his","childhood","."],"lemmas":["acclaimed","director","Abolfazl","Jalili","offer","a","compassionate","story","of","the","young","Afghan","refugee","who","live","illegally","in","Iran",".","14-year-old","Kaim","drift","to","the","Delbaran","cross","on","the","afghan-iran","border",",","where","he","find","work","at","a","coffee","shop","frequent","by","truck","driver",".","he","feel","at","home","in","this","small","oasis","of","friendliness",",","though","the","sound","of","war","can","be","hear","in","the","background",",","violent","bandit","prowl","the","road",",","and","opium","be","everywhere",".","as","we","watch","Kaim","run","from","one","task","to","another","day","after","day",",","we","soon","realize","that","we","be","watch","a","boy","who","be","be","cheat","out","of","he","childhood","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Acclaimed director Abolfazl","director Abolfazl Jalili","Abolfazl Jalili offers","Jalili offers a","offers a compassionate","a compassionate story","compassionate story of","story of the","of the young","the young Afghan","young Afghan refugee","Afghan refugee who","refugee who lives","who lives illegally","lives illegally in","illegally in Iran","14-year-old Kaim drifts","Kaim drifts to","drifts to the","to the Delbaran","the Delbaran crossing","Delbaran crossing on","crossing on the","on the Afghan-Iran","the Afghan-Iran border","Afghan-Iran border ,","border , where",", where he","where he finds","he finds work","finds work at","work at a","at a coffee","a coffee shop","coffee shop frequented","shop frequented by","frequented by truck","by truck drivers","He feels at","feels at home","at home in","home in this","in this small","this small oasis","small oasis of","oasis of friendliness","of friendliness ,","friendliness , though",", though the","though the sounds","the sounds of","sounds of war","of war can","war can be","can be heard","be heard in","heard in the","in the background","the background ,","background , violent",", violent bandits","violent bandits prowl","bandits prowl the","prowl the roads","the roads ,","roads , and",", and opium","and opium is","opium is everywhere","As we watch","we watch Kaim","watch Kaim run","Kaim run from","run from one","from one task","one task to","task to another","to another day","another day after","day after day","after day ,","day , we",", we soon","we soon realize","soon realize that","realize that we","that we are","we are watching","are watching a","watching a boy","a boy who","boy who is","who is being","is being cheated","being cheated out","cheated out of","out of his","of his childhood"],"2grams":["Acclaimed director","director Abolfazl","Abolfazl Jalili","Jalili offers","offers a","a compassionate","compassionate story","story of","of the","the young","young Afghan","Afghan refugee","refugee who","who lives","lives illegally","illegally in","in Iran","14-year-old Kaim","Kaim drifts","drifts to","to the","the Delbaran","Delbaran crossing","crossing on","on the","the Afghan-Iran","Afghan-Iran border","border ,",", where","where he","he finds","finds work","work at","at a","a coffee","coffee shop","shop frequented","frequented by","by truck","truck drivers","He feels","feels at","at home","home in","in this","this small","small oasis","oasis of","of friendliness","friendliness ,",", though","though the","the sounds","sounds of","of war","war can","can be","be heard","heard in","in the","the background","background ,",", violent","violent bandits","bandits prowl","prowl the","the roads","roads ,",", and","and opium","opium is","is everywhere","As we","we watch","watch Kaim","Kaim run","run from","from one","one task","task to","to another","another day","day after","after day","day ,",", we","we soon","soon realize","realize that","that we","we are","are watching","watching a","a boy","boy who","who is","is being","being cheated","cheated out","out of","of his","his childhood"]}

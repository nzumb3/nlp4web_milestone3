{"title":"Major Payne","plot":"Major Benson Winifred Payne is being discharged from the Marines. Payne is a killin' machine, but the wars of the world are no longer fought on the battlefield. A career Marine, he has no idea what to do as a civilian, so his commander finds him a job - commanding officer of a local school's JROTC program, a bunch or ragtag losers with no hope. Using such teaching tools as live grenades and real bullets, Payne starts to instill the Corps with some hope. But when Payne is recalled to fight in Bosnia, will he leave the Corps that has just started to believe in him, or will he find out that killin' ain't much of a livin'?","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Comedy"],"stems":["Major","Benson","Winifr","Payn","is","be","discharg","from","the","Marin",".","Payn","is","a","killin","'","machin",",","but","the","war","of","the","world","are","no","longer","fought","on","the","battlefield",".","A","career","Marin",",","he","has","no","idea","what","to","do","as","a","civilian",",","so","his","command","find","him","a","job","-","command","offic","of","a","local","school","'s","JROTC","program",",","a","bunch","or","ragtag","loser","with","no","hope",".","Using","such","teach","tool","as","live","grenad","and","real","bullet",",","Payn","start","to","instil","the","Corp","with","some","hope",".","But","when","Payn","is","recal","to","fight","in","Bosnia",",","will","he","leav","the","Corp","that","has","just","start","to","believ","in","him",",","or","will","he","find","out","that","killin","'","ai","n't","much","of","a","livin","'","?"],"lemmas":["Major","Benson","Winifred","Payne","be","be","discharge","from","the","Marines",".","Payne","be","a","killin","'","machine",",","but","the","war","of","the","world","be","no","longer","fight","on","the","battlefield",".","a","career","Marine",",","he","have","no","idea","what","to","do","as","a","civilian",",","so","he","commander","find","he","a","job","-","command","officer","of","a","local","school","'s","JROTC","program",",","a","bunch","or","ragtag","loser","with","no","hope",".","use","such","teaching","tool","as","live","grenade","and","real","bullet",",","Payne","start","to","instill","the","Corps","with","some","hope",".","but","when","Payne","be","recall","to","fight","in","Bosnia",",","will","he","leave","the","Corps","that","have","just","start","to","believe","in","he",",","or","will","he","find","out","that","killin","'","be","not","much","of","a","livin","'","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Major Benson Winifred","Benson Winifred Payne","Winifred Payne is","Payne is being","is being discharged","being discharged from","discharged from the","from the Marines","Payne is a","is a killin","a killin '","killin ' machine","' machine ,","machine , but",", but the","but the wars","the wars of","wars of the","of the world","the world are","world are no","are no longer","no longer fought","longer fought on","fought on the","on the battlefield","A career Marine","career Marine ,","Marine , he",", he has","he has no","has no idea","no idea what","idea what to","what to do","to do as","do as a","as a civilian","a civilian ,","civilian , so",", so his","so his commander","his commander finds","commander finds him","finds him a","him a job","a job -","job -

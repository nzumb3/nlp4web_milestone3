{"title":"El Amparo","plot":"At the end of the 80's, by the creeks of the Arauca river, near the Colombian-Venezuelan border, two men survived the brutality of a shooting in which 14 of their mates were killed. They claimed to be mere fishermen, but the Venezuelan army accused them to be guerrilla fighters, intimidating them in every possible way and even attempting to remove them from the cell where they were guarded by a policeman. Their neighbors prevented their transfer, but the pressure they faced to give in and submit the official version was overwhelming.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["At","the","end","of","the","80","'s",",","by","the","creek","of","the","Arauca","river",",","near","the","Colombian-Venezuelan","border",",","two","men","surviv","the","brutal","of","a","shoot","in","which","14","of","their","mate","were","kill",".","They","claim","to","be","mere","fishermen",",","but","the","Venezuelan","armi","accus","them","to","be","guerrilla","fighter",",","intimid","them","in","everi","possibl","way","and","even","attempt","to","remov","them","from","the","cell","where","they","were","guard","by","a","policeman",".","Their","neighbor","prevent","their","transfer",",","but","the","pressur","they","face","to","give","in","and","submit","the","offici","version","was","overwhelm","."],"lemmas":["at","the","end","of","the","80","'s",",","by","the","creek","of","the","Arauca","river",",","near","the","Colombian-Venezuelan","border",",","two","man","survive","the","brutality","of","a","shooting","in","which","14","of","they","mate","be","kill",".","they","claim","to","be","mere","fisherman",",","but","the","venezuelan","army","accuse","they","to","be","guerrilla","fighter",",","intimidate","they","in","every","possible","way","and","even","attempt","to","remove","they","from","the","cell","where","they","be","guard","by","a","policeman",".","they","neighbor","prevent","they","transfer",",","but","the","pressure","they","face","to","give","in","and","submit","the","official","version","be","overwhelming","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["At the end","the end of","end of the","of the 80","the 80 's","80 's ,","'s , by",", by the","by the creeks","the creeks of","creeks of the","of the Arauca","the Arauca river","Arauca river ,","river , near",", near the","near the Colombian-Venezuelan","the Colombian-Venezuelan border","Colombian-Venezuelan border ,","border , two",", two men","two men survived","men survived the","survived the brutality","the brutality of","brutality of a","of a shooting","a shooting in","shooting in which","in which 14","which 14 of","14 of their","of their mates","their mates were","mates were killed","They claimed to","claimed to be","to be mere","be mere fishermen","mere fishermen ,","fishermen , but",", but the","but the Venezuelan","the Venezuelan army","Venezuelan army accused","army accused them","accused them to","them to be","to be guerrilla","be guerrilla fighters","guerrilla fighters ,","fighters , intimidating",", intimidating them","intimidating them in","them in every","in every possible","every possible way","possible way and","way and even","and even attempting","even attempting to","attempting to remove","to remove them","remove them from","them from the","from the cell","the cell where","cell where they","where they were","they were guarded","were guarded by","guarded by a","by a policeman","Their neighbors prevented","neighbors prevented their","prevented their transfer","their transfer ,","transfer , but",", but the","but the pressure","the pressure they","pressure they faced","they faced to","faced to give","to give in","give in and","in and submit","and submit the","submit the official","the official version","official version was","version was overwhelming"],"2grams":["At the","the end","end of","of the","the 80","80 's","'s ,",", by","by the","the creeks","creeks of","of the","the Arauca","Arauca river","river ,",", near","near the","the Colombian-Venezuelan","Colombian-Venezuelan border","border ,",", two","two men","men survived","survived the","the brutality","brutality of","of a","a shooting","shooting in","in which","which 14","14 of","of their","their mates","mates were","were killed","They claimed","claimed to","to be","be mere","mere fishermen","fishermen ,",", but","but the","the Venezuelan","Venezuelan army","army accused","accused them","them to","to be","be guerrilla","guerrilla fighters","fighters ,",", intimidating","intimidating them","them in","in every","every possible","possible way","way and","and even","even attempting","attempting to","to remove","remove them","them from","from the","the cell","cell where","where they","they were","were guarded","guarded by","by a","a policeman","Their neighbors","neighbors prevented","prevented their","their transfer","transfer ,",", but","but the","the pressure","pressure they","they faced","faced to","to give","give in","in and","and submit","submit the","the official","official version","version was","was overwhelming"]}

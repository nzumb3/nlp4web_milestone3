{"title":"113 Days","plot":"This documentary follows 25 players and 2 coaches from the Division II Stonehill College Women's Lacrosse team in their quest for their first National Championship since 2005. The 2003 women's lacrosse team brought the college their first National Champion in school's history, and this past fall both the 2003 and 2005 teams were inducted into the Stonehill College Hall of Fame. Over the past 7 years, the women's lacrosse program has fought to step out from behind the large shadow of the 2003 and 2005 teams, and create their own footprint in the school's history. Katie Lambert Conover was a member of the 2003 championship team and took over as head coach of the women's lacrosse program in 2008. We will be following the team from their preseason training, to their in season games, and through their post season. We will be tying together the footage with coach and player interviews. This documentary will show the history and traditions of Stonehill's Women's Lacrosse program, and will capture the failures and successes the 2012 team faces as it fights to create it's own place in history.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama","

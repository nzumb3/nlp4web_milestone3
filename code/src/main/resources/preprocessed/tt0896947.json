He survives by poaching animals. His father then trades the animals in the nearest village for the things they need to survive in the wilderness. Marek needs to stay in hiding since it is a war and, if found, he would risk being recruited in the army. His father wouldn't survive on his own. But then one day, an unexpected catch awaits Marek in one of his traps...","genres":["Drama"," War"],"stems":["The","movi","tell","a","drama","of","three","peopl",".","Marek","(","Vojtech","Stepánek",")","live","out","in","the","mountain","with","his","half-dis","father","(","Jan","Novotný",")",",","separ","from","anyon","els",".","He","surviv","by","poach","anim",".","His","father","then","trade","the","anim","in","the","nearest","villag","for","the","thing","they","need","to","surviv","in","the","wilder",".","Marek","need","to","stay","in","hide","sinc","it","is","a","war","and",",","if","found",",","he","would","risk","be","recruit","in","the","armi",".","His","father","would","n't","surviv","on","his","own",".","But","then","one","day",",","an","unexpect","catch","await","Marek","in","one","of","his","trap","..."],"lemmas":["the","movie","tell","a","drama","of","three","people",".","marek","-lrb-","Vojtech","Stepánek","-rrb-","live","out","in","the","mountain","with","he","half-disabled","father","-lrb-","Jan","Novotný","-rrb-",",","separate","from","anyone","else",".","he","survive","by","poach","animal",".","he","father","then","trade","the","animal","in","the","nearest","village","for","the","thing","they","need","to","survive","in","the","wilderness",".","marek","need","to","stay","in","hiding","since","it","be","a","war","and",",","if","find",",","he","would","risk","be","recruit","in","the","army",".","he","father","would","not","survive","on","he","own",".","but","then","one","day",",","a","unexpected","catch","await","marek","in","one","of","he","trap","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The movie tells","movie tells a","tells a drama","a drama of","drama of three","of three people","Marek ( Vojtech","( Vojtech Stepánek","Vojtech Stepánek )","Stepánek ) lives",") lives out","lives out in","out in the","in the mountains","the mountains with","mountains with his","with his half-disabled","his half-disabled father","half-disabled father (","father ( Jan","( Jan Novotný","Jan Novotný )","Novotný ) ,",") , separated",", separated from","separated from anyone","from anyone else","He survives by","survives by poaching","by poaching animals","His father then","father then trades","then trades the","trades the animals","the animals in","animals in the","in the nearest","the nearest village","nearest village for","village for the","for the things","the things they","things they need","they need to","need to survive","to survive in","survive in the","in the wilderness","Marek needs to","needs to stay","to stay in","stay in hiding","in hiding since","hiding since it","since it is","it is a","is a war","a war and","war and ,","and , if",", if found","if found ,","found , he",", he would","he would risk","would risk being","risk being recruited","being recruited in","recruited in the","in the army","His father would","father would n't","would n't survive","n't survive on","survive on his","on his own","But then one","then one day","one day ,","day , an",", an unexpected","an unexpected catch","unexpected catch awaits","catch awaits Marek","awaits Marek in","Marek in one","in one of","one of his","of his traps","his traps ..."],"2grams":["The movie","movie tells","tells a","a drama","drama of","of three","three people","Marek (","( Vojtech","Vojtech Stepánek","Stepánek )",") lives","lives out","out in","in the","the mountains","mountains with","with his","his half-disabled","half-disabled father","father (","( Jan","Jan Novotný","Novotný )",") ,",", separated","separated from","from anyone","anyone else","He survives","survives by","by poaching","poaching animals","His father","father then","then trades","trades the","the animals","animals in","in the","the nearest","nearest village","village for","for the","the things","things they","they need","need to","to survive","survive in","in the","the wilderness","Marek needs","needs to","to stay","stay in","in hiding","hiding since","since it","it is","is a","a war","war and","and ,",", if","if found","found ,",", he","he would","would risk","risk being","being recruited","recruited in","in the","the army","His father","father would","would n't","n't survive","survive on","on his","his own","But then","then one","one day","day ,",", an","an unexpected","unexpected catch","catch awaits","awaits Marek","Marek in","in one","one of","of his","his traps","traps ..."]}

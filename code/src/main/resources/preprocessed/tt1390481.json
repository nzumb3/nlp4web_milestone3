{"title":"Playback","plot":"Friday morning, April 1st. A sleeping Jessica Latham is chloroformed. Her husband Michael calls a friend on the phone and gets his answering machine. While he leaves the message, he's murdered and made to look like he overdosed. However, the murder is recorded onto his friend's machine over the phone. The killer is in a quandary. He must retrieve the tape or risk having his plans shattered. Eddie Flanders, a school teacher, is the unfortunate recipient of the grisly recording. Flanders discounts it as an April Fool's joke. After narrowly escaping an attempt on his life he seeks answers from his deceased friend's wife. The two set out to find the murderer with the help of a detective nearing retirement. No one can be trusted as they're drawn further into a web of corruption, deception and murder - all leading to a violent showdown.","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["Friday","morn",",","April","1st",".","A","sleep","Jessica","Latham","is","chloroform",".","Her","husband","Michael","call","a","friend","on","the","phone","and","get","his","answer","machin",".","While","he","leav","the","messag",",","he","'s","murder","and","made","to","look","like","he","overdos",".","Howev",",","the","murder","is","record","onto","his","friend","'s","machin","over","the","phone",".","The","killer","is","in","a","quandari",".","He","must","retriev","the","tape","or","risk","have","his","plan","shatter",".","Eddie","Flander",",","a","school","teacher",",","is","the","unfortun","recipi","of","the","grisli","record",".","Flander","discount","it","as","an","April","Fool","'s","joke",".","After","narrowli","escap","an","attempt","on","his","life","he","seek","answer","from","his","deceas","friend","'s","wife",".","The","two","set","out","to","find","the","murder","with","the","help","of","a","detect","near","retir",".","No","one","can","be","trust","as","they","re","drawn","further","into","a","web","of","corrupt",",","decept","and","murder","-","all","lead","to","a","violent","showdown","."],"lemmas":["Friday","morning",",","April","1st",".","a","sleep","Jessica","Latham","be","chloroform",".","she","husband","Michael","call","a","friend","on","the","phone","and","get","he","answer","machine",".","while","he","leave","the","message",",","he","be","murder","and","make","to","look","like","he","overdose",".","however",",","the","murder","be","record","onto","he","friend","'s","machine","over","the","phone",".","the","killer","be","in","a","quandary",".","he","must","retrieve","the","tape","or","risk","have","he","plan","shatter",".","Eddie","Flanders",",","a","school","teacher",",","be","the","unfortunate","recipient","of","the","grisly","recording",".","Flanders","discount","it","as","a","April","Fool","'s","joke",".","after","narrowly","escape","a","attempt","on","he","life","he","seek","answer","from","he","deceased","friend","'s","wife",".","the","two","set","out","to","find","the","murderer","with","the","help","of","a","detective","near","retirement",".","no","one","can","be","trust","as","they","be","draw","further","into","a","web","of","corruption",",","deception","and","murder","-","all","lead","to","a","violent","showdown","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Friday morning ,","morning , April",", April 1st","A sleeping Jessica","sleeping Jessica Latham","Jessica Latham is","Latham is chloroformed","Her husband Michael","husband Michael calls","Michael calls a","calls a friend","a friend on","friend on the","on the phone","the phone and","phone and gets","and gets his","gets his answering","his answering machine","While he leaves","he leaves the","leaves the message","the message ,","message , he",", he 's","he 's murdered","'s murdered and","murdered and made","and made to","made to look","to look like","look like he","like he overdosed","However , the",", the murder","the murder is","murder is recorded","is recorded onto","recorded onto his","onto his friend","his friend 's","friend 's machine","'s machine over","machine over the","over the phone","The killer is","killer is in","is in a","in a quandary","He must retrieve","must retrieve the","retrieve the tape","the tape or","tape or risk","or risk having","risk having his","having his plans","his plans shattered","Eddie Flanders ,","Flanders , a",", a school","a school teacher","school teacher ,","teacher , is",", is the","is the unfortunate","the unfortunate recipient","unfortunate recipient of","recipient of the","of the grisly","the grisly recording","Flanders discounts it","discounts it as","it as an","as an April","an April Fool","April Fool 's","Fool 's joke","After narrowly escaping","narrowly escaping an","escaping an attempt","an attempt on","attempt on his","on his life","his life he","life he seeks","he seeks answers","seeks answers from","answers from his","from his deceased","his deceased friend","deceased friend 's","friend 's wife","The two set","two set out","set out to","out to find","to find the","find the murderer","the murderer with","murderer with the","with the help","the help of","help of a","of a detective","a detective nearing","detective nearing retirement","No one can","one can be","can be trusted","be trusted as","trusted as they","as they 're","they 're drawn","'re drawn further","drawn further into","further into a","into a web","a web of","web of corruption","of corruption ,","corruption , deception",", deception and","deception and murder","and murder -","murder -

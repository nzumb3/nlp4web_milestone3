{"title":"Civic Duty","plot":"Shortly after landing a job, Terry Allen is laid off, starts looking for another circa post September 11, 2001 media frenzy and paranoia with President George W. Bush stating that grief has turned to anger, anger to resolution, and that there are thousands of terrorists in over 60 countries ready to strike. With increasing reports of identity theft, the involvement of wealthy & educated foreigners in terrorist activities, Terry starts suspecting his new neighbor, a middle-easterner, who he stereotypes as 'raghead', 'camel jockey', and 'sand nigger'. His wife, Marla, does not share in his bigotry, but he believes that she has turned her attention from rock-stars to Jihadists. While looking for employment, as well as a loan to purchase a house, he also contacts the Federal Bureau of Investigation as he feels he has sufficient evidence that his new neighbor is structuring money, experimenting with chemicals, and associating with other middle-easterners for devious reasons.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Short","after","land","a","job",",","Terri","Allen","is","laid","off",",","start","look","for","anoth","circa","post","Septemb","11",",","2001","media","frenzi","and","paranoia","with","Presid","Georg","W.","Bush","state","that","grief","has","turn","to","anger",",","anger","to","resolut",",","and","that","there","are","thousand","of","terrorist","in","over","60","countri","readi","to","strike",".","With","increas","report","of","ident","theft",",","the","involv","of","wealthi","&","educ","foreign","in","terrorist","activ",",","Terri","start","suspect","his","new","neighbor",",","a","middle-eastern",",","who","he","stereotyp","as","'","raghead","'",",","'","camel","jockey","'",",","and","'","sand","nigger","'",".","His","wife",",","Marla",",","doe","not","share","in","his","bigotri",",","but","he","believ","that","she","has","turn","her","attent","from","rock-star","to","Jihadist",".","While","look","for","employ",",","as","well","as","a","loan","to","purchas","a","hous",",","he","also","contact","the","Feder","Bureau","of","Investig","as","he","feel","he","has","suffici","evid","that","his","new","neighbor","is","structur","money",",","experi","with","chemic",",","and","associ","with","other","middle-eastern","for","devious","reason","."],"lemmas":["shortly","after","land","a","job",",","Terry","Allen","be","lay","off",",","start","look","for","another","circa","post","September","11",",","2001","media","frenzy","and","paranoia","with","President","George","W.","Bush","state","that","grief","have","turn","to","anger",",","anger","to","resolution",",","and","that","there","be","thousand","of","terrorist","in","over","60","country","ready","to","strike",".","with","increase","report","of","identity","theft",",","the","involvement","of","wealthy","&","educate","foreigner","in","terrorist","activity",",","Terry","start","suspect","he","new","neighbor",",","a","middle-easterner",",","who","he","stereotype","as","'","raghead","'",",","'","camel","jockey","'",",","and","'","sand","nigger","'",".","he","wife",",","Marla",",","do","not","share","in","he","bigotry",",","but","he","believe","that","she","have","turn","she","attention","from","rock-star","to","Jihadists",".","while","look","for","employment",",","as","well","as","a","loan","to","purchase","a","house",",","he","also","contact","the","Federal","Bureau","of","Investigation","as","he","feel","he","have","sufficient","evidence","that","he","new","neighbor","be","structure","money",",","experiment","with","chemical",",","and","associate","with","other","middle-easterner","for","devious","reason","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Shortly after landing","after landing a","landing a job","a job ,","job , Terry",", Terry Allen","Terry Allen is","Allen is laid","is laid off","laid off ,","off , starts",", starts looking","starts looking for","looking for another","for another circa","another circa post","circa post September","post September 11","September 11 ,","11 , 2001",", 2001 media","2001 media frenzy","media frenzy and","frenzy and paranoia","and paranoia with","paranoia with President","with President George","President George W.","George W.

{"title":"Eurocrime! The Italian Cop and Gangster Films That Ruled the '70s","plot":"A documentary concerning the violent Italian 'poliziotteschi' cinematic movement of the 1970s which, at first glance, seem to be rip-offs of American crime films like DIRTY HARRY or THE GODFATHER, but which really address Italian issues like the Sicilian Mafia and red terrorism. Perhaps even more interesting than the films themselves were the rushed methods of production (stars performing their own stunts, stealing shots, no live sound) and the bleed-over between real-life crime and movie crime.","genres":["Action"," Documentary"," Crime"],"stems":["A","documentari","concern","the","violent","Italian","'","poliziotteschi","'","cinemat","movement","of","the","1970s","which",",","at","first","glanc",",","seem","to","be","rip-off","of","American","crime","film","like","DIRTi","HARRi","or","THE","GODFATHER",",","but","which","realli","address","Italian","issu","like","the","Sicilian","Mafia","and","red","terror",".","Perhap","even","more","interest","than","the","film","themselv","were","the","rush","method","of","product","(","star","perform","their","own","stunt",",","steal","shot",",","no","live","sound",")","and","the","bleed-ov","between","real-lif","crime","and","movi","crime","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","concern","the","violent","Italian","'","poliziotteschus","'","cinematic","movement","of","the","1970","which",",","at","first","glance",",","seem","to","be","rip-off","of","american","crime","film","like","DIRTY","HARRY","or","the","godfather",",","but","which","really","address","italian","issue","like","the","Sicilian","Mafia","and","red","terrorism",".","perhaps","even","more","interesting","than","the","film","themselves","be","the","rush","method","of","production","-lrb-","star","perform","they","own","stunt",",","steal","shot",",","no","live","sound","-rrb-","and","the","bleed-over","between","real-life","crime","and","movie","crime","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A documentary concerning","documentary concerning the","concerning the violent","the violent Italian","violent Italian '","Italian ' poliziotteschi","' poliziotteschi '","poliziotteschi ' cinematic","' cinematic movement","cinematic movement of","movement of the","of the 1970s","the 1970s which","1970s which ,","which , at",", at first","at first glance","first glance ,","glance , seem",", seem to","seem to be","to be rip-offs","be rip-offs of","rip-offs of American","of American crime","American crime films","crime films like","films like DIRTY","like DIRTY HARRY","DIRTY HARRY or","HARRY or THE","or THE GODFATHER","THE GODFATHER ,","GODFATHER , but",", but which","but which really","which really address","really address Italian","address Italian issues","Italian issues like","issues like the","like the Sicilian","the Sicilian Mafia","Sicilian Mafia and","Mafia and red","and red terrorism","Perhaps even more","even more interesting","more interesting than","interesting than the","than the films","the films themselves","films themselves were","themselves were the","were the rushed","the rushed methods","rushed methods of","methods of production","of production (","production ( stars","( stars performing","stars performing their","performing their own","their own stunts","own stunts ,","stunts , stealing",", stealing shots","stealing shots ,","shots , no",", no live","no live sound","live sound )","sound ) and",") and the","and the bleed-over","the bleed-over between","bleed-over between real-life","between real-life crime","real-life crime and","crime and movie","and movie crime"],"2grams":["A documentary","documentary concerning","concerning the","the violent","violent Italian","Italian '","' poliziotteschi","poliziotteschi '","' cinematic","cinematic movement","movement of","of the","the 1970s","1970s which","which ,",", at","at first","first glance","glance ,",", seem","seem to","to be","be rip-offs","rip-offs of","of American","American crime","crime films","films like","like DIRTY","DIRTY HARRY","HARRY or","or THE","THE GODFATHER","GODFATHER ,",", but","but which","which really","really address","address Italian","Italian issues","issues like","like the","the Sicilian","Sicilian Mafia","Mafia and","and red","red terrorism","Perhaps even","even more","more interesting","interesting than","than the","the films","films themselves","themselves were","were the","the rushed","rushed methods","methods of","of production","production (","( stars","stars performing","performing their","their own","own stunts","stunts ,",", stealing","stealing shots","shots ,",", no","no live","live sound","sound )",") and","and the","the bleed-over","bleed-over between","between real-life","real-life crime","crime and","and movie","movie crime"]}

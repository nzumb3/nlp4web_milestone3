{"title":"Divan","plot":"Divan follows the filmmaker's effort to retrieve a turn-of-the-century family heir loom - a couch. The filmmaker journeys from her birthplace, Brooklyn's Hasidic community, to its origins in Hungary and back. The couch - considered holy because certain Hasidic rabbis had slept on it - survived WWII and is in the filmmaker's great grandfather's house in Rohod, a northeast Hungarian town. In the tradition of storytelling, the filmmaker creates a visual parable about the Hasidic community that she left as a teenager. She trails the couch through a quirky landscape populated by Hasidim in Brooklyn, Holocaust survivors and ex-communists in Hungary, and, finally, the next generation of formerly-Hasidic Jews on the margins of their communities in New York and Israel.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Divan","follow","the","filmmak","'s","effort","to","retriev","a","turn-of-the-centuri","famili","heir","loom","-","a","couch",".","The","filmmak","journey","from","her","birthplac",",","Brooklyn","'s","Hasid","communiti",",","to","it","origin","in","Hungari","and","back",".","The","couch","-","consid","holi","becaus","certain","Hasid","rabbi","had","slept","on","it","-","surviv","WWII","and","is","in","the","filmmak","'s","great","grandfath","'s","hous","in","Rohod",",","a","northeast","Hungarian","town",".","In","the","tradit","of","storytel",",","the","filmmak","creat","a","visual","parabl","about","the","Hasid","communiti","that","she","left","as","a","teenag",".","She","trail","the","couch","through","a","quirki","landscap","popul","by","Hasidim","in","Brooklyn",",","Holocaust","survivor","and","ex-communist","in","Hungari",",","and",",","final",",","the","next","generat","of","formerly-Hasid","Jew","on","the","margin","of","their","communiti","in","New","York","and","Israel","."],"lemmas":["Divan","follow","the","filmmaker","'s","effort","to","retrieve","a","turn-of-the-century","family","heir","loom","-","a","couch",".","the","filmmaker","journey","from","she","birthplace",",","Brooklyn","'s","hasidic","community",",","to","its","origin","in","Hungary","and","back",".","the","couch","-","consider","holy","because","certain","hasidic","rabbi","have","sleep","on","it","-","survive","WWII","and","be","in","the","filmmaker","'s","great","grandfather","'s","house","in","Rohod",",","a","northeast","hungarian","town",".","in","the","tradition","of","storytelling",",","the","filmmaker","create","a","visual","parable","about","the","hasidic","community","that","she","leave","as","a","teenager",".","she","trail","the","couch","through","a","quirky","landscape","populate","by","Hasidim","in","Brooklyn",",","Holocaust","survivor","and","ex-communist","in","Hungary",",","and",",","finally",",","the","next","generation","of","formerly-hasidic","jew","on","the","margin","of","they","community","in","New","York","and","Israel","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Divan follows the","follows the filmmaker","the filmmaker 's","filmmaker 's effort","'s effort to","effort to retrieve","to retrieve a","retrieve a turn-of-the-century","a turn-of-the-century family","turn-of-the-century family heir","family heir loom","heir loom -","loom -

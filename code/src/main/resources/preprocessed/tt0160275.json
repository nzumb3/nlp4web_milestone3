{"title":"Final Solution","plot":"The indoctrination of Gerrit Wolfaardt is complete: his family traditions, history, culture- even his church-have taught him that black South Africans are a cancer in the land. Under the eye of prominent members of the government and military, Gerrit develops a diabolical plan to rid South Africa of its \"black danger.\" Before his plans can be carried out, he meets two people who will put him on a collision course with his future: Celeste, an open-minded University student, and Peter Lekota, a pastor who challenges Gerrit's prejudice. His \"final solution\" meets its greatest obstacle when Gerrit realizes he is wrong. The Persecutor becomes the Peacemaker and begins to seek reconciliation between whites and blacks. However, in the turbulent last days of apartheid, there are those who doubt his transformation. One such person is Moses Moremi, whom Gerrit had once violently attacked. In the end, it is Moses who must choose between peace and bloodshed.","genres":["Action"," Drama"],"stems":["The","indoctrin","of","Gerrit","Wolfaardt","is","complet",":","his","famili","tradit",",","histori",",","cultur","-","even","his","church-hav","taught","him","that","black","South","African","are","a","cancer","in","the","land",".","Under","the","eye","of","promin","member","of","the","govern","and","militari",",","Gerrit","develop","a","diabol","plan","to","rid","South","Africa","of","it","\"","black","danger",".","\"","Befor","his","plan","can","be","carri","out",",","he","meet","two","peopl","who","will","put","him","on","a","collis","cours","with","his","futur",":","Celest",",","an","open-mind","Univers","student",",","and","Peter","Lekota",",","a","pastor","who","challeng","Gerrit","'s","prejudic",".","His","\"","final","solut","\"","meet","it","greatest","obstacl","when","Gerrit","realiz","he","is","wrong",".","The","Persecutor","becom","the","Peacemak","and","begin","to","seek","reconcili","between","white","and","black",".","Howev",",","in","the","turbul","last","day","of","apartheid",",","there","are","those","who","doubt","his","transform",".","One","such","person","is","Mose","Moremi",",","whom","Gerrit","had","onc","violent","attack",".","In","the","end",",","it","is","Mose","who","must","choos","between","peac","and","bloodsh","."],"lemmas":["the","indoctrination","of","Gerrit","Wolfaardt","be","complete",":","he","family","tradition",",","history",",","culture","-","even","he","church-have","teach","he","that","black","South","Africans","be","a","cancer","in","the","land",".","under","the","eye","of","prominent","member","of","the","government","and","military",",","Gerrit","develop","a","diabolical","plan","to","rid","South","Africa","of","its","``","black","danger",".","''","before","he","plan","can","be","carry","out",",","he","meet","two","people","who","will","put","he","on","a","collision","course","with","he","future",":","Celeste",",","a","open-minded","University","student",",","and","Peter","Lekota",",","a","pastor","who","challenge","Gerrit","'s","prejudice",".","he","``","final","solution","''","meet","its","greatest","obstacle","when","Gerrit","realize","he","be","wrong",".","the","Persecutor","become","the","peacemaker","and","begin","to","seek","reconciliation","between","whites","and","black",".","however",",","in","the","turbulent","last","day","of","apartheid",",","there","be","those","who","doubt","he","transformation",".","one","such","person","be","Moses","Moremi",",","whom","Gerrit","have","once","violently","attack",".","in","the","end",",","it","be","Moses","who","must","choose","between","peace","and","bloodshed","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The indoctrination of","indoctrination of Gerrit","of Gerrit Wolfaardt","Gerrit Wolfaardt is","Wolfaardt is complete","is complete :","complete : his",": his family","his family traditions","family traditions ,","traditions , history",", history ,","history , culture",", culture -","culture -

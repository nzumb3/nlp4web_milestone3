{"title":"Behind the Sun","plot":"The Brazilian badlands, April 1910. Tonho is ordered by his father to avenge the death of his older brother. The young man knows that if he commits this crime, his life will be divided in two: the 20 years he has already lived and the few days he has left to live, before the other family avenges their son's death. He is torn between fulfilling his ancestral duty and rebelling against it, urged by his younger brother Pacu. That's when a tiny traveling circus passes through the vast badlands where Tonho's family lives.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","Brazilian","badland",",","April","1910",".","Tonho","is","order","by","his","father","to","aveng","the","death","of","his","older","brother",".","The","young","man","know","that","if","he","commit","this","crime",",","his","life","will","be","divid","in","two",":","the","20","year","he","has","alreadi","live","and","the","few","day","he","has","left","to","live",",","befor","the","other","famili","aveng","their","son","'s","death",".","He","is","torn","between","fulfil","his","ancestr","duti","and","rebel","against","it",",","urg","by","his","younger","brother","Pacu",".","That","'s","when","a","tini","travel","circus","pass","through","the","vast","badland","where","Tonho","'s","famili","live","."],"lemmas":["the","brazilian","badland",",","April","1910",".","Tonho","be","order","by","he","father","to","avenge","the","death","of","he","older","brother",".","the","young","man","know","that","if","he","commit","this","crime",",","he","life","will","be","divide","in","two",":","the","20","year","he","have","already","live","and","the","few","day","he","have","leave","to","live",",","before","the","other","family","avenge","they","son","'s","death",".","he","be","tear","between","fulfil","he","ancestral","duty","and","rebel","against","it",",","urge","by","he","younger","brother","pacu",".","that","be","when","a","tiny","travel","circus","pass","through","the","vast","badland","where","Tonho","'s","family","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Brazilian badlands","Brazilian badlands ,","badlands , April",", April 1910","Tonho is ordered","is ordered by","ordered by his","by his father","his father to","father to avenge","to avenge the","avenge the death","the death of","death of his","of his older","his older brother","The young man","young man knows","man knows that","knows that if","that if he","if he commits","he commits this","commits this crime","this crime ,","crime , his",", his life","his life will","life will be","will be divided","be divided in","divided in two","in two :","two : the",": the 20","the 20 years","20 years he","years he has","he has already","has already lived","already lived and","lived and the","and the few","the few days","few days he","days he has","he has left","has left to","left to live","to live ,","live , before",", before the","before the other","the other family","other family avenges","family avenges their","avenges their son","their son 's","son 's death","He is torn","is torn between","torn between fulfilling","between fulfilling his","fulfilling his ancestral","his ancestral duty","ancestral duty and","duty and rebelling","and rebelling against","rebelling against it","against it ,","it , urged",", urged by","urged by his","by his younger","his younger brother","younger brother Pacu","That 's when","'s when a","when a tiny","a tiny traveling","tiny traveling circus","traveling circus passes","circus passes through","passes through the","through the vast","the vast badlands","vast badlands where","badlands where Tonho","where Tonho 's","Tonho 's family","'s family lives"],"2grams":["The Brazilian","Brazilian badlands","badlands ,",", April","April 1910","Tonho is","is ordered","ordered by","by his","his father","father to","to avenge","avenge the","the death","death of","of his","his older","older brother","The young","young man","man knows","knows that","that if","if he","he commits","commits this","this crime","crime ,",", his","his life","life will","will be","be divided","divided in","in two","two :",": the","the 20","20 years","years he","he has","has already","already lived","lived and","and the","the few","few days","days he","he has","has left","left to","to live","live ,",", before","before the","the other","other family","family avenges","avenges their","their son","son 's","'s death","He is","is torn","torn between","between fulfilling","fulfilling his","his ancestral","ancestral duty","duty and","and rebelling","rebelling against","against it","it ,",", urged","urged by","by his","his younger","younger brother","brother Pacu","That 's","'s when","when a","a tiny","tiny traveling","traveling circus","circus passes","passes through","through the","the vast","vast badlands","badlands where","where Tonho","Tonho 's","'s family","family lives"]}

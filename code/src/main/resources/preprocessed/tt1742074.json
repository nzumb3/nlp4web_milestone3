{"title":"Mom's Home","plot":"Mom's home is a compassionate and intimate documentary about aging mothers who live with their adult daughters. The observational film follows three pairs of mothers and daughters who, despite their life experience, are still wrestling with their conflicting emotions, difficulties and sometimes ill-fated commitment to do what's best. The film captures the myriad of changing expectations and social adjustments that come into play when mothers and daughters find their roles reversed and mother becomes reliant on child due to finances, Alzheimer's or family feuding.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Mom","'s","home","is","a","compassion","and","intim","documentari","about","age","mother","who","live","with","their","adult","daughter",".","The","observ","film","follow","three","pair","of","mother","and","daughter","who",",","despit","their","life","experi",",","are","still","wrestl","with","their","conflict","emot",",","difficulti","and","sometim","ill-fat","commit","to","do","what","'s","best",".","The","film","captur","the","myriad","of","chang","expect","and","social","adjust","that","come","into","play","when","mother","and","daughter","find","their","role","revers","and","mother","becom","reliant","on","child","due","to","financ",",","Alzheimer","'s","or","famili","feud","."],"lemmas":["mom","'s","home","be","a","compassionate","and","intimate","documentary","about","age","mother","who","live","with","they","adult","daughter",".","the","observational","film","follow","three","pair","of","mother","and","daughter","who",",","despite","they","life","experience",",","be","still","wrestle","with","they","conflict","emotion",",","difficulty","and","sometimes","ill-fated","commitment","to","do","what","be","best",".","the","film","capture","the","myriad","of","change","expectation","and","social","adjustment","that","come","into","play","when","mother","and","daughter","find","they","role","reverse","and","mother","become","reliant","on","child","due","to","finances",",","Alzheimer","'s","or","family","feuding","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Mom 's home","'s home is","home is a","is a compassionate","a compassionate and","compassionate and intimate","and intimate documentary","intimate documentary about","documentary about aging","about aging mothers","aging mothers who","mothers who live","who live with","live with their","with their adult","their adult daughters","The observational film","observational film follows","film follows three","follows three pairs","three pairs of","pairs of mothers","of mothers and","mothers and daughters","and daughters who","daughters who ,","who , despite",", despite their","despite their life","their life experience","life experience ,","experience , are",", are still","are still wrestling","still wrestling with","wrestling with their","with their conflicting","their conflicting emotions","conflicting emotions ,","emotions , difficulties",", difficulties and","difficulties and sometimes","and sometimes ill-fated","sometimes ill-fated commitment","ill-fated commitment to","commitment to do","to do what","do what 's","what 's best","The film captures","film captures the","captures the myriad","the myriad of","myriad of changing","of changing expectations","changing expectations and","expectations and social","and social adjustments","social adjustments that","adjustments that come","that come into","come into play","into play when","play when mothers","when mothers and","mothers and daughters","and daughters find","daughters find their","find their roles","their roles reversed","roles reversed and","reversed and mother","and mother becomes","mother becomes reliant","becomes reliant on","reliant on child","on child due","child due to","due to finances","to finances ,","finances , Alzheimer",", Alzheimer 's","Alzheimer 's or","'s or family","or family feuding"],"2grams":["Mom 's","'s home","home is","is a","a compassionate","compassionate and","and intimate","intimate documentary","documentary about","about aging","aging mothers","mothers who","who live","live with","with their","their adult","adult daughters","The observational","observational film","film follows","follows three","three pairs","pairs of","of mothers","mothers and","and daughters","daughters who","who ,",", despite","despite their","their life","life experience","experience ,",", are","are still","still wrestling","wrestling with","with their","their conflicting","conflicting emotions","emotions ,",", difficulties","difficulties and","and sometimes","sometimes ill-fated","ill-fated commitment","commitment to","to do","do what","what 's","'s best","The film","film captures","captures the","the myriad","myriad of","of changing","changing expectations","expectations and","and social","social adjustments","adjustments that","that come","come into","into play","play when","when mothers","mothers and","and daughters","daughters find","find their","their roles","roles reversed","reversed and","and mother","mother becomes","becomes reliant","reliant on","on child","child due","due to","to finances","finances ,",", Alzheimer","Alzheimer 's","'s or","or family","family feuding"]}

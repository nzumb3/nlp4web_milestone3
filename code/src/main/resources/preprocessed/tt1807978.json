{"title":"Bhoot and Friends","plot":"After Raghav's examination, his America-based cousins, Igloo and Roma, come for a visit. The trio then travel to their grandmother's house in Pratapgarh where Raghav introduces his cousins to his polio-stricken friend, Ali, who is quite uninhibited, and almost alienates himself from the visitors. Then things change when they find out that Andrew Gomes and his goons have abducted Ali's father. Their quest to locate him will lead them to confront the abductors as well as get them stranded in a dreaded forest - known to be haunted by a ferocious ghost.","genres":["Action"," Animation"," Adventure"],"stems":["After","Raghav","'s","examin",",","his","America-bas","cousin",",","Igloo","and","Roma",",","come","for","a","visit",".","The","trio","then","travel","to","their","grandmoth","'s","hous","in","Pratapgarh","where","Raghav","introduc","his","cousin","to","his","polio-stricken","friend",",","Ali",",","who","is","quit","uninhibit",",","and","almost","alien","himself","from","the","visitor",".","Then","thing","chang","when","they","find","out","that","Andrew","Gome","and","his","goon","have","abduct","Ali","'s","father",".","Their","quest","to","locat","him","will","lead","them","to","confront","the","abductor","as","well","as","get","them","strand","in","a","dread","forest","-","known","to","be","haunt","by","a","feroci","ghost","."],"lemmas":["after","Raghav","'s","examination",",","he","america-based","cousin",",","Igloo","and","Roma",",","come","for","a","visit",".","the","trio","then","travel","to","they","grandmother","'s","house","in","Pratapgarh","where","Raghav","introduce","he","cousin","to","he","polio-stricken","friend",",","Ali",",","who","be","quite","uninhibited",",","and","almost","alienate","himself","from","the","visitor",".","then","thing","change","when","they","find","out","that","Andrew","Gomes","and","he","goon","have","abducted","Ali","'s","father",".","they","quest","to","locate","he","will","lead","they","to","confront","the","abductor","as","well","as","get","they","strand","in","a","dreaded","forest","-","know","to","be","haunt","by","a","ferocious","ghost","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After Raghav 's","Raghav 's examination","'s examination ,","examination , his",", his America-based","his America-based cousins","America-based cousins ,","cousins , Igloo",", Igloo and","Igloo and Roma","and Roma ,","Roma , come",", come for","come for a","for a visit","The trio then","trio then travel","then travel to","travel to their","to their grandmother","their grandmother 's","grandmother 's house","'s house in","house in Pratapgarh","in Pratapgarh where","Pratapgarh where Raghav","where Raghav introduces","Raghav introduces his","introduces his cousins","his cousins to","cousins to his","to his polio-stricken","his polio-stricken friend","polio-stricken friend ,","friend , Ali",", Ali ,","Ali , who",", who is","who is quite","is quite uninhibited","quite uninhibited ,","uninhibited , and",", and almost","and almost alienates","almost alienates himself","alienates himself from","himself from the","from the visitors","Then things change","things change when","change when they","when they find","they find out","find out that","out that Andrew","that Andrew Gomes","Andrew Gomes and","Gomes and his","and his goons","his goons have","goons have abducted","have abducted Ali","abducted Ali 's","Ali 's father","Their quest to","quest to locate","to locate him","locate him will","him will lead","will lead them","lead them to","them to confront","to confront the","confront the abductors","the abductors as","abductors as well","as well as","well as get","as get them","get them stranded","them stranded in","stranded in a","in a dreaded","a dreaded forest","dreaded forest -","forest - known","- known to","known to be","to be haunted","be haunted by","haunted by a","by a ferocious","a ferocious ghost"],"2grams":["After Raghav","Raghav 's","'s examination","examination ,",", his","his America-based","America-based cousins","cousins ,",", Igloo","Igloo and","and Roma","Roma ,",", come","come for","for a","a visit","The trio","trio then","then travel","travel to","to their","their grandmother","grandmother 's","'s house","house in","in Pratapgarh","Pratapgarh where","where Raghav","Raghav introduces","introduces his","his cousins","cousins to","to his","his polio-stricken","polio-stricken friend","friend ,",", Ali","Ali ,",", who","who is","is quite","quite uninhibited","uninhibited ,",", and","and almost","almost alienates","alienates himself","himself from","from the","the visitors","Then things","things change","change when","when they","they find","find out","out that","that Andrew","Andrew Gomes","Gomes and","and his","his goons","goons have","have abducted","abducted Ali","Ali 's","'s father","Their quest","quest to","to locate","locate him","him will","will lead","lead them","them to","to confront","confront the","the abductors","abductors as","as well","well as","as get","get them","them stranded","stranded in","in a","a dreaded","dreaded forest","forest -","- known","known to","to be","be haunted","haunted by","by a","a ferocious","ferocious ghost"]}

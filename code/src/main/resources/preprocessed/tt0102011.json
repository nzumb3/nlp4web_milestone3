{"title":"He Said, She Said","plot":"Dan and Lorie are journalists working in the same office. More often than not they have opposing view of the issue in question. Deciding that this is hot stuff, a television producer gives them their own program (called \"He Said, She Said\") where they can give their opposing views on various issues. As they work together and get to know one another, the events that occur in their lives are replayed in the film twice; once from each's perspective.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Dan","and","Lori","are","journalist","work","in","the","same","offic",".","More","often","than","not","they","have","oppos","view","of","the","issu","in","question",".","Decid","that","this","is","hot","stuff",",","a","televis","produc","give","them","their","own","program","(","call","\"","He","Said",",","She","Said","\"",")","where","they","can","give","their","oppos","view","on","various","issu",".","As","they","work","togeth","and","get","to","know","one","anoth",",","the","event","that","occur","in","their","live","are","replay","in","the","film","twice",";","onc","from","each","'s","perspect","."],"lemmas":["Dan","and","Lorie","be","journalist","work","in","the","same","office",".","more","often","than","not","they","have","opposing","view","of","the","issue","in","question",".","decide","that","this","be","hot","stuff",",","a","television","producer","give","they","they","own","program","-lrb-","call","``","he","Said",",","she","said","''","-rrb-","where","they","can","give","they","opposing","view","on","various","issue",".","as","they","work","together","and","get","to","know","one","another",",","the","event","that","occur","in","they","life","be","replay","in","the","film","twice",";","once","from","each","'s","perspective","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Dan and Lorie","and Lorie are","Lorie are journalists","are journalists working","journalists working in","working in the","in the same","the same office","More often than","often than not","than not they","not they have","they have opposing","have opposing view","opposing view of","view of the","of the issue","the issue in","issue in question","Deciding that this","that this is","this is hot","is hot stuff","hot stuff ,","stuff , a",", a television","a television producer","television producer gives","producer gives them","gives them their","them their own","their own program","own program (","program ( called","( called \"","called \" He","\" He Said","He Said ,","Said , She",", She Said","She Said \"","Said \" )","\" ) where",") where they","where they can","they can give","can give their","give their opposing","their opposing views","opposing views on","views on various","on various issues","As they work","they work together","work together and","together and get","and get to","get to know","to know one","know one another","one another ,","another , the",", the events","the events that","events that occur","that occur in","occur in their","in their lives","their lives are","lives are replayed","are replayed in","replayed in the","in the film","the film twice","film twice ;","twice ; once","; once from","once from each","from each 's","each 's perspective"],"2grams":["Dan and","and Lorie","Lorie are","are journalists","journalists working","working in","in the","the same","same office","More often","often than","than not","not they","they have","have opposing","opposing view","view of","of the","the issue","issue in","in question","Deciding that","that this","this is","is hot","hot stuff","stuff ,",", a","a television","television producer","producer gives","gives them","them their","their own","own program","program (","( called","called \"","\" He","He Said","Said ,",", She","She Said","Said \"","\" )",") where","where they","they can","can give","give their","their opposing","opposing views","views on","on various","various issues","As they","they work","work together","together and","and get","get to","to know","know one","one another","another ,",", the","the events","events that","that occur","occur in","in their","their lives","lives are","are replayed","replayed in","in the","the film","film twice","twice ;","; once","once from","from each","each 's","'s perspective"]}

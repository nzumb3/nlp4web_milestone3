{"title":"Underground: The Julian Assange Story","plot":"Julian Assange is one of the most significant figures of the twenty first century. But before he was famous, before WikiLeaks, before the internet even existed, he was a teenage computer hacker in Melbourne. This is his story. In 1989, known as 'Mendax', Assange and two friends formed a group called the 'International Subversives'. Using early home computers and defining themselves as 'white hat hackers' - those who look but don't steal - they broke into some of the world's most powerful and secretive organisations. They were young, brilliant, and in the eyes of the US Government, a major threat to national security. At the urging of the FBI, the Australian Federal Police set up a special taskforce to catch them. But at a time when most Australian police had never seen a computer, let alone used one, they had to figure out just where to begin. Police ingenuity and old-fashioned detective work are pitted against nimble, highly skilled young men in this new crime frontier. What follows, is a tense and gripping game of cat and mouse through the electronic underground of Melbourne.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"],"stems":["Julian","Assang","is","one","of","the","most","signific","figur","of","the","twenti","first","centuri",".","But","befor","he","was","famous",",","befor","WikiLeak",",","befor","the","internet","even","exist",",","he","was","a","teenag","comput","hacker","in","Melbourn",".","This","is","his","stori",".","In","1989",",","known","as","'","Mendax","'",",","Assang","and","two","friend","form","a","group","call","the","'","Internat","Subvers","'",".","Using","earli","home","comput","and","defin","themselv","as","'","white","hat","hacker","'","-","those","who","look","but","do","n't","steal","-","they","broke","into","some","of","the","world","'s","most","power","and","secret","organis",".","They","were","young",",","brilliant",",","and","in","the","eye","of","the","US","Govern",",","a","major","threat","to","nation","secur",".","At","the","urg","of","the","FBI",",","the","Australian","Feder","Polic","set","up","a","special","taskforc","to","catch","them",".","But","at","a","time","when","most","Australian","polic","had","never","seen","a","comput",",","let","alon","use","one",",","they","had","to","figur","out","just","where","to","begin",".","Polic","ingenu","and","old-fashion","detect","work","are","pit","against","nimbl",",","high","skill","young","men","in","this","new","crime","frontier",".","What","follow",",","is","a","tens","and","grip","game","of","cat","and","mous","through","the","electron","underground","of","Melbourn","."],"lemmas":["Julian","Assange","be","one","of","the","most","significant","figure","of","the","twenty","first","century",".","but","before","he","be","famous",",","before","WikiLeaks",",","before","the","internet","even","exist",",","he","be","a","teenage","computer","hacker","in","Melbourne",".","this","be","he","story",".","in","1989",",","know","as","'","Mendax","'",",","Assange","and","two","friend","form","a","group","call","the","'","International","Subversives","'",".","use","early","home","computer","and","define","themselves","as","'","white","hat","hacker","'","-","those","who","look","but","do","not","steal","-","they","break","into","some","of","the","world","'s","most","powerful","and","secretive","organisation",".","they","be","young",",","brilliant",",","and","in","the","eye","of","the","US","Government",",","a","major","threat","to","national","security",".","at","the","urge","of","the","FBI",",","the","Australian","Federal","Police","set","up","a","special","taskforce","to","catch","they",".","but","at","a","time","when","most","australian","police","have","never","see","a","computer",",","let","alone","use","one",",","they","have","to","figure","out","just","where","to","begin",".","police","ingenuity","and","old-fashioned","detective","work","be","pit","against","nimble",",","highly","skilled","young","man","in","this","new","crime","frontier",".","what","follow",",","be","a","tense","and","gripping","game","of","cat","and","mouse","through","the","electronic","underground","of","Melbourne","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Julian Assange is","Assange is one","is one of","one of the","of the most","the most significant","most significant figures","significant figures of","figures of the","of the twenty","the twenty first","twenty first century","But before he","before he was","he was famous","was famous ,","famous , before",", before WikiLeaks","before WikiLeaks ,","WikiLeaks , before",", before the","before the internet","the internet even","internet even existed","even existed ,","existed , he",", he was","he was a","was a teenage","a teenage computer","teenage computer hacker","computer hacker in","hacker in Melbourne","This is his","is his story","In 1989 ,","1989 , known",", known as","known as '","as ' Mendax","' Mendax '","Mendax ' ,","' , Assange",", Assange and","Assange and two","and two friends","two friends formed","friends formed a","formed a group","a group called","group called the","called the '","the ' International","' International Subversives","International Subversives '","Using early home","early home computers","home computers and","computers and defining","and defining themselves","defining themselves as","themselves as '","as ' white","' white hat","white hat hackers","hat hackers '","hackers ' -","' -

{"title":"The Fight to Forgive","plot":"Forced to fight in Liberia's civil war, six former child soldiers now battle for peace in post-conflict Liberia. Trading their weapons for cameras and soccer balls, these ex-combatants train as grassroots peacebuilders and re-enter their villages after years of trauma and isolation. In THE FIGHT TO FORGIVE young Liberians discover that their future and a lasting peace for their developing nation depend on one final personal battle--the fight to forgive both themselves and the adults who forced them to kill.","genres":["Documentary"," War"],"stems":["Forc","to","fight","in","Liberia","'s","civil","war",",","six","former","child","soldier","now","battl","for","peac","in","post-conflict","Liberia",".","Trade","their","weapon","for","camera","and","soccer","ball",",","these","ex-combat","train","as","grassroot","peacebuild","and","re-ent","their","villag","after","year","of","trauma","and","isol",".","In","THE","FIGHT","TO","FORGIVE","young","Liberian","discov","that","their","futur","and","a","last","peac","for","their","develop","nation","depend","on","one","final","person","battl","--","the","fight","to","forgiv","both","themselv","and","the","adult","who","forc","them","to","kill","."],"lemmas":["force","to","fight","in","Liberia","'s","civil","war",",","six","former","child","soldier","now","battle","for","peace","in","post-conflict","Liberia",".","Trading","they","weapon","for","camera","and","soccer","ball",",","these","ex-combatant","train","as","grassroot","peacebuilder","and","re-enter","they","village","after","year","of","trauma","and","isolation",".","in","the","fight","to","forgive","young","Liberians","discover","that","they","future","and","a","lasting","peace","for","they","develop","nation","depend","on","one","final","personal","battle","--","the","fight","to","forgive","both","themselves","and","the","adult","who","force","they","to","kill","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Forced to fight","to fight in","fight in Liberia","in Liberia 's","Liberia 's civil","'s civil war","civil war ,","war , six",", six former","six former child","former child soldiers","child soldiers now","soldiers now battle","now battle for","battle for peace","for peace in","peace in post-conflict","in post-conflict Liberia","Trading their weapons","their weapons for","weapons for cameras","for cameras and","cameras and soccer","and soccer balls","soccer balls ,","balls , these",", these ex-combatants","these ex-combatants train","ex-combatants train as","train as grassroots","as grassroots peacebuilders","grassroots peacebuilders and","peacebuilders and re-enter","and re-enter their","re-enter their villages","their villages after","villages after years","after years of","years of trauma","of trauma and","trauma and isolation","In THE FIGHT","THE FIGHT TO","FIGHT TO FORGIVE","TO FORGIVE young","FORGIVE young Liberians","young Liberians discover","Liberians discover that","discover that their","that their future","their future and","future and a","and a lasting","a lasting peace","lasting peace for","peace for their","for their developing","their developing nation","developing nation depend","nation depend on","depend on one","on one final","one final personal","final personal battle","personal battle --","battle -- the","-- the fight","the fight to","fight to forgive","to forgive both","forgive both themselves","both themselves and","themselves and the","and the adults","the adults who","adults who forced","who forced them","forced them to","them to kill"],"2grams":["Forced to","to fight","fight in","in Liberia","Liberia 's","'s civil","civil war","war ,",", six","six former","former child","child soldiers","soldiers now","now battle","battle for","for peace","peace in","in post-conflict","post-conflict Liberia","Trading their","their weapons","weapons for","for cameras","cameras and","and soccer","soccer balls","balls ,",", these","these ex-combatants","ex-combatants train","train as","as grassroots","grassroots peacebuilders","peacebuilders and","and re-enter","re-enter their","their villages","villages after","after years","years of","of trauma","trauma and","and isolation","In THE","THE FIGHT","FIGHT TO","TO FORGIVE","FORGIVE young","young Liberians","Liberians discover","discover that","that their","their future","future and","and a","a lasting","lasting peace","peace for","for their","their developing","developing nation","nation depend","depend on","on one","one final","final personal","personal battle","battle --","-- the","the fight","fight to","to forgive","forgive both","both themselves","themselves and","and the","the adults","adults who","who forced","forced them","them to","to kill"]}

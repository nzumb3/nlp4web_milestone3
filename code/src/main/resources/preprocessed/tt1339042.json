{"title":"About the Bells","plot":"While trying to complete the greatest commission of his life, small-town artist Caleb Bell unexpectedly finds himself in a mid-life crisis. Struggling to keep his life in order, he turns to his eccentric family for support - including his overly protective wife, Marie; apathetic and sardonic son, Cameron; environmental-activist daughter, Autumn; and genius six-year-old child, Jackson. As he attempts to reassemble the various pieces of his personal and professional life, Caleb soon discovers that neither art nor family are as elementary as he once suspected.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["While","tri","to","complet","the","greatest","commiss","of","his","life",",","small-town","artist","Caleb","Bell","unexpect","find","himself","in","a","mid-lif","crisi",".","Struggl","to","keep","his","life","in","order",",","he","turn","to","his","eccentr","famili","for","support","-","includ","his","over","protect","wife",",","Mari",";","apathet","and","sardon","son",",","Cameron",";","environmental-activist","daughter",",","Autumn",";","and","genius","six-year-old","child",",","Jackson",".","As","he","attempt","to","reassembl","the","various","piec","of","his","person","and","profession","life",",","Caleb","soon","discov","that","neither","art","nor","famili","are","as","elementari","as","he","onc","suspect","."],"lemmas":["while","try","to","complete","the","greatest","commission","of","he","life",",","small-town","artist","Caleb","Bell","unexpectedly","find","himself","in","a","mid-life","crisis",".","struggle","to","keep","he","life","in","order",",","he","turn","to","he","eccentric","family","for","support","-","include","he","overly","protective","wife",",","Marie",";","apathetic","and","sardonic","son",",","Cameron",";","environmental-activist","daughter",",","autumn",";","and","genius","six-year-old","child",",","Jackson",".","as","he","attempt","to","reassemble","the","various","piece","of","he","personal","and","professional","life",",","Caleb","soon","discover","that","neither","art","nor","family","be","as","elementary","as","he","once","suspect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["While trying to","trying to complete","to complete the","complete the greatest","the greatest commission","greatest commission of","commission of his","of his life","his life ,","life , small-town",", small-town artist","small-town artist Caleb","artist Caleb Bell","Caleb Bell unexpectedly","Bell unexpectedly finds","unexpectedly finds himself","finds himself in","himself in a","in a mid-life","a mid-life crisis","Struggling to keep","to keep his","keep his life","his life in","life in order","in order ,","order , he",", he turns","he turns to","turns to his","to his eccentric","his eccentric family","eccentric family for","family for support","for support -","support - including","- including his","including his overly","his overly protective","overly protective wife","protective wife ,","wife , Marie",", Marie ;","Marie ; apathetic","; apathetic and","apathetic and sardonic","and sardonic son","sardonic son ,","son , Cameron",", Cameron ;","Cameron ; environmental-activist","; environmental-activist daughter","environmental-activist daughter ,","daughter , Autumn",", Autumn ;","Autumn ; and","; and genius","and genius six-year-old","genius six-year-old child","six-year-old child ,","child , Jackson","As he attempts","he attempts to","attempts to reassemble","to reassemble the","reassemble the various","the various pieces","various pieces of","pieces of his","of his personal","his personal and","personal and professional","and professional life","professional life ,","life , Caleb",", Caleb soon","Caleb soon discovers","soon discovers that","discovers that neither","that neither art","neither art nor","art nor family","nor family are","family are as","are as elementary","as elementary as","elementary as he","as he once","he once suspected"],"2grams":["While trying","trying to","to complete","complete the","the greatest","greatest commission","commission of","of his","his life","life ,",", small-town","small-town artist","artist Caleb","Caleb Bell","Bell unexpectedly","unexpectedly finds","finds himself","himself in","in a","a mid-life","mid-life crisis","Struggling to","to keep","keep his","his life","life in","in order","order ,",", he","he turns","turns to","to his","his eccentric","eccentric family","family for","for support","support -","- including","including his","his overly","overly protective","protective wife","wife ,",", Marie","Marie ;","; apathetic","apathetic and","and sardonic","sardonic son","son ,",", Cameron","Cameron ;","; environmental-activist","environmental-activist daughter","daughter ,",", Autumn","Autumn ;","; and","and genius","genius six-year-old","six-year-old child","child ,",", Jackson","As he","he attempts","attempts to","to reassemble","reassemble the","the various","various pieces","pieces of","of his","his personal","personal and","and professional","professional life","life ,",", Caleb","Caleb soon","soon discovers","discovers that","that neither","neither art","art nor","nor family","family are","are as","as elementary","elementary as","as he","he once","once suspected"]}

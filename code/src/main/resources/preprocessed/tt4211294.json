{"title":"Clerical Errors","plot":"It's always been the crooked path to easy street for Vinny. But when a routine bank heist goes terribly wrong, Vinny runs out of options. Hiding out in a small town church, he is discovered - and mistaken for their new pastor. It's a 'baptism by fire' as this crook-who-would-be-clergy struggles to keep up appearances, stumbling through sermons and sacraments! Bad turns to worse when \"Pastor\" is charged with mentoring a troubled youngster caught stealing (ah, the irony!), and overworked Administrator Mallory Ball struggles to keep all the plates spinning as the new pastor adjusts. Through it all, Vinny begins - for the first time - to understand real love and forgiveness. But when his devoted congregation finds out the truth, will they be able to forgive him?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["It","'s","alway","been","the","crook","path","to","easi","street","for","Vinni",".","But","when","a","routin","bank","heist","goe","terribl","wrong",",","Vinni","run","out","of","option",".","Hide","out","in","a","small","town","church",",","he","is","discov","-","and","mistaken","for","their","new","pastor",".","It","'s","a","'","baptism","by","fire","'","as","this","crook-who-would-be-clergi","struggl","to","keep","up","appear",",","stumbl","through","sermon","and","sacrament","!","Bad","turn","to","wors","when","\"","Pastor","\"","is","charg","with","mentor","a","troubl","youngster","caught","steal","(","ah",",","the","ironi","!",")",",","and","overwork","Administr","Mallori","Ball","struggl","to","keep","all","the","plate","spin","as","the","new","pastor","adjust",".","Through","it","all",",","Vinni","begin","-","for","the","first","time","-","to","understand","real","love","and","forgiv",".","But","when","his","devot","congreg","find","out","the","truth",",","will","they","be","abl","to","forgiv","him","?"],"lemmas":["it","be","always","be","the","crooked","path","to","easy","street","for","Vinny",".","but","when","a","routine","bank","heist","go","terribly","wrong",",","Vinny","run","out","of","option",".","hide","out","in","a","small","town","church",",","he","be","discover","-","and","mistaken","for","they","new","pastor",".","it","be","a","'","baptism","by","fire","'","as","this","crook-who-would-be-clergy","struggle","to","keep","up","appearance",",","stumble","through","sermon","and","sacrament","!","bad","turn","to","worse","when","``","Pastor","''","be","charge","with","mentore","a","troubled","youngster","catch","stealing","-lrb-","ah",",","the","irony","!","-rrb-",",","and","overwork","Administrator","Mallory","Ball","struggle","to","keep","all","the","plate","spin","as","the","new","pastor","adjust",".","through","it","all",",","Vinny","begin","-","for","the","first","time","-","to","understand","real","love","and","forgiveness",".","but","when","he","devoted","congregation","find","out","the","truth",",","will","they","be","able","to","forgive","he","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["It 's always","'s always been","always been the","been the crooked","the crooked path","crooked path to","path to easy","to easy street","easy street for","street for Vinny","But when a","when a routine","a routine bank","routine bank heist","bank heist goes","heist goes terribly","goes terribly wrong","terribly wrong ,","wrong , Vinny",", Vinny runs","Vinny runs out","runs out of","out of options","Hiding out in","out in a","in a small","a small town","small town church","town church ,","church , he",", he is","he is discovered","is discovered -","discovered - and","- and mistaken","and mistaken for","mistaken for their","for their new","their new pastor","It 's a","'s a '","a ' baptism","' baptism by","baptism by fire","by fire '","fire ' as","' as this","as this crook-who-would-be-clergy","this crook-who-would-be-clergy struggles","crook-who-would-be-clergy struggles to","struggles to keep","to keep up","keep up appearances","up appearances ,","appearances , stumbling",", stumbling through","stumbling through sermons","through sermons and","sermons and sacraments","Bad turns to","turns to worse","to worse when","worse when \"","when \" Pastor","\" Pastor \"","Pastor \" is","\" is charged","is charged with","charged with mentoring","with mentoring a","mentoring a troubled","a troubled youngster","troubled youngster caught","youngster caught stealing","caught stealing (","stealing ( ah","( ah ,","ah , the",", the irony","the irony !","irony !

{"title":"Mother Kuskokwim","plot":"This is a film about southwestern Alaska and the native Yupik people who live there. The region suffers from some of the worst rural poverty in the United States. This poverty is made worse by isolation, extreme temperatures in the winter, and the enormous cost of goods and services. Many of these people live without electricity or running water and rely heavily on subsistence fishing, hunting, and berry picking. All of this takes place in the context of a wild and largely intact tundra wilderness, which is currently threatened by planetary warming.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["This","is","a","film","about","southwestern","Alaska","and","the","nativ","Yupik","peopl","who","live","there",".","The","region","suffer","from","some","of","the","worst","rural","poverti","in","the","Unite","State",".","This","poverti","is","made","wors","by","isol",",","extrem","temperatur","in","the","winter",",","and","the","enorm","cost","of","good","and","servic",".","Mani","of","these","peopl","live","without","electr","or","run","water","and","reli","heavili","on","subsist","fish",",","hunt",",","and","berri","pick",".","All","of","this","take","place","in","the","context","of","a","wild","and","larg","intact","tundra","wilder",",","which","is","current","threaten","by","planetari","warm","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","film","about","southwestern","Alaska","and","the","native","Yupik","people","who","live","there",".","the","region","suffer","from","some","of","the","worst","rural","poverty","in","the","United","States",".","this","poverty","be","make","worse","by","isolation",",","extreme","temperature","in","the","winter",",","and","the","enormous","cost","of","goods","and","service",".","many","of","these","people","live","without","electricity","or","run","water","and","rely","heavily","on","subsistence","fishing",",","hunting",",","and","berry","picking",".","all","of","this","take","place","in","the","context","of","a","wild","and","largely","intact","tundra","wilderness",",","which","be","currently","threaten","by","planetary","warming","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is a","is a film","a film about","film about southwestern","about southwestern Alaska","southwestern Alaska and","Alaska and the","and the native","the native Yupik","native Yupik people","Yupik people who","people who live","who live there","The region suffers","region suffers from","suffers from some","from some of","some of the","of the worst","the worst rural","worst rural poverty","rural poverty in","poverty in the","in the United","the United States","This poverty is","poverty is made","is made worse","made worse by","worse by isolation","by isolation ,","isolation , extreme",", extreme temperatures","extreme temperatures in","temperatures in the","in the winter","the winter ,","winter , and",", and the","and the enormous","the enormous cost","enormous cost of","cost of goods","of goods and","goods and services","Many of these","of these people","these people live","people live without","live without electricity","without electricity or","electricity or running","or running water","running water and","water and rely","and rely heavily","rely heavily on","heavily on subsistence","on subsistence fishing","subsistence fishing ,","fishing , hunting",", hunting ,","hunting , and",", and berry","and berry picking","All of this","of this takes","this takes place","takes place in","place in the","in the context","the context of","context of a","of a wild","a wild and","wild and largely","and largely intact","largely intact tundra","intact tundra wilderness","tundra wilderness ,","wilderness , which",", which is","which is currently","is currently threatened","currently threatened by","threatened by planetary","by planetary warming"],"2grams":["This is","is a","a film","film about","about southwestern","southwestern Alaska","Alaska and","and the","the native","native Yupik","Yupik people","people who","who live","live there","The region","region suffers","suffers from","from some","some of","of the","the worst","worst rural","rural poverty","poverty in","in the","the United","United States","This poverty","poverty is","is made","made worse","worse by","by isolation","isolation ,",", extreme","extreme temperatures","temperatures in","in the","the winter","winter ,",", and","and the","the enormous","enormous cost","cost of","of goods","goods and","and services","Many of","of these","these people","people live","live without","without electricity","electricity or","or running","running water","water and","and rely","rely heavily","heavily on","on subsistence","subsistence fishing","fishing ,",", hunting","hunting ,",", and","and berry","berry picking","All of","of this","this takes","takes place","place in","in the","the context","context of","of a","a wild","wild and","and largely","largely intact","intact tundra","tundra wilderness","wilderness ,",", which","which is","is currently","currently threatened","threatened by","by planetary","planetary warming"]}

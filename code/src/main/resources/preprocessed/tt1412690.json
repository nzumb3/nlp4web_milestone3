{"title":"Amitié","plot":"Amitié; is a story of three people whose lives come together in unexpected ways. At first, Greg seems to have everything going for him. He has a girlfriend, Gloria, who has stuck with him for two years. Greg has many close friends and a steady job selling shoes. It's not the best, but it puts money in his pocket. An interest in theater and music brings Greg to a play where he meets Vanessa, an artistically-minded waitress. Vanessa is increasingly dissatisfied with her boyfriend's priorities, and she's wondering whether to break up with him. Kevin, a street musician dropout, has had a crush on Stacy for a long time. Kevin visits Stacy at the restaurant where she and Vanessa work. After getting into a fight with Stacy, Kevin bumps into Vanessa. The two go to a nearby coffee shop where they run into Greg. Greg invites them to play pool at his friend Mark's house. Gloria meets everyone at Mark's during the middle of a game. The group decides to go to a truck stop for a late-night meal. Gloria doesn't go because she has to work in the morning. Things take a turn for the worse.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Amitié",";","is","a","stori","of","three","peopl","whose","live","come","togeth","in","unexpect","way",".","At","first",",","Greg","seem","to","have","everyth","go","for","him",".","He","has","a","girlfriend",",","Gloria",",","who","has","stuck","with","him","for","two","year",".","Greg","has","mani","close","friend","and","a","steadi","job","sell","shoe",".","It","'s","not","the","best",",","but","it","put","money","in","his","pocket",".","An","interest","in","theater","and","music","bring","Greg","to","a","play","where","he","meet","Vanessa",",","an","artistically-mind","waitress",".","Vanessa","is","increas","dissatisfi","with","her","boyfriend","'s","prioriti",",","and","she","'s","wonder","whether","to","break","up","with","him",".","Kevin",",","a","street","musician","dropout",",","has","had","a","crush","on","Staci","for","a","long","time",".","Kevin","visit","Staci","at","the","restaur","where","she","and","Vanessa","work",".","After","get","into","a","fight","with","Staci",",","Kevin","bump","into","Vanessa",".","The","two","go","to","a","nearbi","coffe","shop","where","they","run","into","Greg",".","Greg","invit","them","to","play","pool","at","his","friend","Mark","'s","hous",".","Gloria","meet","everyon","at","Mark","'s","dure","the","middl","of","a","game",".","The","group","decid","to","go","to","a","truck","stop","for","a","late-night","meal",".","Gloria","doe","n't","go","becaus","she","has","to","work","in","the","morn",".","Thing","take","a","turn","for","the","wors","."],"lemmas":["Amitié",";","be","a","story","of","three","people","whose","life","come","together","in","unexpected","way",".","at","first",",","Greg","seem","to","have","everything","go","for","he",".","he","have","a","girlfriend",",","Gloria",",","who","have","stick","with","he","for","two","year",".","Greg","have","many","close","friend","and","a","steady","job","selling","shoe",".","it","be","not","the","best",",","but","it","put","money","in","he","pocket",".","a","interest","in","theater","and","music","bring","Greg","to","a","play","where","he","meet","Vanessa",",","a","artistically-minded","waitress",".","Vanessa","be","increasingly","dissatisfied","with","she","boyfriend","'s","priority",",","and","she","be","wonder","whether","to","break","up","with","he",".","Kevin",",","a","street","musician","dropout",",","have","have","a","crush","on","Stacy","for","a","long","time",".","Kevin","visit","Stacy","at","the","restaurant","where","she","and","Vanessa","work",".","after","get","into","a","fight","with","Stacy",",","Kevin","bump","into","Vanessa",".","the","two","go","to","a","nearby","coffee","shop","where","they","run","into","Greg",".","Greg","invite","they","to","play","pool","at","he","friend","Mark","'s","house",".","Gloria","meet","everyone","at","Mark","'s","during","the","middle","of","a","game",".","the","group","decide","to","go","to","a","truck","stop","for","a","late-night","meal",".","Gloria","do","not","go","because","she","have","to","work","in","the","morning",".","thing","take","a","turn","for","the","worse","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Amitié ;

{"title":"The Milky Way","plot":"1964, a village in Galilee. The Mukhtar collaborates with Israeli military rule. Someone is forging work permits, and the Mukhtar's son and a steady metalsmith, Mahmud, want to marry the same woman. These story lines cross when the village teacher is arrested and jailed for the forgeries, with the Mukhtar's approval. Mahmoud discovers who the real forger is and goes to the Mukhtar, whose son assumes Mahmud has come to denounce him. He sets off to burn down Mahmoud's house; tragedy follows. At Mahmud's side through his troubles is Mabruq, the village fool who, like others, particularly a young woman named Jamilah, still suffers from witnessing horrors in the 1948 war.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["1964",",","a","villag","in","Galile",".","The","Mukhtar","collabor","with","Israeli","militari","rule",".","Someon","is","forg","work","permit",",","and","the","Mukhtar","'s","son","and","a","steadi","metalsmith",",","Mahmud",",","want","to","marri","the","same","woman",".","These","stori","line","cross","when","the","villag","teacher","is","arrest","and","jail","for","the","forgeri",",","with","the","Mukhtar","'s","approv",".","Mahmoud","discov","who","the","real","forger","is","and","goe","to","the","Mukhtar",",","whose","son","assum","Mahmud","has","come","to","denounc","him",".","He","set","off","to","burn","down","Mahmoud","'s","hous",";","tragedi","follow",".","At","Mahmud","'s","side","through","his","troubl","is","Mabruq",",","the","villag","fool","who",",","like","other",",","particular","a","young","woman","name","Jamilah",",","still","suffer","from","wit","horror","in","the","1948","war","."],"lemmas":["1964",",","a","village","in","Galilee",".","the","Mukhtar","collaborate","with","israeli","military","rule",".","someone","be","forge","work","permit",",","and","the","Mukhtar","'s","son","and","a","steady","metalsmith",",","Mahmud",",","want","to","marry","the","same","woman",".","these","story","line","cross","when","the","village","teacher","be","arrest","and","jail","for","the","forgery",",","with","the","Mukhtar","'s","approval",".","Mahmoud","discover","who","the","real","forger","be","and","go","to","the","Mukhtar",",","whose","son","assume","Mahmud","have","come","to","denounce","he",".","he","set","off","to","burn","down","Mahmoud","'s","house",";","tragedy","follow",".","at","Mahmud","'s","side","through","he","trouble","be","Mabruq",",","the","village","fool","who",",","like","other",",","particularly","a","young","woman","name","Jamilah",",","still","suffer","from","witness","horror","in","the","1948","war","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["1964 , a",", a village","a village in","village in Galilee","The Mukhtar collaborates","Mukhtar collaborates with","collaborates with Israeli","with Israeli military","Israeli military rule","Someone is forging","is forging work","forging work permits","work permits ,","permits , and",", and the","and the Mukhtar","the Mukhtar 's","Mukhtar 's son","'s son and","son and a","and a steady","a steady metalsmith","steady metalsmith ,","metalsmith , Mahmud",", Mahmud ,","Mahmud , want",", want to","want to marry","to marry the","marry the same","the same woman","These story lines","story lines cross","lines cross when","cross when the","when the village","the village teacher","village teacher is","teacher is arrested","is arrested and","arrested and jailed","and jailed for","jailed for the","for the forgeries","the forgeries ,","forgeries , with",", with the","with the Mukhtar","the Mukhtar 's","Mukhtar 's approval","Mahmoud discovers who","discovers who the","who the real","the real forger","real forger is","forger is and","is and goes","and goes to","goes to the","to the Mukhtar","the Mukhtar ,","Mukhtar , whose",", whose son","whose son assumes","son assumes Mahmud","assumes Mahmud has","Mahmud has come","has come to","come to denounce","to denounce him","He sets off","sets off to","off to burn","to burn down","burn down Mahmoud","down Mahmoud 's","Mahmoud 's house","'s house ;","house ;

{"title":"Sneakah Boutique the Documentary","plot":"In this documentary, we explore the fervent spirit of three young African American entrepreneurs who will defy all critics and non-believers to become one of the most Innovative companies to usher in the retro fashion phenomena that encompasses popular culture in a millennial demographic. Brilliant, ambitious and filled with real desire we enter the minds of three forces of nature that assemble to create a lifestyle beyond the physical restraints of just fabric, prints and photo-shoots. Over the course of two years with complete creative autonomy and infectious concepts, Nailah Wright founder, Ernest Freeman business development and Whitney Bryant creative director manage to shift the climate with a new blueprint for grassroots success. From concept to fruition, everyday struggles turn to heated disputes and temporary setbacks in a world where fashion and culture is usually influenced by people of color but rarely controlled by them. Sneakah Boutique's model is fresh, new, revolutionary, and is poised to change the dynamic of Ecommerce forever. The Rise of an Empire chronicles the lives of these three visionaries as they attempt to take Sneakah Boutique to the next level. Using dramatic daily interactions, music performances, interviews and archival footage, this documentary offers an intensely personal look into the lives of the company's heartbeat.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","this","documentari",",","we","explor","the","fervent","spirit","of","three","young","African","American","entrepreneur","who","will","defi","all","critic","and","non-believ","to","becom","one","of","the","most","Innovat","compani","to","usher","in","the","retro","fashion","phenomena","that","encompass","popular","cultur","in","a","millenni","demograph",".","Brilliant",",","ambiti","and","fill","with","real","desir","we","enter","the","mind","of","three","forc","of","natur","that","assembl","to","creat","a","lifestyl","beyond","the","physic","restraint","of","just","fabric",",","print","and","photo-shoot",".","Over","the","cours","of","two","year","with","complet","creativ","autonomi","and","infecti","concept",",","Nailah","Wright","founder",",","Ernest","Freeman","busi","develop","and","Whitney","Bryant","creativ","director","manag","to","shift","the","climat","with","a","new","blueprint","for","grassroot","success",".","From","concept","to","fruition",",","everyday","struggl","turn","to","heat","disput","and","temporari","setback","in","a","world","where","fashion","and","cultur","is","usual","influenc","by","peopl","of","color","but","rare","control","by","them",".","Sneakah","Boutiqu","'s","model","is","fresh",",","new",",","revolutionari",",","and","is","pois","to","chang","the","dynam","of","Ecommerc","forev",".","The","Rise","of","an","Empire","chronicl","the","live","of","these","three","visionari","as","they","attempt","to","take","Sneakah","Boutiqu","to","the","next","level",".","Using","dramat","daili","interact",",","music","perform",",","interview","and","archiv","footag",",","this","documentari","offer","an","intens","person","look","into","the","live","of","the","compani","'s","heartbeat","."],"lemmas":["in","this","documentary",",","we","explore","the","fervent","spirit","of","three","young","african","american","entrepreneur","who","will","defy","all","critic","and","non-believer","to","become","one","of","the","most","innovative","company","to","usher","in","the","retro","fashion","phenomenon","that","encompass","popular","culture","in","a","millennial","demographic",".","brilliant",",","ambitious","and","fill","with","real","desire","we","enter","the","mind","of","three","force","of","nature","that","assemble","to","create","a","lifestyle","beyond","the","physical","restraint","of","just","fabric",",","print","and","photo-shoot",".","over","the","course","of","two","year","with","complete","creative","autonomy","and","infectious","concept",",","Nailah","Wright","founder",",","Ernest","Freeman","business","development","and","Whitney","Bryant","creative","director","manage","to","shift","the","climate","with","a","new","blueprint","for","grassroot","success",".","from","concept","to","fruition",",","everyday","struggle","turn","to","heated","dispute","and","temporary","setback","in","a","world","where","fashion","and","culture","be","usually","influence","by","people","of","color","but","rarely","control","by","they",".","Sneakah","Boutique","'s","model","be","fresh",",","new",",","revolutionary",",","and","be","poise","to","change","the","dynamic","of","Ecommerce","forever",".","the","rise","of","a","Empire","chronicle","the","life","of","these","three","visionary","as","they","attempt","to","take","Sneakah","Boutique","to","the","next","level",".","use","dramatic","daily","interaction",",","music","performance",",","interview","and","archival","footage",",","this","documentary","offer","a","intensely","personal","look","into","the","life","of","the","company","'s","heartbeat","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In

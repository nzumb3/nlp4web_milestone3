{"title":"One More Dead Fish","plot":"In a small town in Nova Scotia, Canada, six desperate fishermen seize a Federal building and barricade themselves inside. They're fighting regulations which let corporations destroy their traditional fishing grounds. When the government refuses to back down, fishermen seize 6 more buildings across Atlantic Canada. In tense footage of the men behind the barricade, and fascinating interviews with government officials and industry leaders, One More Dead Fish gets to the heart of a community's fight against globalization.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","a","small","town","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada",",","six","desper","fishermen","seiz","a","Feder","build","and","barricad","themselv","insid",".","They","re","fight","regul","which","let","corpor","destroy","their","tradit","fish","ground",".","When","the","govern","refus","to","back","down",",","fishermen","seiz","6","more","build","across","Atlantic","Canada",".","In","tens","footag","of","the","men","behind","the","barricad",",","and","fascin","interview","with","govern","offici","and","industri","leader",",","One","More","Dead","Fish","get","to","the","heart","of","a","communiti","'s","fight","against","global","."],"lemmas":["in","a","small","town","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada",",","six","desperate","fisherman","seize","a","Federal","building","and","barricade","themselves","inside",".","they","be","fight","regulation","which","let","corporation","destroy","they","traditional","fishing","grounds",".","when","the","government","refuse","to","back","down",",","fisherman","seize","6","more","building","across","Atlantic","Canada",".","in","tense","footage","of","the","man","behind","the","barricade",",","and","fascinating","interview","with","government","official","and","industry","leader",",","one","more","dead","fish","get","to","the","heart","of","a","community","'s","fight","against","globalization","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a small","a small town","small town in","town in Nova","in Nova Scotia","Nova Scotia ,","Scotia , Canada",", Canada ,","Canada , six",", six desperate","six desperate fishermen","desperate fishermen seize","fishermen seize a","seize a Federal","a Federal building","Federal building and","building and barricade","and barricade themselves","barricade themselves inside","They 're fighting","'re fighting regulations","fighting regulations which","regulations which let","which let corporations","let corporations destroy","corporations destroy their","destroy their traditional","their traditional fishing","traditional fishing grounds","When the government","the government refuses","government refuses to","refuses to back","to back down","back down ,","down , fishermen",", fishermen seize","fishermen seize 6","seize 6 more","6 more buildings","more buildings across","buildings across Atlantic","across Atlantic Canada","In tense footage","tense footage of","footage of the","of the men","the men behind","men behind the","behind the barricade","the barricade ,","barricade , and",", and fascinating","and fascinating interviews","fascinating interviews with","interviews with government","with government officials","government officials and","officials and industry","and industry leaders","industry leaders ,","leaders , One",", One More","One More Dead","More Dead Fish","Dead Fish gets","Fish gets to","gets to the","to the heart","the heart of","heart of a","of a community","a community 's","community 's fight","'s fight against","fight against globalization"],"2grams":["In a","a small","small town","town in","in Nova","Nova Scotia","Scotia ,",", Canada","Canada ,",", six","six desperate","desperate fishermen","fishermen seize","seize a","a Federal","Federal building","building and","and barricade","barricade themselves","themselves inside","They 're","'re fighting","fighting regulations","regulations which","which let","let corporations","corporations destroy","destroy their","their traditional","traditional fishing","fishing grounds","When the","the government","government refuses","refuses to","to back","back down","down ,",", fishermen","fishermen seize","seize 6","6 more","more buildings","buildings across","across Atlantic","Atlantic Canada","In tense","tense footage","footage of","of the","the men","men behind","behind the","the barricade","barricade ,",", and","and fascinating","fascinating interviews","interviews with","with government","government officials","officials and","and industry","industry leaders","leaders ,",", One","One More","More Dead","Dead Fish","Fish gets","gets to","to the","the heart","heart of","of a","a community","community 's","'s fight","fight against","against globalization"]}

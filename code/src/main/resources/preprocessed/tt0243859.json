{"title":"The Wild Bees","plot":"A bitter comedy about the difficult lives of young people living in an isolated part of North Moravia. The story is a confrontation of relations between various lovers. The heroes and heroines feel neither the strength nor much reason to commit themselves on a permanent basis because they are all incessantly aware of their social situation, which limits their hopes and yearnings and often turns them into a parody.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["A","bitter","comedi","about","the","difficult","live","of","young","peopl","live","in","an","isol","part","of","North","Moravia",".","The","stori","is","a","confront","of","relat","between","various","lover",".","The","hero","and","heroin","feel","neither","the","strength","nor","much","reason","to","commit","themselv","on","a","perman","basi","becaus","they","are","all","incess","awar","of","their","social","situat",",","which","limit","their","hope","and","yearn","and","often","turn","them","into","a","parodi","."],"lemmas":["a","bitter","comedy","about","the","difficult","life","of","young","people","live","in","a","isolate","part","of","North","Moravia",".","the","story","be","a","confrontation","of","relation","between","various","lover",".","the","hero","and","heroine","feel","neither","the","strength","nor","much","reason","to","commit","themselves","on","a","permanent","basis","because","they","be","all","incessantly","aware","of","they","social","situation",",","which","limit","they","hope","and","yearning","and","often","turn","they","into","a","parody","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A bitter comedy","bitter comedy about","comedy about the","about the difficult","the difficult lives","difficult lives of","lives of young","of young people","young people living","people living in","living in an","in an isolated","an isolated part","isolated part of","part of North","of North Moravia","The story is","story is a","is a confrontation","a confrontation of","confrontation of relations","of relations between","relations between various","between various lovers","The heroes and","heroes and heroines","and heroines feel","heroines feel neither","feel neither the","neither the strength","the strength nor","strength nor much","nor much reason","much reason to","reason to commit","to commit themselves","commit themselves on","themselves on a","on a permanent","a permanent basis","permanent basis because","basis because they","because they are","they are all","are all incessantly","all incessantly aware","incessantly aware of","aware of their","of their social","their social situation","social situation ,","situation , which",", which limits","which limits their","limits their hopes","their hopes and","hopes and yearnings","and yearnings and","yearnings and often","and often turns","often turns them","turns them into","them into a","into a parody"],"2grams":["A bitter","bitter comedy","comedy about","about the","the difficult","difficult lives","lives of","of young","young people","people living","living in","in an","an isolated","isolated part","part of","of North","North Moravia","The story","story is","is a","a confrontation","confrontation of","of relations","relations between","between various","various lovers","The heroes","heroes and","and heroines","heroines feel","feel neither","neither the","the strength","strength nor","nor much","much reason","reason to","to commit","commit themselves","themselves on","on a","a permanent","permanent basis","basis because","because they","they are","are all","all incessantly","incessantly aware","aware of","of their","their social","social situation","situation ,",", which","which limits","limits their","their hopes","hopes and","and yearnings","yearnings and","and often","often turns","turns them","them into","into a","a parody"]}

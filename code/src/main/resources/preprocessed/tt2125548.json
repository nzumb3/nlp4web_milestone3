{"title":"Love Free or Die","plot":"LOVE FREE OR DIE is about a man whose two defining passions are in direct conflict: his love for God and for his partner Mark. Gene Robinson is the first openly gay person to become a bishop in the historic traditions of Christendom. His consecration in 2003, to which he wore a bullet-proof vest, caused an international stir, and he has lived with death threats every day since. The film follows Robinson's personal story as American churches debate whether or not lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) people are equal to heterosexuals in the eyes of God while our nation debates whether LGBT people are equal to heterosexuals in the eyes of the law. In LOVE FREE OR DIE, Bishop Gene steps onto the world stage as he travels from small-town churches to Washington's Lincoln Memorial to London's Lambeth Palace calling for all to stand for equality - inspiring bishops, priests and ordinary folk to come out from the shadows and change history.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["LOVE","FREE","OR","DIE","is","about","a","man","whose","two","defin","passion","are","in","direct","conflict",":","his","love","for","God","and","for","his","partner","Mark",".","Gene","Robinson","is","the","first","open","gay","person","to","becom","a","bishop","in","the","histor","tradit","of","Christendom",".","His","consecr","in","2003",",","to","which","he","wore","a","bullet-proof","vest",",","caus","an","intern","stir",",","and","he","has","live","with","death","threat","everi","day","sinc",".","The","film","follow","Robinson","'s","person","stori","as","American","church","debat","whether","or","not","lesbian",",","gay",",","bisexu","and","transgend","(","LGBT",")","peopl","are","equal","to","heterosexu","in","the","eye","of","God","while","our","nation","debat","whether","LGBT","peopl","are","equal","to","heterosexu","in","the","eye","of","the","law",".","In","LOVE","FREE","OR","DIE",",","Bishop","Gene","step","onto","the","world","stage","as","he","travel","from","small-town","church","to","Washington","'s","Lincoln","Memori","to","London","'s","Lambeth","Palac","call","for","all","to","stand","for","equal","-","inspir","bishop",",","priest","and","ordinari","folk","to","come","out","from","the","shadow","and","chang","histori","."],"lemmas":["love","free","or","die","be","about","a","man","whose","two","define","passion","be","in","direct","conflict",":","he","love","for","God","and","for","he","partner","Mark",".","Gene","Robinson","be","the","first","openly","gay","person","to","become","a","bishop","in","the","historic","tradition","of","Christendom",".","he","consecration","in","2003",",","to","which","he","wear","a","bullet-proof","vest",",","cause","a","international","stir",",","and","he","have","live","with","death","threat","every","day","since",".","the","film","follow","Robinson","'s","personal","story","as","american","church","debate","whether","or","not","lesbian",",","gay",",","bisexual","and","transgender","-lrb-","lgbt","-rrb-","people","be","equal","to","heterosexual","in","the","eye","of","God","while","we","nation","debate","whether","lgbt","people","be","equal","to","heterosexual","in","the","eye","of","the","law",".","in","LOVE","FREE","or","DIE",",","Bishop","Gene","step","onto","the","world","stage","as","he","travel","from","small-town","church","to","Washington","'s","Lincoln","Memorial","to","London","'s","Lambeth","Palace","call","for","all","to","stand","for","equality","-","inspiring","bishop",",","priest","and","ordinary","folk","to","come","out","from","the","shadow","and","change","history","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["LOVE

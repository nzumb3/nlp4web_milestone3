{"title":"The Story of Lotus","plot":"The pretty girl Lotus, who lives in the Wuyi mountains in the south of China, lost her husband just after their marriage. This causes several difficulties for the newly-widowed Lotus; the sadness of losing her husband, the misunderstanding from her father-in-law, and their dispute in dividing the family properties. Lotus has to deal with this all by herself and support the family. Her softness and virtuousness wins the love of a bus driver who is kind and honest, and of a quarry manager who is powerful and rich. This forces Lotus to make a decision.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","pretti","girl","Lotus",",","who","live","in","the","Wuyi","mountain","in","the","south","of","China",",","lost","her","husband","just","after","their","marriag",".","This","caus","sever","difficulti","for","the","newly-widow","Lotus",";","the","sad","of","lose","her","husband",",","the","misunderstand","from","her","father-in-law",",","and","their","disput","in","divid","the","famili","properti",".","Lotus","has","to","deal","with","this","all","by","herself","and","support","the","famili",".","Her","soft","and","virtuous","win","the","love","of","a","bus","driver","who","is","kind","and","honest",",","and","of","a","quarri","manag","who","is","power","and","rich",".","This","forc","Lotus","to","make","a","decis","."],"lemmas":["the","pretty","girl","Lotus",",","who","live","in","the","Wuyi","mountain","in","the","south","of","China",",","lose","she","husband","just","after","they","marriage",".","this","cause","several","difficulty","for","the","newly-widowed","Lotus",";","the","sadness","of","lose","she","husband",",","the","misunderstanding","from","she","father-in-law",",","and","they","dispute","in","divide","the","family","property",".","Lotus","have","to","deal","with","this","all","by","herself","and","support","the","family",".","she","softness","and","virtuousness","win","the","love","of","a","bus","driver","who","be","kind","and","honest",",","and","of","a","quarry","manager","who","be","powerful","and","rich",".","this","force","Lotus","to","make","a","decision","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The pretty girl","pretty girl Lotus","girl Lotus ,","Lotus , who",", who lives","who lives in","lives in the","in the Wuyi","the Wuyi mountains","Wuyi mountains in","mountains in the","in the south","the south of","south of China","of China ,","China , lost",", lost her","lost her husband","her husband just","husband just after","just after their","after their marriage","This causes several","causes several difficulties","several difficulties for","difficulties for the","for the newly-widowed","the newly-widowed Lotus","newly-widowed Lotus ;","Lotus ; the","; the sadness","the sadness of","sadness of losing","of losing her","losing her husband","her husband ,","husband , the",", the misunderstanding","the misunderstanding from","misunderstanding from her","from her father-in-law","her father-in-law ,","father-in-law , and",", and their","and their dispute","their dispute in","dispute in dividing","in dividing the","dividing the family","the family properties","Lotus has to","has to deal","to deal with","deal with this","with this all","this all by","all by herself","by herself and","herself and support","and support the","support the family","Her softness and","softness and virtuousness","and virtuousness wins","virtuousness wins the","wins the love","the love of","love of a","of a bus","a bus driver","bus driver who","driver who is","who is kind","is kind and","kind and honest","and honest ,","honest , and",", and of","and of a","of a quarry","a quarry manager","quarry manager who","manager who is","who is powerful","is powerful and","powerful and rich","This forces Lotus","forces Lotus to","Lotus to make","to make a","make a decision"],"2grams":["The pretty","pretty girl","girl Lotus","Lotus ,",", who","who lives","lives in","in the","the Wuyi","Wuyi mountains","mountains in","in the","the south","south of","of China","China ,",", lost","lost her","her husband","husband just","just after","after their","their marriage","This causes","causes several","several difficulties","difficulties for","for the","the newly-widowed","newly-widowed Lotus","Lotus ;","; the","the sadness","sadness of","of losing","losing her","her husband","husband ,",", the","the misunderstanding","misunderstanding from","from her","her father-in-law","father-in-law ,",", and","and their","their dispute","dispute in","in dividing","dividing the","the family","family properties","Lotus has","has to","to deal","deal with","with this","this all","all by","by herself","herself and","and support","support the","the family","Her softness","softness and","and virtuousness","virtuousness wins","wins the","the love","love of","of a","a bus","bus driver","driver who","who is","is kind","kind and","and honest","honest ,",", and","and of","of a","a quarry","quarry manager","manager who","who is","is powerful","powerful and","and rich","This forces","forces Lotus","Lotus to","to make","make a","a decision"]}

Furthermore, the film's difficult and controversial release to an unsuspecting film public is also recounted as it survived the early revulsion to become a landmark cinematic creation with a profound effect on popular culture.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","1968",",","Pittsburgh","nativ",",","Georg","Romero",",","would","direct","a","low","budget","film","that","would","revolution","the","horror","genr","forev",",","Night","of","the","Live","Dead",".","Through","interview","with","the","talent","involv",",","the","stori","of","this","film","creation","is","told","and","how","it","reflect","it","time","with","a","grotesqu","and","power","immediaci",".","Furthermor",",","the","film","'s","difficult","and","controversi","releas","to","an","unsuspect","film","public","is","also","recount","as","it","surviv","the","earli","revuls","to","becom","a","landmark","cinemat","creation","with","a","profound","effect","on","popular","cultur","."],"lemmas":["in","1968",",","Pittsburgh","native",",","George","Romero",",","would","direct","a","low","budget","film","that","would","revolutionize","the","horror","genre","forever",",","Night","of","the","live","Dead",".","through","interview","with","the","talent","involve",",","the","story","of","this","film","creation","be","tell","and","how","it","reflect","its","time","with","a","grotesque","and","powerful","immediacy",".","furthermore",",","the","film","'s","difficult","and","controversial","release","to","a","unsuspecting","film","public","be","also","recount","as","it","survive","the","early","revulsion","to","become","a","landmark","cinematic","creation","with","a","profound","effect","on","popular","culture","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In 1968 ,","1968 , Pittsburgh",", Pittsburgh native","Pittsburgh native ,","native , George",", George Romero","George Romero ,","Romero , would",", would direct","would direct a","direct a low","a low budget","low budget film","budget film that","film that would","that would revolutionize","would revolutionize the","revolutionize the horror","the horror genre","horror genre forever","genre forever ,","forever , Night",", Night of","Night of the","of the Living","the Living Dead","Through interviews with","interviews with the","with the talents","the talents involved","talents involved ,","involved , the",", the story","the story of","story of this","of this film","this film creation","film creation is","creation is told","is told and","told and how","and how it","how it reflected","it reflected its","reflected its time","its time with","time with a","with a grotesque","a grotesque and","grotesque and powerful","and powerful immediacy","Furthermore , the",", the film","the film 's","film 's difficult","'s difficult and","difficult and controversial","and controversial release","controversial release to","release to an","to an unsuspecting","an unsuspecting film","unsuspecting film public","film public is","public is also","is also recounted","also recounted as","recounted as it","as it survived","it survived the","survived the early","the early revulsion","early revulsion to","revulsion to become","to become a","become a landmark","a landmark cinematic","landmark cinematic creation","cinematic creation with","creation with a","with a profound","a profound effect","profound effect on","effect on popular","on popular culture"],"2grams":["In 1968","1968 ,",", Pittsburgh","Pittsburgh native","native ,",", George","George Romero","Romero ,",", would","would direct","direct a","a low","low budget","budget film","film that","that would","would revolutionize","revolutionize the","the horror","horror genre","genre forever","forever ,",", Night","Night of","of the","the Living","Living Dead","Through interviews","interviews with","with the","the talents","talents involved","involved ,",", the","the story","story of","of this","this film","film creation","creation is","is told","told and","and how","how it","it reflected","reflected its","its time","time with","with a","a grotesque","grotesque and","and powerful","powerful immediacy","Furthermore ,",", the","the film","film 's","'s difficult","difficult and","and controversial","controversial release","release to","to an","an unsuspecting","unsuspecting film","film public","public is","is also","also recounted","recounted as","as it","it survived","survived the","the early","early revulsion","revulsion to","to become","become a","a landmark","landmark cinematic","cinematic creation","creation with","with a","a profound","profound effect","effect on","on popular","popular culture"]}

{"title":"Broke","plot":"High school, road trips, and the lost art of pool cleaning. In the vein of classic 80s teen comedies, BROKE follows the adventures of four friends who try to plan a weekend trip to Canada. Marshall Tucker has just survived the last day of his junior year of high school. To celebrate, he and his three best friends plan to head north of the border to Canada for the weekend. However, the venture soon takes a turn for the worse when Marshall's trusty Chevy Nova dies during their departure. Their solution; convince their friend Vern to take his parents minivan while they're away for a week on a shady religious retreat. Before the group even gets out of Chicago, they end up in a bizarre car accident, wrecking the minivan. Now it's up to them to find a way to raise a thousand dollars to fix the van before Vern's parents return home.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["High","school",",","road","trip",",","and","the","lost","art","of","pool","clean",".","In","the","vein","of","classic","80s","teen","comedi",",","BROKE","follow","the","adventur","of","four","friend","who","tri","to","plan","a","weekend","trip","to","Canada",".","Marshal","Tucker","has","just","surviv","the","last","day","of","his","junior","year","of","high","school",".","To","celebr",",","he","and","his","three","best","friend","plan","to","head","north","of","the","border","to","Canada","for","the","weekend",".","Howev",",","the","ventur","soon","take","a","turn","for","the","wors","when","Marshal","'s","trusti","Chevi","Nova","die","dure","their","departur",".","Their","solut",";","convinc","their","friend","Vern","to","take","his","parent","minivan","while","they","re","away","for","a","week","on","a","shadi","religi","retreat",".","Befor","the","group","even","get","out","of","Chicago",",","they","end","up","in","a","bizarr","car","accid",",","wreck","the","minivan",".","Now","it","'s","up","to","them","to","find","a","way","to","rais","a","thousand","dollar","to","fix","the","van","befor","Vern","'s","parent","return","home","."],"lemmas":["high","school",",","road","trip",",","and","the","lost","art","of","pool","cleaning",".","in","the","vein","of","classic","80s","teen","comedy",",","BROKE","follow","the","adventure","of","four","friend","who","try","to","plan","a","weekend","trip","to","Canada",".","Marshall","Tucker","have","just","survive","the","last","day","of","he","junior","year","of","high","school",".","to","celebrate",",","he","and","he","three","best","friend","plan","to","head","north","of","the","border","to","Canada","for","the","weekend",".","however",",","the","venture","soon","take","a","turn","for","the","worse","when","Marshall","'s","trusty","Chevy","Nova","die","during","they","departure",".","they","solution",";","convince","they","friend","Vern","to","take","he","parent","minivan","while","they","be","away","for","a","week","on","a","shady","religious","retreat",".","before","the","group","even","get","out","of","Chicago",",","they","end","up","in","a","bizarre","car","accident",",","wreck","the","minivan",".","now","it","be","up","to","they","to","find","a","way","to","raise","a","thousand","dollar","to","fix","the","van","before","Vern","'s","parent","return","home","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["High school ,","school , road",", road trips","road trips ,","trips , and",", and the","and the lost","the lost art","lost art of","art of pool","of pool cleaning","In the vein","the vein of","vein of classic","of classic 80s","classic 80s teen","80s teen comedies","teen comedies ,","comedies , BROKE",", BROKE follows","BROKE follows the","follows the adventures","the adventures of","adventures of four","of four friends","four friends who","friends who try","who try to","try to plan","to plan a","plan a weekend","a weekend trip","weekend trip to","trip to Canada","Marshall Tucker has","Tucker has just","has just survived","just survived the","survived the last","the last day","last day of","day of his","of his junior","his junior year","junior year of","year of high","of high school","To celebrate ,","celebrate , he",", he and","he and his","and his three","his three best","three best friends","best friends plan","friends plan to","plan to head","to head north","head north of","north of the","of the border","the border to","border to Canada","to Canada for","Canada for the","for the weekend","However , the",", the venture","the venture soon","venture soon takes","soon takes a","takes a turn","a turn for","turn for the","for the worse","the worse when","worse when Marshall","when Marshall 's","Marshall 's trusty","'s trusty Chevy","trusty Chevy Nova","Chevy Nova dies","Nova dies during","dies during their","during their departure","Their solution ;","solution ;

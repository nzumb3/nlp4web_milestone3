{"title":"New Hope","plot":"Michael is not thrilled about his family's move to New Hope, a small, close-knit southern town. After all, it is his senior year. He is even less enthused about joining the town's high school basketball team, especially when he begins to bump heads with the team's star player, Lucas. Lucas is fiercely loyal to the memory of his brother Chase -- the victim of a suicide that shook the entire town to its core. To Lucas, Michael is reaping everything Chase left behind -- an insult he refuses to accept. Jasmine, Chase's longtime girlfriend, still has not found peace a year after his tragic death -- until a chance meeting with Michael. Michael's faith is tested as he endures confrontations with Lucas on and off the basketball court and through his growing fascination with Jasmine. With topics including peer pressure, alcohol, sex, suicide, relationships, and acceptance, New Hope captures the life of the modern teenager.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Michael","is","not","thrill","about","his","famili","'s","move","to","New","Hope",",","a","small",",","close-knit","southern","town",".","After","all",",","it","is","his","senior","year",".","He","is","even","less","enthus","about","join","the","town","'s","high","school","basketbal","team",",","especi","when","he","begin","to","bump","head","with","the","team","'s","star","player",",","Luca",".","Luca","is","fierc","loyal","to","the","memori","of","his","brother","Chase","--","the","victim","of","a","suicid","that","shook","the","entir","town","to","it","core",".","To","Luca",",","Michael","is","reap","everyth","Chase","left","behind","--","an","insult","he","refus","to","accept",".","Jasmin",",","Chase","'s","longtim","girlfriend",",","still","has","not","found","peac","a","year","after","his","tragic","death","--","until","a","chanc","meet","with","Michael",".","Michael","'s","faith","is","test","as","he","endur","confront","with","Luca","on","and","off","the","basketbal","court","and","through","his","grow","fascin","with","Jasmin",".","With","topic","includ","peer","pressur",",","alcohol",",","sex",",","suicid",",","relationship",",","and","accept",",","New","Hope","captur","the","life","of","the","modern","teenag","."],"lemmas":["Michael","be","not","thrill","about","he","family","'s","move","to","New","Hope",",","a","small",",","close-knit","southern","town",".","after","all",",","it","be","he","senior","year",".","he","be","even","less","enthused","about","join","the","town","'s","high","school","basketball","team",",","especially","when","he","begin","to","bump","head","with","the","team","'s","star","player",",","Lucas",".","Lucas","be","fiercely","loyal","to","the","memory","of","he","brother","Chase","--","the","victim","of","a","suicide","that","shake","the","entire","town","to","its","core",".","to","Lucas",",","Michael","be","reap","everything","Chase","leave","behind","--","a","insult","he","refuse","to","accept",".","jasmine",",","Chase","'s","longtime","girlfriend",",","still","have","not","find","peace","a","year","after","he","tragic","death","--","until","a","chance","meeting","with","Michael",".","Michael","'s","faith","be","test","as","he","endure","confrontation","with","Lucas","on","and","off","the","basketball","court","and","through","he","grow","fascination","with","jasmine",".","with","topic","include","peer","pressure",",","alcohol",",","sex",",","suicide",",","relationship",",","and","acceptance",",","New","Hope","capture","the","life","of","the","modern","teenager","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Michael

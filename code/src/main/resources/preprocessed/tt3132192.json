{"title":"In Search of the Sublime","plot":"What is the sublime. When we witness something that instills fascination mixed with fear, or if we stand in the presence of something far larger than ourselves, according to Edmund Burke (1729-1797). So a father and his two sons went walking in the Yorkshire Dales. In the footsteps of Joseph Mallord William Turner, the nineteenth century landscape painter. In search of the sublime. They have seen death. They have admired life. And they have done stupid things. A short story about walking. And about how walking mirrors life.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["What","is","the","sublim",".","When","we","wit","someth","that","instil","fascin","mix","with","fear",",","or","if","we","stand","in","the","presenc","of","someth","far","larger","than","ourselv",",","accord","to","Edmund","Burk","(","1729-1797",")",".","So","a","father","and","his","two","son","went","walk","in","the","Yorkshir","Dale",".","In","the","footstep","of","Joseph","Mallord","William","Turner",",","the","nineteenth","centuri","landscap","painter",".","In","search","of","the","sublim",".","They","have","seen","death",".","They","have","admir","life",".","And","they","have","done","stupid","thing",".","A","short","stori","about","walk",".","And","about","how","walk","mirror","life","."],"lemmas":["what","be","the","sublime",".","when","we","witness","something","that","instill","fascination","mixed","with","fear",",","or","if","we","stand","in","the","presence","of","something","far","larger","than","ourselves",",","accord","to","Edmund","Burke","-lrb-","1729-1797","-rrb-",".","so","a","father","and","he","two","son","go","walk","in","the","Yorkshire","Dales",".","in","the","footstep","of","Joseph","Mallord","William","Turner",",","the","nineteenth","century","landscape","painter",".","in","search","of","the","sublime",".","they","have","see","death",".","they","have","admire","life",".","and","they","have","do","stupid","thing",".","a","short","story","about","walking",".","and","about","how","walking","mirror","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["What is the","is the sublime","When we witness","we witness something","witness something that","something that instills","that instills fascination","instills fascination mixed","fascination mixed with","mixed with fear","with fear ,","fear , or",", or if","or if we","if we stand","we stand in","stand in the","in the presence","the presence of","presence of something","of something far","something far larger","far larger than","larger than ourselves","than ourselves ,","ourselves , according",", according to","according to Edmund","to Edmund Burke","Edmund Burke (","Burke ( 1729-1797","( 1729-1797 )","So a father","a father and","father and his","and his two","his two sons","two sons went","sons went walking","went walking in","walking in the","in the Yorkshire","the Yorkshire Dales","In the footsteps","the footsteps of","footsteps of Joseph","of Joseph Mallord","Joseph Mallord William","Mallord William Turner","William Turner ,","Turner , the",", the nineteenth","the nineteenth century","nineteenth century landscape","century landscape painter","In search of","search of the","of the sublime","They have seen","have seen death","They have admired","have admired life","And they have","they have done","have done stupid","done stupid things","A short story","short story about","story about walking","And about how","about how walking","how walking mirrors","walking mirrors life"],"2grams":["What is","is the","the sublime","When we","we witness","witness something","something that","that instills","instills fascination","fascination mixed","mixed with","with fear","fear ,",", or","or if","if we","we stand","stand in","in the","the presence","presence of","of something","something far","far larger","larger than","than ourselves","ourselves ,",", according","according to","to Edmund","Edmund Burke","Burke (","( 1729-1797","1729-1797 )","So a","a father","father and","and his","his two","two sons","sons went","went walking","walking in","in the","the Yorkshire","Yorkshire Dales","In the","the footsteps","footsteps of","of Joseph","Joseph Mallord","Mallord William","William Turner","Turner ,",", the","the nineteenth","nineteenth century","century landscape","landscape painter","In search","search of","of the","the sublime","They have","have seen","seen death","They have","have admired","admired life","And they","they have","have done","done stupid","stupid things","A short","short story","story about","about walking","And about","about how","how walking","walking mirrors","mirrors life"]}

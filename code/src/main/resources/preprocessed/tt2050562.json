{"title":"Love and Other Anxieties","plot":"Faced with the reality that her only child will 'flee the nest' for college, documentary funder-turned-filmmaker Lyda Kuth gets anxious not only about her aspirations for her daughter but also about her relationship with her husband of 20 years. What is the real meaning of love, marriage, long-term commitment? She queries non-experts and experts alike, such as indie filmmaker Josh Safdie, playwright and budding rock star Kyle Jarrow, author and scholar Stephanie Coontz, about their successes and failures of the heart. 'Love and Other Anxieties' is both personal and poetic. With the help of editor/co-writer Lucia Small (filmmaker of 'My Father, the Genius' and 'The Axe in the Attic'), Kuth has crafted a meditative documentary that is poignantly intimate yet surprisingly universal.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Face","with","the","realiti","that","her","onli","child","will","'","flee","the","nest","'","for","colleg",",","documentari","funder-turned-filmmak","Lyda","Kuth","get","anxious","not","onli","about","her","aspir","for","her","daughter","but","also","about","her","relationship","with","her","husband","of","20","year",".","What","is","the","real","mean","of","love",",","marriag",",","long-term","commit","?","She","queri","non-expert","and","expert","alik",",","such","as","indi","filmmak","Josh","Safdi",",","playwright","and","bud","rock","star","Kyle","Jarrow",",","author","and","scholar","Stephani","Coontz",",","about","their","success","and","failur","of","the","heart",".","'","Love","and","Other","Anxieti","'","is","both","person","and","poetic",".","With","the","help","of","editor/co-writ","Lucia","Small","(","filmmak","of","'","My","Father",",","the","Genius","'","and","'","The","Axe","in","the","Attic","'",")",",","Kuth","has","craft","a","medit","documentari","that","is","poignant","intim","yet","surpris","univers","."],"lemmas":["face","with","the","reality","that","she","only","child","will","'","flee","the","nest","'","for","college",",","documentary","funder-turned-filmmaker","Lyda","Kuth","get","anxious","not","only","about","she","aspiration","for","she","daughter","but","also","about","she","relationship","with","she","husband","of","20","year",".","what","be","the","real","meaning","of","love",",","marriage",",","long-term","commitment","?","she","query","non-expert","and","expert","alike",",","such","as","indie","filmmaker","Josh","Safdie",",","playwright","and","budding","rock","star","Kyle","Jarrow",",","author","and","scholar","Stephanie","Coontz",",","about","they","success","and","failure","of","the","heart",".","'","love","and","other","anxiety","'","be","both","personal","and","poetic",".","with","the","help","of","editor/co-writer","Lucia","Small","-lrb-","filmmaker","of","'","My","Father",",","the","genius","'","and","'","the","Axe","in","the","attic","'","-rrb-",",","Kuth","have","craft","a","meditative","documentary","that","be","poignantly","intimate","yet","surprisingly","universal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Faced with the","with the reality","the reality that","reality that her","that her only","her only child","only child will","child will '","will ' flee","' flee the","flee the nest","the nest '","nest ' for","' for college","for college ,","college , documentary",", documentary funder-turned-filmmaker","documentary funder-turned-filmmaker Lyda","funder-turned-filmmaker Lyda Kuth","Lyda Kuth gets","Kuth gets anxious","gets anxious not","anxious not only","not only about","only about her","about her aspirations","her aspirations for","aspirations for her","for her daughter","her daughter but","daughter but also","but also about","also about her","about her relationship","her relationship with","relationship with her","with her husband","her husband of","husband of 20","of 20 years","What is the","is the real","the real meaning","real meaning of","meaning of love","of love ,","love , marriage",", marriage ,","marriage , long-term",", long-term commitment","She queries non-experts","queries non-experts and","non-experts and experts","and experts alike","experts alike ,","alike , such",", such as","such as indie","as indie filmmaker","indie filmmaker Josh","filmmaker Josh Safdie","Josh Safdie ,","Safdie , playwright",", playwright and","playwright and budding","and budding rock","budding rock star","rock star Kyle","star Kyle Jarrow","Kyle Jarrow ,","Jarrow , author",", author and","author and scholar","and scholar Stephanie","scholar Stephanie Coontz","Stephanie Coontz ,","Coontz , about",", about their","about their successes","their successes and","successes and failures","and failures of","failures of the","of the heart","the heart .","heart .

{"title":"Sister Mary","plot":"Homophobic detective Mark Rima (James Vallo) must \"partner\" up with the very gay and flamboyant Detective Chris Riant (Shawn Quinlan) to stop a serial killing Nun (Judy Tenuta) from offing 5 band members otherwise known as \"The Ex Choir Boys.\" But when it is determined that the detectives can't solve the case on their own, expert F.B.I. profiler Agent Peccant (comedian Ant) is assigned to the case. As the details of the case slowly emerge the police determine that that the \"nun\" may only be a silent witness to the grisly murders. The task force then turns its attention on the Catholic Church and a suspect group of Priests that have had a propensity for \"cleansing the souls\" of innocent young choir boys.","genres":["Comedy","

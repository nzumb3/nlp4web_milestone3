{"title":"Wet Dreams","plot":"This documentary follows Rebecca Romijn and Steve Willis as they approach Wet Design, the creators of the Bellagio fountain, with their dream to choreograph a fountain show. Their idea is to create a show to music that \"builds\" - specifically Ennio Morricone's \"Ecstasy of Gold\" from \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.\" Despite numerous attempts to contact WET Design, the creator of the fountain, they were unable to reach the firm's founder, Mark Fuller, until Romijn made an on-air plea on The Tonight Show With Jay Leno. WET Design engineer Peter Kopik translated Romijn's ideas to a computer system that emulates the fountain, \"Virtual WET,\" and finally to the fountain itself. The final tests at Bellagio proved so successful that the piece was added to the fountain's regular show schedule.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","follow","Rebecca","Romijn","and","Steve","Willi","as","they","approach","Wet","Design",",","the","creator","of","the","Bellagio","fountain",",","with","their","dream","to","choreograph","a","fountain","show",".","Their","idea","is","to","creat","a","show","to","music","that","\"","build","\"","-","specif","Ennio","Morricon","'s","\"","Ecstasi","of","Gold","\"","from","\"","The","Good",",","The","Bad","and","The","Ugli",".","\"","Despit","numer","attempt","to","contact","WET","Design",",","the","creator","of","the","fountain",",","they","were","unabl","to","reach","the","firm","'s","founder",",","Mark","Fuller",",","until","Romijn","made","an","on-air","plea","on","The","Tonight","Show","With","Jay","Leno",".","WET","Design","engin","Peter","Kopik","translat","Romijn","'s","idea","to","a","comput","system","that","emul","the","fountain",",","\"","Virtual","WET",",","\"","and","final","to","the","fountain","itself",".","The","final","test","at","Bellagio","prove","so","success","that","the","piec","was","ad","to","the","fountain","'s","regular","show","schedul","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","follow","Rebecca","Romijn","and","Steve","Willis","as","they","approach","Wet","Design",",","the","creator","of","the","Bellagio","fountain",",","with","they","dream","to","choreograph","a","fountain","show",".","they","idea","be","to","create","a","show","to","music","that","``","build","''","-","specifically","Ennio","Morricone","'s","``","Ecstasy","of","Gold","''","from","``","the","Good",",","The","Bad","and","The","Ugly",".","''","despite","numerous","attempt","to","contact","WET","Design",",","the","creator","of","the","fountain",",","they","be","unable","to","reach","the","firm","'s","founder",",","Mark","Fuller",",","until","Romijn","make","a","on-air","plea","on","the","Tonight","Show","With","Jay","Leno",".","WET","Design","engineer","Peter","Kopik","translate","Romijn","'s","idea","to","a","computer","system","that","emulate","the","fountain",",","``","virtual","wet",",","''","and","finally","to","the","fountain","itself",".","the","final","test","at","Bellagio","prove","so","successful","that","the","piece","be","add","to","the","fountain","'s","regular","show","schedule","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary follows","documentary follows Rebecca","follows Rebecca Romijn","Rebecca Romijn and","Romijn and Steve","and Steve Willis","Steve Willis as","Willis as they","as they approach","they approach Wet","approach Wet Design","Wet Design ,","Design , the",", the creators","the creators of","creators of the","of the Bellagio","the Bellagio fountain","Bellagio fountain ,","fountain , with",", with their","with their dream","their dream to","dream to choreograph","to choreograph a","choreograph a fountain","a fountain show","Their idea is","idea is to","is to create","to create a","create a show","a show to","show to music","to music that","music that \"","that \" builds","\" builds \"","builds \" -","\" -

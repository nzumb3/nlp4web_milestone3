{"title":"The Hide","plot":"On the windswept Suffolk mudflats creaks a bird-hide, inside which hovers Roy Tunt, a prematurely aged, mildly obsessive-compulsive birder. With one more sighting - the elusive sociable plover - he will have 'twitched' the entire British List. Tunt has his shortwave radio, packed-lunch and a portrait of his ex-wife Sandra for company. Suddenly, in the midst of a conversation with Sandra's portrait, the hide door blows open and a bedraggled stranger - unshaven, edgy and bloodied introduces himself as Dave John, a fugitive from the storm. After a tense introduction, the two men discover that they have a good deal in common, sharing sandwiches, tea and personal exchanges which are frank, poignant and often funny. As the two men begin to form a close bond news of a police manhunt sets them both on edge driving their fragile relationship to a tragic conclusion.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["On","the","windswept","Suffolk","mudflat","creak","a","bird-hid",",","insid","which","hover","Roy","Tunt",",","a","prematur","age",",","mild","obsessive-compuls","birder",".","With","one","more","sight","-","the","elus","sociabl","plover","-","he","will","have","'","twitch","'","the","entir","British","List",".","Tunt","has","his","shortwav","radio",",","packed-lunch","and","a","portrait","of","his","ex-wif","Sandra","for","compani",".","Sudden",",","in","the","midst","of","a","convers","with","Sandra","'s","portrait",",","the","hide","door","blow","open","and","a","bedraggl","stranger","-","unshaven",",","edgi","and","bloodi","introduc","himself","as","Dave","John",",","a","fugit","from","the","storm",".","After","a","tens","introduct",",","the","two","men","discov","that","they","have","a","good","deal","in","common",",","share","sandwich",",","tea","and","person","exchang","which","are","frank",",","poignant","and","often","funni",".","As","the","two","men","begin","to","form","a","close","bond","news","of","a","polic","manhunt","set","them","both","on","edg","drive","their","fragil","relationship","to","a","tragic","conclus","."],"lemmas":["on","the","windswept","Suffolk","mudflat","creak","a","bird-hide",",","inside","which","hover","Roy","Tunt",",","a","prematurely","aged",",","mildly","obsessive-compulsive","birder",".","with","one","more","sighting","-","the","elusive","sociable","plover","-","he","will","have","'","twitch","'","the","entire","british","list",".","Tunt","have","he","shortwave","radio",",","packed-lunch","and","a","portrait","of","he","ex-wife","Sandra","for","company",".","suddenly",",","in","the","midst","of","a","conversation","with","Sandra","'s","portrait",",","the","hide","door","blow","open","and","a","bedraggled","stranger","-","unshaven",",","edgy","and","bloody","introduce","himself","as","Dave","John",",","a","fugitive","from","the","storm",".","after","a","tense","introduction",",","the","two","man","discover","that","they","have","a","good","deal","in","common",",","share","sandwich",",","tea","and","personal","exchange","which","be","frank",",","poignant","and","often","funny",".","as","the","two","man","begin","to","form","a","close","bond","news","of","a","police","manhunt","set","they","both","on","edge","drive","they","fragile","relationship","to","a","tragic","conclusion","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On the windswept","the windswept Suffolk","windswept Suffolk mudflats","Suffolk mudflats creaks","mudflats creaks a","creaks a bird-hide","a bird-hide ,","bird-hide , inside",", inside which","inside which hovers","which hovers Roy","hovers Roy Tunt","Roy Tunt ,","Tunt , a",", a prematurely","a prematurely aged","prematurely aged ,","aged , mildly",", mildly obsessive-compulsive","mildly obsessive-compulsive birder","With one more","one more sighting","more sighting -","sighting -

{"title":"Lost Causes","plot":"'Lost Causes' is a neo-noir set in Oakland, California. This is where criminal defense attorney, Archer Keats, struggles to maintain his office overlooking the city. Archer hasn't tried a case in three years. When a high-profile, gangland murder falls in his lap, his first instinct is to find a way out of the case. As he and his investigator, struggle to unravel tangled allegiances and contradictory clues, what Archer assumed was a dead case begins to take on new life. A trial - something Archer desperately wants to avoid - looms on the horizon, and Archer is forced to confront the demons that have haunted him since his last case.","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["'","Lost","Caus","'","is","a","neo-noir","set","in","Oakland",",","California",".","This","is","where","crimin","defens","attorney",",","Archer","Keat",",","struggl","to","maintain","his","offic","overlook","the","citi",".","Archer","has","n't","tri","a","case","in","three","year",".","When","a","high-profil",",","gangland","murder","fall","in","his","lap",",","his","first","instinct","is","to","find","a","way","out","of","the","case",".","As","he","and","his","investig",",","struggl","to","unravel","tangl","allegi","and","contradictori","clue",",","what","Archer","assum","was","a","dead","case","begin","to","take","on","new","life",".","A","trial","-","someth","Archer","desper","want","to","avoid","-","loom","on","the","horizon",",","and","Archer","is","forc","to","confront","the","demon","that","have","haunt","him","sinc","his","last","case","."],"lemmas":["'","Lost","cause","'","be","a","neo-noir","set","in","Oakland",",","California",".","this","be","where","criminal","defense","attorney",",","Archer","Keats",",","struggle","to","maintain","he","office","overlook","the","city",".","Archer","have","not","try","a","case","in","three","year",".","when","a","high-profile",",","gangland","murder","fall","in","he","lap",",","he","first","instinct","be","to","find","a","way","out","of","the","case",".","as","he","and","he","investigator",",","struggle","to","unravel","tangled","allegiance","and","contradictory","clue",",","what","Archer","assume","be","a","dead","case","begin","to","take","on","new","life",".","a","trial","-","something","Archer","desperately","want","to","avoid","-","loom","on","the","horizon",",","and","Archer","be","force","to","confront","the","demon","that","have","haunt","he","since","he","last","case","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["' Lost Causes","Lost Causes '","Causes ' is","' is a","is a neo-noir","a neo-noir set","neo-noir set in","set in Oakland","in Oakland ,","Oakland , California","This is where","is where criminal","where criminal defense","criminal defense attorney","defense attorney ,","attorney , Archer",", Archer Keats","Archer Keats ,","Keats , struggles",", struggles to","struggles to maintain","to maintain his","maintain his office","his office overlooking","office overlooking the","overlooking the city","Archer has n't","has n't tried","n't tried a","tried a case","a case in","case in three","in three years","When a high-profile","a high-profile ,","high-profile , gangland",", gangland murder","gangland murder falls","murder falls in","falls in his","in his lap","his lap ,","lap , his",", his first","his first instinct","first instinct is","instinct is to","is to find","to find a","find a way","a way out","way out of","out of the","of the case","As he and","he and his","and his investigator","his investigator ,","investigator , struggle",", struggle to","struggle to unravel","to unravel tangled","unravel tangled allegiances","tangled allegiances and","allegiances and contradictory","and contradictory clues","contradictory clues ,","clues , what",", what Archer","what Archer assumed","Archer assumed was","assumed was a","was a dead","a dead case","dead case begins","case begins to","begins to take","to take on","take on new","on new life","A trial -","trial -

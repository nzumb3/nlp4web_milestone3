{"title":"Alfred Eliasson & Loftleidir Icelandic","plot":"This documentary tells the story of the aviation entrepreneur Alfred Eliasson, founder and manager of Loftleidir Icelandic, who is recognized as one of the pioneers in Trans-Atlantic passenger aviation. As well as being a gripping drama, the Loftleidir saga is a study in leadership. Trusted by everyone, Mr. Eliasson was a top flight motivator and a visionary who communicated his vision effectively to his employees. Whether it was to go on a dangerous rescue mission on a glacier to dig up a stranded DC-3 plane, find ways to outsmart the market stranglehold of government owned airlines (IATA) or offer low fares as a way to increase business and revenues, Alfred Eliasson had the ability to come up with solutions to seemingly hopeless situations. Alfred Eliasson and his friends formed Loftleidir almost empty handed - with a four seat Stinson Reliant in 1944 - and made the company not only the 20th century's most successful business venture in Iceland but alsoÂ a major player in international aviation, among ten biggest airlines on the Atlantic. Loftleidir Icelandic was the first low-cost carrier in the world, started offering low fares as early as 1952, making New York - Luxembourg via Iceland it's main route. Loftleidir was nicknamed \"The Hippie Airline\" in the 60's and 70's because of its popularity with young people with little means to travel. Besides Stinson, Loftleidir Icelandic operated Douglas DC-3, DC-4, DC-6, DC-8-63, Norseman, Anson, Grumman, Catalina and Canadair CL-44 airplanes, all of which appear in the film.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","tell","the","stori","of","the","aviat","entrepreneur","Alfred","Eliasson",",","founder","and","manag","of","Loftleidir","Iceland",",","who","is","recogn","as","one","of","the","pioneer","in","Trans-Atlant","passeng","aviat",".","As","well","as","be","a","grip","drama",",","the","Loftleidir","saga","is","a","studi","in","leadership",".","Trust","by","everyon",",","Mr.","Eliasson","was","a","top","flight","motiv","and","a","visionari","who","communic","his","vision","effect","to","his","employe",".","Whether","it","was","to","go","on","a","danger","rescu","mission","on","a","glacier","to","dig","up","a","strand","DC-3","plane",",","find","way","to","outsmart","the","market","stranglehold","of","govern","own","airlin","(","IATA",")","or","offer","low","fare","as","a","way","to","increas","busi","and","revenu",",","Alfred","Eliasson","had","the","abil","to","come","up","with","solut","to","seem","hopeless","situat",".","Alfred","Eliasson","and","his","friend","form","Loftleidir","almost","empti","hand","-","with","a","four","seat","Stinson","Reliant","in","1944","-","and","made","the","compani","not","onli","the","20th","centuri","'s","most","success","busi","ventur","in","Iceland","but","also","a","major","player","in","intern","aviat",",","among","ten","biggest","airlin","on","the","Atlantic",".","Loftleidir","Iceland","was","the","first","low-cost","carrier","in","the","world",",","start","offer","low","fare","as","earli","as","1952",",","make","New","York","-","Luxembourg","via","Iceland","it","'s","main","rout",".","Loftleidir","was","nicknam","\"","The","Hippi","Airlin","\"","in","the","60","'s","and","70","'s","becaus","of","it","popular","with","young","peopl","with","littl","mean","to","travel",".","Besid","Stinson",",","Loftleidir","Iceland","oper","Dougla","DC-3",",","DC-4",",","DC-6",",","DC-8-63",",","Norseman",",","Anson",",","Grumman",",","Catalina","and","Canadair","CL-44","airplan",",","all","of","which","appear","in","the","film","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","tell","the","story","of","the","aviation","entrepreneur","Alfred","Eliasson",",","founder","and","manager","of","Loftleidir","Icelandic",",","who","be","recognize","as","one","of","the","pioneer","in","trans-atlantic","passenger","aviation",".","as","well","as","be","a","grip","drama",",","the","Loftleidir","saga","be","a","study","in","leadership",".","trust","by","everyone",",","Mr.","Eliasson","be","a","top","flight","motivator","and","a","visionary","who","communicate","he","vision","effectively","to","he","employee",".","whether","it","be","to","go","on","a","dangerous","rescue","mission","on","a","glacier","to","dig","up","a","stranded","dc-3","plane",",","find","way","to","outsmart","the","market","stranglehold","of","government","own","airline","-lrb-","IATA","-rrb-","or","offer","low","fare","as","a","way","to","increase","business","and","revenue",",","Alfred","Eliasson","have","the","ability","to","come","up","with","solution","to","seemingly","hopeless","situation",".","Alfred","Eliasson","and","he","friend","form","Loftleidir","almost","empty","handed","-","with","a","four","seat","Stinson","Reliant","in","1944","-","and","make","the","company","not","only","the","20th","century","be","most","successful","business","venture","in","Iceland","but","also","a","major","player","in","international","aviation",",","among","ten","biggest","airline","on","the","Atlantic",".","Loftleidir","Icelandic","be","the","first","low-cost","carrier","in","the","world",",","start","offer","low","fare","as","early","as","1952",",","make","New","York","-","Luxembourg","via","Iceland","it","be","main","route",".","Loftleidir","be","nickname","``","the","Hippie","Airline","''","in","the","60","'s","and","70","'s","because","of","its","popularity","with","young","people","with","little","means","to","travel",".","besides","Stinson",",","Loftleidir","Icelandic","operate","Douglas","dc-3",",","dc-4",",","dc-6",",","dc-8-63",",","Norseman",",","Anson",",","Grumman",",","Catalina","and","Canadair","cl-44","airplane",",","all","of","which","appear","in","the","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

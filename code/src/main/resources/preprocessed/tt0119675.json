{"title":"Mimic","plot":"A disease carried by common cockroaches is killing Manhattan children. In an effort to stop the epidemic an entomologist, Susan Tyler, creates a mutant breed of insect that secretes a fluid to kill the roaches. This mutant breed was engineered to die after one generation, but three years later Susan finds out that the species has survived and evolved into a large, gruesome monster that can mimic human form.","genres":["Horror"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["A","diseas","carri","by","common","cockroach","is","kill","Manhattan","children",".","In","an","effort","to","stop","the","epidem","an","entomologist",",","Susan","Tyler",",","creat","a","mutant","breed","of","insect","that","secret","a","fluid","to","kill","the","roach",".","This","mutant","breed","was","engin","to","die","after","one","generat",",","but","three","year","later","Susan","find","out","that","the","speci","has","surviv","and","evolv","into","a","larg",",","gruesom","monster","that","can","mimic","human","form","."],"lemmas":["a","disease","carry","by","common","cockroach","be","kill","Manhattan","child",".","in","a","effort","to","stop","the","epidemic","a","entomologist",",","Susan","Tyler",",","create","a","mutant","breed","of","insect","that","secrete","a","fluid","to","kill","the","roach",".","this","mutant","breed","be","engineer","to","die","after","one","generation",",","but","three","year","later","Susan","find","out","that","the","species","have","survive","and","evolve","into","a","large",",","gruesome","monster","that","can","mimic","human","form","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A disease carried","disease carried by","carried by common","by common cockroaches","common cockroaches is","cockroaches is killing","is killing Manhattan","killing Manhattan children","In an effort","an effort to","effort to stop","to stop the","stop the epidemic","the epidemic an","epidemic an entomologist","an entomologist ,","entomologist , Susan",", Susan Tyler","Susan Tyler ,","Tyler , creates",", creates a","creates a mutant","a mutant breed","mutant breed of","breed of insect","of insect that","insect that secretes","that secretes a","secretes a fluid","a fluid to","fluid to kill","to kill the","kill the roaches","This mutant breed","mutant breed was","breed was engineered","was engineered to","engineered to die","to die after","die after one","after one generation","one generation ,","generation , but",", but three","but three years","three years later","years later Susan","later Susan finds","Susan finds out","finds out that","out that the","that the species","the species has","species has survived","has survived and","survived and evolved","and evolved into","evolved into a","into a large","a large ,","large , gruesome",", gruesome monster","gruesome monster that","monster that can","that can mimic","can mimic human","mimic human form"],"2grams":["A disease","disease carried","carried by","by common","common cockroaches","cockroaches is","is killing","killing Manhattan","Manhattan children","In an","an effort","effort to","to stop","stop the","the epidemic","epidemic an","an entomologist","entomologist ,",", Susan","Susan Tyler","Tyler ,",", creates","creates a","a mutant","mutant breed","breed of","of insect","insect that","that secretes","secretes a","a fluid","fluid to","to kill","kill the","the roaches","This mutant","mutant breed","breed was","was engineered","engineered to","to die","die after","after one","one generation","generation ,",", but","but three","three years","years later","later Susan","Susan finds","finds out","out that","that the","the species","species has","has survived","survived and","and evolved","evolved into","into a","a large","large ,",", gruesome","gruesome monster","monster that","that can","can mimic","mimic human","human form"]}

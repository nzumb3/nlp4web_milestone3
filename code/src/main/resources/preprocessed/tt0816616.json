{"title":"Poor Boy's Game","plot":"Donnie Rose went to prison for beating a young man so brutally it left him handicapped for life. Nine years later, Donnie is out. He's a different man with only one place to go: back home to the same violent and racist neighborhood that created him. At the other end of town, the black community still wants revenge. The instrument of justice will be Ossie Paris, a devastatingly talented boxer who challenges Donnie to a match; a match Donnie's family and peers won't let him refuse. George Carvery has waited nine years to avenge his son's fate at the hands of Donnie. When finally they meet face to face, however, both realize they share a similar desire to overcome the past. As the barely contained racism boils to the surface, George and Donnie form a seemingly unlikely alliance. Their partnership makes them outcasts from both tribes, who will only be satisfied by blood in the ring. The two men get to know each other in the eye of a storm, knowing full well that their futures will be decided with the bell of the first round.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Donni","Rose","went","to","prison","for","beat","a","young","man","so","brutal","it","left","him","handicap","for","life",".","Nine","year","later",",","Donni","is","out",".","He","'s","a","differ","man","with","onli","one","place","to","go",":","back","home","to","the","same","violent","and","racist","neighborhood","that","creat","him",".","At","the","other","end","of","town",",","the","black","communiti","still","want","reveng",".","The","instrument","of","justic","will","be","Ossie","Pari",",","a","devast","talent","boxer","who","challeng","Donni","to","a","match",";","a","match","Donni","'s","famili","and","peer","wo","n't","let","him","refus",".","Georg","Carveri","has","wait","nine","year","to","aveng","his","son","'s","fate","at","the","hand","of","Donni",".","When","final","they","meet","face","to","face",",","howev",",","both","realiz","they","share","a","similar","desir","to","overcom","the","past",".","As","the","bare","contain","racism","boil","to","the","surfac",",","Georg","and","Donni","form","a","seem","unlik","allianc",".","Their","partnership","make","them","outcast","from","both","tribe",",","who","will","onli","be","satisfi","by","blood","in","the","ring",".","The","two","men","get","to","know","each","other","in","the","eye","of","a","storm",",","know","full","well","that","their","futur","will","be","decid","with","the","bell","of","the","first","round","."],"lemmas":["Donnie","Rose","go","to","prison","for","beat","a","young","man","so","brutally","it","leave","he","handicap","for","life",".","nine","year","later",",","Donnie","be","out",".","he","be","a","different","man","with","only","one","place","to","go",":","back","home","to","the","same","violent","and","racist","neighborhood","that","create","he",".","at","the","other","end","of","town",",","the","black","community","still","want","revenge",".","the","instrument","of","justice","will","be","Ossie","Paris",",","a","devastatingly","talented","boxer","who","challenge","Donnie","to","a","match",";","a","match","Donnie","'s","family","and","peer","will","not","let","he","refuse",".","George","Carvery","have","wait","nine","year","to","avenge","he","son","'s","fate","at","the","hand","of","Donnie",".","when","finally","they","meet","face","to","face",",","however",",","both","realize","they","share","a","similar","desire","to","overcome","the","past",".","as","the","barely","contain","racism","boil","to","the","surface",",","George","and","Donnie","form","a","seemingly","unlikely","alliance",".","they","partnership","make","they","outcast","from","both","tribe",",","who","will","only","be","satisfy","by","blood","in","the","ring",".","the","two","man","get","to","know","each","other","in","the","eye","of","a","storm",",","know","full","well","that","they","future","will","be","decide","with","the","bell","of","the","first","round","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Donnie Rose went","Rose went to","went to prison","to prison for","prison for beating","for beating a","beating a young","a young man","young man so","man so brutally","so brutally it","brutally it left","it left him","left him handicapped","him handicapped for","handicapped for life","Nine years later","years later ,","later , Donnie",", Donnie is","Donnie is out","He 's a","'s a different","a different man","different man with","man with only","with only one","only one place","one place to","place to go","to go :","go : back",": back home","back home to","home to the","to the same","the same violent","same violent and","violent and racist","and racist neighborhood","racist neighborhood that","neighborhood that created","that created him","At the other","the other end","other end of","end of town","of town ,","town , the",", the black","the black community","black community still","community still wants","still wants revenge","The instrument of","instrument of justice","of justice will","justice will be","will be Ossie","be Ossie Paris","Ossie Paris ,","Paris , a",", a devastatingly","a devastatingly talented","devastatingly talented boxer","talented boxer who","boxer who challenges","who challenges Donnie","challenges Donnie to","Donnie to a","to a match","a match ;","match ;

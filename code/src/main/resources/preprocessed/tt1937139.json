{"title":"Dissonance","plot":"DISSONANCE is composed of documentary material of diverse kinds, juxtaposed on an HD wide-screen, in a challenging formal manner. The opening sequence is composed of 3 screens, each with a single shot on it, lasting 50 minutes; the interaction between the 3 images is force which compels interest. Following this sequence are a number of other much quicker shots, often enigmatic. The conclusion is abrupt. I have no idea what it means, only that it poetically probes the meaning of life, and offers no conclusions. It is meant, on many levels, to disturb the viewer.","genres":["Documentary"," Horror"],"stems":["DISSONANCE","is","compos","of","documentari","materi","of","divers","kind",",","juxtapos","on","an","HD","wide-screen",",","in","a","challeng","formal","manner",".","The","open","sequenc","is","compos","of","3","screen",",","each","with","a","singl","shot","on","it",",","last","50","minut",";","the","interact","between","the","3","imag","is","forc","which","compel","interest",".","Follow","this","sequenc","are","a","number","of","other","much","quicker","shot",",","often","enigmat",".","The","conclus","is","abrupt",".","I","have","no","idea","what","it","mean",",","onli","that","it","poetic","probe","the","mean","of","life",",","and","offer","no","conclus",".","It","is","meant",",","on","mani","level",",","to","disturb","the","viewer","."],"lemmas":["dissonance","be","compose","of","documentary","material","of","diverse","kind",",","juxtapose","on","a","hd","wide-screen",",","in","a","challenging","formal","manner",".","the","opening","sequence","be","compose","of","3","screen",",","each","with","a","single","shot","on","it",",","last","50","minute",";","the","interaction","between","the","3","image","be","force","which","compel","interest",".","follow","this","sequence","be","a","number","of","other","much","quicker","shot",",","often","enigmatic",".","the","conclusion","be","abrupt",".","I","have","no","idea","what","it","mean",",","only","that","it","poetically","probe","the","meaning","of","life",",","and","offer","no","conclusion",".","it","be","mean",",","on","many","level",",","to","disturb","the","viewer","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["DISSONANCE is composed","is composed of","composed of documentary","of documentary material","documentary material of","material of diverse","of diverse kinds","diverse kinds ,","kinds , juxtaposed",", juxtaposed on","juxtaposed on an","on an HD","an HD wide-screen","HD wide-screen ,","wide-screen , in",", in a","in a challenging","a challenging formal","challenging formal manner","The opening sequence","opening sequence is","sequence is composed","is composed of","composed of 3","of 3 screens","3 screens ,","screens , each",", each with","each with a","with a single","a single shot","single shot on","shot on it","on it ,","it , lasting",", lasting 50","lasting 50 minutes","50 minutes ;","minutes ; the","; the interaction","the interaction between","interaction between the","between the 3","the 3 images","3 images is","images is force","is force which","force which compels","which compels interest","Following this sequence","this sequence are","sequence are a","are a number","a number of","number of other","of other much","other much quicker","much quicker shots","quicker shots ,","shots , often",", often enigmatic","The conclusion is","conclusion is abrupt","I have no","have no idea","no idea what","idea what it","what it means","it means ,","means , only",", only that","only that it","that it poetically","it poetically probes","poetically probes the","probes the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of life","of life ,","life , and",", and offers","and offers no","offers no conclusions","It is meant","is meant ,","meant , on",", on many","on many levels","many levels ,","levels , to",", to disturb","to disturb the","disturb the viewer"],"2grams":["DISSONANCE is","is composed","composed of","of documentary","documentary material","material of","of diverse","diverse kinds","kinds ,",", juxtaposed","juxtaposed on","on an","an HD","HD wide-screen","wide-screen ,",", in","in a","a challenging","challenging formal","formal manner","The opening","opening sequence","sequence is","is composed","composed of","of 3","3 screens","screens ,",", each","each with","with a","a single","single shot","shot on","on it","it ,",", lasting","lasting 50","50 minutes","minutes ;","; the","the interaction","interaction between","between the","the 3","3 images","images is","is force","force which","which compels","compels interest","Following this","this sequence","sequence are","are a","a number","number of","of other","other much","much quicker","quicker shots","shots ,",", often","often enigmatic","The conclusion","conclusion is","is abrupt","I have","have no","no idea","idea what","what it","it means","means ,",", only","only that","that it","it poetically","poetically probes","probes the","the meaning","meaning of","of life","life ,",", and","and offers","offers no","no conclusions","It is","is meant","meant ,",", on","on many","many levels","levels ,",", to","to disturb","disturb the","the viewer"]}

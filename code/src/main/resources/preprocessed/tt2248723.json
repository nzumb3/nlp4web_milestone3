{"title":"Like Stone Lions at the Gateway into Night","plot":"Between 1947 and 1950, more than 80 000 Greek citizens were imprisoned on the isle of Makronisos (Greece) in reeducation camps created to 'fight the spread of communism'. Among these exiles were a number of writers and poets, including Yannis Ritsos and Tassos Livaditis. Despite the deprivation and torture, these prisoners succeeded in composing poems, which describe their struggle for survival in this world of internment. These texts, some of them buried in the camps, were later found. «Like Lions of stone at the gateway of night» blends these poetic writings with the reeducation propaganda constantly piped through the camps' loudspeakers. Long tracking shots take us on a trance-like journey through the camp ruins, interrupted along the way by segments from photographic archives. A cinematic essay, which revives the memory of forgotten ruins and a battle lost.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Between","1947","and","1950",",","more","than","80","000","Greek","citizen","were","imprison","on","the","isl","of","Makroniso","(","Greec",")","in","reeduc","camp","creat","to","'","fight","the","spread","of","communism","'",".","Among","these","exil","were","a","number","of","writer","and","poet",",","includ","Yanni","Ritso","and","Tasso","Livad",".","Despit","the","depriv","and","tortur",",","these","prison","succeed","in","compos","poem",",","which","describ","their","struggl","for","surviv","in","this","world","of","intern",".","These","text",",","some","of","them","buri","in","the","camp",",","were","later","found",".","«","Like","Lion","of","stone","at","the","gateway","of","night","»","blend","these","poetic","write","with","the","reeduc","propaganda","constant","pipe","through","the","camp","'","loudspeak",".","Long","track","shot","take","us","on","a","trance-lik","journey","through","the","camp","ruin",",","interrupt","along","the","way","by","segment","from","photograph","archiv",".","A","cinemat","essay",",","which","reviv","the","memori","of","forgotten","ruin","and","a","battl","lost","."],"lemmas":["between","1947","and","1950",",","more","than","80","000","greek","citizen","be","imprison","on","the","isle","of","Makronisos","-lrb-","Greece","-rrb-","in","reeducation","camp","create","to","'","fight","the","spread","of","communism","'",".","among","these","exile","be","a","number","of","writer","and","poet",",","include","Yannis","Ritsos","and","Tassos","Livaditis",".","despite","the","deprivation","and","torture",",","these","prisoner","succeed","in","compose","poem",",","which","describe","they","struggle","for","survival","in","this","world","of","internment",".","these","text",",","some","of","they","bury","in","the","camp",",","be","later","find",".","«","like","lion","of","stone","at","the","gateway","of","night","»","blend","these","poetic","writings","with","the","reeducation","propaganda","constantly","pipe","through","the","camp","'","loudspeaker",".","long","tracking","shot","take","we","on","a","trance-like","journey","through","the","camp","ruin",",","interrupt","along","the","way","by","segment","from","photographic","archive",".","a","cinematic","essay",",","which","revive","the","memory","of","forget","ruin","and","a","battle","lose","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Between

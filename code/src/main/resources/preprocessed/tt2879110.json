{"title":"Adik manja Returns","plot":"\"Adik Manja Returns\" is the long-awaited sequel to the successful \"Adik Manja\" directed by Othman Hafsham. The story still revolves around the misbehaviour of the female students in a private institution, which has now been taken over by the daughter of the previous headmaster, Pengetua Sofia (Rozita). However, Sofia is unable to control the discipline problems that plague the institution, so she resorts to seeking Azmi (Dharma Harun Al Rashid), something that her late mother advised her to do should she face those problems. Apparently, two rival dance groups known as Shuffle and Hip Hop, which are led by queen bees Bib and Su, respectively, are stirring up trouble among the other students.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["\"","Adik","Manja","Return","\"","is","the","long-await","sequel","to","the","success","\"","Adik","Manja","\"","direct","by","Othman","Hafsham",".","The","stori","still","revolv","around","the","misbehaviour","of","the","femal","student","in","a","privat","institut",",","which","has","now","been","taken","over","by","the","daughter","of","the","previous","headmast",",","Pengetua","Sofia","(","Rozita",")",".","Howev",",","Sofia","is","unabl","to","control","the","disciplin","problem","that","plagu","the","institut",",","so","she","resort","to","seek","Azmi","(","Dharma","Harun","Al","Rashid",")",",","someth","that","her","late","mother","advis","her","to","do","should","she","face","those","problem",".","Apparent",",","two","rival","danc","group","known","as","Shuffl","and","Hip","Hop",",","which","are","led","by","queen","bee","Bib","and","Su",",","respect",",","are","stir","up","troubl","among","the","other","student","."],"lemmas":["``","Adik","Manja","Returns","''","be","the","long-awaited","sequel","to","the","successful","``","Adik","Manja","''","direct","by","Othman","Hafsham",".","the","story","still","revolve","around","the","misbehaviour","of","the","female","student","in","a","private","institution",",","which","have","now","be","take","over","by","the","daughter","of","the","previous","headmaster",",","Pengetua","Sofia","-lrb-","Rozita","-rrb-",".","however",",","Sofia","be","unable","to","control","the","discipline","problem","that","plague","the","institution",",","so","she","resort","to","seek","Azmi","-lrb-","Dharma","Harun","Al","Rashid","-rrb-",",","something","that","she","late","mother","advise","she","to","do","should","she","face","those","problem",".","apparently",",","two","rival","dance","group","know","as","shuffle","and","hip","hop",",","which","be","lead","by","queen","bee","Bib","and","Su",",","respectively",",","be","stir","up","trouble","among","the","other","student","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\"

{"title":"Mirror of Happiness","plot":"This is a story about love and economics situated in Istanbul. Two anti-heroes run away to Istanbul from Paris. They are momentarily embraced by the Turkish fashion scene. Then hunted down by unknown assassins. Then seek a new kind of paradise by the sea. However their paradise is polluted. Or perhaps everything is a fiction of their imagination, and they never leave their hotels. Ghosts as doubles of the two main characters are featured. Dancers create allegorical scenarios that relate to the narrative of the film. In the beginning it appears to be loosely based on the Jean-Luc Godard film, 'Pierrot Le Fou.' But other stories are quickly woven into the plot.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","is","a","stori","about","love","and","econom","situat","in","Istanbul",".","Two","anti-hero","run","away","to","Istanbul","from","Pari",".","They","are","momentarili","embrac","by","the","Turkish","fashion","scene",".","Then","hunt","down","by","unknown","assassin",".","Then","seek","a","new","kind","of","paradis","by","the","sea",".","Howev","their","paradis","is","pollut",".","Or","perhap","everyth","is","a","fiction","of","their","imagin",",","and","they","never","leav","their","hotel",".","Ghost","as","doubl","of","the","two","main","charact","are","featur",".","Dancer","creat","allegor","scenario","that","relat","to","the","narrat","of","the","film",".","In","the","begin","it","appear","to","be","loos","base","on","the","Jean-Luc","Godard","film",",","'","Pierrot","Le","Fou",".","'","But","other","stori","are","quick","woven","into","the","plot","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","story","about","love","and","economics","situate","in","Istanbul",".","two","anti-hero","run","away","to","Istanbul","from","Paris",".","they","be","momentarily","embrace","by","the","turkish","fashion","scene",".","then","hunt","down","by","unknown","assassin",".","then","seek","a","new","kind","of","paradise","by","the","sea",".","however","they","paradise","be","polluted",".","or","perhaps","everything","be","a","fiction","of","they","imagination",",","and","they","never","leave","they","hotel",".","ghost","as","double","of","the","two","main","character","be","feature",".","dancer","create","allegorical","scenario","that","relate","to","the","narrative","of","the","film",".","in","the","beginning","it","appear","to","be","loosely","base","on","the","Jean-Luc","Godard","film",",","'","Pierrot","Le","Fou",".","'","but","other","story","be","quickly","weave","into","the","plot","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is a","is a story","a story about","story about love","about love and","love and economics","and economics situated","economics situated in","situated in Istanbul","Two anti-heroes run","anti-heroes run away","run away to","away to Istanbul","to Istanbul from","Istanbul from Paris","They are momentarily","are momentarily embraced","momentarily embraced by","embraced by the","by the Turkish","the Turkish fashion","Turkish fashion scene","Then hunted down","hunted down by","down by unknown","by unknown assassins","Then seek a","seek a new","a new kind","new kind of","kind of paradise","of paradise by","paradise by the","by the sea","However their paradise","their paradise is","paradise is polluted","Or perhaps everything","perhaps everything is","everything is a","is a fiction","a fiction of","fiction of their","of their imagination","their imagination ,","imagination , and",", and they","and they never","they never leave","never leave their","leave their hotels","Ghosts as doubles","as doubles of","doubles of the","of the two","the two main","two main characters","main characters are","characters are featured","Dancers create allegorical","create allegorical scenarios","allegorical scenarios that","scenarios that relate","that relate to","relate to the","to the narrative","the narrative of","narrative of the","of the film","In the beginning","the beginning it","beginning it appears","it appears to","appears to be","to be loosely","be loosely based","loosely based on","based on the","on the Jean-Luc","the Jean-Luc Godard","Jean-Luc Godard film","Godard film ,","film , '",", ' Pierrot","' Pierrot Le","Pierrot Le Fou","Le Fou .","Fou .

{"title":"The Lessons of Hayti","plot":"The ''Lessons of Hayti'' is a one-hour documentary which examines the unique history of Black self-sufficiency and political power in the United States from its origins just following President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1863 up to the second inauguration of America's first Black President 150 years later in 2013, as well as how that power has eroded since the Civil Rights era, leaving Black America in its current state of economic turmoil.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["The","''","Lesson","of","Hayti","''","is","a","one-hour","documentari","which","examin","the","uniqu","histori","of","Black","self-suffici","and","polit","power","in","the","Unite","State","from","it","origin","just","follow","Presid","Lincoln","'s","Emancip","Proclam","of","1863","up","to","the","second","inaugur","of","America","'s","first","Black","Presid","150","year","later","in","2013",",","as","well","as","how","that","power","has","erod","sinc","the","Civil","Right","era",",","leav","Black","America","in","it","current","state","of","econom","turmoil","."],"lemmas":["the","''","lesson","of","Hayti","''","be","a","one-hour","documentary","which","examine","the","unique","history","of","black","self-sufficiency","and","political","power","in","the","United","States","from","its","origin","just","follow","President","Lincoln","'s","Emancipation","Proclamation","of","1863","up","to","the","second","inauguration","of","America","'s","first","Black","President","150","year","later","in","2013",",","as","well","as","how","that","power","have","erode","since","the","Civil","Rights","era",",","leave","Black","America","in","its","current","state","of","economic","turmoil","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The '' Lessons","'' Lessons of","Lessons of Hayti","of Hayti ''","Hayti '' is","'' is a","is a one-hour","a one-hour documentary","one-hour documentary which","documentary which examines","which examines the","examines the unique","the unique history","unique history of","history of Black","of Black self-sufficiency","Black self-sufficiency and","self-sufficiency and political","and political power","political power in","power in the","in the United","the United States","United States from","States from its","from its origins","its origins just","origins just following","just following President","following President Lincoln","President Lincoln 's","Lincoln 's Emancipation","'s Emancipation Proclamation","Emancipation Proclamation of","Proclamation of 1863","of 1863 up","1863 up to","up to the","to the second","the second inauguration","second inauguration of","inauguration of America","of America 's","America 's first","'s first Black","first Black President","Black President 150","President 150 years","150 years later","years later in","later in 2013","in 2013 ,","2013 , as",", as well","as well as","well as how","as how that","how that power","that power has","power has eroded","has eroded since","eroded since the","since the Civil","the Civil Rights","Civil Rights era","Rights era ,","era , leaving",", leaving Black","leaving Black America","Black America in","America in its","in its current","its current state","current state of","state of economic","of economic turmoil"],"2grams":["The ''","'' Lessons","Lessons of","of Hayti","Hayti ''","'' is","is a","a one-hour","one-hour documentary","documentary which","which examines","examines the","the unique","unique history","history of","of Black","Black self-sufficiency","self-sufficiency and","and political","political power","power in","in the","the United","United States","States from","from its","its origins","origins just","just following","following President","President Lincoln","Lincoln 's","'s Emancipation","Emancipation Proclamation","Proclamation of","of 1863","1863 up","up to","to the","the second","second inauguration","inauguration of","of America","America 's","'s first","first Black","Black President","President 150","150 years","years later","later in","in 2013","2013 ,",", as","as well","well as","as how","how that","that power","power has","has eroded","eroded since","since the","the Civil","Civil Rights","Rights era","era ,",", leaving","leaving Black","Black America","America in","in its","its current","current state","state of","of economic","economic turmoil"]}

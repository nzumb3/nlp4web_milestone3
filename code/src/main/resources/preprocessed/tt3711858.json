{"title":"Cartas para Angola","plot":"Brazil and Angola while on either side of the Atlantic Ocean have the same language, a common colonial past and many shared stories. In this film, correspondence is exchanged between these two places - some people are longtime friends, others have never met. Their stories intertwine and tell about migration, nostalgia, belonging, war, prejudice, exile and distance. The search for identity and flow of memory are driven by the line of affection that binds the seven pairs of speakers presented in this documentary, people whose life stories are traced between Brazil, Angola and Portugal.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Brazil","and","Angola","while","on","either","side","of","the","Atlantic","Ocean","have","the","same","languag",",","a","common","coloni","past","and","mani","share","stori",".","In","this","film",",","correspond","is","exchang","between","these","two","place","-","some","peopl","are","longtim","friend",",","other","have","never","met",".","Their","stori","intertwin","and","tell","about","migrat",",","nostalgia",",","belong",",","war",",","prejudic",",","exil","and","distanc",".","The","search","for","ident","and","flow","of","memori","are","driven","by","the","line","of","affect","that","bind","the","seven","pair","of","speaker","present","in","this","documentari",",","peopl","whose","life","stori","are","trace","between","Brazil",",","Angola","and","Portug","."],"lemmas":["Brazil","and","Angola","while","on","either","side","of","the","Atlantic","Ocean","have","the","same","language",",","a","common","colonial","past","and","many","shared","story",".","in","this","film",",","correspondence","be","exchange","between","these","two","place","-","some","people","be","longtime","friend",",","other","have","never","meet",".","they","story","intertwine","and","tell","about","migration",",","nostalgia",",","belong",",","war",",","prejudice",",","exile","and","distance",".","the","search","for","identity","and","flow","of","memory","be","drive","by","the","line","of","affection","that","bind","the","seven","pair","of","speaker","present","in","this","documentary",",","people","whose","life","story","be","trace","between","Brazil",",","Angola","and","Portugal","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Brazil and Angola","and Angola while","Angola while on","while on either","on either side","either side of","side of the","of the Atlantic","the Atlantic Ocean","Atlantic Ocean have","Ocean have the","have the same","the same language","same language ,","language , a",", a common","a common colonial","common colonial past","colonial past and","past and many","and many shared","many shared stories","In this film","this film ,","film , correspondence",", correspondence is","correspondence is exchanged","is exchanged between","exchanged between these","between these two","these two places","two places -","places -

{"title":"American Animal","plot":"Jimmy is a terminally ill young man. But from today on, he has decided that he is 'happy', and that he is no longer sick. Jimmy's roommate James is a healthy, dreamy young man. They're best friends. They live together. They don't do much of anything, and seem very happy that way. But trouble arises when James announces that he will be leaving for his new job in the morning. Jimmy sees this as the destruction of the perfect little world that they've set up, and what ensues is a humorous battle of wills as James heads towards the real world and Jimmy falls deeper and deeper into his isolated world of illness and make-believe.","genres":["Comedy","

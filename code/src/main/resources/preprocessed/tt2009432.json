{"title":"Redemption Trail","plot":"Two powerful, yet deeply troubled women - refugees from political and personal trauma - flee a past that haunts them. The daughter of a murdered Black Panther revolutionary, Tess, lives off the grid on a Sonoma vineyard, fiercely detached from all connections. Her hermetic life cracks when she gives reluctant shelter to a desperate young woman, Anna who has attempted suicide in a nearby forest. An unlikely alliance forms between the two, where other close relationships have failed - David, Anna's husband and John, Tess' employer, cannot break through their walls. But the very difference between the two women opens them up to a new vision of themselves, as not only survivors, but as heroes capable even of a thrilling shoot-out in the name of outlaw justice. Reclaiming freedom, and life, they plunge forward, towards an unknown, transformative horizon.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Two","power",",","yet","deepli","troubl","women","-","refuge","from","polit","and","person","trauma","-","flee","a","past","that","haunt","them",".","The","daughter","of","a","murder","Black","Panther","revolutionari",",","Tess",",","live","off","the","grid","on","a","Sonoma","vineyard",",","fierc","detach","from","all","connect",".","Her","hermet","life","crack","when","she","give","reluct","shelter","to","a","desper","young","woman",",","Anna","who","has","attempt","suicid","in","a","nearbi","forest",".","An","unlik","allianc","form","between","the","two",",","where","other","close","relationship","have","fail","-","David",",","Anna","'s","husband","and","John",",","Tess","'","employ",",","can","not","break","through","their","wall",".","But","the","veri","differ","between","the","two","women","open","them","up","to","a","new","vision","of","themselv",",","as","not","onli","survivor",",","but","as","hero","capabl","even","of","a","thrill","shoot-out","in","the","name","of","outlaw","justic",".","Reclaim","freedom",",","and","life",",","they","plung","forward",",","toward","an","unknown",",","transform","horizon","."],"lemmas":["two","powerful",",","yet","deeply","troubled","woman","-","refugee","from","political","and","personal","trauma","-","flee","a","past","that","haunt","they",".","the","daughter","of","a","murder","black","panther","revolutionary",",","Tess",",","live","off","the","grid","on","a","Sonoma","vineyard",",","fiercely","detach","from","all","connection",".","she","hermetic","life","crack","when","she","give","reluctant","shelter","to","a","desperate","young","woman",",","Anna","who","have","attempt","suicide","in","a","nearby","forest",".","a","unlikely","alliance","form","between","the","two",",","where","other","close","relationship","have","fail","-","David",",","Anna","'s","husband","and","John",",","Tess","'","employer",",","can","not","break","through","they","wall",".","but","the","very","difference","between","the","two","woman","open","they","up","to","a","new","vision","of","themselves",",","as","not","only","survivor",",","but","as","hero","capable","even","of","a","thrilling","shoot-out","in","the","name","of","outlaw","justice",".","reclaim","freedom",",","and","life",",","they","plunge","forward",",","towards","a","unknown",",","transformative","horizon","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two powerful ,","powerful , yet",", yet deeply","yet deeply troubled","deeply troubled women","troubled women -","women -

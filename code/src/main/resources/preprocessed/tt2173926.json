{"title":"Meu Caro Amigo Chico","plot":"\"My Dear Friend Chico\" is a feature music-documentary by Joana Barra Vaz that bridges Portugal and Brasil, its history, music and fights for freedom and the future. This project started when researching the connecting points between the music of Chico Buarque and Portugal. Straight away the song \"Tanto Mar\" (which Chico Buarque originally wrote just after the 25th April 1974, Carnation Revolution, to then rewrite it in 1978) and the diference between the two version stood out. During the production of this film we were driven to portray and reflect in the lives and stories of Portuguese musicians and the search for the \"forgotten seed in the corner of the garden\" as mentioned in 1978 version of Tanto Mar. An intimate and very well contextualized portait of music and musicians, freedom, generations and forgotten dreams.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","My","Dear","Friend","Chico","\"","is","a","featur","music-documentari","by","Joana","Barra","Vaz","that","bridg","Portug","and","Brasil",",","it","histori",",","music","and","fight","for","freedom","and","the","futur",".","This","project","start","when","research","the","connect","point","between","the","music","of","Chico","Buarqu","and","Portug",".","Straight","away","the","song","\"","Tanto","Mar","\"","(","which","Chico","Buarqu","origin","wrote","just","after","the","25th","April","1974",",","Carnat","Revolut",",","to","then","rewrit","it","in","1978",")","and","the","difer","between","the","two","version","stood","out",".","Dure","the","product","of","this","film","we","were","driven","to","portray","and","reflect","in","the","live","and","stori","of","Portugues","musician","and","the","search","for","the","\"","forgotten","seed","in","the","corner","of","the","garden","\"","as","mention","in","1978","version","of","Tanto","Mar",".","An","intim","and","veri","well","contextu","portait","of","music","and","musician",",","freedom",",","generat","and","forgotten","dream","."],"lemmas":["``","my","Dear","friend","Chico","''","be","a","feature","music-documentary","by","Joana","Barra","Vaz","that","bridge","Portugal","and","Brasil",",","its","history",",","music","and","fight","for","freedom","and","the","future",".","this","project","start","when","research","the","connect","point","between","the","music","of","Chico","Buarque","and","Portugal",".","Straight","away","the","song","``","Tanto","Mar","''","-lrb-","which","Chico","Buarque","originally","write","just","after","the","25th","April","1974",",","Carnation","Revolution",",","to","then","rewrite","it","in","1978","-rrb-","and","the","diference","between","the","two","version","stand","out",".","during","the","production","of","this","film","we","be","drive","to","portray","and","reflect","in","the","life","and","story","of","portuguese","musician","and","the","search","for","the","``","forget","seed","in","the","corner","of","the","garden","''","as","mention","in","1978","version","of","Tanto","Mar",".","a","intimate","and","very","well","contextualize","portait","of","music","and","musician",",","freedom",",","generation","and","forget","dream","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["\"

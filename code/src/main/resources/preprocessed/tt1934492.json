{"title":"Zoo Zappers -Too Hot -The Movie (from Disco to Disco)","plot":"In a dystopian future where tabloid journalism and state-sponsored designer drugs control their minds, the protagonists of Zoo Zappers meander through a cultish and corporate media-controlled Berlin in a drug and celebrity culture-induced haze. This feature film splices Natz Spetsman aka Purio's video work from 2007-2010 in a fashion reminiscent of Alexander Kluge, while incorporating various sub- genres such as music journalism and the making-of of a pop culture movie that was never made. The result is an indictment of the Mass Media by the means of a playful postmodern Brechtian narrative.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["In","a","dystopian","futur","where","tabloid","journal","and","state-sponsor","design","drug","control","their","mind",",","the","protagonist","of","Zoo","Zapper","meander","through","a","cultish","and","corpor","media-control","Berlin","in","a","drug","and","celebr","culture-induc","haze",".","This","featur","film","splice","Natz","Spetsman","aka","Purio","'s","video","work","from","2007-2010","in","a","fashion","reminisc","of","Alexand","Kluge",",","while","incorpor","various","sub","-","genr","such","as","music","journal","and","the","making-of","of","a","pop","cultur","movi","that","was","never","made",".","The","result","is","an","indict","of","the","Mass","Media","by","the","mean","of","a","play","postmodern","Brechtian","narrat","."],"lemmas":["in","a","dystopian","future","where","tabloid","journalism","and","state-sponsored","designer","drug","control","they","mind",",","the","protagonist","of","zoo","zapper","meander","through","a","cultish","and","corporate","media-controlled","Berlin","in","a","drug","and","celebrity","culture-induced","haze",".","this","feature","film","splice","Natz","Spetsman","aka","Purio","'s","video","work","from","2007-2010","in","a","fashion","reminiscent","of","Alexander","Kluge",",","while","incorporate","various","sub","-","genre","such","as","music","journalism","and","the","making-of","of","a","pop","culture","movie","that","be","never","make",".","the","result","be","a","indictment","of","the","Mass","Media","by","the","means","of","a","playful","postmodern","brechtian","narrative","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In a dystopian","a dystopian future","dystopian future where","future where tabloid","where tabloid journalism","tabloid journalism and","journalism and state-sponsored","and state-sponsored designer","state-sponsored designer drugs","designer drugs control","drugs control their","control their minds","their minds ,","minds , the",", the protagonists","the protagonists of","protagonists of Zoo","of Zoo Zappers","Zoo Zappers meander","Zappers meander through","meander through a","through a cultish","a cultish and","cultish and corporate","and corporate media-controlled","corporate media-controlled Berlin","media-controlled Berlin in","Berlin in a","in a drug","a drug and","drug and celebrity","and celebrity culture-induced","celebrity culture-induced haze","This feature film","feature film splices","film splices Natz","splices Natz Spetsman","Natz Spetsman aka","Spetsman aka Purio","aka Purio 's","Purio 's video","'s video work","video work from","work from 2007-2010","from 2007-2010 in","2007-2010 in a","in a fashion","a fashion reminiscent","fashion reminiscent of","reminiscent of Alexander","of Alexander Kluge","Alexander Kluge ,","Kluge , while",", while incorporating","while incorporating various","incorporating various sub","various sub -","sub -

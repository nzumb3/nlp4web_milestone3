{"title":"Tale of the Mummy","plot":"Centuries ago, under the sands of ancient Egypt, a prince was buried and his tomb eternally curses so that no man would ever again suffer from his evil ways. But hundreds of years later on a greedy search for treasure, a group of archaeologists break the curses seal of the tomb. Every man vanishes without a trace, leaving behind only a log book - and a deadly warning of the legend of the bloodthursty TALOS. Fifty years later the log book ends up in the hands of the granddaughter of the head archaeologist, and she defiantly sets out to retrace his steps. Discovering the forbidden treasure, she recovers a sacred amulet and once again unleashes the savage power of the tomb. Racing through the streets of London, and against the force of a rare interplanetary lineup, she, along with the help of her original dig team and an American detective, desperately try to turn back the inhuman curse and to keep Talos from destroying all in his path in an attempt to gain immortal power.","genres":["Adventure"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Centuri","ago",",","under","the","sand","of","ancient","Egypt",",","a","princ","was","buri","and","his","tomb","etern","curs","so","that","no","man","would","ever","again","suffer","from","his","evil","way",".","But","hundr","of","year","later","on","a","greedi","search","for","treasur",",","a","group","of","archaeologist","break","the","curs","seal","of","the","tomb",".","Everi","man","vanish","without","a","trace",",","leav","behind","onli","a","log","book","-","and","a","dead","warn","of","the","legend","of","the","bloodthursti","TALOS",".","Fifti","year","later","the","log","book","end","up","in","the","hand","of","the","granddaught","of","the","head","archaeologist",",","and","she","defiant","set","out","to","retrac","his","step",".","Discov","the","forbidden","treasur",",","she","recov","a","sacr","amulet","and","onc","again","unleash","the","savag","power","of","the","tomb",".","Race","through","the","street","of","London",",","and","against","the","forc","of","a","rare","interplanetari","lineup",",","she",",","along","with","the","help","of","her","origin","dig","team","and","an","American","detect",",","desper","tri","to","turn","back","the","inhuman","curs","and","to","keep","Talo","from","destroy","all","in","his","path","in","an","attempt","to","gain","immort","power","."],"lemmas":["century","ago",",","under","the","sand","of","ancient","Egypt",",","a","prince","be","bury","and","he","tomb","eternally","curse","so","that","no","man","would","ever","again","suffer","from","he","evil","way",".","but","hundred","of","year","later","on","a","greedy","search","for","treasure",",","a","group","of","archaeologist","break","the","curse","seal","of","the","tomb",".","every","man","vanish","without","a","trace",",","leave","behind","only","a","log","book","-","and","a","deadly","warning","of","the","legend","of","the","bloodthursty","talos",".","fifty","year","later","the","log","book","end","up","in","the","hand","of","the","granddaughter","of","the","head","archaeologist",",","and","she","defiantly","set","out","to","retrace","he","step",".","discover","the","forbid","treasure",",","she","recover","a","sacred","amulet","and","once","again","unleash","the","savage","power","of","the","tomb",".","race","through","the","street","of","London",",","and","against","the","force","of","a","rare","interplanetary","lineup",",","she",",","along","with","the","help","of","she","original","dig","team","and","a","american","detective",",","desperately","try","to","turn","back","the","inhuman","curse","and","to","keep","Talos","from","destroy","all","in","he","path","in","a","attempt","to","gain","immortal","power","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Centuries ago ,","ago , under",", under the","under the sands","the sands of","sands of ancient","of ancient Egypt","ancient Egypt ,","Egypt , a",", a prince","a prince was","prince was buried","was buried and","buried and his","and his tomb","his tomb eternally","tomb eternally curses","eternally curses so","curses so that","so that no","that no man","no man would","man would ever","would ever again","ever again suffer","again suffer from","suffer from his","from his evil","his evil ways","But hundreds of","hundreds of years","of years later","years later on","later on a","on a greedy","a greedy search","greedy search for","search for treasure","for treasure ,","treasure , a",", a group","a group of","group of archaeologists","of archaeologists break","archaeologists break the","break the curses","the curses seal","curses seal of","seal of the","of the tomb","Every man vanishes","man vanishes without","vanishes without a","without a trace","a trace ,","trace , leaving",", leaving behind","leaving behind only","behind only a","only a log","a log book","log book -","book -

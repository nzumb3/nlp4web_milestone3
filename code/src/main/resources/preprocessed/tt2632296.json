{"title":"The Medicine Game","plot":"Tucked away in central New York State is the Onondaga Nation, a sovereign Native American community known to produce some of the top lacrosse players in the world. Yet, the fear of leaving their community, substance abuse, and poverty have kept far too many of these players from venturing off the 'rez' and into the collegiate or professional ranks. A film six years in the making, The Medicine Game shares the remarkable journey of two brothers from the Onondaga Nation driven by a single goal; to beat the odds and play lacrosse for national powerhouse Syracuse University. The obstacles in their way are frequent and daunting, but the brothers love for the game and their family's unyielding determination, propels these boys towards their dream.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Tuck","away","in","central","New","York","State","is","the","Onondaga","Nation",",","a","sovereign","Nativ","American","communiti","known","to","produc","some","of","the","top","lacross","player","in","the","world",".","Yet",",","the","fear","of","leav","their","communiti",",","substanc","abus",",","and","poverti","have","kept","far","too","mani","of","these","player","from","ventur","off","the","'","rez","'","and","into","the","collegi","or","profession","rank",".","A","film","six","year","in","the","make",",","The","Medicin","Game","share","the","remark","journey","of","two","brother","from","the","Onondaga","Nation","driven","by","a","singl","goal",";","to","beat","the","odd","and","play","lacross","for","nation","powerhous","Syracus","Univers",".","The","obstacl","in","their","way","are","frequent","and","daunt",",","but","the","brother","love","for","the","game","and","their","famili","'s","unyield","determin",",","propel","these","boy","toward","their","dream","."],"lemmas":["tuck","away","in","central","New","York","State","be","the","Onondaga","Nation",",","a","sovereign","native","american","community","know","to","produce","some","of","the","top","lacrosse","player","in","the","world",".","yet",",","the","fear","of","leave","they","community",",","substance","abuse",",","and","poverty","have","keep","far","too","many","of","these","player","from","venture","off","the","'","rez","'","and","into","the","collegiate","or","professional","rank",".","a","film","six","year","in","the","making",",","the","Medicine","Game","share","the","remarkable","journey","of","two","brother","from","the","Onondaga","nation","drive","by","a","single","goal",";","to","beat","the","odds","and","play","lacrosse","for","national","powerhouse","Syracuse","University",".","the","obstacle","in","they","way","be","frequent","and","daunting",",","but","the","brother","love","for","the","game","and","they","family","'s","unyielding","determination",",","propel","these","boy","towards","they","dream","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Tucked away in","away in central","in central New","central New York","New York State","York State is","State is the","is the Onondaga","the Onondaga Nation","Onondaga Nation ,","Nation , a",", a sovereign","a sovereign Native","sovereign Native American","Native American community","American community known","community known to","known to produce","to produce some","produce some of","some of the","of the top","the top lacrosse","top lacrosse players","lacrosse players in","players in the","in the world","Yet , the",", the fear","the fear of","fear of leaving","of leaving their","leaving their community","their community ,","community , substance",", substance abuse","substance abuse ,","abuse , and",", and poverty","and poverty have","poverty have kept","have kept far","kept far too","far too many","too many of","many of these","of these players","these players from","players from venturing","from venturing off","venturing off the","off the '","the ' rez","' rez '","rez ' and","' and into","and into the","into the collegiate","the collegiate or","collegiate or professional","or professional ranks","A film six","film six years","six years in","years in the","in the making","the making ,","making , The",", The Medicine","The Medicine Game","Medicine Game shares","Game shares the","shares the remarkable","the remarkable journey","remarkable journey of","journey of two","of two brothers","two brothers from","brothers from the","from the Onondaga","the Onondaga Nation","Onondaga Nation driven","Nation driven by","driven by a","by a single","a single goal","single goal ;","goal ;

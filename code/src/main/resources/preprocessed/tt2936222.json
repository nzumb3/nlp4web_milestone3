{"title":"Never Die Young","plot":"Guido Peter was born in Pétange on the 7th December 1959. At the age of 12, he is sent to a boarding school in Arlon. Having wasted three years of his life, he returns back to his native town. But things aren't the same anymore, Guido matured and starts behaving differently. Having lost all his faith in authority, he soon turns to drugs as means of coping. Trying to keep up with his habit, he starts selling heroine and living as a junkie. Yet, it won't be long until life as he knows it comes to a stop. Tetraplegic and bound to a wheelchair, will he manage to leave his 'greatest love' and kick the habit? Or is the urge stronger?","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"Life Span of the Object in Frame","plot":"... It all started with a sudden feeling that something has permanently changed around us and in our life in the past 15 or 20 years. We have never noticed how the changes were taking place within our presence. As if we never have existed and there have never been all those years. The time of exposure is the life span of an object in frame. In this regard, any photo is not just two-dimensional graphic composition - it always has the third, temporal dimension, the temporal depth. A photo is a time carrier, a time vessel. It means - a vessel of memory... But whose memory?.. Of the Face or the Thing or the Landscape which are still on the photo?.. Of the Photographer?.. Having chosen photos as material of the film and memory as the theme, we inevitably find ourselves in a labyrinth of our own and the others' memories, of our own and the others' time being. And seeking for the escape we are becoming a part of this labyrinth and the material of the own film. This is a film about relationships that have developed between the Author and the Raw Material at the heart of his Creative Work to a point when the Material itself becomes the main character and the Author is compelled to become a part of the Material to keep a possibility of interacting with It on an equal footing.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["...","It","all","start","with","a","sudden","feel","that","someth","has","perman","chang","around","us","and","in","our","life","in","the","past","15","or","20","year",".","We","have","never","notic","how","the","chang","were","take","place","within","our","presenc",".","As","if","we","never","have","exist","and","there","have","never","been","all","those","year",".","The","time","of","exposur","is","the","life","span","of","an","object","in","frame",".","In","this","regard",",","ani","photo","is","not","just","two-dimension","graphic","composit","-","it","alway","has","the","third",",","tempor","dimens",",","the","tempor","depth",".","A","photo","is","a","time","carrier",",","a","time","vessel",".","It","mean","-","a","vessel","of","memori","...","But","whose","memori","?",".",".","Of","the","Face","or","the","Thing","or","the","Landscap","which","are","still","on","the","photo","?",".",".","Of","the","Photograph","?",".",".","Have","chosen","photo","as","materi","of","the","film","and","memori","as","the","theme",",","we","inevit","find","ourselv","in","a","labyrinth","of","our","own","and","the","other","'","memori",",","of","our","own","and","the","other","'","time","be",".","And","seek","for","the","escap","we","are","becom","a","part","of","this","labyrinth","and","the","materi","of","the","own","film",".","This","is","a","film","about","relationship","that","have","develop","between","the","Author","and","the","Raw","Materi","at","the","heart","of","his","Creativ","Work","to","a","point","when","the","Materi","itself","becom","the","main","charact","and","the","Author","is","compel","to","becom","a","part","of","the","Materi","to","keep","a","possibl","of","interact","with","It","on","an","equal","foot","."],"lemmas":["...","it","all","start","with","a","sudden","feeling","that","something","have","permanently","change","around","we","and","in","we","life","in","the","past","15","or","20","year",".","we","have","never","notice","how","the","change","be","take","place","within","we","presence",".","as","if","we","never","have","exist","and","there","have","never","be","all","those","year",".","the","time","of","exposure","be","the","life","span","of","a","object","in","frame",".","in","this","regard",",","any","photo","be","not","just","two-dimensional","graphic","composition","-","it","always","have","the","third",",","temporal","dimension",",","the","temporal","depth",".","a","photo","be","a","time","carrier",",","a","time","vessel",".","it","mean","-","a","vessel","of","memory","...","but","whose","memory","?",".",".","of","the","Face","or","the","thing","or","the","Landscape","which","be","still","on","the","photo","?",".",".","of","the","Photographer","?",".",".","have","choose","photo","as","material","of","the","film","and","memory","as","the","theme",",","we","inevitably","find","ourselves","in","a","labyrinth","of","we","own","and","the","other","'","memory",",","of","we","own","and","the","other","'","time","be",".","and","seek","for","the","escape","we","be","become","a","part","of","this","labyrinth","and","the","material","of","the","own","film",".","this","be","a","film","about","relationship","that","have","develop","between","the","author","and","the","raw","material","at","the","heart","of","he","Creative","Work","to","a","point","when","the","Material","itself","become","the","main","character","and","the","author","be","compel","to","become","a","part","of","the","Material","to","keep","a","possibility","of","interact","with","it","on","a","equal","footing","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["...

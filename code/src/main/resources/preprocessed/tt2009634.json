{"title":"Working Hands, Awakening Minds","plot":"The Earth Sangha is a community of activists, students of environmental issues, practitioners of meditation, and other people interested in creating environmentally sustainable ways of life. Members believe that there is a close connection between their own well- being and the health of the lives and land around them. Members recognize that all life is profoundly interdependent and express this understanding by building healthier relationships between people and the lands they inhabit. This film takes a closer look at their conservation activities throughout the Washington DC metro area as well as abroad.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Earth","Sangha","is","a","communiti","of","activist",",","student","of","environment","issu",",","practition","of","medit",",","and","other","peopl","interest","in","creat","environment","sustain","way","of","life",".","Member","believ","that","there","is","a","close","connect","between","their","own","well","-","be","and","the","health","of","the","live","and","land","around","them",".","Member","recogn","that","all","life","is","profound","interdepend","and","express","this","understand","by","build","healthier","relationship","between","peopl","and","the","land","they","inhabit",".","This","film","take","a","closer","look","at","their","conserv","activ","throughout","the","Washington","DC","metro","area","as","well","as","abroad","."],"lemmas":["the","Earth","Sangha","be","a","community","of","activist",",","student","of","environmental","issue",",","practitioner","of","meditation",",","and","other","people","interested","in","create","environmentally","sustainable","way","of","life",".","member","believe","that","there","be","a","close","connection","between","they","own","well","-","be","and","the","health","of","the","life","and","land","around","they",".","member","recognize","that","all","life","be","profoundly","interdependent","and","express","this","understanding","by","build","healthier","relationship","between","people","and","the","land","they","inhabit",".","this","film","take","a","closer","look","at","they","conservation","activity","throughout","the","Washington","dc","metro","area","as","well","as","abroad","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Earth Sangha","Earth Sangha is","Sangha is a","is a community","a community of","community of activists","of activists ,","activists , students",", students of","students of environmental","of environmental issues","environmental issues ,","issues , practitioners",", practitioners of","practitioners of meditation","of meditation ,","meditation , and",", and other","and other people","other people interested","people interested in","interested in creating","in creating environmentally","creating environmentally sustainable","environmentally sustainable ways","sustainable ways of","ways of life","Members believe that","believe that there","that there is","there is a","is a close","a close connection","close connection between","connection between their","between their own","their own well","own well -","well -

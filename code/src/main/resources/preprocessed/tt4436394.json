{"title":"9999","plot":"Wilfried refers to himself as 'king one-eye in the land of the blind'. This land lays in Merksplas' prison in Belgium and the blind are the internees who reside in the prison without treatment. Mentally ill criminals in Belgium are not held responsible for their actions but become separated from society. There criminal acts range from murder to stabbing fire of a bike. Due to the lack of places in psychiatric hospitals they end up in prison without any possibility for therapy nor end date. Their files mention as date of release: 31/12/9999. 9999 intertwines five different stories of these 'blind.' These men are waiting; for comfort, for hope, for freedom, for change. The time between their prison bars is altogether different from the time outside the prison walls. Time is annihilated. The only thing that remains is an eternal confrontation; a confrontation with their deeds and with their illness. There is nothing else. In this film we disappear, together with the characters in need of treatment, behind the inexorable closed doors. We wait side by side.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Wilfri","refer","to","himself","as","'","king","one-ey","in","the","land","of","the","blind","'",".","This","land","lay","in","Merkspla","'","prison","in","Belgium","and","the","blind","are","the","interne","who","resid","in","the","prison","without","treatment",".","Mental","ill","crimin","in","Belgium","are","not","held","respons","for","their","action","but","becom","separ","from","societi",".","There","crimin","act","rang","from","murder","to","stab","fire","of","a","bike",".","Due","to","the","lack","of","place","in","psychiatr","hospit","they","end","up","in","prison","without","ani","possibl","for","therapi","nor","end","date",".","Their","file","mention","as","date","of","releas",":","31/12/9999",".","9999","intertwin","five","differ","stori","of","these","'","blind",".","'","These","men","are","wait",";","for","comfort",",","for","hope",",","for","freedom",",","for","chang",".","The","time","between","their","prison","bar","is","altogeth","differ","from","the","time","outsid","the","prison","wall",".","Time","is","annihil",".","The","onli","thing","that","remain","is","an","etern","confront",";","a","confront","with","their","deed","and","with","their","ill",".","There","is","noth","els",".","In","this","film","we","disappear",",","togeth","with","the","charact","in","need","of","treatment",",","behind","the","inexor","close","door",".","We","wait","side","by","side","."],"lemmas":["Wilfried","refer","to","himself","as","'","king","one-eye","in","the","land","of","the","blind","'",".","this","land","lay","in","Merksplas","'","prison","in","Belgium","and","the","blind","be","the","internee","who","reside","in","the","prison","without","treatment",".","mentally","ill","criminal","in","Belgium","be","not","hold","responsible","for","they","action","but","become","separate","from","society",".","there","criminal","act","range","from","murder","to","stab","fire","of","a","bike",".","due","to","the","lack","of","place","in","psychiatric","hospital","they","end","up","in","prison","without","any","possibility","for","therapy","nor","end","date",".","they","file","mention","as","date","of","release",":","31/12/9999",".","9999","intertwine","five","different","story","of","these","'","blind",".","'","these","man","be","wait",";","for","comfort",",","for","hope",",","for","freedom",",","for","change",".","the","time","between","they","prison","bar","be","altogether","different","from","the","time","outside","the","prison","wall",".","Time","be","annihilate",".","the","only","thing","that","remain","be","a","eternal","confrontation",";","a","confrontation","with","they","deed","and","with","they","illness",".","there","be","nothing","else",".","in","this","film","we","disappear",",","together","with","the","character","in","need","of","treatment",",","behind","the","inexorable","closed","door",".","we","wait","side","by","side","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Wilfried refers to","refers to himself","to himself as","himself as '","as ' king","' king one-eye","king one-eye in","one-eye in the","in the land","the land of","land of the","of the blind","the blind '","This land lays","land lays in","lays in Merksplas","in Merksplas '","Merksplas ' prison","' prison in","prison in Belgium","in Belgium and","Belgium and the","and the blind","the blind are","blind are the","are the internees","the internees who","internees who reside","who reside in","reside in the","in the prison","the prison without","prison without treatment","Mentally ill criminals","ill criminals in","criminals in Belgium","in Belgium are","Belgium are not","are not held","not held responsible","held responsible for","responsible for their","for their actions","their actions but","actions but become","but become separated","become separated from","separated from society","There criminal acts","criminal acts range","acts range from","range from murder","from murder to","murder to stabbing","to stabbing fire","stabbing fire of","fire of a","of a bike","Due to the","to the lack","the lack of","lack of places","of places in","places in psychiatric","in psychiatric hospitals","psychiatric hospitals they","hospitals they end","they end up","end up in","up in prison","in prison without","prison without any","without any possibility","any possibility for","possibility for therapy","for therapy nor","therapy nor end","nor end date","Their files mention","files mention as","mention as date","as date of","date of release","of release :","release : 31/12/9999","9999 intertwines five","intertwines five different","five different stories","different stories of","stories of these","of these '","these ' blind","' blind .","blind .

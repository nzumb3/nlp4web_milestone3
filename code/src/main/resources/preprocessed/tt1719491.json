{"title":"Factory of Martyrs","plot":"The monumental face of Ayatollah Khomeini, the charismatic revolutionary leader, and his successors towering on the backdrop of a quiet or stormy natural setting, the portraits of the revolutionary martyrs: these are the images that in Iran cover the walls of entire buildings and draw the attention of the viewer. They are not advertising images printed in industrial quantity. They are wall paintings, hand-made murals commissioned by the government playing a role in the Islamic propaganda campaign begun at the time of the Revolution in 1979 and still alive today. Despite an iconoclastic religion, these works cover the wall of otherwise anonymous buildings and invite the viewers to consider them as a real \"epic\" representation of ordinary men who have left a mark on history.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","monument","face","of","Ayatollah","Khomeini",",","the","charismat","revolutionari","leader",",","and","his","successor","tower","on","the","backdrop","of","a","quiet","or","stormi","natur","set",",","the","portrait","of","the","revolutionari","martyr",":","these","are","the","imag","that","in","Iran","cover","the","wall","of","entir","build","and","draw","the","attent","of","the","viewer",".","They","are","not","advertis","imag","print","in","industri","quantiti",".","They","are","wall","paint",",","hand-mad","mural","commiss","by","the","govern","play","a","role","in","the","Islamic","propaganda","campaign","begun","at","the","time","of","the","Revolut","in","1979","and","still","aliv","today",".","Despit","an","iconoclast","religion",",","these","work","cover","the","wall","of","otherwis","anonym","build","and","invit","the","viewer","to","consid","them","as","a","real","\"","epic","\"","represent","of","ordinari","men","who","have","left","a","mark","on","histori","."],"lemmas":["the","monumental","face","of","Ayatollah","Khomeini",",","the","charismatic","revolutionary","leader",",","and","he","successor","tower","on","the","backdrop","of","a","quiet","or","stormy","natural","setting",",","the","portrait","of","the","revolutionary","martyr",":","these","be","the","image","that","in","Iran","cover","the","wall","of","entire","building","and","draw","the","attention","of","the","viewer",".","they","be","not","advertise","image","print","in","industrial","quantity",".","they","be","wall","painting",",","hand-made","mural","commission","by","the","government","play","a","role","in","the","islamic","propaganda","campaign","begin","at","the","time","of","the","Revolution","in","1979","and","still","alive","today",".","despite","a","iconoclastic","religion",",","these","work","cover","the","wall","of","otherwise","anonymous","building","and","invite","the","viewer","to","consider","they","as","a","real","``","epic","''","representation","of","ordinary","man","who","have","leave","a","mark","on","history","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

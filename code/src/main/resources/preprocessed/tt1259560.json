{"title":"Lost in the Fog","plot":"After 28 years in the game, the life of an iconoclastic racehorse owner is transformed when his \"big horse\" finally arrives. The owner and his longtime trainer enjoy the season of a lifetime as their champion horse propels them to racing's most prestigious events culminating in the world championships. At the end of the horse's racing career, plans are finalized to retire him to stud and collect on a ten million dollar sales offer but the equine gods intervene at the last minute to turn this would-be fairy tale upside down.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["After","28","year","in","the","game",",","the","life","of","an","iconoclast","racehors","owner","is","transform","when","his","\"","big","hors","\"","final","arriv",".","The","owner","and","his","longtim","trainer","enjoy","the","season","of","a","lifetim","as","their","champion","hors","propel","them","to","race","'s","most","prestigi","event","culmin","in","the","world","championship",".","At","the","end","of","the","hors","'s","race","career",",","plan","are","final","to","retir","him","to","stud","and","collect","on","a","ten","million","dollar","sale","offer","but","the","equin","god","interven","at","the","last","minut","to","turn","this","would-b","fairi","tale","upsid","down","."],"lemmas":["after","28","year","in","the","game",",","the","life","of","a","iconoclastic","racehorse","owner","be","transform","when","he","``","big","horse","''","finally","arrive",".","the","owner","and","he","longtime","trainer","enjoy","the","season","of","a","lifetime","as","they","champion","horse","propel","they","to","racing","be","most","prestigious","event","culminate","in","the","world","championship",".","at","the","end","of","the","horse","'s","racing","career",",","plan","be","finalize","to","retire","he","to","stud","and","collect","on","a","ten","million","dollar","sale","offer","but","the","equine","god","intervene","at","the","last","minute","to","turn","this","would-be","fairy","tale","upside","down","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["After 28 years","28 years in","years in the","in the game","the game ,","game , the",", the life","the life of","life of an","of an iconoclastic","an iconoclastic racehorse","iconoclastic racehorse owner","racehorse owner is","owner is transformed","is transformed when","transformed when his","when his \"","his \" big","\" big horse","big horse \"","horse \" finally","\" finally arrives","The owner and","owner and his","and his longtime","his longtime trainer","longtime trainer enjoy","trainer enjoy the","enjoy the season","the season of","season of a","of a lifetime","a lifetime as","lifetime as their","as their champion","their champion horse","champion horse propels","horse propels them","propels them to","them to racing","to racing 's","racing 's most","'s most prestigious","most prestigious events","prestigious events culminating","events culminating in","culminating in the","in the world","the world championships","At the end","the end of","end of the","of the horse","the horse 's","horse 's racing","'s racing career","racing career ,","career , plans",", plans are","plans are finalized","are finalized to","finalized to retire","to retire him","retire him to","him to stud","to stud and","stud and collect","and collect on","collect on a","on a ten","a ten million","ten million dollar","million dollar sales","dollar sales offer","sales offer but","offer but the","but the equine","the equine gods","equine gods intervene","gods intervene at","intervene at the","at the last","the last minute","last minute to","minute to turn","to turn this","turn this would-be","this would-be fairy","would-be fairy tale","fairy tale upside","tale upside down"],"2grams":["After 28","28 years","years in","in the","the game","game ,",", the","the life","life of","of an","an iconoclastic","iconoclastic racehorse","racehorse owner","owner is","is transformed","transformed when","when his","his \"","\" big","big horse","horse \"","\" finally","finally arrives","The owner","owner and","and his","his longtime","longtime trainer","trainer enjoy","enjoy the","the season","season of","of a","a lifetime","lifetime as","as their","their champion","champion horse","horse propels","propels them","them to","to racing","racing 's","'s most","most prestigious","prestigious events","events culminating","culminating in","in the","the world","world championships","At the","the end","end of","of the","the horse","horse 's","'s racing","racing career","career ,",", plans","plans are","are finalized","finalized to","to retire","retire him","him to","to stud","stud and","and collect","collect on","on a","a ten","ten million","million dollar","dollar sales","sales offer","offer but","but the","the equine","equine gods","gods intervene","intervene at","at the","the last","last minute","minute to","to turn","turn this","this would-be","would-be fairy","fairy tale","tale upside","upside down"]}

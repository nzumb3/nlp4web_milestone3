{"title":"Border Line","plot":"Centres on two brothers, Stelios and Yannis. The impulsive Stelios skips their small town, deserts from the army, and is thought dead, until Yannis, now a city cop, recognizes his name on the papers of an illegal immigrant seaman. He begins a search for his lost brother, a search that takes him across many borders: between past and present, between Greece and its neighbouring countries, between one identity and another.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Centr","on","two","brother",",","Stelio","and","Yanni",".","The","impuls","Stelio","skip","their","small","town",",","desert","from","the","armi",",","and","is","thought","dead",",","until","Yanni",",","now","a","citi","cop",",","recogn","his","name","on","the","paper","of","an","illeg","immigr","seaman",".","He","begin","a","search","for","his","lost","brother",",","a","search","that","take","him","across","mani","border",":","between","past","and","present",",","between","Greec","and","it","neighbour","countri",",","between","one","ident","and","anoth","."],"lemmas":["centre","on","two","brother",",","Stelios","and","Yannis",".","the","impulsive","Stelios","skip","they","small","town",",","desert","from","the","army",",","and","be","think","dead",",","until","Yannis",",","now","a","city","cop",",","recognize","he","name","on","the","papers","of","a","illegal","immigrant","seaman",".","he","begin","a","search","for","he","lost","brother",",","a","search","that","take","he","across","many","border",":","between","past","and","present",",","between","Greece","and","its","neighbouring","country",",","between","one","identity","and","another","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Centres on two","on two brothers","two brothers ,","brothers , Stelios",", Stelios and","Stelios and Yannis","The impulsive Stelios","impulsive Stelios skips","Stelios skips their","skips their small","their small town","small town ,","town , deserts",", deserts from","deserts from the","from the army","the army ,","army , and",", and is","and is thought","is thought dead","thought dead ,","dead , until",", until Yannis","until Yannis ,","Yannis , now",", now a","now a city","a city cop","city cop ,","cop , recognizes",", recognizes his","recognizes his name","his name on","name on the","on the papers","the papers of","papers of an","of an illegal","an illegal immigrant","illegal immigrant seaman","He begins a","begins a search","a search for","search for his","for his lost","his lost brother","lost brother ,","brother , a",", a search","a search that","search that takes","that takes him","takes him across","him across many","across many borders","many borders :","borders : between",": between past","between past and","past and present","and present ,","present , between",", between Greece","between Greece and","Greece and its","and its neighbouring","its neighbouring countries","neighbouring countries ,","countries , between",", between one","between one identity","one identity and","identity and another"],"2grams":["Centres on","on two","two brothers","brothers ,",", Stelios","Stelios and","and Yannis","The impulsive","impulsive Stelios","Stelios skips","skips their","their small","small town","town ,",", deserts","deserts from","from the","the army","army ,",", and","and is","is thought","thought dead","dead ,",", until","until Yannis","Yannis ,",", now","now a","a city","city cop","cop ,",", recognizes","recognizes his","his name","name on","on the","the papers","papers of","of an","an illegal","illegal immigrant","immigrant seaman","He begins","begins a","a search","search for","for his","his lost","lost brother","brother ,",", a","a search","search that","that takes","takes him","him across","across many","many borders","borders :",": between","between past","past and","and present","present ,",", between","between Greece","Greece and","and its","its neighbouring","neighbouring countries","countries ,",", between","between one","one identity","identity and","and another"]}

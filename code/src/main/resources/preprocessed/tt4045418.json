{"title":"Georgica","plot":"We float above the plains of the Flevopolder, the last reclamation project of the Dutch government. We see how various farmers carry out their occupations in that ordered landscape. Over two thousand years ago, the Roman poet Vergilius wrote an ode to farming and to life in the countryside with the title Georgica. What do the farmers think of the texts by Vergilius? Some things have remained the same: the seasons, the ground has to be ploughed, the weather, the sounds of the birds. However, when the farmers hear the old texts, they spontaneously conjure up stories on what has changed, about the influence of the food industry, about contemporary regulations.","genres":["Documentary","

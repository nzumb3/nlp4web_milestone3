{"title":"The Saint of Fort Washington","plot":"Matthew, a young schizophrenic, finds himself out on the street when a slumlord tears down his apartment building. Soon, he finds himself in even more dire straits, when he is threatened by Little Leroy, a thug who is one of the tough denizens of the Fort Washington Shelter for Men. He reaches out to Jerry, a streetwise combat veteran, who takes Matthew under his wing as a son. The relationship between these two men grows as they attempt to conquer the numbing isolation of homelessness.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Matthew",",","a","young","schizophren",",","find","himself","out","on","the","street","when","a","slumlord","tear","down","his","apart","build",".","Soon",",","he","find","himself","in","even","more","dire","strait",",","when","he","is","threaten","by","Littl","Leroy",",","a","thug","who","is","one","of","the","tough","denizen","of","the","Fort","Washington","Shelter","for","Men",".","He","reach","out","to","Jerri",",","a","streetwis","combat","veteran",",","who","take","Matthew","under","his","wing","as","a","son",".","The","relationship","between","these","two","men","grow","as","they","attempt","to","conquer","the","numb","isol","of","homeless","."],"lemmas":["Matthew",",","a","young","schizophrenic",",","find","himself","out","on","the","street","when","a","slumlord","tear","down","he","apartment","building",".","soon",",","he","find","himself","in","even","more","dire","strait",",","when","he","be","threaten","by","Little","Leroy",",","a","thug","who","be","one","of","the","tough","denizen","of","the","Fort","Washington","Shelter","for","Men",".","he","reach","out","to","Jerry",",","a","streetwise","combat","veteran",",","who","take","Matthew","under","he","wing","as","a","son",".","the","relationship","between","these","two","man","grow","as","they","attempt","to","conquer","the","numbing","isolation","of","homelessness","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Matthew , a",", a young","a young schizophrenic","young schizophrenic ,","schizophrenic , finds",", finds himself","finds himself out","himself out on","out on the","on the street","the street when","street when a","when a slumlord","a slumlord tears","slumlord tears down","tears down his","down his apartment","his apartment building","Soon , he",", he finds","he finds himself","finds himself in","himself in even","in even more","even more dire","more dire straits","dire straits ,","straits , when",", when he","when he is","he is threatened","is threatened by","threatened by Little","by Little Leroy","Little Leroy ,","Leroy , a",", a thug","a thug who","thug who is","who is one","is one of","one of the","of the tough","the tough denizens","tough denizens of","denizens of the","of the Fort","the Fort Washington","Fort Washington Shelter","Washington Shelter for","Shelter for Men","He reaches out","reaches out to","out to Jerry","to Jerry ,","Jerry , a",", a streetwise","a streetwise combat","streetwise combat veteran","combat veteran ,","veteran , who",", who takes","who takes Matthew","takes Matthew under","Matthew under his","under his wing","his wing as","wing as a","as a son","The relationship between","relationship between these","between these two","these two men","two men grows","men grows as","grows as they","as they attempt","they attempt to","attempt to conquer","to conquer the","conquer the numbing","the numbing isolation","numbing isolation of","isolation of homelessness"],"2grams":["Matthew ,",", a","a young","young schizophrenic","schizophrenic ,",", finds","finds himself","himself out","out on","on the","the street","street when","when a","a slumlord","slumlord tears","tears down","down his","his apartment","apartment building","Soon ,",", he","he finds","finds himself","himself in","in even","even more","more dire","dire straits","straits ,",", when","when he","he is","is threatened","threatened by","by Little","Little Leroy","Leroy ,",", a","a thug","thug who","who is","is one","one of","of the","the tough","tough denizens","denizens of","of the","the Fort","Fort Washington","Washington Shelter","Shelter for","for Men","He reaches","reaches out","out to","to Jerry","Jerry ,",", a","a streetwise","streetwise combat","combat veteran","veteran ,",", who","who takes","takes Matthew","Matthew under","under his","his wing","wing as","as a","a son","The relationship","relationship between","between these","these two","two men","men grows","grows as","as they","they attempt","attempt to","to conquer","conquer the","the numbing","numbing isolation","isolation of","of homelessness"]}

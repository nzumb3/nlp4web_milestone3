{"title":"Tipping the Scale","plot":"Happy-go-lucky Malya flies through life without resistance, breezing along on her charms, never questioning her relationship with her mother, her Down Syndrome sister, or anyone else for that matter. But in one split-second everything changes, sending Malya careening off in a different direction, until she's forced to stop herself and really think for the very first time. She wonders if life isn't a scale, and all the little things that we do really do count. And maybe every word and every action is \"Tipping the Scale.\"","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Happy-go-lucki","Malya","fli","through","life","without","resist",",","breez","along","on","her","charm",",","never","question","her","relationship","with","her","mother",",","her","Down","Syndrom","sister",",","or","anyon","els","for","that","matter",".","But","in","one","split-second","everyth","chang",",","send","Malya","careen","off","in","a","differ","direct",",","until","she","'s","forc","to","stop","herself","and","realli","think","for","the","veri","first","time",".","She","wonder","if","life","is","n't","a","scale",",","and","all","the","littl","thing","that","we","do","realli","do","count",".","And","mayb","everi","word","and","everi","action","is","\"","Tip","the","Scale",".","\""],"lemmas":["happy-go-lucky","Malya","fly","through","life","without","resistance",",","breeze","along","on","she","charm",",","never","question","she","relationship","with","she","mother",",","she","Down","syndrome","sister",",","or","anyone","else","for","that","matter",".","but","in","one","split-second","everything","change",",","send","Malya","careen","off","in","a","different","direction",",","until","she","be","force","to","stop","herself","and","really","think","for","the","very","first","time",".","she","wonder","if","life","be","not","a","scale",",","and","all","the","little","thing","that","we","do","really","do","count",".","and","maybe","every","word","and","every","action","be","``","tip","the","Scale",".","''"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Happy-go-lucky Malya flies","Malya flies through","flies through life","through life without","life without resistance","without resistance ,","resistance , breezing",", breezing along","breezing along on","along on her","on her charms","her charms ,","charms , never",", never questioning","never questioning her","questioning her relationship","her relationship with","relationship with her","with her mother","her mother ,","mother , her",", her Down","her Down Syndrome","Down Syndrome sister","Syndrome sister ,","sister , or",", or anyone","or anyone else","anyone else for","else for that","for that matter","But in one","in one split-second","one split-second everything","split-second everything changes","everything changes ,","changes , sending",", sending Malya","sending Malya careening","Malya careening off","careening off in","off in a","in a different","a different direction","different direction ,","direction , until",", until she","until she 's","she 's forced","'s forced to","forced to stop","to stop herself","stop herself and","herself and really","and really think","really think for","think for the","for the very","the very first","very first time","She wonders if","wonders if life","if life is","life is n't","is n't a","n't a scale","a scale ,","scale , and",", and all","and all the","all the little","the little things","little things that","things that we","that we do","we do really","do really do","really do count","And maybe every","maybe every word","every word and","word and every","and every action","every action is","action is \"","is \" Tipping","\" Tipping the","Tipping the Scale","the Scale .","Scale . \""],"2grams":["Happy-go-lucky Malya","Malya flies","flies through","through life","life without","without resistance","resistance ,",", breezing","breezing along","along on","on her","her charms","charms ,",", never","never questioning","questioning her","her relationship","relationship with","with her","her mother","mother ,",", her","her Down","Down Syndrome","Syndrome sister","sister ,",", or","or anyone","anyone else","else for","for that","that matter","But in","in one","one split-second","split-second everything","everything changes","changes ,",", sending","sending Malya","Malya careening","careening off","off in","in a","a different","different direction","direction ,",", until","until she","she 's","'s forced","forced to","to stop","stop herself","herself and","and really","really think","think for","for the","the very","very first","first time","She wonders","wonders if","if life","life is","is n't","n't a","a scale","scale ,",", and","and all","all the","the little","little things","things that","that we","we do","do really","really do","do count","And maybe","maybe every","every word","word and","and every","every action","action is","is \"","\" Tipping","Tipping the","the Scale","Scale .",". \""]}

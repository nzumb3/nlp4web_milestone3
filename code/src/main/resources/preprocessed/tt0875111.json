{"title":"Seventeen","plot":"Maiko (Ishikawa) is a 17 year old aspiring picture book writer who was abandoned by her widowed father at the age of 3 and has lived in a foster home ever since. She meets Lisa (Fujimoto), also 17, and the two quickly form a bond of understanding as they help each other work out their problems. Lisa holds a grudge against her mother for paying more attention to the men she brings home than her own daughter and Maiko begins to doubt her artistic dream will ever come to fruition after a book editor judges her writing ability harshly.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Maiko","(","Ishikawa",")","is","a","17","year","old","aspir","pictur","book","writer","who","was","abandon","by","her","widow","father","at","the","age","of","3","and","has","live","in","a","foster","home","ever","sinc",".","She","meet","Lisa","(","Fujimoto",")",",","also","17",",","and","the","two","quick","form","a","bond","of","understand","as","they","help","each","other","work","out","their","problem",".","Lisa","hold","a","grudg","against","her","mother","for","pay","more","attent","to","the","men","she","bring","home","than","her","own","daughter","and","Maiko","begin","to","doubt","her","artist","dream","will","ever","come","to","fruition","after","a","book","editor","judg","her","write","abil","harsh","."],"lemmas":["Maiko","-lrb-","Ishikawa","-rrb-","be","a","17","year","old","aspire","picture","book","writer","who","be","abandon","by","she","widow","father","at","the","age","of","3","and","have","live","in","a","foster","home","ever","since",".","she","meet","Lisa","-lrb-","Fujimoto","-rrb-",",","also","17",",","and","the","two","quickly","form","a","bond","of","understanding","as","they","help","each","other","work","out","they","problem",".","Lisa","hold","a","grudge","against","she","mother","for","pay","more","attention","to","the","man","she","bring","home","than","she","own","daughter","and","Maiko","begin","to","doubt","she","artistic","dream","will","ever","come","to","fruition","after","a","book","editor","judge","she","writing","ability","harshly","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Maiko ( Ishikawa","( Ishikawa )","Ishikawa ) is",") is a","is a 17","a 17 year","17 year old","year old aspiring","old aspiring picture","aspiring picture book","picture book writer","book writer who","writer who was","who was abandoned","was abandoned by","abandoned by her","by her widowed","her widowed father","widowed father at","father at the","at the age","the age of","age of 3","of 3 and","3 and has","and has lived","has lived in","lived in a","in a foster","a foster home","foster home ever","home ever since","She meets Lisa","meets Lisa (","Lisa ( Fujimoto","( Fujimoto )","Fujimoto ) ,",") , also",", also 17","also 17 ,","17 , and",", and the","and the two","the two quickly","two quickly form","quickly form a","form a bond","a bond of","bond of understanding","of understanding as","understanding as they","as they help","they help each","help each other","each other work","other work out","work out their","out their problems","Lisa holds a","holds a grudge","a grudge against","grudge against her","against her mother","her mother for","mother for paying","for paying more","paying more attention","more attention to","attention to the","to the men","the men she","men she brings","she brings home","brings home than","home than her","than her own","her own daughter","own daughter and","daughter and Maiko","and Maiko begins","Maiko begins to","begins to doubt","to doubt her","doubt her artistic","her artistic dream","artistic dream will","dream will ever","will ever come","ever come to","come to fruition","to fruition after","fruition after a","after a book","a book editor","book editor judges","editor judges her","judges her writing","her writing ability","writing ability harshly"],"2grams":["Maiko (","( Ishikawa","Ishikawa )",") is","is a","a 17","17 year","year old","old aspiring","aspiring picture","picture book","book writer","writer who","who was","was abandoned","abandoned by","by her","her widowed","widowed father","father at","at the","the age","age of","of 3","3 and","and has","has lived","lived in","in a","a foster","foster home","home ever","ever since","She meets","meets Lisa","Lisa (","( Fujimoto","Fujimoto )",") ,",", also","also 17","17 ,",", and","and the","the two","two quickly","quickly form","form a","a bond","bond of","of understanding","understanding as","as they","they help","help each","each other","other work","work out","out their","their problems","Lisa holds","holds a","a grudge","grudge against","against her","her mother","mother for","for paying","paying more","more attention","attention to","to the","the men","men she","she brings","brings home","home than","than her","her own","own daughter","daughter and","and Maiko","Maiko begins","begins to","to doubt","doubt her","her artistic","artistic dream","dream will","will ever","ever come","come to","to fruition","fruition after","after a","a book","book editor","editor judges","judges her","her writing","writing ability","ability harshly"]}

{"title":"Newsies","plot":"July, 1899: When Joseph Pulitzer and William Randolph Hearst raise the distribution price one-tenth of a cent per paper, ten cents per hundred, the newsboys, poor enough already, are outraged. Inspired by the strike put on by the trolley workers, Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly (Christian Bale) organizes a newsboys' strike. With David Jacobs (David Moscow) as the brains of the new union, and Jack as the voice, the weak and oppressed found the strength to band together and challenge the powerful.","genres":["Drama"," History"," Family"],"stems":["Juli",",","1899",":","When","Joseph","Pulitz","and","William","Randolph","Hearst","rais","the","distribut","price","one-tenth","of","a","cent","per","paper",",","ten","cent","per","hundr",",","the","newsboy",",","poor","enough","alreadi",",","are","outrag",".","Inspire","by","the","strike","put","on","by","the","trolley","worker",",","Jack","\"","Cowboy","\"","Kelli","(","Christian","Bale",")","organ","a","newsboy","'","strike",".","With","David","Jacob","(","David","Moscow",")","as","the","brain","of","the","new","union",",","and","Jack","as","the","voic",",","the","weak","and","oppress","found","the","strength","to","band","togeth","and","challeng","the","power","."],"lemmas":["July",",","1899",":","when","Joseph","Pulitzer","and","William","Randolph","Hearst","raise","the","distribution","price","one-tenth","of","a","cent","per","paper",",","ten","cent","per","hundred",",","the","newsboy",",","poor","enough","already",",","be","outrage",".","inspire","by","the","strike","put","on","by","the","trolley","worker",",","Jack","``","Cowboy","''","Kelly","-lrb-","Christian","Bale","-rrb-","organize","a","newsboy","'","strike",".","with","David","Jacobs","-lrb-","David","Moscow","-rrb-","as","the","brain","of","the","new","union",",","and","Jack","as","the","voice",",","the","weak","and","oppressed","find","the","strength","to","band","together","and","challenge","the","powerful","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["July , 1899",", 1899 :","1899 : When",": When Joseph","When Joseph Pulitzer","Joseph Pulitzer and","Pulitzer and William","and William Randolph","William Randolph Hearst","Randolph Hearst raise","Hearst raise the","raise the distribution","the distribution price","distribution price one-tenth","price one-tenth of","one-tenth of a","of a cent","a cent per","cent per paper","per paper ,","paper , ten",", ten cents","ten cents per","cents per hundred","per hundred ,","hundred , the",", the newsboys","the newsboys ,","newsboys , poor",", poor enough","poor enough already","enough already ,","already , are",", are outraged","Inspired by the","by the strike","the strike put","strike put on","put on by","on by the","by the trolley","the trolley workers","trolley workers ,","workers , Jack",", Jack \"","Jack \" Cowboy","\" Cowboy \"","Cowboy \" Kelly","\" Kelly (","Kelly ( Christian","( Christian Bale","Christian Bale )","Bale ) organizes",") organizes a","organizes a newsboys","a newsboys '","newsboys ' strike","With David Jacobs","David Jacobs (","Jacobs ( David","( David Moscow","David Moscow )","Moscow ) as",") as the","as the brains","the brains of","brains of the","of the new","the new union","new union ,","union , and",", and Jack","and Jack as","Jack as the","as the voice","the voice ,","voice , the",", the weak","the weak and","weak and oppressed","and oppressed found","oppressed found the","found the strength","the strength to","strength to band","to band together","band together and","together and challenge","and challenge the","challenge the powerful"],"2grams":["July ,",", 1899","1899 :",": When","When Joseph","Joseph Pulitzer","Pulitzer and","and William","William Randolph","Randolph Hearst","Hearst raise","raise the","the distribution","distribution price","price one-tenth","one-tenth of","of a","a cent","cent per","per paper","paper ,",", ten","ten cents","cents per","per hundred","hundred ,",", the","the newsboys","newsboys ,",", poor","poor enough","enough already","already ,",", are","are outraged","Inspired by","by the","the strike","strike put","put on","on by","by the","the trolley","trolley workers","workers ,",", Jack","Jack \"","\" Cowboy","Cowboy \"","\" Kelly","Kelly (","( Christian","Christian Bale","Bale )",") organizes","organizes a","a newsboys","newsboys '","' strike","With David","David Jacobs","Jacobs (","( David","David Moscow","Moscow )",") as","as the","the brains","brains of","of the","the new","new union","union ,",", and","and Jack","Jack as","as the","the voice","voice ,",", the","the weak","weak and","and oppressed","oppressed found","found the","the strength","strength to","to band","band together","together and","and challenge","challenge the","the powerful"]}

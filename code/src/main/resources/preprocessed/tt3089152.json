{"title":"White Man Black Man Jew Man","plot":"White Man, Black Man, Jew Man' is a very original comedy motion picture project set on locations in the Atlanta, Georgia metropolitan area. In the tradition of films like 'Blazing Saddles', 'Friday', 'Dogma', and 'South Park', 'White Man, Black Man, Jew Man' is an energetic, satirical comedy that is both character and plot driven and is riotously funny and unexpectedly moving, yet subtly profound with meaningful messages about the importance of communication in bridging the divide between race religion and politics. It will become a movie that captures the hearts of all who see it and set a new standard for African American film.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["White","Man",",","Black","Man",",","Jew","Man","'","is","a","veri","origin","comedi","motion","pictur","project","set","on","locat","in","the","Atlanta",",","Georgia","metropolitan","area",".","In","the","tradit","of","film","like","'","Blaze","Saddl","'",",","'","Friday","'",",","'","Dogma","'",",","and","'","South","Park","'",",","'","White","Man",",","Black","Man",",","Jew","Man","'","is","an","energet",",","satir","comedi","that","is","both","charact","and","plot","driven","and","is","riotous","funni","and","unexpect","move",",","yet","subt","profound","with","meaning","messag","about","the","import","of","communic","in","bridg","the","divid","between","race","religion","and","polit",".","It","will","becom","a","movi","that","captur","the","heart","of","all","who","see","it","and","set","a","new","standard","for","African","American","film","."],"lemmas":["White","Man",",","Black","Man",",","Jew","Man","'","be","a","very","original","comedy","motion","picture","project","set","on","location","in","the","Atlanta",",","Georgia","metropolitan","area",".","in","the","tradition","of","film","like","'","Blazing","Saddles","'",",","'","Friday","'",",","'","dogma","'",",","and","'","South","Park","'",",","'","White","Man",",","Black","Man",",","Jew","Man","'","be","a","energetic",",","satirical","comedy","that","be","both","character","and","plot","drive","and","be","riotously","funny","and","unexpectedly","move",",","yet","subtly","profound","with","meaningful","message","about","the","importance","of","communication","in","bridge","the","divide","between","race","religion","and","politics",".","it","will","become","a","movie","that","capture","the","heart","of","all","who","see","it","and","set","a","new","standard","for","african","american","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["White

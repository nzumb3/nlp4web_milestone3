{"title":"Platinum Illusions","plot":"This action packed Hip-Hop drama explores the life of Oscar Hernandez, a handsome Latino ex-gang member who sets forth to land a recording contract and make a name for himself in the cut-throat hip hop business with the help of his crew. When a chance encounter with the owner of the hottest Latin Hip-Hop label on the West Coast, leaves one of his crew members in critical condition and him signed to the label for the next decade, and a tip off of a rival studio head exposes some disturbing evidence of the record company's conspiracy to murder their top artists for higher record sales, Oscar discovers that he's next on their list. He begins his plan of escape, but when his attempt to flee is unveiled, Oscar is forced to confront the demons of his past and return to the life of violence he's sworn to stay away from. \"Platinum Illusions\" is an exciting tale of strength and survival against impossible odds, filled with terror, humor and action! A film that is worthy to call itself the first \"true\" Latin Hip-Hop movie.","genres":["Action","

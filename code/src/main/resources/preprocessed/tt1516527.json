{"title":"Dancing with the Storms","plot":"Storm chasers are people who have a passion for finding and documenting wild weather conditions, thunderstorms, high winds, or tornados. These men and women often put themselves at great risk when they want to experience these powerful natural forces at close range. In Switzerland there is also a small group of storm chasers that, during the summer, is underway almost daily throughout the country and even beyond, looking for summer storms, heavy hailstorms, and tornados. They document and film their experiences.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["Storm","chaser","are","peopl","who","have","a","passion","for","find","and","document","wild","weather","condit",",","thunderstorm",",","high","wind",",","or","tornado",".","These","men","and","women","often","put","themselv","at","great","risk","when","they","want","to","experi","these","power","natur","forc","at","close","rang",".","In","Switzerland","there","is","also","a","small","group","of","storm","chaser","that",",","dure","the","summer",",","is","underway","almost","daili","throughout","the","countri","and","even","beyond",",","look","for","summer","storm",",","heavi","hailstorm",",","and","tornado",".","They","document","and","film","their","experi","."],"lemmas":["storm","chaser","be","people","who","have","a","passion","for","find","and","document","wild","weather","condition",",","thunderstorm",",","high","wind",",","or","tornado",".","these","man","and","woman","often","put","themselves","at","great","risk","when","they","want","to","experience","these","powerful","natural","force","at","close","range",".","in","Switzerland","there","be","also","a","small","group","of","storm","chaser","that",",","during","the","summer",",","be","underway","almost","daily","throughout","the","country","and","even","beyond",",","look","for","summer","storm",",","heavy","hailstorm",",","and","tornado",".","they","document","and","film","they","experience","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Storm chasers are","chasers are people","are people who","people who have","who have a","have a passion","a passion for","passion for finding","for finding and","finding and documenting","and documenting wild","documenting wild weather","wild weather conditions","weather conditions ,","conditions , thunderstorms",", thunderstorms ,","thunderstorms , high",", high winds","high winds ,","winds , or",", or tornados","These men and","men and women","and women often","women often put","often put themselves","put themselves at","themselves at great","at great risk","great risk when","risk when they","when they want","they want to","want to experience","to experience these","experience these powerful","these powerful natural","powerful natural forces","natural forces at","forces at close","at close range","In Switzerland there","Switzerland there is","there is also","is also a","also a small","a small group","small group of","group of storm","of storm chasers","storm chasers that","chasers that ,","that , during",", during the","during the summer","the summer ,","summer , is",", is underway","is underway almost","underway almost daily","almost daily throughout","daily throughout the","throughout the country","the country and","country and even","and even beyond","even beyond ,","beyond , looking",", looking for","looking for summer","for summer storms","summer storms ,","storms , heavy",", heavy hailstorms","heavy hailstorms ,","hailstorms , and",", and tornados","They document and","document and film","and film their","film their experiences"],"2grams":["Storm chasers","chasers are","are people","people who","who have","have a","a passion","passion for","for finding","finding and","and documenting","documenting wild","wild weather","weather conditions","conditions ,",", thunderstorms","thunderstorms ,",", high","high winds","winds ,",", or","or tornados","These men","men and","and women","women often","often put","put themselves","themselves at","at great","great risk","risk when","when they","they want","want to","to experience","experience these","these powerful","powerful natural","natural forces","forces at","at close","close range","In Switzerland","Switzerland there","there is","is also","also a","a small","small group","group of","of storm","storm chasers","chasers that","that ,",", during","during the","the summer","summer ,",", is","is underway","underway almost","almost daily","daily throughout","throughout the","the country","country and","and even","even beyond","beyond ,",", looking","looking for","for summer","summer storms","storms ,",", heavy","heavy hailstorms","hailstorms ,",", and","and tornados","They document","document and","and film","film their","their experiences"]}

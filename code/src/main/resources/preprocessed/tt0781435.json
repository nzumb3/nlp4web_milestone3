{"title":"The Duchess of Langeais","plot":"In Majorca, in 1823, a French general, Armand de Montriveau, overhears a cloistered nun singing in a chapel; he insists on speaking to her. She is Antoinette, for five years he has searched for her. Flash back to their meeting in Paris, he recently returned from Africa, she married and part of the highest society. She flirts with him, and soon he's captivated. His behavior is possessive, insistent. Then, it is her turn to become obsessed. Letters, balls, scandal, a kidnapping, and an ultimatum bring her to the cloister and him to melancholy. Whose steel proved sharper? Is it tragic or grotesque?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["In","Majorca",",","in","1823",",","a","French","general",",","Armand","de","Montriveau",",","overhear","a","cloister","nun","sing","in","a","chapel",";","he","insist","on","speak","to","her",".","She","is","Antoinett",",","for","five","year","he","has","search","for","her",".","Flash","back","to","their","meet","in","Pari",",","he","recent","return","from","Africa",",","she","marri","and","part","of","the","highest","societi",".","She","flirt","with","him",",","and","soon","he","'s","captiv",".","His","behavior","is","possess",",","insist",".","Then",",","it","is","her","turn","to","becom","obsess",".","Letter",",","ball",",","scandal",",","a","kidnap",",","and","an","ultimatum","bring","her","to","the","cloister","and","him","to","melancholi",".","Whose","steel","prove","sharper","?","Is","it","tragic","or","grotesqu","?"],"lemmas":["in","Majorca",",","in","1823",",","a","french","general",",","Armand","de","Montriveau",",","overhear","a","cloistered","nun","singing","in","a","chapel",";","he","insist","on","speaking","to","she",".","she","be","Antoinette",",","for","five","year","he","have","search","for","she",".","flash","back","to","they","meeting","in","Paris",",","he","recently","return","from","Africa",",","she","marry","and","part","of","the","highest","society",".","she","flirt","with","he",",","and","soon","he","be","captivate",".","he","behavior","be","possessive",",","insistent",".","then",",","it","be","she","turn","to","become","obsess",".","letter",",","ball",",","scandal",",","a","kidnapping",",","and","a","ultimatum","bring","she","to","the","cloister","and","he","to","melancholy",".","whose","steel","prove","sharper","?","be","it","tragic","or","grotesque","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In Majorca ,","Majorca , in",", in 1823","in 1823 ,","1823 , a",", a French","a French general","French general ,","general , Armand",", Armand de","Armand de Montriveau","de Montriveau ,","Montriveau , overhears",", overhears a","overhears a cloistered","a cloistered nun","cloistered nun singing","nun singing in","singing in a","in a chapel","a chapel ;","chapel ; he","; he insists","he insists on","insists on speaking","on speaking to","speaking to her","She is Antoinette","is Antoinette ,","Antoinette , for",", for five","for five years","five years he","years he has","he has searched","has searched for","searched for her","Flash back to","back to their","to their meeting","their meeting in","meeting in Paris","in Paris ,","Paris , he",", he recently","he recently returned","recently returned from","returned from Africa","from Africa ,","Africa , she",", she married","she married and","married and part","and part of","part of the","of the highest","the highest society","She flirts with","flirts with him","with him ,","him , and",", and soon","and soon he","soon he 's","he 's captivated","His behavior is","behavior is possessive","is possessive ,","possessive , insistent","Then , it",", it is","it is her","is her turn","her turn to","turn to become","to become obsessed","Letters , balls",", balls ,","balls , scandal",", scandal ,","scandal , a",", a kidnapping","a kidnapping ,","kidnapping , and",", and an","and an ultimatum","an ultimatum bring","ultimatum bring her","bring her to","her to the","to the cloister","the cloister and","cloister and him","and him to","him to melancholy","Whose steel proved","steel proved sharper","Is it tragic","it tragic or","tragic or grotesque"],"2grams":["In Majorca","Majorca ,",", in","in 1823","1823 ,",", a","a French","French general","general ,",", Armand","Armand de","de Montriveau","Montriveau ,",", overhears","overhears a","a cloistered","cloistered nun","nun singing","singing in","in a","a chapel","chapel ;","; he","he insists","insists on","on speaking","speaking to","to her","She is","is Antoinette","Antoinette ,",", for","for five","five years","years he","he has","has searched","searched for","for her","Flash back","back to","to their","their meeting","meeting in","in Paris","Paris ,",", he","he recently","recently returned","returned from","from Africa","Africa ,",", she","she married","married and","and part","part of","of the","the highest","highest society","She flirts","flirts with","with him","him ,",", and","and soon","soon he","he 's","'s captivated","His behavior","behavior is","is possessive","possessive ,",", insistent","Then ,",", it","it is","is her","her turn","turn to","to become","become obsessed","Letters ,",", balls","balls ,",", scandal","scandal ,",", a","a kidnapping","kidnapping ,",", and","and an","an ultimatum","ultimatum bring","bring her","her to","to the","the cloister","cloister and","and him","him to","to melancholy","Whose steel","steel proved","proved sharper","Is it","it tragic","tragic or","or grotesque"]}

{"title":"Crude Sacrifice","plot":"Crude Sacrifice takes a look at how one northern community, Fort Chipewyan is affected by the exploitation of Canada's rich Tar Sands development, and how Canada is dealing with their concerns. The health of the land and the people living near the world's largest construction project is discussed by leading scientists and the Aboriginal Peoples. Although this town is located near the earth's second largest fresh water delta, they can no longer drink the water, or eat the fish and other game food which sustained them for thousands of years. The film examines the state of our democracy.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Crude","Sacrific","take","a","look","at","how","one","northern","communiti",",","Fort","Chipewyan","is","affect","by","the","exploit","of","Canada","'s","rich","Tar","Sand","develop",",","and","how","Canada","is","deal","with","their","concern",".","The","health","of","the","land","and","the","peopl","live","near","the","world","'s","largest","construct","project","is","discuss","by","lead","scientist","and","the","Aborigin","Peopl",".","Although","this","town","is","locat","near","the","earth","'s","second","largest","fresh","water","delta",",","they","can","no","longer","drink","the","water",",","or","eat","the","fish","and","other","game","food","which","sustain","them","for","thousand","of","year",".","The","film","examin","the","state","of","our","democraci","."],"lemmas":["Crude","Sacrifice","take","a","look","at","how","one","northern","community",",","Fort","Chipewyan","be","affect","by","the","exploitation","of","Canada","'s","rich","Tar","Sands","development",",","and","how","Canada","be","deal","with","they","concern",".","the","health","of","the","land","and","the","people","live","near","the","world","'s","largest","construction","project","be","discuss","by","lead","scientist","and","the","Aboriginal","Peoples",".","although","this","town","be","located","near","the","earth","'s","second","largest","fresh","water","delta",",","they","can","no","longer","drink","the","water",",","or","eat","the","fish","and","other","game","food","which","sustain","they","for","thousand","of","year",".","the","film","examine","the","state","of","we","democracy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Crude Sacrifice takes","Sacrifice takes a","takes a look","a look at","look at how","at how one","how one northern","one northern community","northern community ,","community , Fort",", Fort Chipewyan","Fort Chipewyan is","Chipewyan is affected","is affected by","affected by the","by the exploitation","the exploitation of","exploitation of Canada","of Canada 's","Canada 's rich","'s rich Tar","rich Tar Sands","Tar Sands development","Sands development ,","development , and",", and how","and how Canada","how Canada is","Canada is dealing","is dealing with","dealing with their","with their concerns","The health of","health of the","of the land","the land and","land and the","and the people","the people living","people living near","living near the","near the world","the world 's","world 's largest","'s largest construction","largest construction project","construction project is","project is discussed","is discussed by","discussed by leading","by leading scientists","leading scientists and","scientists and the","and the Aboriginal","the Aboriginal Peoples","Although this town","this town is","town is located","is located near","located near the","near the earth","the earth 's","earth 's second","'s second largest","second largest fresh","largest fresh water","fresh water delta","water delta ,","delta , they",", they can","they can no","can no longer","no longer drink","longer drink the","drink the water","the water ,","water , or",", or eat","or eat the","eat the fish","the fish and","fish and other","and other game","other game food","game food which","food which sustained","which sustained them","sustained them for","them for thousands","for thousands of","thousands of years","The film examines","film examines the","examines the state","the state of","state of our","of our democracy"],"2grams":["Crude Sacrifice","Sacrifice takes","takes a","a look","look at","at how","how one","one northern","northern community","community ,",", Fort","Fort Chipewyan","Chipewyan is","is affected","affected by","by the","the exploitation","exploitation of","of Canada","Canada 's","'s rich","rich Tar","Tar Sands","Sands development","development ,",", and","and how","how Canada","Canada is","is dealing","dealing with","with their","their concerns","The health","health of","of the","the land","land and","and the","the people","people living","living near","near the","the world","world 's","'s largest","largest construction","construction project","project is","is discussed","discussed by","by leading","leading scientists","scientists and","and the","the Aboriginal","Aboriginal Peoples","Although this","this town","town is","is located","located near","near the","the earth","earth 's","'s second","second largest","largest fresh","fresh water","water delta","delta ,",", they","they can","can no","no longer","longer drink","drink the","the water","water ,",", or","or eat","eat the","the fish","fish and","and other","other game","game food","food which","which sustained","sustained them","them for","for thousands","thousands of","of years","The film","film examines","examines the","the state","state of","of our","our democracy"]}

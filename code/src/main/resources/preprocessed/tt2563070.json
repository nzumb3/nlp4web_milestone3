{"title":"Kiosk: A Generation Destroyed by Madness","plot":"Kiosk - the band and the movie - makes music from the howl of oppression. Founded in 2003 by lead singer and guitarist Arash Sobhani, Kiosk is Iran's most prominent underground rock band. At first, the musicians met in back alleys and basements around Tehran - in any little 'kiosk' beyond the regime's grasp. Their lyrics pry the skin off the Islamic Republic and hold up a mirror to the ghosts beneath. Kiosk has become the voice of the revolution. Not the holy war waged by clerics and politicians. But the revolt of the free mind against the boot-heel of tyranny.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Kiosk","-","the","band","and","the","movi","-","make","music","from","the","howl","of","oppress",".","Found","in","2003","by","lead","singer","and","guitarist","Arash","Sobhani",",","Kiosk","is","Iran","'s","most","promin","underground","rock","band",".","At","first",",","the","musician","met","in","back","alley","and","basement","around","Tehran","-","in","ani","littl","'","kiosk","'","beyond","the","regim","'s","grasp",".","Their","lyric","pri","the","skin","off","the","Islamic","Republ","and","hold","up","a","mirror","to","the","ghost","beneath",".","Kiosk","has","becom","the","voic","of","the","revolut",".","Not","the","holi","war","wage","by","cleric","and","politician",".","But","the","revolt","of","the","free","mind","against","the","boot-heel","of","tyranni","."],"lemmas":["Kiosk","-","the","band","and","the","movie","-","make","music","from","the","howl","of","oppression",".","found","in","2003","by","lead","singer","and","guitarist","Arash","Sobhani",",","Kiosk","be","Iran","'s","most","prominent","underground","rock","band",".","at","first",",","the","musician","meet","in","back","alley","and","basement","around","Tehran","-","in","any","little","'","kiosk","'","beyond","the","regime","'s","grasp",".","they","lyric","pry","the","skin","off","the","Islamic","Republic","and","hold","up","a","mirror","to","the","ghost","beneath",".","Kiosk","have","become","the","voice","of","the","revolution",".","not","the","holy","war","wage","by","cleric","and","politician",".","but","the","revolt","of","the","free","mind","against","the","boot-heel","of","tyranny","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Kiosk - the","- the band","the band and","band and the","and the movie","the movie -","movie - makes","- makes music","makes music from","music from the","from the howl","the howl of","howl of oppression","Founded in 2003","in 2003 by","2003 by lead","by lead singer","lead singer and","singer and guitarist","and guitarist Arash","guitarist Arash Sobhani","Arash Sobhani ,","Sobhani , Kiosk",", Kiosk is","Kiosk is Iran","is Iran 's","Iran 's most","'s most prominent","most prominent underground","prominent underground rock","underground rock band","At first ,","first , the",", the musicians","the musicians met","musicians met in","met in back","in back alleys","back alleys and","alleys and basements","and basements around","basements around Tehran","around Tehran -","Tehran - in","- in any","in any little","any little '","little ' kiosk","' kiosk '","kiosk ' beyond","' beyond the","beyond the regime","the regime 's","regime 's grasp","Their lyrics pry","lyrics pry the","pry the skin","the skin off","skin off the","off the Islamic","the Islamic Republic","Islamic Republic and","Republic and hold","and hold up","hold up a","up a mirror","a mirror to","mirror to the","to the ghosts","the ghosts beneath","Kiosk has become","has become the","become the voice","the voice of","voice of the","of the revolution","Not the holy","the holy war","holy war waged","war waged by","waged by clerics","by clerics and","clerics and politicians","But the revolt","the revolt of","revolt of the","of the free","the free mind","free mind against","mind against the","against the boot-heel","the boot-heel of","boot-heel of tyranny"],"2grams":["Kiosk -","- the","the band","band and","and the","the movie","movie -","- makes","makes music","music from","from the","the howl","howl of","of oppression","Founded in","in 2003","2003 by","by lead","lead singer","singer and","and guitarist","guitarist Arash","Arash Sobhani","Sobhani ,",", Kiosk","Kiosk is","is Iran","Iran 's","'s most","most prominent","prominent underground","underground rock","rock band","At first","first ,",", the","the musicians","musicians met","met in","in back","back alleys","alleys and","and basements","basements around","around Tehran","Tehran -","- in","in any","any little","little '","' kiosk","kiosk '","' beyond","beyond the","the regime","regime 's","'s grasp","Their lyrics","lyrics pry","pry the","the skin","skin off","off the","the Islamic","Islamic Republic","Republic and","and hold","hold up","up a","a mirror","mirror to","to the","the ghosts","ghosts beneath","Kiosk has","has become","become the","the voice","voice of","of the","the revolution","Not the","the holy","holy war","war waged","waged by","by clerics","clerics and","and politicians","But the","the revolt","revolt of","of the","the free","free mind","mind against","against the","the boot-heel","boot-heel of","of tyranny"]}

{"title":"No Smoke","plot":"A woman shopper suspects an Asian film crew are terrorists, and tries to report them, but she soon becomes of interest to the police and Special Branch herself when she is found in possession of a large sum of money, and a plane ticket to Spain. She didn't know that if you have over £1000 on you and can't prove where it came from, the police can keep it without charging you. It's just the beginning of the slippery slope... 'No Smoke' is based on true story.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["A","woman","shopper","suspect","an","Asian","film","crew","are","terrorist",",","and","tri","to","report","them",",","but","she","soon","becom","of","interest","to","the","polic","and","Special","Branch","herself","when","she","is","found","in","possess","of","a","larg","sum","of","money",",","and","a","plane","ticket","to","Spain",".","She","did","n't","know","that","if","you","have","over","£","1000","on","you","and","ca","n't","prove","where","it","came","from",",","the","polic","can","keep","it","without","charg","you",".","It","'s","just","the","begin","of","the","slipperi","slope","...","'","No","Smoke","'","is","base","on","true","stori","."],"lemmas":["a","woman","shopper","suspect","a","asian","film","crew","be","terrorist",",","and","try","to","report","they",",","but","she","soon","become","of","interest","to","the","police","and","special","Branch","herself","when","she","be","find","in","possession","of","a","large","sum","of","money",",","and","a","plane","ticket","to","Spain",".","she","do","not","know","that","if","you","have","over","£","1000","on","you","and","can","not","prove","where","it","come","from",",","the","police","can","keep","it","without","charge","you",".","it","be","just","the","beginning","of","the","slippery","slope","...","'","no","smoke","'","be","base","on","true","story","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A woman shopper","woman shopper suspects","shopper suspects an","suspects an Asian","an Asian film","Asian film crew","film crew are","crew are terrorists","are terrorists ,","terrorists , and",", and tries","and tries to","tries to report","to report them","report them ,","them , but",", but she","but she soon","she soon becomes","soon becomes of","becomes of interest","of interest to","interest to the","to the police","the police and","police and Special","and Special Branch","Special Branch herself","Branch herself when","herself when she","when she is","she is found","is found in","found in possession","in possession of","possession of a","of a large","a large sum","large sum of","sum of money","of money ,","money , and",", and a","and a plane","a plane ticket","plane ticket to","ticket to Spain","She did n't","did n't know","n't know that","know that if","that if you","if you have","you have over","have over £","over £ 1000","£ 1000 on","1000 on you","on you and","you and ca","and ca n't","ca n't prove","n't prove where","prove where it","where it came","it came from","came from ,","from , the",", the police","the police can","police can keep","can keep it","keep it without","it without charging","without charging you","It 's just","'s just the","just the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of the","of the slippery","the slippery slope","slippery slope ...","slope ...

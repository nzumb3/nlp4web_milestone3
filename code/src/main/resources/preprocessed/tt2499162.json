{"title":"The Manor","plot":"The Cohen family has owned The Manor strip club in Guelph, Ontario for thirty years, originally purchased by family patriarch, Roger Cohen. Five years ago, Roger's oldest son, Shawney Cohen started working at the club while he tried to figure out what to do with his life. He realizes that working at or owning the strip club is not what he wants to do for the rest of his life, and that his younger brother, Sammy Cohen is better suited to that life. But Shawney isn't working very hard to get out of it, in part as he tries to get a handle on the interrelationships between all his family members, which also includes his mother, Brenda Cohen. Those relationships have largely suffered because of the strip club, which in part is manifested in both his parents suffering from eating issues, but on opposite ends of the spectrum. Roger is obese and refuses to give up food, while Brenda does not eat, which has resulted in her being malnourished. The family will have to figure out if The Manor in its current form will play a role in their collective futures, and if so if that is a healthy decision for all concerned.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Cohen","famili","has","own","The","Manor","strip","club","in","Guelph",",","Ontario","for","thirti","year",",","origin","purchas","by","famili","patriarch",",","Roger","Cohen",".","Five","year","ago",",","Roger","'s","oldest","son",",","Shawney","Cohen","start","work","at","the","club","while","he","tri","to","figur","out","what","to","do","with","his","life",".","He","realiz","that","work","at","or","own","the","strip","club","is","not","what","he","want","to","do","for","the","rest","of","his","life",",","and","that","his","younger","brother",",","Sammi","Cohen","is","better","suit","to","that","life",".","But","Shawney","is","n't","work","veri","hard","to","get","out","of","it",",","in","part","as","he","tri","to","get","a","handl","on","the","interrelationship","between","all","his","famili","member",",","which","also","includ","his","mother",",","Brenda","Cohen",".","Those","relationship","have","larg","suffer","becaus","of","the","strip","club",",","which","in","part","is","manifest","in","both","his","parent","suffer","from","eat","issu",",","but","on","opposit","end","of","the","spectrum",".","Roger","is","obes","and","refus","to","give","up","food",",","while","Brenda","doe","not","eat",",","which","has","result","in","her","be","malnourish",".","The","famili","will","have","to","figur","out","if","The","Manor","in","it","current","form","will","play","a","role","in","their","collect","futur",",","and","if","so","if","that","is","a","healthi","decis","for","all","concern","."],"lemmas":["the","Cohen","family","have","own","the","Manor","strip","club","in","Guelph",",","Ontario","for","thirty","year",",","originally","purchase","by","family","patriarch",",","Roger","Cohen",".","five","year","ago",",","Roger","'s","oldest","son",",","Shawney","Cohen","start","work","at","the","club","while","he","try","to","figure","out","what","to","do","with","he","life",".","he","realize","that","work","at","or","own","the","strip","club","be","not","what","he","want","to","do","for","the","rest","of","he","life",",","and","that","he","younger","brother",",","Sammy","Cohen","be","better","suit","to","that","life",".","but","Shawney","be","not","work","very","hard","to","get","out","of","it",",","in","part","as","he","try","to","get","a","handle","on","the","interrelationship","between","all","he","family","member",",","which","also","include","he","mother",",","Brenda","Cohen",".","those","relationship","have","largely","suffer","because","of","the","strip","club",",","which","in","part","be","manifest","in","both","he","parent","suffer","from","eat","issue",",","but","on","opposite","end","of","the","spectrum",".","Roger","be","obese","and","refuse","to","give","up","food",",","while","Brenda","do","not","eat",",","which","have","result","in","she","be","malnourish",".","the","family","will","have","to","figure","out","if","the","Manor","in","its","current","form","will","play","a","role","in","they","collective","future",",","and","if","so","if","that","be","a","healthy","decision","for","all","concern","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

In an attempt to fit in, and more importantly, in an attempt to find himself, Don joins an activist group which forces him to question what he really believes in.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Disench","by","the","church","and","his","devout","Christian","mother",",","19","year-old","Donald","escap","Texa","for","the","liber","Northwest","and","attend","Reed","Colleg","at","the","urg","of","his","secular","father",".","At","Reed","Colleg",",","Don","find","that","his","classmat",",","from","all","walk","of","life",",","are","more","anti-religi","and","anti-everyth","than","he","was","prepar","for",".","In","an","attempt","to","fit","in",",","and","more","import",",","in","an","attempt","to","find","himself",",","Don","join","an","activist","group","which","forc","him","to","question","what","he","realli","believ","in","."],"lemmas":["disenchant","by","the","church","and","he","devout","Christian","mother",",","19","year-old","Donald","escape","Texas","for","the","liberal","Northwest","and","attend","Reed","College","at","the","urge","of","he","secular","father",".","at","Reed","College",",","Don","find","that","he","classmate",",","from","all","walk","of","life",",","be","more","anti-religious","and","anti-everything","than","he","be","prepare","for",".","in","a","attempt","to","fit","in",",","and","more","importantly",",","in","a","attempt","to","find","himself",",","Don","join","a","activist","group","which","force","he","to","question","what","he","really","believe","in","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Disenchanted by the","by the church","the church and","church and his","and his devout","his devout Christian","devout Christian mother","Christian mother ,","mother , 19",", 19 year-old","19 year-old Donald","year-old Donald escapes","Donald escapes Texas","escapes Texas for","Texas for the","for the liberal","the liberal Northwest","liberal Northwest and","Northwest and attends","and attends Reed","attends Reed College","Reed College at","College at the","at the urging","the urging of","urging of his","of his secular","his secular father","At Reed College","Reed College ,","College , Don",", Don finds","Don finds that","finds that his","that his classmates","his classmates ,","classmates , from",", from all","from all walks","all walks of","walks of life","of life ,","life , are",", are more","are more anti-religious","more anti-religious and","anti-religious and anti-everything","and anti-everything than","anti-everything than he","than he was","he was prepared","was prepared for","In an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to fit","to fit in","fit in ,","in , and",", and more","and more importantly","more importantly ,","importantly , in",", in an","in an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to find","to find himself","find himself ,","himself , Don",", Don joins","Don joins an","joins an activist","an activist group","activist group which","group which forces","which forces him","forces him to","him to question","to question what","question what he","what he really","he really believes","really believes in"],"2grams":["Disenchanted by","by the","the church","church and","and his","his devout","devout Christian","Christian mother","mother ,",", 19","19 year-old","year-old Donald","Donald escapes","escapes Texas","Texas for","for the","the liberal","liberal Northwest","Northwest and","and attends","attends Reed","Reed College","College at","at the","the urging","urging of","of his","his secular","secular father","At Reed","Reed College","College ,",", Don","Don finds","finds that","that his","his classmates","classmates ,",", from","from all","all walks","walks of","of life","life ,",", are","are more","more anti-religious","anti-religious and","and anti-everything","anti-everything than","than he","he was","was prepared","prepared for","In an","an attempt","attempt to","to fit","fit in","in ,",", and","and more","more importantly","importantly ,",", in","in an","an attempt","attempt to","to find","find himself","himself ,",", Don","Don joins","joins an","an activist","activist group","group which","which forces","forces him","him to","to question","question what","what he","he really","really believes","believes in"]}

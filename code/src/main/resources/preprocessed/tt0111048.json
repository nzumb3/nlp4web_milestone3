{"title":"S.F.W.","plot":"Cliff Spab is a guy who doesn't really care about anything. He gets held hostage at a store for 36 days by terrorists, who demand that the entire thing be broadcast on national television. Cliff ends up taking a bullet for fellow hostage Wendy - making him a national hero. The two are the sole survivors of the ordeal, and soon become prisoners of the media. Cliff escapes it all, only to find himself being pushed further away from Wendy when he needs her most.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Cliff","Spab","is","a","guy","who","doe","n't","realli","care","about","anyth",".","He","get","held","hostag","at","a","store","for","36","day","by","terrorist",",","who","demand","that","the","entir","thing","be","broadcast","on","nation","televis",".","Cliff","end","up","take","a","bullet","for","fellow","hostag","Wendi","-","make","him","a","nation","hero",".","The","two","are","the","sole","survivor","of","the","ordeal",",","and","soon","becom","prison","of","the","media",".","Cliff","escap","it","all",",","onli","to","find","himself","be","push","further","away","from","Wendi","when","he","need","her","most","."],"lemmas":["Cliff","Spab","be","a","guy","who","do","not","really","care","about","anything",".","he","get","held","hostage","at","a","store","for","36","day","by","terrorist",",","who","demand","that","the","entire","thing","be","broadcast","on","national","television",".","Cliff","end","up","take","a","bullet","for","fellow","hostage","Wendy","-","make","he","a","national","hero",".","the","two","be","the","sole","survivor","of","the","ordeal",",","and","soon","become","prisoner","of","the","media",".","Cliff","escape","it","all",",","only","to","find","himself","be","push","further","away","from","Wendy","when","he","need","she","most","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cliff Spab is","Spab is a","is a guy","a guy who","guy who does","who does n't","does n't really","n't really care","really care about","care about anything","He gets held","gets held hostage","held hostage at","hostage at a","at a store","a store for","store for 36","for 36 days","36 days by","days by terrorists","by terrorists ,","terrorists , who",", who demand","who demand that","demand that the","that the entire","the entire thing","entire thing be","thing be broadcast","be broadcast on","broadcast on national","on national television","Cliff ends up","ends up taking","up taking a","taking a bullet","a bullet for","bullet for fellow","for fellow hostage","fellow hostage Wendy","hostage Wendy -","Wendy - making","- making him","making him a","him a national","a national hero","The two are","two are the","are the sole","the sole survivors","sole survivors of","survivors of the","of the ordeal","the ordeal ,","ordeal , and",", and soon","and soon become","soon become prisoners","become prisoners of","prisoners of the","of the media","Cliff escapes it","escapes it all","it all ,","all , only",", only to","only to find","to find himself","find himself being","himself being pushed","being pushed further","pushed further away","further away from","away from Wendy","from Wendy when","Wendy when he","when he needs","he needs her","needs her most"],"2grams":["Cliff Spab","Spab is","is a","a guy","guy who","who does","does n't","n't really","really care","care about","about anything","He gets","gets held","held hostage","hostage at","at a","a store","store for","for 36","36 days","days by","by terrorists","terrorists ,",", who","who demand","demand that","that the","the entire","entire thing","thing be","be broadcast","broadcast on","on national","national television","Cliff ends","ends up","up taking","taking a","a bullet","bullet for","for fellow","fellow hostage","hostage Wendy","Wendy -","- making","making him","him a","a national","national hero","The two","two are","are the","the sole","sole survivors","survivors of","of the","the ordeal","ordeal ,",", and","and soon","soon become","become prisoners","prisoners of","of the","the media","Cliff escapes","escapes it","it all","all ,",", only","only to","to find","find himself","himself being","being pushed","pushed further","further away","away from","from Wendy","Wendy when","when he","he needs","needs her","her most"]}

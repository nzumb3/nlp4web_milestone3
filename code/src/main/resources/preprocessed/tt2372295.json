{"title":"In God We Trust","plot":"When a returning Afghanistan veteran threatens to sue the small town of King, NC unless they take down a Christian Flag from the public Veteran's Memorial, a firestorm of protests and threats ensue. Most residents claim that the Separation of Church and State is a myth and that the Founders intended this to be a Christian Nation. Starting with the words of dozens of King's citizens, the trail to find the truth leads to Monticello, Washington D.C., and even alongside a group of Christians who are convinced that May 21st is the end of the world, as well as a half dozen other contradictory religious viewpoints. The question becomes, how does one determine the truth of history and of God?","genres":["Documentary"," History","

{"title":"The Secret to My Silky Skin","plot":"A boy who lives with his parents in Kyoto comes to Tokyo for a business trip and stays with his fuck buddy. They have no special plans for the five days together. They will go to work in the morning, come home, spend the evening together, and sleep. The first night when he arrives, the fuck buddy starts to have sex with him just as usual, but he is somehow unable to respond. In fact, he has been concerned about a certain thing since before he visits Tokyo.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","boy","who","live","with","his","parent","in","Kyoto","come","to","Tokyo","for","a","busi","trip","and","stay","with","his","fuck","buddi",".","They","have","no","special","plan","for","the","five","day","togeth",".","They","will","go","to","work","in","the","morn",",","come","home",",","spend","the","even","togeth",",","and","sleep",".","The","first","night","when","he","arriv",",","the","fuck","buddi","start","to","have","sex","with","him","just","as","usual",",","but","he","is","somehow","unabl","to","respond",".","In","fact",",","he","has","been","concern","about","a","certain","thing","sinc","befor","he","visit","Tokyo","."],"lemmas":["a","boy","who","live","with","he","parent","in","Kyoto","come","to","Tokyo","for","a","business","trip","and","stay","with","he","fuck","buddy",".","they","have","no","special","plan","for","the","five","day","together",".","they","will","go","to","work","in","the","morning",",","come","home",",","spend","the","evening","together",",","and","sleep",".","the","first","night","when","he","arrive",",","the","fuck","buddy","start","to","have","sex","with","he","just","as","usual",",","but","he","be","somehow","unable","to","respond",".","in","fact",",","he","have","be","concern","about","a","certain","thing","since","before","he","visit","Tokyo","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A boy who","boy who lives","who lives with","lives with his","with his parents","his parents in","parents in Kyoto","in Kyoto comes","Kyoto comes to","comes to Tokyo","to Tokyo for","Tokyo for a","for a business","a business trip","business trip and","trip and stays","and stays with","stays with his","with his fuck","his fuck buddy","They have no","have no special","no special plans","special plans for","plans for the","for the five","the five days","five days together","They will go","will go to","go to work","to work in","work in the","in the morning","the morning ,","morning , come",", come home","come home ,","home , spend",", spend the","spend the evening","the evening together","evening together ,","together , and",", and sleep","The first night","first night when","night when he","when he arrives","he arrives ,","arrives , the",", the fuck","the fuck buddy","fuck buddy starts","buddy starts to","starts to have","to have sex","have sex with","sex with him","with him just","him just as","just as usual","as usual ,","usual , but",", but he","but he is","he is somehow","is somehow unable","somehow unable to","unable to respond","In fact ,","fact , he",", he has","he has been","has been concerned","been concerned about","concerned about a","about a certain","a certain thing","certain thing since","thing since before","since before he","before he visits","he visits Tokyo"],"2grams":["A boy","boy who","who lives","lives with","with his","his parents","parents in","in Kyoto","Kyoto comes","comes to","to Tokyo","Tokyo for","for a","a business","business trip","trip and","and stays","stays with","with his","his fuck","fuck buddy","They have","have no","no special","special plans","plans for","for the","the five","five days","days together","They will","will go","go to","to work","work in","in the","the morning","morning ,",", come","come home","home ,",", spend","spend the","the evening","evening together","together ,",", and","and sleep","The first","first night","night when","when he","he arrives","arrives ,",", the","the fuck","fuck buddy","buddy starts","starts to","to have","have sex","sex with","with him","him just","just as","as usual","usual ,",", but","but he","he is","is somehow","somehow unable","unable to","to respond","In fact","fact ,",", he","he has","has been","been concerned","concerned about","about a","a certain","certain thing","thing since","since before","before he","he visits","visits Tokyo"]}

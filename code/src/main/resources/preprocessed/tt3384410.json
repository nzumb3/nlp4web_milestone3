{"title":"Pig Business in Chile","plot":"The residents of Freirina, Chile blockaded the world's biggest factory pig farm just outside the town which was sickening them with toxic stench and depleting the valley's precious water. Special forces attacked the blockade and their spokesman was seriously injured by private security guards. In response to nationwide outrage at the violence against the protesters, the government announced stringent environmental requirements which the company was unable to comply with, and so closed the factory farm.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["The","resid","of","Freirina",",","Chile","blockad","the","world","'s","biggest","factori","pig","farm","just","outsid","the","town","which","was","sicken","them","with","toxic","stench","and","deplet","the","valley","'s","precious","water",".","Special","forc","attack","the","blockad","and","their","spokesman","was","serious","injur","by","privat","secur","guard",".","In","respons","to","nationwid","outrag","at","the","violenc","against","the","protest",",","the","govern","announc","stringent","environment","requir","which","the","compani","was","unabl","to","compli","with",",","and","so","close","the","factori","farm","."],"lemmas":["the","resident","of","Freirina",",","Chile","blockade","the","world","'s","biggest","factory","pig","farm","just","outside","the","town","which","be","sicken","they","with","toxic","stench","and","deplete","the","valley","'s","precious","water",".","special","force","attack","the","blockade","and","they","spokesman","be","seriously","injure","by","private","security","guard",".","in","response","to","nationwide","outrage","at","the","violence","against","the","protester",",","the","government","announce","stringent","environmental","requirement","which","the","company","be","unable","to","comply","with",",","and","so","close","the","factory","farm","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The residents of","residents of Freirina","of Freirina ,","Freirina , Chile",", Chile blockaded","Chile blockaded the","blockaded the world","the world 's","world 's biggest","'s biggest factory","biggest factory pig","factory pig farm","pig farm just","farm just outside","just outside the","outside the town","the town which","town which was","which was sickening","was sickening them","sickening them with","them with toxic","with toxic stench","toxic stench and","stench and depleting","and depleting the","depleting the valley","the valley 's","valley 's precious","'s precious water","Special forces attacked","forces attacked the","attacked the blockade","the blockade and","blockade and their","and their spokesman","their spokesman was","spokesman was seriously","was seriously injured","seriously injured by","injured by private","by private security","private security guards","In response to","response to nationwide","to nationwide outrage","nationwide outrage at","outrage at the","at the violence","the violence against","violence against the","against the protesters","the protesters ,","protesters , the",", the government","the government announced","government announced stringent","announced stringent environmental","stringent environmental requirements","environmental requirements which","requirements which the","which the company","the company was","company was unable","was unable to","unable to comply","to comply with","comply with ,","with , and",", and so","and so closed","so closed the","closed the factory","the factory farm"],"2grams":["The residents","residents of","of Freirina","Freirina ,",", Chile","Chile blockaded","blockaded the","the world","world 's","'s biggest","biggest factory","factory pig","pig farm","farm just","just outside","outside the","the town","town which","which was","was sickening","sickening them","them with","with toxic","toxic stench","stench and","and depleting","depleting the","the valley","valley 's","'s precious","precious water","Special forces","forces attacked","attacked the","the blockade","blockade and","and their","their spokesman","spokesman was","was seriously","seriously injured","injured by","by private","private security","security guards","In response","response to","to nationwide","nationwide outrage","outrage at","at the","the violence","violence against","against the","the protesters","protesters ,",", the","the government","government announced","announced stringent","stringent environmental","environmental requirements","requirements which","which the","the company","company was","was unable","unable to","to comply","comply with","with ,",", and","and so","so closed","closed the","the factory","factory farm"]}

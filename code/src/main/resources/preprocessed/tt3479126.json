{"title":"The Deadly Ponies Gang","plot":"A docu-comedy about friendship and the lengths people go to for their mates. Meet Clint and Dwayne- The extremely quotable members of the two-member Deadly ponies Gang who trawl the edges of rural New Zealand on their pimped-out rides (i.e.. ponies decorated with glitter, beads and sunglasses). Not short of a suave move with the ladies, Clint worries that Dwayne's not pulling the way he once did- most likely because he has no teeth! So Dwayne organises a gig to fundraise for a new set, the 'Help my mate Dwayne get some teeth Fundraising gig'. Along with some drug deals to supplement their income, the pair go in search of a life of hustling, riding and partying.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["A","docu-comedi","about","friendship","and","the","length","peopl","go","to","for","their","mate",".","Meet","Clint","and","Dwayn","-","The","extrem","quotabl","member","of","the","two-memb","Dead","poni","Gang","who","trawl","the","edg","of","rural","New","Zealand","on","their","pimped-out","ride","(","i.e.",".","poni","decor","with","glitter",",","bead","and","sunglass",")",".","Not","short","of","a","suav","move","with","the","ladi",",","Clint","worri","that","Dwayn","'s","not","pull","the","way","he","onc","did","-","most","like","becaus","he","has","no","teeth","!","So","Dwayn","organis","a","gig","to","fundrais","for","a","new","set",",","the","'","Help","my","mate","Dwayn","get","some","teeth","Fundrais","gig","'",".","Along","with","some","drug","deal","to","supplement","their","incom",",","the","pair","go","in","search","of","a","life","of","hustl",",","ride","and","parti","."],"lemmas":["a","docu-comedy","about","friendship","and","the","length","people","go","to","for","they","mate",".","Meet","Clint","and","Dwayne","-","the","extremely","quotable","member","of","the","two-member","deadly","pony","gang","who","trawl","the","edge","of","rural","New","Zealand","on","they","pimped-out","ride","-lrb-","i.e.",".","pony","decorate","with","glitter",",","bead","and","sunglass","-rrb-",".","not","short","of","a","suave","move","with","the","lady",",","Clint","worry","that","Dwayne","'s","not","pull","the","way","he","once","do","-","most","likely","because","he","have","no","tooth","!","so","Dwayne","organise","a","gig","to","fundraise","for","a","new","set",",","the","'","help","my","mate","Dwayne","get","some","tooth","fundraise","gig","'",".","along","with","some","drug","deal","to","supplement","they","income",",","the","pair","go","in","search","of","a","life","of","hustle",",","ride","and","party","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A docu-comedy about","docu-comedy about friendship","about friendship and","friendship and the","and the lengths","the lengths people","lengths people go","people go to","go to for","to for their","for their mates","Meet Clint and","Clint and Dwayne","and Dwayne -","Dwayne -

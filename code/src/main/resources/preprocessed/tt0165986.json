{"title":"The Tic Code","plot":"A 10 year old gifted boy wants to be a jazz pianist much to the chagrin of his more classical oriented piano instructor. With his mother's help, he is an underage regular at a local nightspot, where he is teamed up with a sax superstar. Both come to learn that each suffers from Tourette's Syndrome (thus the film title). The older man has developed mannerisms to cover up his own fallibilities and resents the boy and his mother's acceptance of the disease.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","10","year","old","gift","boy","want","to","be","a","jazz","pianist","much","to","the","chagrin","of","his","more","classic","orient","piano","instructor",".","With","his","mother","'s","help",",","he","is","an","underag","regular","at","a","local","nightspot",",","where","he","is","team","up","with","a","sax","superstar",".","Both","come","to","learn","that","each","suffer","from","Tourett","'s","Syndrom","(","thus","the","film","titl",")",".","The","older","man","has","develop","manner","to","cover","up","his","own","fallibl","and","resent","the","boy","and","his","mother","'s","accept","of","the","diseas","."],"lemmas":["a","10","year","old","gifted","boy","want","to","be","a","jazz","pianist","much","to","the","chagrin","of","he","more","classical","oriented","piano","instructor",".","with","he","mother","'s","help",",","he","be","a","underage","regular","at","a","local","nightspot",",","where","he","be","team","up","with","a","sax","superstar",".","both","come","to","learn","that","each","suffer","from","Tourette","'s","syndrome","-lrb-","thus","the","film","title","-rrb-",".","the","older","man","have","develop","mannerism","to","cover","up","he","own","fallibility","and","resent","the","boy","and","he","mother","'s","acceptance","of","the","disease","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A 10 year","10 year old","year old gifted","old gifted boy","gifted boy wants","boy wants to","wants to be","to be a","be a jazz","a jazz pianist","jazz pianist much","pianist much to","much to the","to the chagrin","the chagrin of","chagrin of his","of his more","his more classical","more classical oriented","classical oriented piano","oriented piano instructor","With his mother","his mother 's","mother 's help","'s help ,","help , he",", he is","he is an","is an underage","an underage regular","underage regular at","regular at a","at a local","a local nightspot","local nightspot ,","nightspot , where",", where he","where he is","he is teamed","is teamed up","teamed up with","up with a","with a sax","a sax superstar","Both come to","come to learn","to learn that","learn that each","that each suffers","each suffers from","suffers from Tourette","from Tourette 's","Tourette 's Syndrome","'s Syndrome (","Syndrome ( thus","( thus the","thus the film","the film title","film title )","The older man","older man has","man has developed","has developed mannerisms","developed mannerisms to","mannerisms to cover","to cover up","cover up his","up his own","his own fallibilities","own fallibilities and","fallibilities and resents","and resents the","resents the boy","the boy and","boy and his","and his mother","his mother 's","mother 's acceptance","'s acceptance of","acceptance of the","of the disease"],"2grams":["A 10","10 year","year old","old gifted","gifted boy","boy wants","wants to","to be","be a","a jazz","jazz pianist","pianist much","much to","to the","the chagrin","chagrin of","of his","his more","more classical","classical oriented","oriented piano","piano instructor","With his","his mother","mother 's","'s help","help ,",", he","he is","is an","an underage","underage regular","regular at","at a","a local","local nightspot","nightspot ,",", where","where he","he is","is teamed","teamed up","up with","with a","a sax","sax superstar","Both come","come to","to learn","learn that","that each","each suffers","suffers from","from Tourette","Tourette 's","'s Syndrome","Syndrome (","( thus","thus the","the film","film title","title )","The older","older man","man has","has developed","developed mannerisms","mannerisms to","to cover","cover up","up his","his own","own fallibilities","fallibilities and","and resents","resents the","the boy","boy and","and his","his mother","mother 's","'s acceptance","acceptance of","of the","the disease"]}

After his father's departure, György gets a job at a brickyard; his bus is stopped and its Jewish occupants sent to camps. There, György find camaraderie, suffering, cruelty, illness, and death. He hears advice on preserving one's dignity and self-esteem. He discovers hatred. If he does survive and returns to Budapest, what will he find? What is natural; what is it to be a Jew? Sepia, black and white, and color alternate to shade the mood.","genres":["Drama"," War"," Romance"],"stems":["An","Hungarian","youth","come","of","age","at","Buchenwald","dure","World","War","II",".","Györgi","Köves","is","14",",","the","son","of","a","merchant","who","'s","sent","to","a","forc","labor","camp",".","After","his","father","'s","departur",",","Györgi","get","a","job","at","a","brickyard",";","his","bus","is","stop","and","it","Jewish","occup","sent","to","camp",".","There",",","Györgi","find","camaraderi",",","suffer",",","cruelti",",","ill",",","and","death",".","He","hear","advic","on","preserv","one","'s","digniti","and","self-esteem",".","He","discov","hatr",".","If","he","doe","surviv","and","return","to","Budapest",",","what","will","he","find","?","What","is","natur",";","what","is","it","to","be","a","Jew","?","Sepia",",","black","and","white",",","and","color","altern","to","shade","the","mood","."],"lemmas":["a","hungarian","youth","come","of","age","at","Buchenwald","during","World","War","II",".","György","Köves","be","14",",","the","son","of","a","merchant","who","be","send","to","a","force","labor","camp",".","after","he","father","'s","departure",",","György","get","a","job","at","a","brickyard",";","he","bus","be","stop","and","its","jewish","occupant","send","to","camp",".","there",",","György","find","camaraderie",",","suffering",",","cruelty",",","illness",",","and","death",".","he","hear","advice","on","preserve","one","'s","dignity","and","self-esteem",".","he","discover","hatred",".","if","he","do","survive","and","return","to","Budapest",",","what","will","he","find","?","what","be","natural",";","what","be","it","to","be","a","jew","?","Sepia",",","black","and","white",",","and","color","alternate","to","shade","the","mood","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An Hungarian youth","Hungarian youth comes","youth comes of","comes of age","of age at","age at Buchenwald","at Buchenwald during","Buchenwald during World","during World War","World War II","György Köves is","Köves is 14","is 14 ,","14 , the",", the son","the son of","son of a","of a merchant","a merchant who","merchant who 's","who 's sent","'s sent to","sent to a","to a forced","a forced labor","forced labor camp","After his father","his father 's","father 's departure","'s departure ,","departure , György",", György gets","György gets a","gets a job","a job at","job at a","at a brickyard","a brickyard ;","brickyard ; his","; his bus","his bus is","bus is stopped","is stopped and","stopped and its","and its Jewish","its Jewish occupants","Jewish occupants sent","occupants sent to","sent to camps","There , György",", György find","György find camaraderie","find camaraderie ,","camaraderie , suffering",", suffering ,","suffering , cruelty",", cruelty ,","cruelty , illness",", illness ,","illness , and",", and death","He hears advice","hears advice on","advice on preserving","on preserving one","preserving one 's","one 's dignity","'s dignity and","dignity and self-esteem","He discovers hatred","If he does","he does survive","does survive and","survive and returns","and returns to","returns to Budapest","to Budapest ,","Budapest , what",", what will","what will he","will he find","What is natural","is natural ;","natural ; what","; what is","what is it","is it to","it to be","to be a","be a Jew","Sepia , black",", black and","black and white","and white ,","white , and",", and color","and color alternate","color alternate to","alternate to shade","to shade the","shade the mood"],"2grams":["An Hungarian","Hungarian youth","youth comes","comes of","of age","age at","at Buchenwald","Buchenwald during","during World","World War","War II","György Köves","Köves is","is 14","14 ,",", the","the son","son of","of a","a merchant","merchant who","who 's","'s sent","sent to","to a","a forced","forced labor","labor camp","After his","his father","father 's","'s departure","departure ,",", György","György gets","gets a","a job","job at","at a","a brickyard","brickyard ;","; his","his bus","bus is","is stopped","stopped and","and its","its Jewish","Jewish occupants","occupants sent","sent to","to camps","There ,",", György","György find","find camaraderie","camaraderie ,",", suffering","suffering ,",", cruelty","cruelty ,",", illness","illness ,",", and","and death","He hears","hears advice","advice on","on preserving","preserving one","one 's","'s dignity","dignity and","and self-esteem","He discovers","discovers hatred","If he","he does","does survive","survive and","and returns","returns to","to Budapest","Budapest ,",", what","what will","will he","he find","What is","is natural","natural ;","; what","what is","is it","it to","to be","be a","a Jew","Sepia ,",", black","black and","and white","white ,",", and","and color","color alternate","alternate to","to shade","shade the","the mood"]}

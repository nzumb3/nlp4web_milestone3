{"title":"Return to Reichenbach","plot":"One-hour documentary that weaves together the stories of two women - one orphaned by the Hitler regime and the other possibly the Nazi guard who protected her. The film intimately explores and contrasts their WW2 experiences and crushing losses, and witnesses their fraught reunion more than half a century later. RETURN TO REICHENBACH gives audiences a rare opportunity to intimately experience history through the eyes of an everyday German woman and a Jewish girl.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["One-hour","documentari","that","weav","togeth","the","stori","of","two","women","-","one","orphan","by","the","Hitler","regim","and","the","other","possibl","the","Nazi","guard","who","protect","her",".","The","film","intim","explor","and","contrast","their","WW2","experi","and","crush","loss",",","and","wit","their","fraught","reunion","more","than","half","a","centuri","later",".","RETURN","TO","REICHENBACH","give","audienc","a","rare","opportun","to","intim","experi","histori","through","the","eye","of","an","everyday","German","woman","and","a","Jewish","girl","."],"lemmas":["one-hour","documentary","that","weave","together","the","story","of","two","woman","-","one","orphan","by","the","Hitler","regime","and","the","other","possibly","the","Nazi","guard","who","protect","she",".","the","film","intimately","explore","and","contrast","they","ww2","experience","and","crush","loss",",","and","witness","they","fraught","reunion","more","than","half","a","century","later",".","return","to","reichenbach","give","audience","a","rare","opportunity","to","intimately","experience","history","through","the","eye","of","a","everyday","german","woman","and","a","jewish","girl","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["One-hour documentary that","documentary that weaves","that weaves together","weaves together the","together the stories","the stories of","stories of two","of two women","two women -","women - one","- one orphaned","one orphaned by","orphaned by the","by the Hitler","the Hitler regime","Hitler regime and","regime and the","and the other","the other possibly","other possibly the","possibly the Nazi","the Nazi guard","Nazi guard who","guard who protected","who protected her","The film intimately","film intimately explores","intimately explores and","explores and contrasts","and contrasts their","contrasts their WW2","their WW2 experiences","WW2 experiences and","experiences and crushing","and crushing losses","crushing losses ,","losses , and",", and witnesses","and witnesses their","witnesses their fraught","their fraught reunion","fraught reunion more","reunion more than","more than half","than half a","half a century","a century later","RETURN TO REICHENBACH","TO REICHENBACH gives","REICHENBACH gives audiences","gives audiences a","audiences a rare","a rare opportunity","rare opportunity to","opportunity to intimately","to intimately experience","intimately experience history","experience history through","history through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of an","of an everyday","an everyday German","everyday German woman","German woman and","woman and a","and a Jewish","a Jewish girl"],"2grams":["One-hour documentary","documentary that","that weaves","weaves together","together the","the stories","stories of","of two","two women","women -","- one","one orphaned","orphaned by","by the","the Hitler","Hitler regime","regime and","and the","the other","other possibly","possibly the","the Nazi","Nazi guard","guard who","who protected","protected her","The film","film intimately","intimately explores","explores and","and contrasts","contrasts their","their WW2","WW2 experiences","experiences and","and crushing","crushing losses","losses ,",", and","and witnesses","witnesses their","their fraught","fraught reunion","reunion more","more than","than half","half a","a century","century later","RETURN TO","TO REICHENBACH","REICHENBACH gives","gives audiences","audiences a","a rare","rare opportunity","opportunity to","to intimately","intimately experience","experience history","history through","through the","the eyes","eyes of","of an","an everyday","everyday German","German woman","woman and","and a","a Jewish","Jewish girl"]}

{"title":"My Sisters Kids in the Snow","plot":"The whole family are going to Norway on a week's ski vacation. However, the father of the family breaks his leg and the mother feels she cannot go with all the seven children alone, not with the newborn twins needing so much attention and all. Therefore, her brother Erik is asked to go with the children, which he does. When arriving at the hotel, the kids find out that their arch nemesis, Mrs. Flinth, also has come there. Will their vacation be completely spoiled or will they find a way to get at her this time too?","genres":["Family"],"stems":["The","whole","famili","are","go","to","Norway","on","a","week","'s","ski","vacat",".","Howev",",","the","father","of","the","famili","break","his","leg","and","the","mother","feel","she","can","not","go","with","all","the","seven","children","alon",",","not","with","the","newborn","twin","need","so","much","attent","and","all",".","Therefor",",","her","brother","Erik","is","ask","to","go","with","the","children",",","which","he","doe",".","When","arriv","at","the","hotel",",","the","kid","find","out","that","their","arch","nemesi",",","Mrs.","Flinth",",","also","has","come","there",".","Will","their","vacat","be","complet","spoil","or","will","they","find","a","way","to","get","at","her","this","time","too","?"],"lemmas":["the","whole","family","be","go","to","Norway","on","a","week","'s","ski","vacation",".","however",",","the","father","of","the","family","break","he","leg","and","the","mother","feel","she","can","not","go","with","all","the","seven","child","alone",",","not","with","the","newborn","twin","need","so","much","attention","and","all",".","therefore",",","she","brother","Erik","be","ask","to","go","with","the","child",",","which","he","do",".","when","arrive","at","the","hotel",",","the","kid","find","out","that","they","arch","nemesis",",","Mrs.","Flinth",",","also","have","come","there",".","will","they","vacation","be","completely","spoil","or","will","they","find","a","way","to","get","at","she","this","time","too","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The whole family","whole family are","family are going","are going to","going to Norway","to Norway on","Norway on a","on a week","a week 's","week 's ski","'s ski vacation","However , the",", the father","the father of","father of the","of the family","the family breaks","family breaks his","breaks his leg","his leg and","leg and the","and the mother","the mother feels","mother feels she","feels she can","she can not","can not go","not go with","go with all","with all the","all the seven","the seven children","seven children alone","children alone ,","alone , not",", not with","not with the","with the newborn","the newborn twins","newborn twins needing","twins needing so","needing so much","so much attention","much attention and","attention and all","Therefore , her",", her brother","her brother Erik","brother Erik is","Erik is asked","is asked to","asked to go","to go with","go with the","with the children","the children ,","children , which",", which he","which he does","When arriving at","arriving at the","at the hotel","the hotel ,","hotel , the",", the kids","the kids find","kids find out","find out that","out that their","that their arch","their arch nemesis","arch nemesis ,","nemesis , Mrs.",", Mrs. Flinth","Mrs. Flinth ,","Flinth , also",", also has","also has come","has come there","Will their vacation","their vacation be","vacation be completely","be completely spoiled","completely spoiled or","spoiled or will","or will they","will they find","they find a","find a way","a way to","way to get","to get at","get at her","at her this","her this time","this time too"],"2grams":["The whole","whole family","family are","are going","going to","to Norway","Norway on","on a","a week","week 's","'s ski","ski vacation","However ,",", the","the father","father of","of the","the family","family breaks","breaks his","his leg","leg and","and the","the mother","mother feels","feels she","she can","can not","not go","go with","with all","all the","the seven","seven children","children alone","alone ,",", not","not with","with the","the newborn","newborn twins","twins needing","needing so","so much","much attention","attention and","and all","Therefore ,",", her","her brother","brother Erik","Erik is","is asked","asked to","to go","go with","with the","the children","children ,",", which","which he","he does","When arriving","arriving at","at the","the hotel","hotel ,",", the","the kids","kids find","find out","out that","that their","their arch","arch nemesis","nemesis ,",", Mrs.","Mrs. Flinth","Flinth ,",", also","also has","has come","come there","Will their","their vacation","vacation be","be completely","completely spoiled","spoiled or","or will","will they","they find","find a","a way","way to","to get","get at","at her","her this","this time","time too"]}

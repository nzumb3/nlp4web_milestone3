{"title":"Johnny Mad Dog","plot":"Johnny Mad Dog, maybe 15, leads a band of boy soldiers in a civil war in an unnamed African country. \"Don't want to die? Don't be born\" is one of their shouted mottoes. We follow Mad Dog and his crew - No Good Advice, Butterfly, Chicken Hair, and others - as they kill, pillage rape, interrogate, and terrorize on their march to the capital. They take a TV station and lead an assault on the President's residence. We also follow Laokole, about Johnny age, as she tries to hold together her family of brother and disabled father. Is there more than chaos and inhumanity here? At war since age 10, has Johnny anything inside?","genres":["Drama"," War"],"stems":["Johnni","Mad","Dog",",","mayb","15",",","lead","a","band","of","boy","soldier","in","a","civil","war","in","an","unnam","African","countri",".","\"","Do","n't","want","to","die","?","Do","n't","be","born","\"","is","one","of","their","shout","motto",".","We","follow","Mad","Dog","and","his","crew","-","No","Good","Advice",",","Butterfli",",","Chicken","Hair",",","and","other","-","as","they","kill",",","pillag","rape",",","interrog",",","and","terror","on","their","march","to","the","capit",".","They","take","a","TV","station","and","lead","an","assault","on","the","Presid","'s","resid",".","We","also","follow","Laokol",",","about","Johnni","age",",","as","she","tri","to","hold","togeth","her","famili","of","brother","and","disabl","father",".","Is","there","more","than","chao","and","inhuman","here","?","At","war","sinc","age","10",",","has","Johnni","anyth","insid","?"],"lemmas":["Johnny","Mad","Dog",",","maybe","15",",","lead","a","band","of","boy","soldier","in","a","civil","war","in","a","unnamed","african","country",".","``","do","not","want","to","die","?","do","not","be","bear","``","be","one","of","they","shout","motto",".","we","follow","Mad","Dog","and","he","crew","-","No","Good","Advice",",","Butterfly",",","Chicken","Hair",",","and","other","-","as","they","kill",",","pillage","rape",",","interrogate",",","and","terrorize","on","they","march","to","the","capital",".","they","take","a","tv","station","and","lead","a","assault","on","the","President","'s","residence",".","we","also","follow","Laokole",",","about","Johnny","age",",","as","she","try","to","hold","together","she","family","of","brother","and","disabled","father",".","be","there","more","than","chaos","and","inhumanity","here","?","at","war","since","age","10",",","have","Johnny","anything","inside","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Johnny Mad Dog","Mad Dog ,","Dog , maybe",", maybe 15","maybe 15 ,","15 , leads",", leads a","leads a band","a band of","band of boy","of boy soldiers","boy soldiers in","soldiers in a","in a civil","a civil war","civil war in","war in an","in an unnamed","an unnamed African","unnamed African country","\" Do n't","Do n't want","n't want to","want to die","Do n't be","n't be born","be born \"","born \" is","\" is one","is one of","one of their","of their shouted","their shouted mottoes","We follow Mad","follow Mad Dog","Mad Dog and","Dog and his","and his crew","his crew -","crew -

{"title":"Lunch","plot":"For the past 40 years, a group of comedy writers and directors has gathered every other Wednesday for lunch - and other nourishment. The members and their meeting places have changed occasionally, but their friendship and humor persist. Lunch describes more than a single meal. At each, their perceptive comments are sharp and brilliant. But their meetings mean more to them than affable, professional companionship; rather, a need to keep wit and wisdom alive and well. These are the fabled guys that made America funny. This is the feature length documentary LUNCH, which follows an earlier (2007), experimental Short by the same title, but with other cast members.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["For","the","past","40","year",",","a","group","of","comedi","writer","and","director","has","gather","everi","other","Wednesday","for","lunch","-","and","other","nourish",".","The","member","and","their","meet","place","have","chang","occasion",",","but","their","friendship","and","humor","persist",".","Lunch","describ","more","than","a","singl","meal",".","At","each",",","their","percept","comment","are","sharp","and","brilliant",".","But","their","meet","mean","more","to","them","than","affabl",",","profession","companionship",";","rather",",","a","need","to","keep","wit","and","wisdom","aliv","and","well",".","These","are","the","fabl","guy","that","made","America","funni",".","This","is","the","featur","length","documentari","LUNCH",",","which","follow","an","earlier","(","2007",")",",","experiment","Short","by","the","same","titl",",","but","with","other","cast","member","."],"lemmas":["for","the","past","40","year",",","a","group","of","comedy","writer","and","director","have","gather","every","other","Wednesday","for","lunch","-","and","other","nourishment",".","the","member","and","they","meeting","place","have","change","occasionally",",","but","they","friendship","and","humor","persist",".","lunch","describe","more","than","a","single","meal",".","at","each",",","they","perceptive","comment","be","sharp","and","brilliant",".","but","they","meeting","mean","more","to","they","than","affable",",","professional","companionship",";","rather",",","a","need","to","keep","wit","and","wisdom","alive","and","well",".","these","be","the","fabled","guy","that","make","America","funny",".","this","be","the","feature","length","documentary","lunch",",","which","follow","a","earlier","-lrb-","2007","-rrb-",",","experimental","Short","by","the","same","title",",","but","with","other","cast","member","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["For the past","the past 40","past 40 years","40 years ,","years , a",", a group","a group of","group of comedy","of comedy writers","comedy writers and","writers and directors","and directors has","directors has gathered","has gathered every","gathered every other","every other Wednesday","other Wednesday for","Wednesday for lunch","for lunch -","lunch - and","- and other","and other nourishment","The members and","members and their","and their meeting","their meeting places","meeting places have","places have changed","have changed occasionally","changed occasionally ,","occasionally , but",", but their","but their friendship","their friendship and","friendship and humor","and humor persist","Lunch describes more","describes more than","more than a","than a single","a single meal","At each ,","each , their",", their perceptive","their perceptive comments","perceptive comments are","comments are sharp","are sharp and","sharp and brilliant","But their meetings","their meetings mean","meetings mean more","mean more to","more to them","to them than","them than affable","than affable ,","affable , professional",", professional companionship","professional companionship ;","companionship ;

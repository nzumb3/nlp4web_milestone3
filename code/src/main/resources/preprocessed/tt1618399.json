{"title":"The Waiting Room","plot":"The Waiting Room is a character-driven documentary film that uses extraordinary access to go behind the doors of an American public hospital struggling to care for a community of largely uninsured patients. The film - using a blend of cinema verité and characters' voice over - offers a raw, intimate, and even uplifting look at how patients, executive staff and caregivers each cope with disease, bureaucracy and hard choices. It is a film about fighting for survival when the odds are stacked against you.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Wait","Room","is","a","character-driven","documentari","film","that","use","extraordinari","access","to","go","behind","the","door","of","an","American","public","hospit","struggl","to","care","for","a","communiti","of","larg","uninsur","patient",".","The","film","-","use","a","blend","of","cinema","verité","and","charact","'","voic","over","-","offer","a","raw",",","intim",",","and","even","uplift","look","at","how","patient",",","execut","staff","and","caregiv","each","cope","with","diseas",",","bureaucraci","and","hard","choic",".","It","is","a","film","about","fight","for","surviv","when","the","odd","are","stack","against","you","."],"lemmas":["the","Waiting","Room","be","a","character-driven","documentary","film","that","use","extraordinary","access","to","go","behind","the","door","of","a","american","public","hospital","struggle","to","care","for","a","community","of","largely","uninsured","patient",".","the","film","-","use","a","blend","of","cinema","verité","and","character","'","voice","over","-","offer","a","raw",",","intimate",",","and","even","uplifting","look","at","how","patient",",","executive","staff","and","caregiver","each","cope","with","disease",",","bureaucracy","and","hard","choice",".","it","be","a","film","about","fight","for","survival","when","the","odds","be","stack","against","you","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The Waiting Room","Waiting Room is","Room is a","is a character-driven","a character-driven documentary","character-driven documentary film","documentary film that","film that uses","that uses extraordinary","uses extraordinary access","extraordinary access to","access to go","to go behind","go behind the","behind the doors","the doors of","doors of an","of an American","an American public","American public hospital","public hospital struggling","hospital struggling to","struggling to care","to care for","care for a","for a community","a community of","community of largely","of largely uninsured","largely uninsured patients","The film -","film - using","- using a","using a blend","a blend of","blend of cinema","of cinema verité","cinema verité and","verité and characters","and characters '","characters ' voice","' voice over","voice over -","over - offers","- offers a","offers a raw","a raw ,","raw , intimate",", intimate ,","intimate , and",", and even","and even uplifting","even uplifting look","uplifting look at","look at how","at how patients","how patients ,","patients , executive",", executive staff","executive staff and","staff and caregivers","and caregivers each","caregivers each cope","each cope with","cope with disease","with disease ,","disease , bureaucracy",", bureaucracy and","bureaucracy and hard","and hard choices","It is a","is a film","a film about","film about fighting","about fighting for","fighting for survival","for survival when","survival when the","when the odds","the odds are","odds are stacked","are stacked against","stacked against you"],"2grams":["The Waiting","Waiting Room","Room is","is a","a character-driven","character-driven documentary","documentary film","film that","that uses","uses extraordinary","extraordinary access","access to","to go","go behind","behind the","the doors","doors of","of an","an American","American public","public hospital","hospital struggling","struggling to","to care","care for","for a","a community","community of","of largely","largely uninsured","uninsured patients","The film","film -","- using","using a","a blend","blend of","of cinema","cinema verité","verité and","and characters","characters '","' voice","voice over","over -","- offers","offers a","a raw","raw ,",", intimate","intimate ,",", and","and even","even uplifting","uplifting look","look at","at how","how patients","patients ,",", executive","executive staff","staff and","and caregivers","caregivers each","each cope","cope with","with disease","disease ,",", bureaucracy","bureaucracy and","and hard","hard choices","It is","is a","a film","film about","about fighting","fighting for","for survival","survival when","when the","the odds","odds are","are stacked","stacked against","against you"]}

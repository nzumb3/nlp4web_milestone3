{"title":"Tempting Fear","plot":"Andreas Fransson has been called the boldest extreme skier in a generation. Over the past three years he has logged first descents in a half-dozen countries, battled back to life from an accident that nearly killed him, and become the most talked about skier in the epicenter of all things extreme - Chamonix, France. What makes Andreas most intriguing, however, are his thoughtful musings on meaning from a life on the edge - a willingness to enter mental spaces that few have ever experienced. In Tempting Fear, Sweden's soft-spoken Adventurer of the Year explores a place in which fear overwhelms all emotions, playing both friend and enemy in a pas de deux where death lies just one misstep away.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"," Biography"],"stems":["Andrea","Fransson","has","been","call","the","boldest","extrem","skier","in","a","generat",".","Over","the","past","three","year","he","has","log","first","descent","in","a","half-dozen","countri",",","battl","back","to","life","from","an","accid","that","near","kill","him",",","and","becom","the","most","talk","about","skier","in","the","epicent","of","all","thing","extrem","-","Chamonix",",","Franc",".","What","make","Andrea","most","intrigu",",","howev",",","are","his","thought","muse","on","mean","from","a","life","on","the","edg","-","a","willing","to","enter","mental","space","that","few","have","ever","experienc",".","In","Tempt","Fear",",","Sweden","'s","soft-spoken","Adventur","of","the","Year","explor","a","place","in","which","fear","overwhelm","all","emot",",","play","both","friend","and","enemi","in","a","pas","de","deux","where","death","lie","just","one","misstep","away","."],"lemmas":["Andreas","Fransson","have","be","call","the","boldest","extreme","skier","in","a","generation",".","over","the","past","three","year","he","have","log","first","descent","in","a","half-dozen","country",",","battle","back","to","life","from","a","accident","that","nearly","kill","he",",","and","become","the","most","talk","about","skier","in","the","epicenter","of","all","thing","extreme","-","Chamonix",",","France",".","what","make","Andreas","most","intriguing",",","however",",","be","he","thoughtful","musing","on","meaning","from","a","life","on","the","edge","-","a","willingness","to","enter","mental","space","that","few","have","ever","experience",".","in","tempting","fear",",","Sweden","'s","soft-spoken","adventurer","of","the","Year","explore","a","place","in","which","fear","overwhelm","all","emotion",",","play","both","friend","and","enemy","in","a","pas","de","deux","where","death","lie","just","one","misstep","away","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Andreas Fransson has","Fransson has been","has been called","been called the","called the boldest","the boldest extreme","boldest extreme skier","extreme skier in","skier in a","in a generation","Over the past","the past three","past three years","three years he","years he has","he has logged","has logged first","logged first descents","first descents in","descents in a","in a half-dozen","a half-dozen countries","half-dozen countries ,","countries , battled",", battled back","battled back to","back to life","to life from","life from an","from an accident","an accident that","accident that nearly","that nearly killed","nearly killed him","killed him ,","him , and",", and become","and become the","become the most","the most talked","most talked about","talked about skier","about skier in","skier in the","in the epicenter","the epicenter of","epicenter of all","of all things","all things extreme","things extreme -","extreme -

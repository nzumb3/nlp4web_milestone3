{"title":"Forgotten Flag Raisers","plot":"'Forgotten Flag Raisers' tells the story of filmmaker and historian Dustin Spence's quest to identify the heroes who first raised the American flag during the Battle of Iwo Jima in World War II. While the event itself has become one of the most iconic and powerful symbols in American History, to this day the US Marine Corps has not officially recognized the involvement of key participants. After decades of controversy, Spence's interviews and research provide the basis for the definitive account of who was there, pitting him against years of misinformation and the unwillingness of the military establishment to acknowledge the truth.","genres":["Documentary"," War","

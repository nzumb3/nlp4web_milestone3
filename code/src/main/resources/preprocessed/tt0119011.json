{"title":"Double Take","plot":"A writer witnesses a murder that may have been politically motivated involving Argentinian Nationals. After picking the man out of a line-up and persuasively testifying in court against him, the man is convicted. However, his girlfriend shows up and says the man is innocent and produces a picture of a young child which she says will be without a father. This leaves the writer with doubts and then when he sees another man who looks very much like the killer, he becomes more certain that he made a mistake. However, everything is not as it appears and the writer finds himself drawn into the murder and blackmail.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["A","writer","wit","a","murder","that","may","have","been","polit","motiv","involv","Argentinian","Nation",".","After","pick","the","man","out","of","a","line-up","and","persuas","testifi","in","court","against","him",",","the","man","is","convict",".","Howev",",","his","girlfriend","show","up","and","say","the","man","is","innoc","and","produc","a","pictur","of","a","young","child","which","she","say","will","be","without","a","father",".","This","leav","the","writer","with","doubt","and","then","when","he","see","anoth","man","who","look","veri","much","like","the","killer",",","he","becom","more","certain","that","he","made","a","mistak",".","Howev",",","everyth","is","not","as","it","appear","and","the","writer","find","himself","drawn","into","the","murder","and","blackmail","."],"lemmas":["a","writer","witness","a","murder","that","may","have","be","politically","motivate","involve","argentinian","national",".","after","pick","the","man","out","of","a","line-up","and","persuasively","testify","in","court","against","he",",","the","man","be","convict",".","however",",","he","girlfriend","show","up","and","say","the","man","be","innocent","and","produce","a","picture","of","a","young","child","which","she","say","will","be","without","a","father",".","this","leave","the","writer","with","doubt","and","then","when","he","see","another","man","who","look","very","much","like","the","killer",",","he","become","more","certain","that","he","make","a","mistake",".","however",",","everything","be","not","as","it","appear","and","the","writer","find","himself","draw","into","the","murder","and","blackmail","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A

{"title":"Pok√©mon: Arceus and the Jewel of Life","plot":"Long ago, Arceus granted a fragment of its power as the Jewel of Life to help Michina in the town's hour of need, only to be betrayed when it was time for that power to be returned. After so many years, Arceus is about to return to reclaim its stolen power- enraged, vengeful, and seemingly unstoppable. Not even the combined might of Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina can stop Arceus from devastating all existence across the dimensions. But Ash and his companions, joining forces with their new friend Sheena, May have discovered the only way to redeem that ancient betrayal. Their journey will be both dangerous and uncertain: even if Ash and his friends can set an old wrong right again, will there be time to return the Jewel of Life before Arceus destroys everything and everyone they've ever known?","genres":["Action"," Animation"," Adventure"],"stems":["Long","ago",",","Arceus","grant","a","fragment","of","it","power","as","the","Jewel","of","Life","to","help","Michina","in","the","town","'s","hour","of","need",",","onli","to","be","betray","when","it","was","time","for","that","power","to","be","return",".","After","so","mani","year",",","Arceus","is","about","to","return","to","reclaim","it","stolen","power","-","enrag",",","veng",",","and","seem","unstopp",".","Not","even","the","combin","might","of","Dialga",",","Palkia",",","and","Giratina","can","stop","Arceus","from","devast","all","exist","across","the","dimens",".","But","Ash","and","his","companion",",","join","forc","with","their","new","friend","Sheena",",","May","have","discov","the","onli","way","to","redeem","that","ancient","betray",".","Their","journey","will","be","both","danger","and","uncertain",":","even","if","Ash","and","his","friend","can","set","an","old","wrong","right","again",",","will","there","be","time","to","return","the","Jewel","of","Life","befor","Arceus","destroy","everyth","and","everyon","they","ve","ever","known","?"],"lemmas":["long","ago",",","Arceus","grant","a","fragment","of","its","power","as","the","Jewel","of","Life","to","help","Michina","in","the","town","'s","hour","of","need",",","only","to","be","betray","when","it","be","time","for","that","power","to","be","return",".","after","so","many","year",",","Arceus","be","about","to","return","to","reclaim","its","stolen","power","-","enraged",",","vengeful",",","and","seemingly","unstoppable",".","not","even","the","combined","might","of","Dialga",",","Palkia",",","and","Giratina","can","stop","Arceus","from","devastate","all","existence","across","the","dimension",".","but","Ash","and","he","companion",",","join","force","with","they","new","friend","Sheena",",","May","have","discover","the","only","way","to","redeem","that","ancient","betrayal",".","they","journey","will","be","both","dangerous","and","uncertain",":","even","if","Ash","and","he","friend","can","set","a","old","wrong","right","again",",","will","there","be","time","to","return","the","Jewel","of","Life","before","Arceus","destroy","everything","and","everyone","they","have","ever","know","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Long ago ,","ago , Arceus",", Arceus granted","Arceus granted a","granted a fragment","a fragment of","fragment of its","of its power","its power as","power as the","as the Jewel","the Jewel of","Jewel of Life","of Life to","Life to help","to help Michina","help Michina in","Michina in the","in the town","the town 's","town 's hour","'s hour of","hour of need","of need ,","need , only",", only to","only to be","to be betrayed","be betrayed when","betrayed when it","when it was","it was time","was time for","time for that","for that power","that power to","power to be","to be returned","After so many","so many years","many years ,","years , Arceus",", Arceus is","Arceus is about","is about to","about to return","to return to","return to reclaim","to reclaim its","reclaim its stolen","its stolen power","stolen power -","power -

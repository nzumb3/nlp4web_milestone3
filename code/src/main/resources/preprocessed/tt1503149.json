{"title":"Oliver Sherman","plot":"Feeling lost and disconnected, with no family of his own, veteran Sherman Oliver sets out to the countryside in search of the soldier who saved him back in the war. That man, Franklin Page, has long since moved on - to a wife, two children, and a reliable job in a reliably safe and quiet rural town. Upon arriving, Sherman seems at first a harmless if awkward shell of a man. But as he inserts himself further into the Pages' life, he reveals himself to be an angry, unstable individual prone to great jealousy and deep resentment. The stability Franklin worked so hard to establish is soon threatened, and the violence he believed he'd left behind in the war begins to re-emerge and cloud over both the household and the town itself.","genres":["Drama"," War"," Thriller"],"stems":["Feel","lost","and","disconnect",",","with","no","famili","of","his","own",",","veteran","Sherman","Oliver","set","out","to","the","countrysid","in","search","of","the","soldier","who","save","him","back","in","the","war",".","That","man",",","Franklin","Page",",","has","long","sinc","move","on","-","to","a","wife",",","two","children",",","and","a","reliabl","job","in","a","reliabl","safe","and","quiet","rural","town",".","Upon","arriv",",","Sherman","seem","at","first","a","harmless","if","awkward","shell","of","a","man",".","But","as","he","insert","himself","further","into","the","Page","'","life",",","he","reveal","himself","to","be","an","angri",",","unstabl","individu","prone","to","great","jealousi","and","deep","resent",".","The","stabil","Franklin","work","so","hard","to","establish","is","soon","threaten",",","and","the","violenc","he","believ","he","'d","left","behind","in","the","war","begin","to","re-emerg","and","cloud","over","both","the","household","and","the","town","itself","."],"lemmas":["feel","lose","and","disconnect",",","with","no","family","of","he","own",",","veteran","Sherman","Oliver","set","out","to","the","countryside","in","search","of","the","soldier","who","save","he","back","in","the","war",".","that","man",",","Franklin","Page",",","have","long","since","move","on","-","to","a","wife",",","two","child",",","and","a","reliable","job","in","a","reliably","safe","and","quiet","rural","town",".","upon","arrive",",","Sherman","seem","at","first","a","harmless","if","awkward","shell","of","a","man",".","but","as","he","insert","himself","further","into","the","Pages","'","life",",","he","reveal","himself","to","be","a","angry",",","unstable","individual","prone","to","great","jealousy","and","deep","resentment",".","the","stability","Franklin","work","so","hard","to","establish","be","soon","threaten",",","and","the","violence","he","believe","he","have","leave","behind","in","the","war","begin","to","re-emerge","and","cloud","over","both","the","household","and","the","town","itself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Feeling lost and","lost and disconnected","and disconnected ,","disconnected , with",", with no","with no family","no family of","family of his","of his own","his own ,","own , veteran",", veteran Sherman","veteran Sherman Oliver","Sherman Oliver sets","Oliver sets out","sets out to","out to the","to the countryside","the countryside in","countryside in search","in search of","search of the","of the soldier","the soldier who","soldier who saved","who saved him","saved him back","him back in","back in the","in the war","That man ,","man , Franklin",", Franklin Page","Franklin Page ,","Page , has",", has long","has long since","long since moved","since moved on","moved on -","on -

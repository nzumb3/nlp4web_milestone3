{"title":"97% Owned","plot":"97% owned present serious research and verifiable evidence on our economic and financial system. This is the first documentary to tackle this issue from a UK-perspective and explains the inner workings of Central Banks and the Money creation process. When money drives almost all activity on the planet, it's essential that we understand it. Yet simple questions often get overlooked, questions like; where does money come from? Who creates it? Who decides how it gets used? And what does this mean for the millions of ordinary people who suffer when the monetary, and financial system, breaks down? Produced by Queuepolitely and featuring Ben Dyson of Positive Money, Josh Ryan-Collins of The New Economics Foundation, Ann Pettifor, the \"HBOS Whistleblower\" Paul Moore, Simon Dixon of Bank to the Future and Nick Dearden from the Jubliee Debt Campaign.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["97","%","own","present","serious","research","and","verifi","evid","on","our","econom","and","financi","system",".","This","is","the","first","documentari","to","tackl","this","issu","from","a","UK-perspect","and","explain","the","inner","work","of","Central","Bank","and","the","Money","creation","process",".","When","money","drive","almost","all","activ","on","the","planet",",","it","'s","essenti","that","we","understand","it",".","Yet","simpl","question","often","get","overlook",",","question","like",";","where","doe","money","come","from","?","Who","creat","it","?","Who","decid","how","it","get","use","?","And","what","doe","this","mean","for","the","million","of","ordinari","peopl","who","suffer","when","the","monetari",",","and","financi","system",",","break","down","?","Produc","by","Queuepolit","and","featur","Ben","Dyson","of","Posit","Money",",","Josh","Ryan-Collin","of","The","New","Econom","Foundat",",","Ann","Pettifor",",","the","\"","HBOS","Whistleblow","\"","Paul","Moor",",","Simon","Dixon","of","Bank","to","the","Futur","and","Nick","Dearden","from","the","Jublie","Debt","Campaign","."],"lemmas":["97","%","own","present","serious","research","and","verifiable","evidence","on","we","economic","and","financial","system",".","this","be","the","first","documentary","to","tackle","this","issue","from","a","uk-perspective","and","explain","the","inner","workings","of","Central","Banks","and","the","Money","creation","process",".","when","money","drive","almost","all","activity","on","the","planet",",","it","be","essential","that","we","understand","it",".","yet","simple","question","often","get","overlook",",","question","like",";","where","do","money","come","from","?","who","create","it","?","who","decide","how","it","get","use","?","and","what","do","this","mean","for","the","million","of","ordinary","people","who","suffer","when","the","monetary",",","and","financial","system",",","break","down","?","produce","by","Queuepolitely","and","feature","Ben","Dyson","of","positive","money",",","Josh","Ryan-Collins","of","the","New","Economics","Foundation",",","Ann","Pettifor",",","the","``","HBOS","Whistleblower","''","Paul","Moore",",","Simon","Dixon","of","Bank","to","the","Future","and","Nick","Dearden","from","the","Jubliee","Debt","Campaign","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["97 % owned","% owned present","owned present serious","present serious research","serious research and","research and verifiable","and verifiable evidence","verifiable evidence on","evidence on our","on our economic","our economic and","economic and financial","and financial system","This is the","is the first","the first documentary","first documentary to","documentary to tackle","to tackle this","tackle this issue","this issue from","issue from a","from a UK-perspective","a UK-perspective and","UK-perspective and explains","and explains the","explains the inner","the inner workings","inner workings of","workings of Central","of Central Banks","Central Banks and","Banks and the","and the Money","the Money creation","Money creation process","When money drives","money drives almost","drives almost all","almost all activity","all activity on","activity on the","on the planet","the planet ,","planet , it",", it 's","it 's essential","'s essential that","essential that we","that we understand","we understand it","Yet simple questions","simple questions often","questions often get","often get overlooked","get overlooked ,","overlooked , questions",", questions like","questions like ;","like ;

{"title":"Lexicon Devil","plot":"Lexicon Devil tells the story of one of Los Angeles' seminal punk bands: The Germs, and their iconic singer Darby Crash. The Germs did not single handedly created a West Coast Punk sound or that they never progressed past smeared peanut butter and noisy sets, but they surely claimed their stake in the punk rock history. Lexicon Devil is an oral history of a time just past glitter and right before hardcore, of a place where for the first time, a generation of kids stood up to take what they believed they were owed a stage and an audience.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Lexicon","Devil","tell","the","stori","of","one","of","Los","Angele","'","semin","punk","band",":","The","Germ",",","and","their","icon","singer","Darbi","Crash",".","The","Germ","did","not","singl","hand","creat","a","West","Coast","Punk","sound","or","that","they","never","progress","past","smear","peanut","butter","and","noisi","set",",","but","they","sure","claim","their","stake","in","the","punk","rock","histori",".","Lexicon","Devil","is","an","oral","histori","of","a","time","just","past","glitter","and","right","befor","hardcor",",","of","a","place","where","for","the","first","time",",","a","generat","of","kid","stood","up","to","take","what","they","believ","they","were","owe","a","stage","and","an","audienc","."],"lemmas":["Lexicon","Devil","tell","the","story","of","one","of","Los","Angeles","'","seminal","punk","band",":","the","germ",",","and","they","iconic","singer","Darby","Crash",".","the","Germs","do","not","single","handedly","create","a","West","Coast","Punk","sound","or","that","they","never","progress","past","smear","peanut","butter","and","noisy","set",",","but","they","surely","claim","they","stake","in","the","punk","rock","history",".","Lexicon","Devil","be","a","oral","history","of","a","time","just","past","glitter","and","right","before","hardcore",",","of","a","place","where","for","the","first","time",",","a","generation","of","kid","stand","up","to","take","what","they","believe","they","be","owe","a","stage","and","a","audience","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lexicon Devil tells","Devil tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of one","of one of","one of Los","of Los Angeles","Los Angeles '","Angeles ' seminal","' seminal punk","seminal punk bands","punk bands :","bands : The",": The Germs","The Germs ,","Germs , and",", and their","and their iconic","their iconic singer","iconic singer Darby","singer Darby Crash","The Germs did","Germs did not","did not single","not single handedly","single handedly created","handedly created a","created a West","a West Coast","West Coast Punk","Coast Punk sound","Punk sound or","sound or that","or that they","that they never","they never progressed","never progressed past","progressed past smeared","past smeared peanut","smeared peanut butter","peanut butter and","butter and noisy","and noisy sets","noisy sets ,","sets , but",", but they","but they surely","they surely claimed","surely claimed their","claimed their stake","their stake in","stake in the","in the punk","the punk rock","punk rock history","Lexicon Devil is","Devil is an","is an oral","an oral history","oral history of","history of a","of a time","a time just","time just past","just past glitter","past glitter and","glitter and right","and right before","right before hardcore","before hardcore ,","hardcore , of",", of a","of a place","a place where","place where for","where for the","for the first","the first time","first time ,","time , a",", a generation","a generation of","generation of kids","of kids stood","kids stood up","stood up to","up to take","to take what","take what they","what they believed","they believed they","believed they were","they were owed","were owed a","owed a stage","a stage and","stage and an","and an audience"],"2grams":["Lexicon Devil","Devil tells","tells the","the story","story of","of one","one of","of Los","Los Angeles","Angeles '","' seminal","seminal punk","punk bands","bands :",": The","The Germs","Germs ,",", and","and their","their iconic","iconic singer","singer Darby","Darby Crash","The Germs","Germs did","did not","not single","single handedly","handedly created","created a","a West","West Coast","Coast Punk","Punk sound","sound or","or that","that they","they never","never progressed","progressed past","past smeared","smeared peanut","peanut butter","butter and","and noisy","noisy sets","sets ,",", but","but they","they surely","surely claimed","claimed their","their stake","stake in","in the","the punk","punk rock","rock history","Lexicon Devil","Devil is","is an","an oral","oral history","history of","of a","a time","time just","just past","past glitter","glitter and","and right","right before","before hardcore","hardcore ,",", of","of a","a place","place where","where for","for the","the first","first time","time ,",", a","a generation","generation of","of kids","kids stood","stood up","up to","to take","take what","what they","they believed","believed they","they were","were owed","owed a","a stage","stage and","and an","an audience"]}

{"title":"Sons of the Sand: The Strini Moodley Interview","plot":"This documentary traces the Strini Moodley story, from early childhood through an interview with family, onto his own experiences as a student activist and playwright. He was banned and then arrested with 13 others, tried under Section 6 of the notorious Terrorism Act and incarcerated on Robben Island in 1976. Sons of the Sand - The Strini Moodley Interview is his last known filmed interview, some of which takes place with Moodley revisiting Robben Island, recalling the continuous battles members of the black consciousness movement waged against the prison administration. Intercut with reminiscing from comrades and family, he is remembered as someone who fought for liberation and a democratic country.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","trace","the","Strini","Moodley","stori",",","from","earli","childhood","through","an","interview","with","famili",",","onto","his","own","experi","as","a","student","activist","and","playwright",".","He","was","ban","and","then","arrest","with","13","other",",","tri","under","Section","6","of","the","notori","Terror","Act","and","incarcer","on","Robben","Island","in","1976",".","Son","of","the","Sand","-","The","Strini","Moodley","Interview","is","his","last","known","film","interview",",","some","of","which","take","place","with","Moodley","revisit","Robben","Island",",","recal","the","continu","battl","member","of","the","black","conscious","movement","wage","against","the","prison","administr",".","Intercut","with","reminisc","from","comrad","and","famili",",","he","is","rememb","as","someon","who","fought","for","liber","and","a","democrat","countri","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","trace","the","Strini","Moodley","story",",","from","early","childhood","through","a","interview","with","family",",","onto","he","own","experience","as","a","student","activist","and","playwright",".","he","be","ban","and","then","arrest","with","13","other",",","try","under","section","6","of","the","notorious","Terrorism","Act","and","incarcerate","on","Robben","Island","in","1976",".","son","of","the","sand","-","the","Strini","Moodley","Interview","be","he","last","known","film","interview",",","some","of","which","take","place","with","Moodley","revisit","Robben","Island",",","recall","the","continuous","battle","member","of","the","black","consciousness","movement","wage","against","the","prison","administration",".","intercut","with","reminisce","from","comrade","and","family",",","he","be","remember","as","someone","who","fight","for","liberation","and","a","democratic","country","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary traces","documentary traces the","traces the Strini","the Strini Moodley","Strini Moodley story","Moodley story ,","story , from",", from early","from early childhood","early childhood through","childhood through an","through an interview","an interview with","interview with family","with family ,","family , onto",", onto his","onto his own","his own experiences","own experiences as","experiences as a","as a student","a student activist","student activist and","activist and playwright","He was banned","was banned and","banned and then","and then arrested","then arrested with","arrested with 13","with 13 others","13 others ,","others , tried",", tried under","tried under Section","under Section 6","Section 6 of","6 of the","of the notorious","the notorious Terrorism","notorious Terrorism Act","Terrorism Act and","Act and incarcerated","and incarcerated on","incarcerated on Robben","on Robben Island","Robben Island in","Island in 1976","Sons of the","of the Sand","the Sand -","Sand -

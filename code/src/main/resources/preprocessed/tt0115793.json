However, they will find more than expected: namely, Ombasi and Yambo, two illegal African immigrants, apparently thrown back to the ocean from where they came, in search of a better life in Spain. The sun sets, and the evening, night and morning which follow see other bizarre characters entering the scene, before the Africans' and the other characters' fates are finally decided.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Antonio",",","a","taxi","driver",",","his","wife",",","and","two","chidren","arriv","one","fine","afternoon","at","a","solitari","beach",",","look","for","sea-shel",".","Howev",",","they","will","find","more","than","expect",":","name",",","Ombasi","and","Yambo",",","two","illeg","African","immigr",",","appar","thrown","back","to","the","ocean","from","where","they","came",",","in","search","of","a","better","life","in","Spain",".","The","sun","set",",","and","the","even",",","night","and","morn","which","follow","see","other","bizarr","charact","enter","the","scene",",","befor","the","African","'","and","the","other","charact","'","fate","are","final","decid","."],"lemmas":["Antonio",",","a","taxi","driver",",","he","wife",",","and","two","chidren","arrive","one","fine","afternoon","at","a","solitary","beach",",","look","for","sea-shell",".","however",",","they","will","find","more","than","expect",":","namely",",","Ombasi","and","Yambo",",","two","illegal","african","immigrant",",","apparently","throw","back","to","the","ocean","from","where","they","come",",","in","search","of","a","better","life","in","Spain",".","the","sun","set",",","and","the","evening",",","night","and","morning","which","follow","see","other","bizarre","character","enter","the","scene",",","before","the","Africans","'","and","the","other","character","'","fate","be","finally","decide","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Antonio , a",", a taxi","a taxi driver","taxi driver ,","driver , his",", his wife","his wife ,","wife , and",", and two","and two chidren","two chidren arrive","chidren arrive one","arrive one fine","one fine afternoon","fine afternoon at","afternoon at a","at a solitary","a solitary beach","solitary beach ,","beach , looking",", looking for","looking for sea-shells","However , they",", they will","they will find","will find more","find more than","more than expected","than expected :","expected : namely",": namely ,","namely , Ombasi",", Ombasi and","Ombasi and Yambo","and Yambo ,","Yambo , two",", two illegal","two illegal African","illegal African immigrants","African immigrants ,","immigrants , apparently",", apparently thrown","apparently thrown back","thrown back to","back to the","to the ocean","the ocean from","ocean from where","from where they","where they came","they came ,","came , in",", in search","in search of","search of a","of a better","a better life","better life in","life in Spain","The sun sets","sun sets ,","sets , and",", and the","and the evening","the evening ,","evening , night",", night and","night and morning","and morning which","morning which follow","which follow see","follow see other","see other bizarre","other bizarre characters","bizarre characters entering","characters entering the","entering the scene","the scene ,","scene , before",", before the","before the Africans","the Africans '","Africans ' and","' and the","and the other","the other characters","other characters '","characters ' fates","' fates are","fates are finally","are finally decided"],"2grams":["Antonio ,",", a","a taxi","taxi driver","driver ,",", his","his wife","wife ,",", and","and two","two chidren","chidren arrive","arrive one","one fine","fine afternoon","afternoon at","at a","a solitary","solitary beach","beach ,",", looking","looking for","for sea-shells","However ,",", they","they will","will find","find more","more than","than expected","expected :",": namely","namely ,",", Ombasi","Ombasi and","and Yambo","Yambo ,",", two","two illegal","illegal African","African immigrants","immigrants ,",", apparently","apparently thrown","thrown back","back to","to the","the ocean","ocean from","from where","where they","they came","came ,",", in","in search","search of","of a","a better","better life","life in","in Spain","The sun","sun sets","sets ,",", and","and the","the evening","evening ,",", night","night and","and morning","morning which","which follow","follow see","see other","other bizarre","bizarre characters","characters entering","entering the","the scene","scene ,",", before","before the","the Africans","Africans '","' and","and the","the other","other characters","characters '","' fates","fates are","are finally","finally decided"]}

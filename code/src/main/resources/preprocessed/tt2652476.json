{"title":"The Little Penguin Pororo's Racing Adventure","plot":"Curious little penguin Pororo and his friends accidentally cause an airplane to make an emergency landing in their home of Pororo Village. On the airplane are some turtles being shipped to Northpia to deliver ice sleds, or racing ice cars. Nevertheless, Pororo and his friends believe that the turtles are racers, and the turtles end up giving the gang at Pororo Village some lessons and passing on the championship spirit. In the end, Pororo and his friends follow the turtles to Northpia to participate in the race. Upon arriving at icily beautiful Northpia's race, Pororo and his friends wind up unlikely front-runners, ahead of the polar bears, and make it to the finals. However, a more complicated course awaits Pororo and his friends- as does their strongest adversary yet.","genres":["Animation"," Sport"," Family"],"stems":["Curious","littl","penguin","Pororo","and","his","friend","accident","caus","an","airplan","to","make","an","emerg","land","in","their","home","of","Pororo","Villag",".","On","the","airplan","are","some","turtl","be","ship","to","Northpia","to","deliv","ice","sled",",","or","race","ice","car",".","Nevertheless",",","Pororo","and","his","friend","believ","that","the","turtl","are","racer",",","and","the","turtl","end","up","give","the","gang","at","Pororo","Villag","some","lesson","and","pass","on","the","championship","spirit",".","In","the","end",",","Pororo","and","his","friend","follow","the","turtl","to","Northpia","to","particip","in","the","race",".","Upon","arriv","at","icili","beauti","Northpia","'s","race",",","Pororo","and","his","friend","wind","up","unlik","front-runn",",","ahead","of","the","polar","bear",",","and","make","it","to","the","final",".","Howev",",","a","more","complic","cours","await","Pororo","and","his","friend","-","as","doe","their","strongest","adversari","yet","."],"lemmas":["curious","little","penguin","pororo","and","he","friend","accidentally","cause","a","airplane","to","make","a","emergency","landing","in","they","home","of","Pororo","Village",".","on","the","airplane","be","some","turtle","be","ship","to","Northpia","to","deliver","ice","sled",",","or","race","ice","car",".","nevertheless",",","Pororo","and","he","friend","believe","that","the","turtle","be","racer",",","and","the","turtle","end","up","give","the","gang","at","Pororo","Village","some","lesson","and","pass","on","the","championship","spirit",".","in","the","end",",","Pororo","and","he","friend","follow","the","turtle","to","Northpia","to","participate","in","the","race",".","upon","arrive","at","icily","beautiful","Northpia","'s","race",",","Pororo","and","he","friend","wind","up","unlikely","front-runner",",","ahead","of","the","polar","bear",",","and","make","it","to","the","final",".","however",",","a","more","complicated","course","await","Pororo","and","he","friend","-","as","do","they","strongest","adversary","yet","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Curious little penguin","little penguin Pororo","penguin Pororo and","Pororo and his","and his friends","his friends accidentally","friends accidentally cause","accidentally cause an","cause an airplane","an airplane to","airplane to make","to make an","make an emergency","an emergency landing","emergency landing in","landing in their","in their home","their home of","home of Pororo","of Pororo Village","On the airplane","the airplane are","airplane are some","are some turtles","some turtles being","turtles being shipped","being shipped to","shipped to Northpia","to Northpia to","Northpia to deliver","to deliver ice","deliver ice sleds","ice sleds ,","sleds , or",", or racing","or racing ice","racing ice cars","Nevertheless , Pororo",", Pororo and","Pororo and his","and his friends","his friends believe","friends believe that","believe that the","that the turtles","the turtles are","turtles are racers","are racers ,","racers , and",", and the","and the turtles","the turtles end","turtles end up","end up giving","up giving the","giving the gang","the gang at","gang at Pororo","at Pororo Village","Pororo Village some","Village some lessons","some lessons and","lessons and passing","and passing on","passing on the","on the championship","the championship spirit","In the end","the end ,","end , Pororo",", Pororo and","Pororo and his","and his friends","his friends follow","friends follow the","follow the turtles","the turtles to","turtles to Northpia","to Northpia to","Northpia to participate","to participate in","participate in the","in the race","Upon arriving at","arriving at icily","at icily beautiful","icily beautiful Northpia","beautiful Northpia 's","Northpia 's race","'s race ,","race , Pororo",", Pororo and","Pororo and his","and his friends","his friends wind","friends wind up","wind up unlikely","up unlikely front-runners","unlikely front-runners ,","front-runners , ahead",", ahead of","ahead of the","of the polar","the polar bears","polar bears ,","bears , and",", and make","and make it","make it to","it to the","to the finals","However , a",", a more","a more complicated","more complicated course","complicated course awaits","course awaits Pororo","awaits Pororo and","Pororo and his","and his friends","his friends -","friends -

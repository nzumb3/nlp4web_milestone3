{"title":"AniMen: Triton Force","plot":"Over time, the people residing on Swampland began to take on new forms, their modified DNA altering their physiology to better suit their new environment. Generations passed and their original forms were forgotten; these humans had evolved into a new race: the Frogmen.If history (and genetics for that matter) shows us anything, it is that there is always variety.The genetic \"success\" of the Frogmen was also mirrored by the \"achievements\" of another group of human descent: the Cockroaches, otherwise known as the T-zhu Alliance. The brutal T-Hy poured out into the galaxy seeking new territories, resources, and the data crystals left by the original human explorers. The T-Hy's material driven hunger broke the peaceful lives of the Frogmen forcing them to take up arms in order to stop the T-Hy's insatiable ambitions. So began the MALO war.","genres":["Adventure"," Sci-Fi"," Animation"],"stems":["Over","time",",","the","peopl","resid","on","Swampland","began","to","take","on","new","form",",","their","modifi","DNA","alter","their","physiolog","to","better","suit","their","new","environ",".","Gener","pass","and","their","origin","form","were","forgotten",";","these","human","had","evolv","into","a","new","race",":","the","Frogmen.If","histori","(","and","genet","for","that","matter",")","show","us","anyth",",","it","is","that","there","is","alway","variety.Th","genet","\"","success","\"","of","the","Frogmen","was","also","mirror","by","the","\"","achiev","\"","of","anoth","group","of","human","descent",":","the","Cockroach",",","otherwis","known","as","the","T-zhu","Allianc",".","The","brutal","T-Hi","pour","out","into","the","galaxi","seek","new","territori",",","resourc",",","and","the","data","crystal","left","by","the","origin","human","explor",".","The","T-Hi","'s","materi","driven","hunger","broke","the","peac","live","of","the","Frogmen","forc","them","to","take","up","arm","in","order","to","stop","the","T-Hi","'s","insati","ambit",".","So","began","the","MALO","war","."],"lemmas":["over","time",",","the","people","reside","on","Swampland","begin","to","take","on","new","form",",","they","modify","dna","alter","they","physiology","to","better","suit","they","new","environment",".","generation","pass","and","they","original","form","be","forget",";","these","human","have","evolve","into","a","new","race",":","the","frogmen.if","history","-lrb-","and","genetics","for","that","matter","-rrb-","show","we","anything",",","it","be","that","there","be","always","variety.the","genetic","``","success","''","of","the","Frogmen","be","also","mirror","by","the","``","achievement","''","of","another","group","of","human","descent",":","the","Cockroaches",",","otherwise","know","as","the","T-zhu","Alliance",".","the","brutal","t-hy","pour","out","into","the","galaxy","seek","new","territory",",","resource",",","and","the","datum","crystal","leave","by","the","original","human","explorer",".","the","t-hy","'s","material","driven","hunger","break","the","peaceful","life","of","the","Frogmen","force","they","to","take","up","arm","in","order","to","stop","the","t-hy","'s","insatiable","ambition",".","so","begin","the","MALO","war","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Over time ,","time , the",", the people","the people residing","people residing on","residing on Swampland","on Swampland began","Swampland began to","began to take","to take on","take on new","on new forms","new forms ,","forms , their",", their modified","their modified DNA","modified DNA altering","DNA altering their","altering their physiology","their physiology to","physiology to better","to better suit","better suit their","suit their new","their new environment","Generations passed and","passed and their","and their original","their original forms","original forms were","forms were forgotten","were forgotten ;","forgotten ;

{"title":"In the Name of the Brother","plot":"My younger brother Mustapha disappeared for almost one year. He cut any contact with us, his family. We lived then in fear and distress. One evening, after his long absence, my mother received a phone call. He had settled down in the Madrasa Nahlia, a Koranic school of religious teaching in the mountains, 90 km from Marrakesh. We went to meet him, my mother and I. Through a monologue in the form of a letter, from me to my brother, I will tell our story, evoking his absence whilst capturing childhood memories. I will listen to him and observe the simplicity, austerity and serenity of the Madrasa Nahlia.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["My","younger","brother","Mustapha","disappear","for","almost","one","year",".","He","cut","ani","contact","with","us",",","his","famili",".","We","live","then","in","fear","and","distress",".","One","even",",","after","his","long","absenc",",","my","mother","receiv","a","phone","call",".","He","had","settl","down","in","the","Madrasa","Nahlia",",","a","Koran","school","of","religi","teach","in","the","mountain",",","90","km","from","Marrakesh",".","We","went","to","meet","him",",","my","mother","and","I.","Through","a","monologu","in","the","form","of","a","letter",",","from","me","to","my","brother",",","I","will","tell","our","stori",",","evok","his","absenc","whilst","captur","childhood","memori",".","I","will","listen","to","him","and","observ","the","simplic",",","auster","and","seren","of","the","Madrasa","Nahlia","."],"lemmas":["my","younger","brother","Mustapha","disappear","for","almost","one","year",".","he","cut","any","contact","with","we",",","he","family",".","we","live","then","in","fear","and","distress",".","one","evening",",","after","he","long","absence",",","my","mother","receive","a","phone","call",".","he","have","settle","down","in","the","Madrasa","Nahlia",",","a","koranic","school","of","religious","teaching","in","the","mountain",",","90","km","from","Marrakesh",".","we","go","to","meet","he",",","my","mother","and","i.","through","a","monologue","in","the","form","of","a","letter",",","from","I","to","my","brother",",","I","will","tell","we","story",",","evoke","he","absence","whilst","capture","childhood","memory",".","I","will","listen","to","he","and","observe","the","simplicity",",","austerity","and","serenity","of","the","Madrasa","Nahlia","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["My younger brother","younger brother Mustapha","brother Mustapha disappeared","Mustapha disappeared for","disappeared for almost","for almost one","almost one year","He cut any","cut any contact","any contact with","contact with us","with us ,","us , his",", his family","We lived then","lived then in","then in fear","in fear and","fear and distress","One evening ,","evening , after",", after his","after his long","his long absence","long absence ,","absence , my",", my mother","my mother received","mother received a","received a phone","a phone call","He had settled","had settled down","settled down in","down in the","in the Madrasa","the Madrasa Nahlia","Madrasa Nahlia ,","Nahlia , a",", a Koranic","a Koranic school","Koranic school of","school of religious","of religious teaching","religious teaching in","teaching in the","in the mountains","the mountains ,","mountains , 90",", 90 km","90 km from","km from Marrakesh","We went to","went to meet","to meet him","meet him ,","him , my",", my mother","my mother and","mother and I.","and I.

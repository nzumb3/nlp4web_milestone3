{"title":"Very Mean Men","plot":"A bartender wants rid of an obnoxious drunk but not until the drunk has left a decent tip. So the bartender tells the story of two mobster families, the Minettis who work out of an Italian restaurant in the East San Fernando Valley, and the Mulroneys who work out of an Irish pub in the West San Fernando Valley. Mob war breaks out when one of the Minetti \"boys\" stiffs Big Paddy's daughter on her tip. We soon see why these hoods are called very mean men.","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["A","bartend","want","rid","of","an","obnoxi","drunk","but","not","until","the","drunk","has","left","a","decent","tip",".","So","the","bartend","tell","the","stori","of","two","mobster","famili",",","the","Minetti","who","work","out","of","an","Italian","restaur","in","the","East","San","Fernando","Valley",",","and","the","Mulroney","who","work","out","of","an","Irish","pub","in","the","West","San","Fernando","Valley",".","Mob","war","break","out","when","one","of","the","Minetti","\"","boy","\"","stiff","Big","Paddi","'s","daughter","on","her","tip",".","We","soon","see","whi","these","hood","are","call","veri","mean","men","."],"lemmas":["a","bartender","want","rid","of","a","obnoxious","drunk","but","not","until","the","drunk","have","leave","a","decent","tip",".","so","the","bartender","tell","the","story","of","two","mobster","family",",","the","Minettis","who","work","out","of","a","italian","restaurant","in","the","East","San","Fernando","Valley",",","and","the","Mulroneys","who","work","out","of","a","irish","pub","in","the","West","San","Fernando","Valley",".","mob","war","break","out","when","one","of","the","Minetti","``","boy","''","stiff","Big","Paddy","'s","daughter","on","she","tip",".","we","soon","see","why","these","hood","be","call","very","mean","man","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A bartender wants","bartender wants rid","wants rid of","rid of an","of an obnoxious","an obnoxious drunk","obnoxious drunk but","drunk but not","but not until","not until the","until the drunk","the drunk has","drunk has left","has left a","left a decent","a decent tip","So the bartender","the bartender tells","bartender tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of two","of two mobster","two mobster families","mobster families ,","families , the",", the Minettis","the Minettis who","Minettis who work","who work out","work out of","out of an","of an Italian","an Italian restaurant","Italian restaurant in","restaurant in the","in the East","the East San","East San Fernando","San Fernando Valley","Fernando Valley ,","Valley , and",", and the","and the Mulroneys","the Mulroneys who","Mulroneys who work","who work out","work out of","out of an","of an Irish","an Irish pub","Irish pub in","pub in the","in the West","the West San","West San Fernando","San Fernando Valley","Mob war breaks","war breaks out","breaks out when","out when one","when one of","one of the","of the Minetti","the Minetti \"","Minetti \" boys","\" boys \"","boys \" stiffs","\" stiffs Big","stiffs Big Paddy","Big Paddy 's","Paddy 's daughter","'s daughter on","daughter on her","on her tip","We soon see","soon see why","see why these","why these hoods","these hoods are","hoods are called","are called very","called very mean","very mean men"],"2grams":["A bartender","bartender wants","wants rid","rid of","of an","an obnoxious","obnoxious drunk","drunk but","but not","not until","until the","the drunk","drunk has","has left","left a","a decent","decent tip","So the","the bartender","bartender tells","tells the","the story","story of","of two","two mobster","mobster families","families ,",", the","the Minettis","Minettis who","who work","work out","out of","of an","an Italian","Italian restaurant","restaurant in","in the","the East","East San","San Fernando","Fernando Valley","Valley ,",", and","and the","the Mulroneys","Mulroneys who","who work","work out","out of","of an","an Irish","Irish pub","pub in","in the","the West","West San","San Fernando","Fernando Valley","Mob war","war breaks","breaks out","out when","when one","one of","of the","the Minetti","Minetti \"","\" boys","boys \"","\" stiffs","stiffs Big","Big Paddy","Paddy 's","'s daughter","daughter on","on her","her tip","We soon","soon see","see why","why these","these hoods","hoods are","are called","called very","very mean","mean men"]}

{"title":"United States of Africa","plot":"The feature documentary United States of Africa follows African hip hop pioneer Didier Awadi as he crafts a new album that shines a light on black revolutionary leaders - from Kwame Nkrumah to Thomas Sankara, from Malcolm X to Cheikh Antah Diop-who fought for the dignity of the African people, and for an independent united Africa. On a sprawling musical journey that takes him to some 40 countries, Awadi meets hip hop artists Smokey (Burkina Faso), M-1 from Dead Prez (United States) and Zuluboy (South Africa). His travels spark deeper reflection on the power of music and the potential for real political transformation on the continent: For any change to happen in Africa, engagement must go beyond music, beyond hip hop . United States of Africa takes the viewer into the heart of Africa, painting a hopeful and compelling portrait of a continent whose politically aware youth is refusing to lie down and accept the role of victim. The film is a call for Africans of all generations to take a stand, and take control of their continent and their destiny.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","featur","documentari","Unite","State","of","Africa","follow","African","hip","hop","pioneer","Didier","Awadi","as","he","craft","a","new","album","that","shine","a","light","on","black","revolutionari","leader","-","from","Kwame","Nkrumah","to","Thoma","Sankara",",","from","Malcolm","X","to","Cheikh","Antah","Diop-who","fought","for","the","digniti","of","the","African","peopl",",","and","for","an","independ","unit","Africa",".","On","a","sprawl","music","journey","that","take","him","to","some","40","countri",",","Awadi","meet","hip","hop","artist","Smokey","(","Burkina","Faso",")",",","M-1","from","Dead","Prez","(","Unite","State",")","and","Zuluboy","(","South","Africa",")",".","His","travel","spark","deeper","reflect","on","the","power","of","music","and","the","potenti","for","real","polit","transform","on","the","contin",":","For","ani","chang","to","happen","in","Africa",",","engag","must","go","beyond","music",",","beyond","hip","hop",".","Unite","State","of","Africa","take","the","viewer","into","the","heart","of","Africa",",","paint","a","hope","and","compel","portrait","of","a","contin","whose","polit","awar","youth","is","refus","to","lie","down","and","accept","the","role","of","victim",".","The","film","is","a","call","for","African","of","all","generat","to","take","a","stand",",","and","take","control","of","their","contin","and","their","destini","."],"lemmas":["the","feature","documentary","United","States","of","Africa","follow","african","hip","hop","pioneer","Didier","Awadi","as","he","craft","a","new","album","that","shine","a","light","on","black","revolutionary","leader","-","from","Kwame","Nkrumah","to","Thomas","Sankara",",","from","Malcolm","X","to","Cheikh","Antah","Diop-who","fight","for","the","dignity","of","the","african","people",",","and","for","a","independent","united","Africa",".","on","a","sprawling","musical","journey","that","take","he","to","some","40","country",",","Awadi","meet","hip","hop","artist","Smokey","-lrb-","Burkina","Faso","-rrb-",",","m-1","from","Dead","Prez","-lrb-","United","States","-rrb-","and","Zuluboy","-lrb-","South","Africa","-rrb-",".","he","travels","spark","deeper","reflection","on","the","power","of","music","and","the","potential","for","real","political","transformation","on","the","continent",":","for","any","change","to","happen","in","Africa",",","engagement","must","go","beyond","music",",","beyond","hip","hop",".","United","States","of","Africa","take","the","viewer","into","the","heart","of","Africa",",","paint","a","hopeful","and","compelling","portrait","of","a","continent","whose","politically","aware","youth","be","refuse","to","lie","down","and","accept","the","role","of","victim",".","the","film","be","a","call","for","african","of","all","generation","to","take","a","stand",",","and","take","control","of","they","continent","and","they","destiny","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

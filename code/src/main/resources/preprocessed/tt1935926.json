{"title":"Tierra","plot":"Indians at risk of extinction because many are left to starve or commit mass suicide rather than abandon their land or their traditions, others are killed by unscrupulous settlers seeking gold in the forest. Those who survive, they see their culture overwhelmed from the intrusiveness of the whites that push young people to embrace indigenous customs and traditions very different from tradition. The Brazilian constitution has finally recognized their right to maintain their social organization, traditions and original rights of the lands they occupy.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["Indian","at","risk","of","extinct","becaus","mani","are","left","to","starv","or","commit","mass","suicid","rather","than","abandon","their","land","or","their","tradit",",","other","are","kill","by","unscrupul","settler","seek","gold","in","the","forest",".","Those","who","surviv",",","they","see","their","cultur","overwhelm","from","the","intrus","of","the","white","that","push","young","peopl","to","embrac","indigen","custom","and","tradit","veri","differ","from","tradit",".","The","Brazilian","constitut","has","final","recogn","their","right","to","maintain","their","social","organ",",","tradit","and","origin","right","of","the","land","they","occupi","."],"lemmas":["Indians","at","risk","of","extinction","because","many","be","leave","to","starve","or","commit","mass","suicide","rather","than","abandon","they","land","or","they","tradition",",","other","be","kill","by","unscrupulous","settler","seek","gold","in","the","forest",".","those","who","survive",",","they","see","they","culture","overwhelm","from","the","intrusiveness","of","the","whites","that","push","young","people","to","embrace","indigenous","custom","and","tradition","very","different","from","tradition",".","the","brazilian","constitution","have","finally","recognize","they","right","to","maintain","they","social","organization",",","tradition","and","original","rights","of","the","land","they","occupy","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Indians at risk","at risk of","risk of extinction","of extinction because","extinction because many","because many are","many are left","are left to","left to starve","to starve or","starve or commit","or commit mass","commit mass suicide","mass suicide rather","suicide rather than","rather than abandon","than abandon their","abandon their land","their land or","land or their","or their traditions","their traditions ,","traditions , others",", others are","others are killed","are killed by","killed by unscrupulous","by unscrupulous settlers","unscrupulous settlers seeking","settlers seeking gold","seeking gold in","gold in the","in the forest","Those who survive","who survive ,","survive , they",", they see","they see their","see their culture","their culture overwhelmed","culture overwhelmed from","overwhelmed from the","from the intrusiveness","the intrusiveness of","intrusiveness of the","of the whites","the whites that","whites that push","that push young","push young people","young people to","people to embrace","to embrace indigenous","embrace indigenous customs","indigenous customs and","customs and traditions","and traditions very","traditions very different","very different from","different from tradition","The Brazilian constitution","Brazilian constitution has","constitution has finally","has finally recognized","finally recognized their","recognized their right","their right to","right to maintain","to maintain their","maintain their social","their social organization","social organization ,","organization , traditions",", traditions and","traditions and original","and original rights","original rights of","rights of the","of the lands","the lands they","lands they occupy"],"2grams":["Indians at","at risk","risk of","of extinction","extinction because","because many","many are","are left","left to","to starve","starve or","or commit","commit mass","mass suicide","suicide rather","rather than","than abandon","abandon their","their land","land or","or their","their traditions","traditions ,",", others","others are","are killed","killed by","by unscrupulous","unscrupulous settlers","settlers seeking","seeking gold","gold in","in the","the forest","Those who","who survive","survive ,",", they","they see","see their","their culture","culture overwhelmed","overwhelmed from","from the","the intrusiveness","intrusiveness of","of the","the whites","whites that","that push","push young","young people","people to","to embrace","embrace indigenous","indigenous customs","customs and","and traditions","traditions very","very different","different from","from tradition","The Brazilian","Brazilian constitution","constitution has","has finally","finally recognized","recognized their","their right","right to","to maintain","maintain their","their social","social organization","organization ,",", traditions","traditions and","and original","original rights","rights of","of the","the lands","lands they","they occupy"]}

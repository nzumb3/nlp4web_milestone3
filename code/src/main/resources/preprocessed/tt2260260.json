{"title":"Re-enactors","plot":"Jed Hankley lives to relive. From civil war battles to old western shootouts, Jed stops at nothing to create the most 'historical' re-enactments. When Jed is offered his dream job, a temp tour-guide at the Milltown Pioneer Village, he must set aside his differences with his old rival, Douglas Marshall-Pickett, to create the most 'authentic' experience possible. But will Jed and Doug's hardcore re-enacting standards clash with the cushy lifestyle of the Pioneer Village campers? For Jed and Doug the summer has now become 1866; for the campers, it's become a living nightmare.","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Comedy"],"stems":["Jed","Hankley","live","to","reliv",".","From","civil","war","battl","to","old","western","shootout",",","Jed","stop","at","noth","to","creat","the","most","'","histor","'","re-enact",".","When","Jed","is","offer","his","dream","job",",","a","temp","tour-guid","at","the","Milltown","Pioneer","Villag",",","he","must","set","asid","his","differ","with","his","old","rival",",","Dougla","Marshall-Pickett",",","to","creat","the","most","'","authent","'","experi","possibl",".","But","will","Jed","and","Doug","'s","hardcor","re-enact","standard","clash","with","the","cushi","lifestyl","of","the","Pioneer","Villag","camper","?","For","Jed","and","Doug","the","summer","has","now","becom","1866",";","for","the","camper",",","it","'s","becom","a","live","nightmar","."],"lemmas":["Jed","Hankley","live","to","relive",".","from","civil","war","battle","to","old","western","shootout",",","Jed","stop","at","nothing","to","create","the","most","'","historical","'","re-enactment",".","when","Jed","be","offer","he","dream","job",",","a","temp","tour-guide","at","the","Milltown","Pioneer","Village",",","he","must","set","aside","he","difference","with","he","old","rival",",","Douglas","Marshall-Pickett",",","to","create","the","most","'","authentic","'","experience","possible",".","but","will","Jed","and","Doug","'s","hardcore","re-enact","standard","clash","with","the","cushy","lifestyle","of","the","Pioneer","Village","camper","?","for","Jed","and","Doug","the","summer","have","now","become","1866",";","for","the","camper",",","it","be","become","a","living","nightmare","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jed Hankley lives","Hankley lives to","lives to relive","From civil war","civil war battles","war battles to","battles to old","to old western","old western shootouts","western shootouts ,","shootouts , Jed",", Jed stops","Jed stops at","stops at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to create","to create the","create the most","the most '","most ' historical","' historical '","historical ' re-enactments","When Jed is","Jed is offered","is offered his","offered his dream","his dream job","dream job ,","job , a",", a temp","a temp tour-guide","temp tour-guide at","tour-guide at the","at the Milltown","the Milltown Pioneer","Milltown Pioneer Village","Pioneer Village ,","Village , he",", he must","he must set","must set aside","set aside his","aside his differences","his differences with","differences with his","with his old","his old rival","old rival ,","rival , Douglas",", Douglas Marshall-Pickett","Douglas Marshall-Pickett ,","Marshall-Pickett , to",", to create","to create the","create the most","the most '","most ' authentic","' authentic '","authentic ' experience","' experience possible","But will Jed","will Jed and","Jed and Doug","and Doug 's","Doug 's hardcore","'s hardcore re-enacting","hardcore re-enacting standards","re-enacting standards clash","standards clash with","clash with the","with the cushy","the cushy lifestyle","cushy lifestyle of","lifestyle of the","of the Pioneer","the Pioneer Village","Pioneer Village campers","For Jed and","Jed and Doug","and Doug the","Doug the summer","the summer has","summer has now","has now become","now become 1866","become 1866 ;","1866 ; for","; for the","for the campers","the campers ,","campers , it",", it 's","it 's become","'s become a","become a living","a living nightmare"],"2grams":["Jed Hankley","Hankley lives","lives to","to relive","From civil","civil war","war battles","battles to","to old","old western","western shootouts","shootouts ,",", Jed","Jed stops","stops at","at nothing","nothing to","to create","create the","the most","most '","' historical","historical '","' re-enactments","When Jed","Jed is","is offered","offered his","his dream","dream job","job ,",", a","a temp","temp tour-guide","tour-guide at","at the","the Milltown","Milltown Pioneer","Pioneer Village","Village ,",", he","he must","must set","set aside","aside his","his differences","differences with","with his","his old","old rival","rival ,",", Douglas","Douglas Marshall-Pickett","Marshall-Pickett ,",", to","to create","create the","the most","most '","' authentic","authentic '","' experience","experience possible","But will","will Jed","Jed and","and Doug","Doug 's","'s hardcore","hardcore re-enacting","re-enacting standards","standards clash","clash with","with the","the cushy","cushy lifestyle","lifestyle of","of the","the Pioneer","Pioneer Village","Village campers","For Jed","Jed and","and Doug","Doug the","the summer","summer has","has now","now become","become 1866","1866 ;","; for","for the","the campers","campers ,",", it","it 's","'s become","become a","a living","living nightmare"]}

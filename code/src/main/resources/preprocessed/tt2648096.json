{"title":"Status and Trends in Arctic Biodiversity","plot":"The Arctic has entered into a cycle of intensive pressure and change involving a new set of challenges and stressors with climate change at the forefront. The magnitude of change will exert major influences on biological dynamics in the Arctic. To meet these challenges, the Arctic Council Working Group on the Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF) set out to provide policymakers and conservation managers with the best available scientific and traditional knowledge on Arctic biodiversity. This video presentation will focus on highlighting the key issues that surfaced in this report.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["The","Arctic","has","enter","into","a","cycl","of","intens","pressur","and","chang","involv","a","new","set","of","challeng","and","stressor","with","climat","chang","at","the","forefront",".","The","magnitud","of","chang","will","exert","major","influenc","on","biolog","dynam","in","the","Arctic",".","To","meet","these","challeng",",","the","Arctic","Council","Work","Group","on","the","Conserv","of","Arctic","Flora","and","Fauna","(","CAFF",")","set","out","to","provid","policymak","and","conserv","manag","with","the","best","avail","scientif","and","tradit","knowledg","on","Arctic","biodivers",".","This","video","present","will","focus","on","highlight","the","key","issu","that","surfac","in","this","report","."],"lemmas":["the","Arctic","have","enter","into","a","cycle","of","intensive","pressure","and","change","involve","a","new","set","of","challenge","and","stressor","with","climate","change","at","the","forefront",".","the","magnitude","of","change","will","exert","major","influence","on","biological","dynamics","in","the","Arctic",".","to","meet","these","challenge",",","the","Arctic","Council","Working","Group","on","the","Conservation","of","Arctic","Flora","and","Fauna","-lrb-","CAFF","-rrb-","set","out","to","provide","policymaker","and","conservation","manager","with","the","best","available","scientific","and","traditional","knowledge","on","Arctic","biodiversity",".","this","video","presentation","will","focus","on","highlight","the","key","issue","that","surface","in","this","report","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Arctic has","Arctic has entered","has entered into","entered into a","into a cycle","a cycle of","cycle of intensive","of intensive pressure","intensive pressure and","pressure and change","and change involving","change involving a","involving a new","a new set","new set of","set of challenges","of challenges and","challenges and stressors","and stressors with","stressors with climate","with climate change","climate change at","change at the","at the forefront","The magnitude of","magnitude of change","of change will","change will exert","will exert major","exert major influences","major influences on","influences on biological","on biological dynamics","biological dynamics in","dynamics in the","in the Arctic","To meet these","meet these challenges","these challenges ,","challenges , the",", the Arctic","the Arctic Council","Arctic Council Working","Council Working Group","Working Group on","Group on the","on the Conservation","the Conservation of","Conservation of Arctic","of Arctic Flora","Arctic Flora and","Flora and Fauna","and Fauna (","Fauna ( CAFF","( CAFF )","CAFF ) set",") set out","set out to","out to provide","to provide policymakers","provide policymakers and","policymakers and conservation","and conservation managers","conservation managers with","managers with the","with the best","the best available","best available scientific","available scientific and","scientific and traditional","and traditional knowledge","traditional knowledge on","knowledge on Arctic","on Arctic biodiversity","This video presentation","video presentation will","presentation will focus","will focus on","focus on highlighting","on highlighting the","highlighting the key","the key issues","key issues that","issues that surfaced","that surfaced in","surfaced in this","in this report"],"2grams":["The Arctic","Arctic has","has entered","entered into","into a","a cycle","cycle of","of intensive","intensive pressure","pressure and","and change","change involving","involving a","a new","new set","set of","of challenges","challenges and","and stressors","stressors with","with climate","climate change","change at","at the","the forefront","The magnitude","magnitude of","of change","change will","will exert","exert major","major influences","influences on","on biological","biological dynamics","dynamics in","in the","the Arctic","To meet","meet these","these challenges","challenges ,",", the","the Arctic","Arctic Council","Council Working","Working Group","Group on","on the","the Conservation","Conservation of","of Arctic","Arctic Flora","Flora and","and Fauna","Fauna (","( CAFF","CAFF )",") set","set out","out to","to provide","provide policymakers","policymakers and","and conservation","conservation managers","managers with","with the","the best","best available","available scientific","scientific and","and traditional","traditional knowledge","knowledge on","on Arctic","Arctic biodiversity","This video","video presentation","presentation will","will focus","focus on","on highlighting","highlighting the","the key","key issues","issues that","that surfaced","surfaced in","in this","this report"]}

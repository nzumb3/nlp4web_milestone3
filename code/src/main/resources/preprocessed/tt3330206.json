{"title":"The Lost Generation","plot":"Heavily influenced by true events of occupy movements and protests across the world over the past 3 years, The Lost Generation portrays a very entertaining yet relevant depiction of our current media and society. We are invited to follow reality TV star SJ - the inspirational female lead, on an epic fight for survival in a dystopian presentation of our present-day world. The Lost Generation exists in a world governed by a corrupt media who have the police and government in their pocket. Able to scandalize the government through mass surveillance, the media creates propaganda on how to live a life - and leaves desperate civilians in its wake. But there is hope. They are called The Unknown.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Heavili","influenc","by","true","event","of","occupi","movement","and","protest","across","the","world","over","the","past","3","year",",","The","Lost","Gener","portray","a","veri","entertain","yet","relev","depict","of","our","current","media","and","societi",".","We","are","invit","to","follow","realiti","TV","star","SJ","-","the","inspir","femal","lead",",","on","an","epic","fight","for","surviv","in","a","dystopian","present","of","our","present-day","world",".","The","Lost","Gener","exist","in","a","world","govern","by","a","corrupt","media","who","have","the","polic","and","govern","in","their","pocket",".","Able","to","scandal","the","govern","through","mass","surveil",",","the","media","creat","propaganda","on","how","to","live","a","life","-","and","leav","desper","civilian","in","it","wake",".","But","there","is","hope",".","They","are","call","The","Unknown","."],"lemmas":["heavily","influence","by","true","event","of","occupy","movement","and","protest","across","the","world","over","the","past","3","year",",","the","Lost","Generation","portray","a","very","entertaining","yet","relevant","depiction","of","we","current","media","and","society",".","we","be","invite","to","follow","reality","tv","star","sj","-","the","inspirational","female","lead",",","on","a","epic","fight","for","survival","in","a","dystopian","presentation","of","we","present-day","world",".","the","Lost","Generation","exist","in","a","world","govern","by","a","corrupt","media","who","have","the","police","and","government","in","they","pocket",".","able","to","scandalize","the","government","through","mass","surveillance",",","the","media","create","propaganda","on","how","to","live","a","life","-","and","leave","desperate","civilian","in","its","wake",".","but","there","be","hope",".","they","be","call","the","unknown","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Heavily influenced by","influenced by true","by true events","true events of","events of occupy","of occupy movements","occupy movements and","movements and protests","and protests across","protests across the","across the world","the world over","world over the","over the past","the past 3","past 3 years","3 years ,","years , The",", The Lost","The Lost Generation","Lost Generation portrays","Generation portrays a","portrays a very","a very entertaining","very entertaining yet","entertaining yet relevant","yet relevant depiction","relevant depiction of","depiction of our","of our current","our current media","current media and","media and society","We are invited","are invited to","invited to follow","to follow reality","follow reality TV","reality TV star","TV star SJ","star SJ -","SJ -

{"title":"Departure","plot":"Police Officer Deana Kashul (Renata Rinyu) traverses the corridors of an abandoned warehouse, not realizing she's put herself in the line of fire of a desperate drug dealer. As the drug dealer raises his 9mm, for the perfect head shot-he's shot from behind by an unknown source, releases a few rounds himself at the unknown source. Deana snaps herself around to uncover the dead drug dealer , along with Glen Starks (Adi Spektor), lying on the floor, in agony. After Deana deduces the Glen Starks has saved her life, she asks for his identity, and why he was there, saving her life. Glen eventually reveals to her that he was hired to watch over her by a man named Andrei Novikov. He goes on to explain that Mr. Novikov, a diamond smuggler from Russia, met her father in France, while her father tried desperately to squeeze his way onto an overbooked flight, in hopes of making Deana's 16th birthday, the first birthday since the loss of her mother. Mr. Novikov was so taken by her father, Walter Kashul , that he gave her father his ticket to the states. The air liner crashes, killing all aboard, including Walter. The overwhelming guilt eating away at Andrei inspires him to forsake his criminal dealings, and to concentrate solely on the nurturing of young Deana, without the young lady ever being wise to it.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Polic","Officer","Deana","Kashul","(","Renata","Rinyu",")","travers","the","corridor","of","an","abandon","warehous",",","not","realiz","she","'s","put","herself","in","the","line","of","fire","of","a","desper","drug","dealer",".","As","the","drug","dealer","rais","his","9mm",",","for","the","perfect","head","shot-h","'s","shot","from","behind","by","an","unknown","sourc",",","releas","a","few","round","himself","at","the","unknown","sourc",".","Deana","snap","herself","around","to","uncov","the","dead","drug","dealer",",","along","with","Glen","Stark","(","Adi","Spektor",")",",","lie","on","the","floor",",","in","agoni",".","After","Deana","deduc","the","Glen","Stark","has","save","her","life",",","she","ask","for","his","ident",",","and","whi","he","was","there",",","save","her","life",".","Glen","eventu","reveal","to","her","that","he","was","hire","to","watch","over","her","by","a","man","name","Andrei","Novikov",".","He","goe","on","to","explain","that","Mr.","Novikov",",","a","diamond","smuggler","from","Russia",",","met","her","father","in","Franc",",","while","her","father","tri","desper","to","squeez","his","way","onto","an","overbook","flight",",","in","hope","of","make","Deana","'s","16th","birthday",",","the","first","birthday","sinc","the","loss","of","her","mother",".","Mr.","Novikov","was","so","taken","by","her","father",",","Walter","Kashul",",","that","he","gave","her","father","his","ticket","to","the","state",".","The","air","liner","crash",",","kill","all","aboard",",","includ","Walter",".","The","overwhelm","guilt","eat","away","at","Andrei","inspir","him","to","forsak","his","crimin","deal",",","and","to","concentr","sole","on","the","nurtur","of","young","Deana",",","without","the","young","ladi","ever","be","wise","to","it","."],"lemmas":["Police","Officer","Deana","Kashul","-lrb-","Renata","Rinyu","-rrb-","traverse","the","corridor","of","a","abandoned","warehouse",",","not","realize","she","be","put","herself","in","the","line","of","fire","of","a","desperate","drug","dealer",".","as","the","drug","dealer","raise","he","9mm",",","for","the","perfect","head","shot-he","'s","shot","from","behind","by","a","unknown","source",",","release","a","few","round","himself","at","the","unknown","source",".","Deana","snap","herself","around","to","uncover","the","dead","drug","dealer",",","along","with","Glen","Starks","-lrb-","Adi","Spektor","-rrb-",",","lie","on","the","floor",",","in","agony",".","after","Deana","deduce","the","Glen","Starks","have","save","she","life",",","she","ask","for","he","identity",",","and","why","he","be","there",",","save","she","life",".","Glen","eventually","reveal","to","she","that","he","be","hire","to","watch","over","she","by","a","man","name","Andrei","Novikov",".","he","go","on","to","explain","that","Mr.","Novikov",",","a","diamond","smuggler","from","Russia",",","meet","she","father","in","France",",","while","she","father","try","desperately","to","squeeze","he","way","onto","a","overbooked","flight",",","in","hope","of","make","Deana","'s","16th","birthday",",","the","first","birthday","since","the","loss","of","she","mother",".","Mr.","Novikov","be","so","take","by","she","father",",","Walter","Kashul",",","that","he","give","she","father","he","ticket","to","the","state",".","the","air","liner","crash",",","kill","all","aboard",",","include","Walter",".","the","overwhelming","guilt","eat","away","at","Andrei","inspire","he","to","forsake","he","criminal","dealings",",","and","to","concentrate","solely","on","the","nurturing","of","young","Deana",",","without","the","young","lady","ever","be","wise","to","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Police

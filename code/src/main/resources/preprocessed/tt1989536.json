{"title":"Interludes","plot":"Jake Morrison (Christopher Dorrah), a revered criminal psychiatrist, is giving his daily review of three of his patients to his unenthusiastic sergeant. The sessions revolve around a detective caught in a love triangle with his wife and mistress; a husband that falls in love with his wife's best friend (Chrystale Wilson); an overzealous boyfriend that becomes abusive to his girlfriend and a couple struggling to figure out if they really love each other. Through the session Jake begins to analyze his own marital status with his impassioned wife Sare' (Tahiry Jose) and how certain indiscretions could affect his life. \"Interludes\" is based on real life events and is told through the eyes of three incarcerated women as they detail the traumatic events from their love life. The film begins with a sense of loss, but on a deeper level, the film is about the complicated relationships we all have with the people we love. It's a thriller, and the premise is that we are all, from our first love to who we love now shaped from events that happen during the in- between (hence INTERLUDES). \"interludes\", features Clifton Powell (Ray, Next Friday), Chrystale Wilson (Players Club, Trois), Ray Lavender (Konvict Music) and Tahiry (King and Smooth Magazine) and is written and directed by Christopher Dorrah.","genres":["Drama","

{"title":"Football Gladiators","plot":"The most popular sports of the world (football, rugby and American football) come from Historical Florentine Football, a game played in Florence since 1530. Four teams made by 27 players each face each other every year in Piazza S. Croce, a jewel of Italian Renaissance that becomes an Infernal arena. It's like a Spanish bullfight, but between human beings. Bare-chested players fight in a no holds barred contest. The beauty of their bodies is ancient: it's like seeing Michelangelo's sculptures in the flesh. We experience the game from the inside, with 12 cameras plus a ultra light micro-camera fixed on the referee's temple. Knock outs, broken noses, cracked ribs, but also courage, passion and loyalty: all this is Football Gladiators.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","most","popular","sport","of","the","world","(","footbal",",","rugbi","and","American","footbal",")","come","from","Histor","Florentin","Footbal",",","a","game","play","in","Florenc","sinc","1530",".","Four","team","made","by","27","player","each","face","each","other","everi","year","in","Piazza","S.","Croce",",","a","jewel","of","Italian","Renaiss","that","becom","an","Infernal","arena",".","It","'s","like","a","Spanish","bullfight",",","but","between","human","be",".","Bare-chest","player","fight","in","a","no","hold","bar","contest",".","The","beauti","of","their","bodi","is","ancient",":","it","'s","like","see","Michelangelo","'s","sculptur","in","the","flesh",".","We","experi","the","game","from","the","insid",",","with","12","camera","plus","a","ultra","light","micro-camera","fix","on","the","refere","'s","templ",".","Knock","out",",","broken","nose",",","crack","rib",",","but","also","courag",",","passion","and","loyalti",":","all","this","is","Footbal","Gladiat","."],"lemmas":["the","most","popular","sport","of","the","world","-lrb-","football",",","rugby","and","american","football","-rrb-","come","from","historical","Florentine","Football",",","a","game","play","in","Florence","since","1530",".","four","team","make","by","27","player","each","face","each","other","every","year","in","Piazza","S.","Croce",",","a","jewel","of","Italian","Renaissance","that","become","a","infernal","arena",".","it","be","like","a","spanish","bullfight",",","but","between","human","being",".","bare-chested","player","fight","in","a","no","hold","bar","contest",".","the","beauty","of","they","body","be","ancient",":","it","be","like","see","Michelangelo","'s","sculpture","in","the","flesh",".","we","experience","the","game","from","the","inside",",","with","12","camera","plus","a","ultra","light","micro-camera","fix","on","the","referee","'s","temple",".","knock","out",",","broken","nose",",","crack","rib",",","but","also","courage",",","passion","and","loyalty",":","all","this","be","Football","Gladiators","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The most popular","most popular sports","popular sports of","sports of the","of the world","the world (","world ( football","( football ,","football , rugby",", rugby and","rugby and American","and American football","American football )","football ) come",") come from","come from Historical","from Historical Florentine","Historical Florentine Football","Florentine Football ,","Football , a",", a game","a game played","game played in","played in Florence","in Florence since","Florence since 1530","Four teams made","teams made by","made by 27","by 27 players","27 players each","players each face","each face each","face each other","each other every","other every year","every year in","year in Piazza","in Piazza S.","Piazza S.

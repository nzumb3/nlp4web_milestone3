{"title":"Abortion Democracy: Poland/South Africa","plot":"This documentary feature contrasts changes in Poland and South Africa regarding abortion laws and their impact on the lives of women. In the 90's, Poland banned abortion due to the increasing influence of the Catholic Church after the fall of communism; around the same time South Africa legalized it, reforming the health system after the fall of apartheid. The film also however, illustrates the paradox that the implementation of such laws may have little effect on the accessibility of abortion services: Illegal abortions are more accessible in Poland than legal ones in South Africa.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","featur","contrast","chang","in","Poland","and","South","Africa","regard","abort","law","and","their","impact","on","the","live","of","women",".","In","the","90","'s",",","Poland","ban","abort","due","to","the","increas","influenc","of","the","Cathol","Church","after","the","fall","of","communism",";","around","the","same","time","South","Africa","legal","it",",","reform","the","health","system","after","the","fall","of","apartheid",".","The","film","also","howev",",","illustr","the","paradox","that","the","implement","of","such","law","may","have","littl","effect","on","the","access","of","abort","servic",":","Illegal","abort","are","more","access","in","Poland","than","legal","one","in","South","Africa","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","feature","contrast","change","in","Poland","and","South","Africa","regard","abortion","law","and","they","impact","on","the","life","of","woman",".","in","the","90","'s",",","Poland","ban","abortion","due","to","the","increase","influence","of","the","Catholic","Church","after","the","fall","of","communism",";","around","the","same","time","South","Africa","legalize","it",",","reform","the","health","system","after","the","fall","of","apartheid",".","the","film","also","however",",","illustrate","the","paradox","that","the","implementation","of","such","law","may","have","little","effect","on","the","accessibility","of","abortion","service",":","illegal","abortion","be","more","accessible","in","Poland","than","legal","one","in","South","Africa","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary feature","documentary feature contrasts","feature contrasts changes","contrasts changes in","changes in Poland","in Poland and","Poland and South","and South Africa","South Africa regarding","Africa regarding abortion","regarding abortion laws","abortion laws and","laws and their","and their impact","their impact on","impact on the","on the lives","the lives of","lives of women","In the 90","the 90 's","90 's ,","'s , Poland",", Poland banned","Poland banned abortion","banned abortion due","abortion due to","due to the","to the increasing","the increasing influence","increasing influence of","influence of the","of the Catholic","the Catholic Church","Catholic Church after","Church after the","after the fall","the fall of","fall of communism","of communism ;","communism ;

{"title":"Uptown","plot":"Ben has been single for a long time. For his part, he is a loner but as well a romantic: he enjoys the solitude of his simple being but appreciates intelligent and witty company just the same. By yielding to both extremes, Ben remains caught between reason and arousal. Isabel has been married for a year. The passion that had once carried her 5-year relationship has lost its pulse. Passive, protective, and without poise, it now threatens to claim hers. Waiting in abeyance, Isabel is lost between loyalty and loneliness. Uptown is where they come together.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ben","has","been","singl","for","a","long","time",".","For","his","part",",","he","is","a","loner","but","as","well","a","romant",":","he","enjoy","the","solitud","of","his","simpl","be","but","appreci","intellig","and","witti","compani","just","the","same",".","By","yield","to","both","extrem",",","Ben","remain","caught","between","reason","and","arous",".","Isabel","has","been","marri","for","a","year",".","The","passion","that","had","onc","carri","her","5-year","relationship","has","lost","it","puls",".","Passiv",",","protect",",","and","without","pois",",","it","now","threaten","to","claim","her",".","Wait","in","abey",",","Isabel","is","lost","between","loyalti","and","loneli",".","Uptown","is","where","they","come","togeth","."],"lemmas":["Ben","have","be","single","for","a","long","time",".","for","he","part",",","he","be","a","loner","but","as","well","a","romantic",":","he","enjoy","the","solitude","of","he","simple","be","but","appreciate","intelligent","and","witty","company","just","the","same",".","by","yield","to","both","extreme",",","Ben","remain","catch","between","reason","and","arousal",".","Isabel","have","be","marry","for","a","year",".","the","passion","that","have","once","carry","she","5-year","relationship","have","lose","its","pulse",".","passive",",","protective",",","and","without","poise",",","it","now","threaten","to","claim","hers",".","wait","in","abeyance",",","Isabel","be","lose","between","loyalty","and","loneliness",".","Uptown","be","where","they","come","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ben has been","has been single","been single for","single for a","for a long","a long time","For his part","his part ,","part , he",", he is","he is a","is a loner","a loner but","loner but as","but as well","as well a","well a romantic","a romantic :","romantic : he",": he enjoys","he enjoys the","enjoys the solitude","the solitude of","solitude of his","of his simple","his simple being","simple being but","being but appreciates","but appreciates intelligent","appreciates intelligent and","intelligent and witty","and witty company","witty company just","company just the","just the same","By yielding to","yielding to both","to both extremes","both extremes ,","extremes , Ben",", Ben remains","Ben remains caught","remains caught between","caught between reason","between reason and","reason and arousal","Isabel has been","has been married","been married for","married for a","for a year","The passion that","passion that had","that had once","had once carried","once carried her","carried her 5-year","her 5-year relationship","5-year relationship has","relationship has lost","has lost its","lost its pulse","Passive , protective",", protective ,","protective , and",", and without","and without poise","without poise ,","poise , it",", it now","it now threatens","now threatens to","threatens to claim","to claim hers","Waiting in abeyance","in abeyance ,","abeyance , Isabel",", Isabel is","Isabel is lost","is lost between","lost between loyalty","between loyalty and","loyalty and loneliness","Uptown is where","is where they","where they come","they come together"],"2grams":["Ben has","has been","been single","single for","for a","a long","long time","For his","his part","part ,",", he","he is","is a","a loner","loner but","but as","as well","well a","a romantic","romantic :",": he","he enjoys","enjoys the","the solitude","solitude of","of his","his simple","simple being","being but","but appreciates","appreciates intelligent","intelligent and","and witty","witty company","company just","just the","the same","By yielding","yielding to","to both","both extremes","extremes ,",", Ben","Ben remains","remains caught","caught between","between reason","reason and","and arousal","Isabel has","has been","been married","married for","for a","a year","The passion","passion that","that had","had once","once carried","carried her","her 5-year","5-year relationship","relationship has","has lost","lost its","its pulse","Passive ,",", protective","protective ,",", and","and without","without poise","poise ,",", it","it now","now threatens","threatens to","to claim","claim hers","Waiting in","in abeyance","abeyance ,",", Isabel","Isabel is","is lost","lost between","between loyalty","loyalty and","and loneliness","Uptown is","is where","where they","they come","come together"]}

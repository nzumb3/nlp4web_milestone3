{"title":"Do You Like My Basement","plot":"Do You Like My Basement? tracks how one man's creative frustration bore a need to make the perfect horror film. Stanley Farmer was rejected universally by the film world. His frustration provoked a darker side and soon cunning, guile, devilish charm and a sociopath's streak compelled him to produce a home-made magnum opus. A film that blurs the lines between reality and fiction and demands the attention of the very world that spurned him.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["Do","You","Like","My","Basement","?","track","how","one","man","'s","creativ","frustrat","bore","a","need","to","make","the","perfect","horror","film",".","Stanley","Farmer","was","reject","univers","by","the","film","world",".","His","frustrat","provok","a","darker","side","and","soon","cun",",","guil",",","devilish","charm","and","a","sociopath","'s","streak","compel","him","to","produc","a","home-mad","magnum","opus",".","A","film","that","blur","the","line","between","realiti","and","fiction","and","demand","the","attent","of","the","veri","world","that","spurn","him","."],"lemmas":["do","you","like","my","basement","?","track","how","one","man","'s","creative","frustration","bear","a","need","to","make","the","perfect","horror","film",".","Stanley","Farmer","be","reject","universally","by","the","film","world",".","he","frustration","provoke","a","darker","side","and","soon","cunning",",","guile",",","devilish","charm","and","a","sociopath","'s","streak","compel","he","to","produce","a","home-made","magnum","opus",".","a","film","that","blur","the","line","between","reality","and","fiction","and","demand","the","attention","of","the","very","world","that","spurn","he","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Do You Like","You Like My","Like My Basement","tracks how one","how one man","one man 's","man 's creative","'s creative frustration","creative frustration bore","frustration bore a","bore a need","a need to","need to make","to make the","make the perfect","the perfect horror","perfect horror film","Stanley Farmer was","Farmer was rejected","was rejected universally","rejected universally by","universally by the","by the film","the film world","His frustration provoked","frustration provoked a","provoked a darker","a darker side","darker side and","side and soon","and soon cunning","soon cunning ,","cunning , guile",", guile ,","guile , devilish",", devilish charm","devilish charm and","charm and a","and a sociopath","a sociopath 's","sociopath 's streak","'s streak compelled","streak compelled him","compelled him to","him to produce","to produce a","produce a home-made","a home-made magnum","home-made magnum opus","A film that","film that blurs","that blurs the","blurs the lines","the lines between","lines between reality","between reality and","reality and fiction","and fiction and","fiction and demands","and demands the","demands the attention","the attention of","attention of the","of the very","the very world","very world that","world that spurned","that spurned him"],"2grams":["Do You","You Like","Like My","My Basement","tracks how","how one","one man","man 's","'s creative","creative frustration","frustration bore","bore a","a need","need to","to make","make the","the perfect","perfect horror","horror film","Stanley Farmer","Farmer was","was rejected","rejected universally","universally by","by the","the film","film world","His frustration","frustration provoked","provoked a","a darker","darker side","side and","and soon","soon cunning","cunning ,",", guile","guile ,",", devilish","devilish charm","charm and","and a","a sociopath","sociopath 's","'s streak","streak compelled","compelled him","him to","to produce","produce a","a home-made","home-made magnum","magnum opus","A film","film that","that blurs","blurs the","the lines","lines between","between reality","reality and","and fiction","fiction and","and demands","demands the","the attention","attention of","of the","the very","very world","world that","that spurned","spurned him"]}

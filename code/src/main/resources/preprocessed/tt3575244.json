{"title":"The Shoot","plot":"Tommy and Dougie are two weathered musicians who are still living the rock and roll lifestyle, busted broke and desperately dreaming of their big break. Tommy's wife, Maddy, would trade places any day, stable but stuck in her own soul-less job as an assistant fashion stylist. To pay for their big album, the rockers take out a loan from the wrong kind of lender (the kind that breaks legs for breakfast). Unable to repay the loan they riff on a plan to rob Maddy's photo shoot for a high-end jewelry line in the desert. Fashionistas, models, millions in jewels.... all wrapped up in a nice remote desert package. Seems easy enough. Of course fashion isn't always pretty, and neither is felony. When all hell breaks loose in the desert, cameras aren't the only thing doing the shooting. The crew scatters into the barren unforgiving landscape with only their lives and the jewels, gambling on the chance that the armed robbers will give up and leave. But when you dig a hole to hell, do you climb out-- or keep digging? Their dreams turned into a nightmare with the flash of a gun and the splash of innocent blood, it's too late to turn back now. Both souls and lives are at stake, and the desert always has the upper hand.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

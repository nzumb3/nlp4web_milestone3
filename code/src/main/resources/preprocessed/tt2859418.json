{"title":"Geboren in Offenbach","plot":"The social life of immigrants in Germany has been a widely discussed topic. Often ignored is the question of how the second generation deals with the presence of two cultures. Nazmi, Nagije and Bege are three Kosovar Albanian sisters - born in Offenbach/ Germany. After the death of their father (their mother died 11 years prior) the film accompanies them for a period of five years. The relatives are never seen in the film but it becomes evident that they have an enormous influence on the girls. Kosovar Albanian tradition clashes with German daily life as the three sisters struggle to establish their own identity. The film captures their individual inner conflict as they deal with two cultures.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["The","social","life","of","immigr","in","Germani","has","been","a","wide","discuss","topic",".","Often","ignor","is","the","question","of","how","the","second","generat","deal","with","the","presenc","of","two","cultur",".","Nazmi",",","Nagij","and","Bege","are","three","Kosovar","Albanian","sister","-","born","in","Offenbach","/","Germani",".","After","the","death","of","their","father","(","their","mother","die","11","year","prior",")","the","film","accompani","them","for","a","period","of","five","year",".","The","relat","are","never","seen","in","the","film","but","it","becom","evid","that","they","have","an","enorm","influenc","on","the","girl",".","Kosovar","Albanian","tradit","clash","with","German","daili","life","as","the","three","sister","struggl","to","establish","their","own","ident",".","The","film","captur","their","individu","inner","conflict","as","they","deal","with","two","cultur","."],"lemmas":["the","social","life","of","immigrant","in","Germany","have","be","a","widely","discuss","topic",".","often","ignore","be","the","question","of","how","the","second","generation","deal","with","the","presence","of","two","culture",".","Nazmi",",","Nagije","and","Bege","be","three","kosovar","albanian","sister","-","bear","in","Offenbach","/","Germany",".","after","the","death","of","they","father","-lrb-","they","mother","die","11","year","prior","-rrb-","the","film","accompany","they","for","a","period","of","five","year",".","the","relative","be","never","see","in","the","film","but","it","become","evident","that","they","have","a","enormous","influence","on","the","girl",".","kosovar","albanian","tradition","clash","with","german","daily","life","as","the","three","sister","struggle","to","establish","they","own","identity",".","the","film","capture","they","individual","inner","conflict","as","they","deal","with","two","culture","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The social life","social life of","life of immigrants","of immigrants in","immigrants in Germany","in Germany has","Germany has been","has been a","been a widely","a widely discussed","widely discussed topic","Often ignored is","ignored is the","is the question","the question of","question of how","of how the","how the second","the second generation","second generation deals","generation deals with","deals with the","with the presence","the presence of","presence of two","of two cultures","Nazmi , Nagije",", Nagije and","Nagije and Bege","and Bege are","Bege are three","are three Kosovar","three Kosovar Albanian","Kosovar Albanian sisters","Albanian sisters -","sisters -

{"title":"Black and White","plot":"Chris O'Brien, devoted Catholic and rookie cop with LAPD, is assigned to partner with the hard-edged, street-smart Nora Hugosian. A serial killer is loose, and all the victims are low-life guys whom Nora has dealt with. So, when the tire tracks of a police car are found at a murder scene, she's the prime suspect of internal affairs investigator Simon Hertzel. Chris and Nora start an affair, but meanwhile he has suspicions about her. Should he start his own investigation, which would be an act of betrayal, or trust her, as his partner and his lover? When a witness i.d.'s Nora's former partner, Michael Clemence, as the killer, Nora gives Mike an alibi, and things get complicated.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Chris","O'Brien",",","devot","Cathol","and","rooki","cop","with","LAPD",",","is","assign","to","partner","with","the","hard-edg",",","street-smart","Nora","Hugosian",".","A","serial","killer","is","loos",",","and","all","the","victim","are","low-lif","guy","whom","Nora","has","dealt","with",".","So",",","when","the","tire","track","of","a","polic","car","are","found","at","a","murder","scene",",","she","'s","the","prime","suspect","of","intern","affair","investig","Simon","Hertzel",".","Chris","and","Nora","start","an","affair",",","but","meanwhil","he","has","suspicion","about","her",".","Should","he","start","his","own","investig",",","which","would","be","an","act","of","betray",",","or","trust","her",",","as","his","partner","and","his","lover","?","When","a","wit","i.d.","'s","Nora","'s","former","partner",",","Michael","Clemenc",",","as","the","killer",",","Nora","give","Mike","an","alibi",",","and","thing","get","complic","."],"lemmas":["Chris","O'Brien",",","devoted","Catholic","and","rookie","cop","with","lapd",",","be","assign","to","partner","with","the","hard-edged",",","street-smart","Nora","Hugosian",".","a","serial","killer","be","loose",",","and","all","the","victim","be","low-life","guy","whom","Nora","have","deal","with",".","so",",","when","the","tire","track","of","a","police","car","be","find","at","a","murder","scene",",","she","be","the","prime","suspect","of","internal","affair","investigator","Simon","Hertzel",".","Chris","and","Nora","start","a","affair",",","but","meanwhile","he","have","suspicion","about","she",".","should","he","start","he","own","investigation",",","which","would","be","a","act","of","betrayal",",","or","trust","she",",","as","he","partner","and","he","lover","?","when","a","witness","i.d.","'s","Nora","'s","former","partner",",","Michael","Clemence",",","as","the","killer",",","Nora","give","Mike","a","alibi",",","and","thing","get","complicate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Chris O'Brien ,","O'Brien , devoted",", devoted Catholic","devoted Catholic and","Catholic and rookie","and rookie cop","rookie cop with","cop with LAPD","with LAPD ,","LAPD , is",", is assigned","is assigned to","assigned to partner","to partner with","partner with the","with the hard-edged","the hard-edged ,","hard-edged , street-smart",", street-smart Nora","street-smart Nora Hugosian","A serial killer","serial killer is","killer is loose","is loose ,","loose , and",", and all","and all the","all the victims","the victims are","victims are low-life","are low-life guys","low-life guys whom","guys whom Nora","whom Nora has","Nora has dealt","has dealt with","So , when",", when the","when the tire","the tire tracks","tire tracks of","tracks of a","of a police","a police car","police car are","car are found","are found at","found at a","at a murder","a murder scene","murder scene ,","scene , she",", she 's","she 's the","'s the prime","the prime suspect","prime suspect of","suspect of internal","of internal affairs","internal affairs investigator","affairs investigator Simon","investigator Simon Hertzel","Chris and Nora","and Nora start","Nora start an","start an affair","an affair ,","affair , but",", but meanwhile","but meanwhile he","meanwhile he has","he has suspicions","has suspicions about","suspicions about her","Should he start","he start his","start his own","his own investigation","own investigation ,","investigation , which",", which would","which would be","would be an","be an act","an act of","act of betrayal","of betrayal ,","betrayal , or",", or trust","or trust her","trust her ,","her , as",", as his","as his partner","his partner and","partner and his","and his lover","When a witness","a witness i.d.","witness i.d.

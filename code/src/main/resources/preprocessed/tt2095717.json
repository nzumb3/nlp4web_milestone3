{"title":"Mozart of Rap","plot":"The story of a young man in New York who has better visions for his life than just creating the same old rap music with his two best friends, Tyrone and Cobra. He wishes there were something different that he could do, something that he would respect himself for. When he learns of Darelle Sylva, who composes symphony music and writes rap to it, he decides to meet up to start recording. The only problem is, Cobra and Tyrone accuse him of going behind their back, and tension starts to rise.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","stori","of","a","young","man","in","New","York","who","has","better","vision","for","his","life","than","just","creat","the","same","old","rap","music","with","his","two","best","friend",",","Tyron","and","Cobra",".","He","wish","there","were","someth","differ","that","he","could","do",",","someth","that","he","would","respect","himself","for",".","When","he","learn","of","Darell","Sylva",",","who","compos","symphoni","music","and","write","rap","to","it",",","he","decid","to","meet","up","to","start","record",".","The","onli","problem","is",",","Cobra","and","Tyron","accus","him","of","go","behind","their","back",",","and","tension","start","to","rise","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","a","young","man","in","New","York","who","have","better","vision","for","he","life","than","just","create","the","same","old","rap","music","with","he","two","best","friend",",","Tyrone","and","Cobra",".","he","wish","there","be","something","different","that","he","could","do",",","something","that","he","would","respect","himself","for",".","when","he","learn","of","Darelle","Sylva",",","who","compose","symphony","music","and","write","rap","to","it",",","he","decide","to","meet","up","to","start","recording",".","the","only","problem","be",",","Cobra","and","Tyrone","accuse","he","of","go","behind","they","back",",","and","tension","start","to","rise","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The story of","story of a","of a young","a young man","young man in","man in New","in New York","New York who","York who has","who has better","has better visions","better visions for","visions for his","for his life","his life than","life than just","than just creating","just creating the","creating the same","the same old","same old rap","old rap music","rap music with","music with his","with his two","his two best","two best friends","best friends ,","friends , Tyrone",", Tyrone and","Tyrone and Cobra","He wishes there","wishes there were","there were something","were something different","something different that","different that he","that he could","he could do","could do ,","do , something",", something that","something that he","that he would","he would respect","would respect himself","respect himself for","When he learns","he learns of","learns of Darelle","of Darelle Sylva","Darelle Sylva ,","Sylva , who",", who composes","who composes symphony","composes symphony music","symphony music and","music and writes","and writes rap","writes rap to","rap to it","to it ,","it , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to meet","to meet up","meet up to","up to start","to start recording","The only problem","only problem is","problem is ,","is , Cobra",", Cobra and","Cobra and Tyrone","and Tyrone accuse","Tyrone accuse him","accuse him of","him of going","of going behind","going behind their","behind their back","their back ,","back , and",", and tension","and tension starts","tension starts to","starts to rise"],"2grams":["The story","story of","of a","a young","young man","man in","in New","New York","York who","who has","has better","better visions","visions for","for his","his life","life than","than just","just creating","creating the","the same","same old","old rap","rap music","music with","with his","his two","two best","best friends","friends ,",", Tyrone","Tyrone and","and Cobra","He wishes","wishes there","there were","were something","something different","different that","that he","he could","could do","do ,",", something","something that","that he","he would","would respect","respect himself","himself for","When he","he learns","learns of","of Darelle","Darelle Sylva","Sylva ,",", who","who composes","composes symphony","symphony music","music and","and writes","writes rap","rap to","to it","it ,",", he","he decides","decides to","to meet","meet up","up to","to start","start recording","The only","only problem","problem is","is ,",", Cobra","Cobra and","and Tyrone","Tyrone accuse","accuse him","him of","of going","going behind","behind their","their back","back ,",", and","and tension","tension starts","starts to","to rise"]}

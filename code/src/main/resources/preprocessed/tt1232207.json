{"title":"Capitalism: A Love Story","plot":"Capitalism: A Love Story examines the impact of corporate dominance on the everyday lives of Americans (and by default, the rest of the world). The film moves from Middle America, to the halls of power in Washington, to the global financial epicenter in Manhattan. With both humor and outrage, the film explores the question: What is the price that America pays for its love of capitalism? Families pay the price with their jobs, their homes and their savings. Moore goes into the homes of ordinary people whose lives have been turned upside down; and he goes looking for explanations in Washington, DC and elsewhere. What he finds are the all-too-familiar symptoms of a love affair gone astray: lies, abuse, betrayal...and 14,000 jobs being lost every day. Capitalism: A Love Story also presents what a more hopeful future could look like. Who are we and why do we behave the way that we do?","genres":["Crime"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["Capit",":","A","Love","Stori","examin","the","impact","of","corpor","domin","on","the","everyday","live","of","American","(","and","by","default",",","the","rest","of","the","world",")",".","The","film","move","from","Middl","America",",","to","the","hall","of","power","in","Washington",",","to","the","global","financi","epicent","in","Manhattan",".","With","both","humor","and","outrag",",","the","film","explor","the","question",":","What","is","the","price","that","America","pay","for","it","love","of","capit","?","Famili","pay","the","price","with","their","job",",","their","home","and","their","save",".","Moor","goe","into","the","home","of","ordinari","peopl","whose","live","have","been","turn","upsid","down",";","and","he","goe","look","for","explan","in","Washington",",","DC","and","elsewher",".","What","he","find","are","the","all-too-familiar","symptom","of","a","love","affair","gone","astray",":","lie",",","abus",",","betray","...","and","14,000","job","be","lost","everi","day",".","Capit",":","A","Love","Stori","also","present","what","a","more","hope","futur","could","look","like",".","Who","are","we","and","whi","do","we","behav","the","way","that","we","do","?"],"lemmas":["capitalism",":","a","Love","Story","examine","the","impact","of","corporate","dominance","on","the","everyday","life","of","Americans","-lrb-","and","by","default",",","the","rest","of","the","world","-rrb-",".","the","film","move","from","Middle","America",",","to","the","hall","of","power","in","Washington",",","to","the","global","financial","epicenter","in","Manhattan",".","with","both","humor","and","outrage",",","the","film","explore","the","question",":","what","be","the","price","that","America","pay","for","its","love","of","capitalism","?","family","pay","the","price","with","they","job",",","they","home","and","they","savings",".","Moore","go","into","the","home","of","ordinary","people","whose","life","have","be","turn","upside","down",";","and","he","go","look","for","explanation","in","Washington",",","DC","and","elsewhere",".","what","he","find","be","the","all-too-familiar","symptom","of","a","love","affair","go","astray",":","lie",",","abuse",",","betrayal","...","and","14,000","job","be","lose","every","day",".","capitalism",":","a","Love","Story","also","present","what","a","more","hopeful","future","could","look","like",".","who","be","we","and","why","do","we","behave","the","way","that","we","do","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Capitalism : A",": A Love","A Love Story","Love Story examines","Story examines the","examines the impact","the impact of","impact of corporate","of corporate dominance","corporate dominance on","dominance on the","on the everyday","the everyday lives","everyday lives of","lives of Americans","of Americans (","Americans ( and","( and by","and by default","by default ,","default , the",", the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the world","the world )","The film moves","film moves from","moves from Middle","from Middle America","Middle America ,","America , to",", to the","to the halls","the halls of","halls of power","of power in","power in Washington","in Washington ,","Washington , to",", to the","to the global","the global financial","global financial epicenter","financial epicenter in","epicenter in Manhattan","With both humor","both humor and","humor and outrage","and outrage ,","outrage , the",", the film","the film explores","film explores the","explores the question","the question :","question : What",": What is","What is the","is the price","the price that","price that America","that America pays","America pays for","pays for its","for its love","its love of","love of capitalism","Families pay the","pay the price","the price with","price with their","with their jobs","their jobs ,","jobs , their",", their homes","their homes and","homes and their","and their savings","Moore goes into","goes into the","into the homes","the homes of","homes of ordinary","of ordinary people","ordinary people whose","people whose lives","whose lives have","lives have been","have been turned","been turned upside","turned upside down","upside down ;","down ;

{"title":"Waterwalk","plot":"A father and son attempt to get to know each other on a crazy, epic 1,000 canoe trip across the Midwest. Following the 300+ year old pioneering journey of Marquette and Joliet journey, they set out without proper preparation, experience or the right equipment to do something no-one had attempted since that time. Based on a true story from the book by Steven Faulkner, this extraordinary adventure captures some of the most beautiful scenery in the Midwest and captures the heart as father and son struggle against the elements and each other to understand their own journeys. A moving, literary and spiritual family journey from the Upper Peninsula, through Green Bay, up the Fox River, down the Wisconsin River and finally to the mighty Mississippi and St. Louis.","genres":["Family"],"stems":["A","father","and","son","attempt","to","get","to","know","each","other","on","a","crazi",",","epic","1,000","cano","trip","across","the","Midwest",".","Follow","the","300","+","year","old","pioneer","journey","of","Marquett","and","Joliet","journey",",","they","set","out","without","proper","prepar",",","experi","or","the","right","equip","to","do","someth","no-on","had","attempt","sinc","that","time",".","Base","on","a","true","stori","from","the","book","by","Steven","Faulkner",",","this","extraordinari","adventur","captur","some","of","the","most","beauti","sceneri","in","the","Midwest","and","captur","the","heart","as","father","and","son","struggl","against","the","element","and","each","other","to","understand","their","own","journey",".","A","move",",","literari","and","spiritu","famili","journey","from","the","Upper","Peninsula",",","through","Green","Bay",",","up","the","Fox","River",",","down","the","Wisconsin","River","and","final","to","the","mighti","Mississippi","and","St.","Loui","."],"lemmas":["a","father","and","son","attempt","to","get","to","know","each","other","on","a","crazy",",","epic","1,000","canoe","trip","across","the","Midwest",".","follow","the","300","+","year","old","pioneering","journey","of","Marquette","and","Joliet","journey",",","they","set","out","without","proper","preparation",",","experience","or","the","right","equipment","to","do","something","no-one","have","attempt","since","that","time",".","base","on","a","true","story","from","the","book","by","Steven","Faulkner",",","this","extraordinary","adventure","capture","some","of","the","most","beautiful","scenery","in","the","midwest","and","capture","the","heart","as","father","and","son","struggle","against","the","element","and","each","other","to","understand","they","own","journey",".","a","moving",",","literary","and","spiritual","family","journey","from","the","Upper","Peninsula",",","through","Green","Bay",",","up","the","Fox","River",",","down","the","Wisconsin","River","and","finally","to","the","mighty","Mississippi","and","St.","Louis","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A

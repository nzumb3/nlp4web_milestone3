{"title":"Molly Maxwell","plot":"At Phoenix Progressive School, where everyone tries to outdo each other with creative self-expression, 16-year-old Molly Maxwell (Lola Tash) would rather be invisible than risk revealing herself as completely ordinary. When her young, handsome, disillusioned English teacher (Charlie Carrick) enters the picture and allows her to just be herself, Molly is suddenly able to flourish. As their student-teacher bond becomes more intimate, she begins putting herself on the line in unexpected ways while pursuing what she wants. But with each awkward, beautiful step towards an impossible romance, Molly risks alienating everyone she loves.","genres":["Drama","

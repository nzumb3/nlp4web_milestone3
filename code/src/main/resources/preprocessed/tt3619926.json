{"title":"10000 Nights","plot":"In 1981, after many of the live-music bars in Plaka, Athens, were shut down, two professional musicians, Spiros Podaras and Christos Tolos, decided to open Cafe Santan, a live rock music bar in Volos - a sleepy provincial town - that soon became a place of artistic expression for restless and free-spirited people and changed the way of life of the town's youth, becoming a legendary landmark. For 28 years, many famous Greek and foreign artists and bands performed live at the Cafe Santan. In 2009, the building that housed Cafe Santan was reclaimed by the owner for private use and its demolition was scheduled. Cafe Santan's last nights as a live-music bar were full of live music sessions, gatherings of old regulars and new visitors, memories and rock 'n' roll stories.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["In","1981",",","after","mani","of","the","live-mus","bar","in","Plaka",",","Athen",",","were","shut","down",",","two","profession","musician",",","Spiro","Podara","and","Christo","Tolo",",","decid","to","open","Cafe","Santan",",","a","live","rock","music","bar","in","Volo","-","a","sleepi","provinci","town","-","that","soon","becam","a","place","of","artist","express","for","restless","and","free-spirit","peopl","and","chang","the","way","of","life","of","the","town","'s","youth",",","becom","a","legendari","landmark",".","For","28","year",",","mani","famous","Greek","and","foreign","artist","and","band","perform","live","at","the","Cafe","Santan",".","In","2009",",","the","build","that","hous","Cafe","Santan","was","reclaim","by","the","owner","for","privat","use","and","it","demolit","was","schedul",".","Cafe","Santan","'s","last","night","as","a","live-mus","bar","were","full","of","live","music","session",",","gather","of","old","regular","and","new","visitor",",","memori","and","rock","n","roll","stori","."],"lemmas":["in","1981",",","after","many","of","the","live-music","bar","in","Plaka",",","Athens",",","be","shut","down",",","two","professional","musician",",","Spiros","Podaras","and","Christos","Tolos",",","decide","to","open","Cafe","Santan",",","a","live","rock","music","bar","in","Volos","-","a","sleepy","provincial","town","-","that","soon","become","a","place","of","artistic","expression","for","restless","and","free-spirited","people","and","change","the","way","of","life","of","the","town","'s","youth",",","become","a","legendary","landmark",".","for","28","year",",","many","famous","greek","and","foreign","artist","and","band","perform","live","at","the","Cafe","Santan",".","in","2009",",","the","building","that","house","Cafe","Santan","be","reclaim","by","the","owner","for","private","use","and","its","demolition","be","schedule",".","Cafe","Santan","'s","last","night","as","a","live-music","bar","be","full","of","live","music","session",",","gathering","of","old","regular","and","new","visitor",",","memory","and","rock","'n'","roll","story","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1981 ,","1981 , after",", after many","after many of","many of the","of the live-music","the live-music bars","live-music bars in","bars in Plaka","in Plaka ,","Plaka , Athens",", Athens ,","Athens , were",", were shut","were shut down","shut down ,","down , two",", two professional","two professional musicians","professional musicians ,","musicians , Spiros",", Spiros Podaras","Spiros Podaras and","Podaras and Christos","and Christos Tolos","Christos Tolos ,","Tolos , decided",", decided to","decided to open","to open Cafe","open Cafe Santan","Cafe Santan ,","Santan , a",", a live","a live rock","live rock music","rock music bar","music bar in","bar in Volos","in Volos -","Volos -

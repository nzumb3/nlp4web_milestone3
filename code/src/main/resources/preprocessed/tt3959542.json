{"title":"1870 Texas","plot":"In 1870, a gunfighter with a rattlesnake temper, Cletus Lebow, is hell-bent on gunning down Judge White to seek out his own personal revenge. He tracks down the Judge on the road to Jerome City. Seemingly lacking enough 'try' in him to survive the day, the Judge points out that in any gunfight, sometimes the difference between the living and the dying is nothing more than lady luck, or even if the gunfighter succeeds, he will only be unleashing a blood feud that he can't possibly win. Is it possible that there is a peaceful solution? The answer will come with a puff of a cigar and the twitch of an eye.","genres":["Action"," Western","

{"title":"Sankofa: The Untold Story of Harry Herbert Pace","plot":"Harry Herbert Pace was one of the most important African American entrepreneurs, and civil rights activists of the 20th century. Yet, when he died, his children passed into the white race, and never spoke of their African American ancestry, or their fathers legacy again. This great business and cultural pioneer was all but forgotten by society. In 2007, the grandson of the great Harry H. Pace discovered the family secret, and embarked on a unique journey of discovery, identity, and celebration, in the hope that Harry Herbert Paces achievements would once again be remembered.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Harri","Herbert","Pace","was","one","of","the","most","import","African","American","entrepreneur",",","and","civil","right","activist","of","the","20th","centuri",".","Yet",",","when","he","die",",","his","children","pass","into","the","white","race",",","and","never","spoke","of","their","African","American","ancestri",",","or","their","father","legaci","again",".","This","great","busi","and","cultur","pioneer","was","all","but","forgotten","by","societi",".","In","2007",",","the","grandson","of","the","great","Harri","H.","Pace","discov","the","famili","secret",",","and","embark","on","a","uniqu","journey","of","discoveri",",","ident",",","and","celebr",",","in","the","hope","that","Harri","Herbert","Pace","achiev","would","onc","again","be","rememb","."],"lemmas":["Harry","Herbert","Pace","be","one","of","the","most","important","african","american","entrepreneur",",","and","civil","rights","activist","of","the","20th","century",".","yet",",","when","he","die",",","he","child","pass","into","the","white","race",",","and","never","speak","of","they","african","american","ancestry",",","or","they","father","legacy","again",".","this","great","business","and","cultural","pioneer","be","all","but","forget","by","society",".","in","2007",",","the","grandson","of","the","great","Harry","H.","Pace","discover","the","family","secret",",","and","embark","on","a","unique","journey","of","discovery",",","identity",",","and","celebration",",","in","the","hope","that","Harry","Herbert","Paces","achievement","would","once","again","be","remember","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harry Herbert Pace","Herbert Pace was","Pace was one","was one of","one of the","of the most","the most important","most important African","important African American","African American entrepreneurs","American entrepreneurs ,","entrepreneurs , and",", and civil","and civil rights","civil rights activists","rights activists of","activists of the","of the 20th","the 20th century","Yet , when",", when he","when he died","he died ,","died , his",", his children","his children passed","children passed into","passed into the","into the white","the white race","white race ,","race , and",", and never","and never spoke","never spoke of","spoke of their","of their African","their African American","African American ancestry","American ancestry ,","ancestry , or",", or their","or their fathers","their fathers legacy","fathers legacy again","This great business","great business and","business and cultural","and cultural pioneer","cultural pioneer was","pioneer was all","was all but","all but forgotten","but forgotten by","forgotten by society","In 2007 ,","2007 , the",", the grandson","the grandson of","grandson of the","of the great","the great Harry","great Harry H.","Harry H.

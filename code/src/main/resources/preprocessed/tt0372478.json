{"title":"The Stroll","plot":"Watch the exploits of three young romantics as they dance around St. Petersburg, Russia, getting themselves involved in everything from a soccer riot to a rainstorm to a fight between best friends. Set in mostly real time, Olya, Alyosha and Petya act as if the world is their due and they live to enjoy every moment of it. A film alive with energy and a twist at the end that really twists, Progulka (The Stroll) is Alexei Uchitels's latest effort. His last film, His Wife's Diary, was submitted as Russia's Oscar nomination for Best Foreign Film of 2000.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Watch","the","exploit","of","three","young","romant","as","they","danc","around","St.","Petersburg",",","Russia",",","get","themselv","involv","in","everyth","from","a","soccer","riot","to","a","rainstorm","to","a","fight","between","best","friend",".","Set","in","most","real","time",",","Olya",",","Alyosha","and","Petya","act","as","if","the","world","is","their","due","and","they","live","to","enjoy","everi","moment","of","it",".","A","film","aliv","with","energi","and","a","twist","at","the","end","that","realli","twist",",","Progulka","(","The","Stroll",")","is","Alexei","Uchitel","'s","latest","effort",".","His","last","film",",","His","Wife","'s","Diari",",","was","submit","as","Russia","'s","Oscar","nomin","for","Best","Foreign","Film","of","2000","."],"lemmas":["watch","the","exploit","of","three","young","romantic","as","they","dance","around","St.","Petersburg",",","Russia",",","get","themselves","involve","in","everything","from","a","soccer","riot","to","a","rainstorm","to","a","fight","between","best","friend",".","set","in","mostly","real","time",",","Olya",",","Alyosha","and","Petya","act","as","if","the","world","be","they","due","and","they","live","to","enjoy","every","moment","of","it",".","a","film","alive","with","energy","and","a","twist","at","the","end","that","really","twist",",","Progulka","-lrb-","the","stroll","-rrb-","be","Alexei","Uchitels","'s","latest","effort",".","he","last","film",",","he","Wife","'s","Diary",",","be","submit","as","Russia","'s","Oscar","nomination","for","best","Foreign","Film","of","2000","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Watch the exploits","the exploits of","exploits of three","of three young","three young romantics","young romantics as","romantics as they","as they dance","they dance around","dance around St.","around St. Petersburg","St. Petersburg ,","Petersburg , Russia",", Russia ,","Russia , getting",", getting themselves","getting themselves involved","themselves involved in","involved in everything","in everything from","everything from a","from a soccer","a soccer riot","soccer riot to","riot to a","to a rainstorm","a rainstorm to","rainstorm to a","to a fight","a fight between","fight between best","between best friends","Set in mostly","in mostly real","mostly real time","real time ,","time , Olya",", Olya ,","Olya , Alyosha",", Alyosha and","Alyosha and Petya","and Petya act","Petya act as","act as if","as if the","if the world","the world is","world is their","is their due","their due and","due and they","and they live","they live to","live to enjoy","to enjoy every","enjoy every moment","every moment of","moment of it","A film alive","film alive with","alive with energy","with energy and","energy and a","and a twist","a twist at","twist at the","at the end","the end that","end that really","that really twists","really twists ,","twists , Progulka",", Progulka (","Progulka ( The","( The Stroll","The Stroll )","Stroll ) is",") is Alexei","is Alexei Uchitels","Alexei Uchitels 's","Uchitels 's latest","'s latest effort","His last film","last film ,","film , His",", His Wife","His Wife 's","Wife 's Diary","'s Diary ,","Diary , was",", was submitted","was submitted as","submitted as Russia","as Russia 's","Russia 's Oscar","'s Oscar nomination","Oscar nomination for","nomination for Best","for Best Foreign","Best Foreign Film","Foreign Film of","Film of 2000"],"2grams":["Watch the","the exploits","exploits of","of three","three young","young romantics","romantics as","as they","they dance","dance around","around St.","St. Petersburg","Petersburg ,",", Russia","Russia ,",", getting","getting themselves","themselves involved","involved in","in everything","everything from","from a","a soccer","soccer riot","riot to","to a","a rainstorm","rainstorm to","to a","a fight","fight between","between best","best friends","Set in","in mostly","mostly real","real time","time ,",", Olya","Olya ,",", Alyosha","Alyosha and","and Petya","Petya act","act as","as if","if the","the world","world is","is their","their due","due and","and they","they live","live to","to enjoy","enjoy every","every moment","moment of","of it","A film","film alive","alive with","with energy","energy and","and a","a twist","twist at","at the","the end","end that","that really","really twists","twists ,",", Progulka","Progulka (","( The","The Stroll","Stroll )",") is","is Alexei","Alexei Uchitels","Uchitels 's","'s latest","latest effort","His last","last film","film ,",", His","His Wife","Wife 's","'s Diary","Diary ,",", was","was submitted","submitted as","as Russia","Russia 's","'s Oscar","Oscar nomination","nomination for","for Best","Best Foreign","Foreign Film","Film of","of 2000"]}

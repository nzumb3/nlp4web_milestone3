{"title":"Blackfire: A Modern Warcry","plot":"Fighting for truth, justice, and the Native American Way, the Navajo punk band, Blackfire, has rocked the world for 20 years. Their mix of traditional vocalization and electric guitars is internationally embraced. Nationally they have been recognized for the quality of their music, receiving NAMMY's for 'Record of the Year', 'Group of the Year', and 'Best Pop/Rock Album.' At home, where they use the income from their music to fund youth programs and a community center, they are at best taken for granted. At worst, they are viewed as rebels and half-breeds in their fight against corporate greed and the desecration of sacred grounds. Fiercely independent, this family finds a way to maintain its values, integrity, and freedom while working in a highly competitive industry.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Fight","for","truth",",","justic",",","and","the","Nativ","American","Way",",","the","Navajo","punk","band",",","Blackfir",",","has","rock","the","world","for","20","year",".","Their","mix","of","tradit","vocal","and","electr","guitar","is","intern","embrac",".","Nation","they","have","been","recogn","for","the","qualiti","of","their","music",",","receiv","NAMMi","'s","for","'","Record","of","the","Year","'",",","'","Group","of","the","Year","'",",","and","'","Best","Pop/Rock","Album",".","'","At","home",",","where","they","use","the","incom","from","their","music","to","fund","youth","program","and","a","communiti","center",",","they","are","at","best","taken","for","grant",".","At","worst",",","they","are","view","as","rebel","and","half-bre","in","their","fight","against","corpor","greed","and","the","desecr","of","sacr","ground",".","Fierc","independ",",","this","famili","find","a","way","to","maintain","it","valu",",","integr",",","and","freedom","while","work","in","a","high","competit","industri","."],"lemmas":["fighting","for","truth",",","justice",",","and","the","native","American","Way",",","the","Navajo","punk","band",",","Blackfire",",","have","rock","the","world","for","20","year",".","they","mix","of","traditional","vocalization","and","electric","guitar","be","internationally","embrace",".","nationally","they","have","be","recognize","for","the","quality","of","they","music",",","receive","NAMMY","'s","for","'","Record","of","the","Year","'",",","'","Group","of","the","Year","'",",","and","'","best","pop/rock","album",".","'","at","home",",","where","they","use","the","income","from","they","music","to","fund","youth","program","and","a","community","center",",","they","be","at","best","take","for","grant",".","at","worst",",","they","be","view","as","rebel","and","half-breed","in","they","fight","against","corporate","greed","and","the","desecration","of","sacred","grounds",".","fiercely","independent",",","this","family","find","a","way","to","maintain","its","value",",","integrity",",","and","freedom","while","work","in","a","highly","competitive","industry","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Fighting for truth","for truth ,","truth , justice",", justice ,","justice , and",", and the","and the Native","the Native American","Native American Way","American Way ,","Way , the",", the Navajo","the Navajo punk","Navajo punk band","punk band ,","band , Blackfire",", Blackfire ,","Blackfire , has",", has rocked","has rocked the","rocked the world","the world for","world for 20","for 20 years","Their mix of","mix of traditional","of traditional vocalization","traditional vocalization and","vocalization and electric","and electric guitars","electric guitars is","guitars is internationally","is internationally embraced","Nationally they have","they have been","have been recognized","been recognized for","recognized for the","for the quality","the quality of","quality of their","of their music","their music ,","music , receiving",", receiving NAMMY","receiving NAMMY 's","NAMMY 's for","'s for '","for ' Record","' Record of","Record of the","of the Year","the Year '","Year ' ,","' , '",", ' Group","' Group of","Group of the","of the Year","the Year '","Year ' ,","' , and",", and '","and ' Best","' Best Pop/Rock","Best Pop/Rock Album","Pop/Rock Album .","Album .

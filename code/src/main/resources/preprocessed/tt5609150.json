{"title":"The Promise","plot":"A century ago Rogljevo was incredibly prosperous for a remote village in far eastern corners of Serbia. The wines of Rogljevo were to be found at exhibitions in Bordeaux and Paris. But today this region is poor and deserted. Suddenly a French family moved in to grow grapes and produce wine. They believe they have discovered a promised land, one of the top five wine regions in Europe. Their arrival sparked high hopes with some villagers - and great resistance and mistrust with others. Can Rogljevo yet again live out of its wine?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","centuri","ago","Rogljevo","was","incred","prosper","for","a","remot","villag","in","far","eastern","corner","of","Serbia",".","The","wine","of","Rogljevo","were","to","be","found","at","exhibit","in","Bordeaux","and","Pari",".","But","today","this","region","is","poor","and","desert",".","Sudden","a","French","famili","move","in","to","grow","grape","and","produc","wine",".","They","believ","they","have","discov","a","promis","land",",","one","of","the","top","five","wine","region","in","Europ",".","Their","arriv","spark","high","hope","with","some","villag","-","and","great","resist","and","mistrust","with","other",".","Can","Rogljevo","yet","again","live","out","of","it","wine","?"],"lemmas":["a","century","ago","Rogljevo","be","incredibly","prosperous","for","a","remote","village","in","far","eastern","corner","of","Serbia",".","the","wines","of","Rogljevo","be","to","be","find","at","exhibition","in","Bordeaux","and","Paris",".","but","today","this","region","be","poor","and","desert",".","suddenly","a","french","family","move","in","to","grow","grape","and","produce","wine",".","they","believe","they","have","discover","a","promised","land",",","one","of","the","top","five","wine","region","in","Europe",".","they","arrival","spark","high","hope","with","some","villager","-","and","great","resistance","and","mistrust","with","other",".","can","Rogljevo","yet","again","live","out","of","its","wine","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A century ago","century ago Rogljevo","ago Rogljevo was","Rogljevo was incredibly","was incredibly prosperous","incredibly prosperous for","prosperous for a","for a remote","a remote village","remote village in","village in far","in far eastern","far eastern corners","eastern corners of","corners of Serbia","The wines of","wines of Rogljevo","of Rogljevo were","Rogljevo were to","were to be","to be found","be found at","found at exhibitions","at exhibitions in","exhibitions in Bordeaux","in Bordeaux and","Bordeaux and Paris","But today this","today this region","this region is","region is poor","is poor and","poor and deserted","Suddenly a French","a French family","French family moved","family moved in","moved in to","in to grow","to grow grapes","grow grapes and","grapes and produce","and produce wine","They believe they","believe they have","they have discovered","have discovered a","discovered a promised","a promised land","promised land ,","land , one",", one of","one of the","of the top","the top five","top five wine","five wine regions","wine regions in","regions in Europe","Their arrival sparked","arrival sparked high","sparked high hopes","high hopes with","hopes with some","with some villagers","some villagers -","villagers - and","- and great","and great resistance","great resistance and","resistance and mistrust","and mistrust with","mistrust with others","Can Rogljevo yet","Rogljevo yet again","yet again live","again live out","live out of","out of its","of its wine"],"2grams":["A century","century ago","ago Rogljevo","Rogljevo was","was incredibly","incredibly prosperous","prosperous for","for a","a remote","remote village","village in","in far","far eastern","eastern corners","corners of","of Serbia","The wines","wines of","of Rogljevo","Rogljevo were","were to","to be","be found","found at","at exhibitions","exhibitions in","in Bordeaux","Bordeaux and","and Paris","But today","today this","this region","region is","is poor","poor and","and deserted","Suddenly a","a French","French family","family moved","moved in","in to","to grow","grow grapes","grapes and","and produce","produce wine","They believe","believe they","they have","have discovered","discovered a","a promised","promised land","land ,",", one","one of","of the","the top","top five","five wine","wine regions","regions in","in Europe","Their arrival","arrival sparked","sparked high","high hopes","hopes with","with some","some villagers","villagers -","- and","and great","great resistance","resistance and","and mistrust","mistrust with","with others","Can Rogljevo","Rogljevo yet","yet again","again live","live out","out of","of its","its wine"]}

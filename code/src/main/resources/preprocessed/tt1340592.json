{"title":"Life's a Drag: A 2007 Dragumentary","plot":"\"Life's A Drag\" is an urban experience told through the eyes of a woman who follows a drag queen into the world of sorted performance venues, entertaining social gatherings and intimate conversations about why we do the things we do. Lesbian film maker L. Sebastian's debut film is an interesting depiction of life imitating art. Wayne Hawkins' multi talented vignettes highlight the film and his portrayal of Miss Sabrina Blaze gives us access to the lives of drag queens, gay boys and show stopping performances. This 2007 dragumentary starts off in a dressing room and ends up all the way \"OUT\". With a host of extreme characters including drag queens Kitty Litter BB Hayes and La Diva Jonz. Cross dressers, gender variants and the like are a fascinating part of this world of excess and indulgence. Discover one interpretation of tolerance, acceptance and the courage it takes to be okay with who you are. Sebastian uses the innovation of modern culture and the familiarity of a traditional society to convey a message that will change your life.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Life","'s","A","Drag","\"","is","an","urban","experi","told","through","the","eye","of","a","woman","who","follow","a","drag","queen","into","the","world","of","sort","perform","venu",",","entertain","social","gather","and","intim","convers","about","whi","we","do","the","thing","we","do",".","Lesbian","film","maker","L.","Sebastian","'s","debut","film","is","an","interest","depict","of","life","imit","art",".","Wayn","Hawkin","'","multi","talent","vignett","highlight","the","film","and","his","portray","of","Miss","Sabrina","Blaze","give","us","access","to","the","live","of","drag","queen",",","gay","boy","and","show","stop","perform",".","This","2007","dragumentari","start","off","in","a","dress","room","and","end","up","all","the","way","\"","OUT","\"",".","With","a","host","of","extrem","charact","includ","drag","queen","Kitti","Litter","BB","Hay","and","La","Diva","Jonz",".","Cross","dresser",",","gender","variant","and","the","like","are","a","fascin","part","of","this","world","of","excess","and","indulg",".","Discov","one","interpret","of","toler",",","accept","and","the","courag","it","take","to","be","okay","with","who","you","are",".","Sebastian","use","the","innov","of","modern","cultur","and","the","familiar","of","a","tradit","societi","to","convey","a","messag","that","will","chang","your","life","."],"lemmas":["``","Life","'s","A","Drag","''","be","a","urban","experience","tell","through","the","eye","of","a","woman","who","follow","a","drag","queen","into","the","world","of","sort","performance","venue",",","entertain","social","gathering","and","intimate","conversation","about","why","we","do","the","thing","we","do",".","lesbian","film","maker","L.","Sebastian","'s","debut","film","be","a","interesting","depiction","of","life","imitate","art",".","Wayne","Hawkins","'","multi","talented","vignette","highlight","the","film","and","he","portrayal","of","Miss","Sabrina","Blaze","give","we","access","to","the","life","of","drag","queen",",","gay","boy","and","show","stop","performance",".","this","2007","dragumentary","start","off","in","a","dress","room","and","end","up","all","the","way","``","OUT","''",".","with","a","host","of","extreme","character","include","drag","queen","Kitty","Litter","BB","Hayes","and","La","Diva","Jonz",".","cross","dresser",",","gender","variant","and","the","like","be","a","fascinating","part","of","this","world","of","excess","and","indulgence",".","Discover","one","interpretation","of","tolerance",",","acceptance","and","the","courage","it","take","to","be","okay","with","who","you","be",".","Sebastian","use","the","innovation","of","modern","culture","and","the","familiarity","of","a","traditional","society","to","convey","a","message","that","will","change","you","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Life 's","Life 's A","'s A Drag","A Drag \"","Drag \" is","\" is an","is an urban","an urban experience","urban experience told","experience told through","told through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of a","of a woman","a woman who","woman who follows","who follows a","follows a drag","a drag queen","drag queen into","queen into the","into the world","the world of","world of sorted","of sorted performance","sorted performance venues","performance venues ,","venues , entertaining",", entertaining social","entertaining social gatherings","social gatherings and","gatherings and intimate","and intimate conversations","intimate conversations about","conversations about why","about why we","why we do","we do the","do the things","the things we","things we do","Lesbian film maker","film maker L.","maker L.

{"title":"Bon Bini Holland","plot":"Robertico Florentina is a cheeky, but charming crook of Curacao. He earns his money with Bon Bini Bungalows, a so called agency that provides residence for tourists in houses without the permission of the owner. If he, by mistake, cheats a dangerous criminal he has to pay him a lot of money back, but he doesn't have that money so he flees to the Netherlands. When Robertico meets the beautiful Noelle Maduro and discovers that her father Ken Maduro is a rich businessman, he has a plan. If he manages to convince the rich businessman to invest in Bon Bini Bungalows he won't be in trouble anymore. His plan seems to succeed, but gets complicated when Robertico falls in love with Noella. Will he continue his scam or will he follow his heart and be honest for the first time in his life?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Robertico","Florentina","is","a","cheeki",",","but","charm","crook","of","Curacao",".","He","earn","his","money","with","Bon","Bini","Bungalow",",","a","so","call","agenc","that","provid","resid","for","tourist","in","hous","without","the","permiss","of","the","owner",".","If","he",",","by","mistak",",","cheat","a","danger","crimin","he","has","to","pay","him","a","lot","of","money","back",",","but","he","doe","n't","have","that","money","so","he","flee","to","the","Netherland",".","When","Robertico","meet","the","beauti","Noell","Maduro","and","discov","that","her","father","Ken","Maduro","is","a","rich","businessman",",","he","has","a","plan",".","If","he","manag","to","convinc","the","rich","businessman","to","invest","in","Bon","Bini","Bungalow","he","wo","n't","be","in","troubl","anymor",".","His","plan","seem","to","succeed",",","but","get","complic","when","Robertico","fall","in","love","with","Noella",".","Will","he","continu","his","scam","or","will","he","follow","his","heart","and","be","honest","for","the","first","time","in","his","life","?"],"lemmas":["Robertico","Florentina","be","a","cheeky",",","but","charming","crook","of","Curacao",".","he","earn","he","money","with","Bon","Bini","Bungalows",",","a","so","call","agency","that","provide","residence","for","tourist","in","house","without","the","permission","of","the","owner",".","if","he",",","by","mistake",",","cheat","a","dangerous","criminal","he","have","to","pay","he","a","lot","of","money","back",",","but","he","do","not","have","that","money","so","he","flee","to","the","Netherlands",".","when","Robertico","meet","the","beautiful","Noelle","Maduro","and","discover","that","she","father","Ken","Maduro","be","a","rich","businessman",",","he","have","a","plan",".","if","he","manage","to","convince","the","rich","businessman","to","invest","in","Bon","Bini","Bungalows","he","will","not","be","in","trouble","anymore",".","he","plan","seem","to","succeed",",","but","get","complicate","when","Robertico","fall","in","love","with","Noella",".","will","he","continue","he","scam","or","will","he","follow","he","heart","and","be","honest","for","the","first","time","in","he","life","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Robertico

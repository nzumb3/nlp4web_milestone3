{"title":"On the Edge of Black and White","plot":"In the mid 1960's, the last of the old American television shows converted from black and white to color. At the same time, America was undergoing an epic cultural revolution. The Stars from those shows who were children, when we were children, witnessed those changes from the \"inside\" while they were growing up \"in\" television, and growing up in America. That era of Black and White family television didn't last long and it ended seemingly overnight. It would be the last time that America, in mass, was tied together with the same high-ideal family television! \"America and television changed\" and so did the way families would relate!\" As a sub-story, many of the actors from those early shows are currently artists. You'll see their work and their passion in addition to their unique perspectives on this very tumultuous time in American history.","genres":["Documentary","

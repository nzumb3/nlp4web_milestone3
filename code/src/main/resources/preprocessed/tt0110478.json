{"title":"Maverick","plot":"Maverick is recreated from the character James Garner created in the 1950s TV program. Maverick is a gambler who would rather con someone than fight them. He needs an additional three thousand dollars in order to enter a Winner Take All poker game that begins in a few days. He tries to win some, tries to collect a few debts, and recover a little loot for the reward, all with a light hearted air. He joins forces with a woman gambler with a marvelous, though fake, southern accent as the two both try and enter the game.","genres":["Action"," Comedy"," Adventure"],"stems":["Maverick","is","recreat","from","the","charact","Jame","Garner","creat","in","the","1950s","TV","program",".","Maverick","is","a","gambler","who","would","rather","con","someon","than","fight","them",".","He","need","an","addit","three","thousand","dollar","in","order","to","enter","a","Winner","Take","All","poker","game","that","begin","in","a","few","day",".","He","tri","to","win","some",",","tri","to","collect","a","few","debt",",","and","recov","a","littl","loot","for","the","reward",",","all","with","a","light","heart","air",".","He","join","forc","with","a","woman","gambler","with","a","marvel",",","though","fake",",","southern","accent","as","the","two","both","tri","and","enter","the","game","."],"lemmas":["maverick","be","recreate","from","the","character","James","Garner","create","in","the","1950s","tv","program",".","maverick","be","a","gambler","who","would","rather","con","someone","than","fight","they",".","he","need","a","additional","three","thousand","dollar","in","order","to","enter","a","winner","take","all","poker","game","that","begin","in","a","few","day",".","he","try","to","win","some",",","try","to","collect","a","few","debt",",","and","recover","a","little","loot","for","the","reward",",","all","with","a","light","hearted","air",".","he","join","force","with","a","woman","gambler","with","a","marvelous",",","though","fake",",","southern","accent","as","the","two","both","try","and","enter","the","game","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Maverick is recreated","is recreated from","recreated from the","from the character","the character James","character James Garner","James Garner created","Garner created in","created in the","in the 1950s","the 1950s TV","1950s TV program","Maverick is a","is a gambler","a gambler who","gambler who would","who would rather","would rather con","rather con someone","con someone than","someone than fight","than fight them","He needs an","needs an additional","an additional three","additional three thousand","three thousand dollars","thousand dollars in","dollars in order","in order to","order to enter","to enter a","enter a Winner","a Winner Take","Winner Take All","Take All poker","All poker game","poker game that","game that begins","that begins in","begins in a","in a few","a few days","He tries to","tries to win","to win some","win some ,","some , tries",", tries to","tries to collect","to collect a","collect a few","a few debts","few debts ,","debts , and",", and recover","and recover a","recover a little","a little loot","little loot for","loot for the","for the reward","the reward ,","reward , all",", all with","all with a","with a light","a light hearted","light hearted air","He joins forces","joins forces with","forces with a","with a woman","a woman gambler","woman gambler with","gambler with a","with a marvelous","a marvelous ,","marvelous , though",", though fake","though fake ,","fake , southern",", southern accent","southern accent as","accent as the","as the two","the two both","two both try","both try and","try and enter","and enter the","enter the game"],"2grams":["Maverick is","is recreated","recreated from","from the","the character","character James","James Garner","Garner created","created in","in the","the 1950s","1950s TV","TV program","Maverick is","is a","a gambler","gambler who","who would","would rather","rather con","con someone","someone than","than fight","fight them","He needs","needs an","an additional","additional three","three thousand","thousand dollars","dollars in","in order","order to","to enter","enter a","a Winner","Winner Take","Take All","All poker","poker game","game that","that begins","begins in","in a","a few","few days","He tries","tries to","to win","win some","some ,",", tries","tries to","to collect","collect a","a few","few debts","debts ,",", and","and recover","recover a","a little","little loot","loot for","for the","the reward","reward ,",", all","all with","with a","a light","light hearted","hearted air","He joins","joins forces","forces with","with a","a woman","woman gambler","gambler with","with a","a marvelous","marvelous ,",", though","though fake","fake ,",", southern","southern accent","accent as","as the","the two","two both","both try","try and","and enter","enter the","the game"]}

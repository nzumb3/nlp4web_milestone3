Their otherwise parallel lives collide when they reunite to celebrate the 30th anniversary of this day. Compelled to revisit the hotel where 13 of their birthdays were celebrated, Christopher and James confront the tragic event that drove them apart. In the room filled with their mother's stories as told by their fragile, resentful father, these two struggle toward the resolution that will finally restore balance to their lives.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Christoph","and","Jame","Cooper","enter","the","world","togeth","through","a","violent","childbirth","on","the","Equinox",",","a","year","window","of","balanc",".","Their","otherwis","parallel","live","collid","when","they","reunit","to","celebr","the","30th","anniversari","of","this","day",".","Compel","to","revisit","the","hotel","where","13","of","their","birthday","were","celebr",",","Christoph","and","Jame","confront","the","tragic","event","that","drove","them","apart",".","In","the","room","fill","with","their","mother","'s","stori","as","told","by","their","fragil",",","resent","father",",","these","two","struggl","toward","the","resolut","that","will","final","restor","balanc","to","their","live","."],"lemmas":["Christopher","and","James","Cooper","enter","the","world","together","through","a","violent","childbirth","on","the","Equinox",",","a","yearly","window","of","balance",".","they","otherwise","parallel","life","collide","when","they","reunite","to","celebrate","the","30th","anniversary","of","this","day",".","compel","to","revisit","the","hotel","where","13","of","they","birthday","be","celebrate",",","Christopher","and","James","confront","the","tragic","event","that","drive","they","apart",".","in","the","room","fill","with","they","mother","'s","story","as","tell","by","they","fragile",",","resentful","father",",","these","two","struggle","toward","the","resolution","that","will","finally","restore","balance","to","they","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Christopher and James","and James Cooper","James Cooper enter","Cooper enter the","enter the world","the world together","world together through","together through a","through a violent","a violent childbirth","violent childbirth on","childbirth on the","on the Equinox","the Equinox ,","Equinox , a",", a yearly","a yearly window","yearly window of","window of balance","Their otherwise parallel","otherwise parallel lives","parallel lives collide","lives collide when","collide when they","when they reunite","they reunite to","reunite to celebrate","to celebrate the","celebrate the 30th","the 30th anniversary","30th anniversary of","anniversary of this","of this day","Compelled to revisit","to revisit the","revisit the hotel","the hotel where","hotel where 13","where 13 of","13 of their","of their birthdays","their birthdays were","birthdays were celebrated","were celebrated ,","celebrated , Christopher",", Christopher and","Christopher and James","and James confront","James confront the","confront the tragic","the tragic event","tragic event that","event that drove","that drove them","drove them apart","In the room","the room filled","room filled with","filled with their","with their mother","their mother 's","mother 's stories","'s stories as","stories as told","as told by","told by their","by their fragile","their fragile ,","fragile , resentful",", resentful father","resentful father ,","father , these",", these two","these two struggle","two struggle toward","struggle toward the","toward the resolution","the resolution that","resolution that will","that will finally","will finally restore","finally restore balance","restore balance to","balance to their","to their lives"],"2grams":["Christopher and","and James","James Cooper","Cooper enter","enter the","the world","world together","together through","through a","a violent","violent childbirth","childbirth on","on the","the Equinox","Equinox ,",", a","a yearly","yearly window","window of","of balance","Their otherwise","otherwise parallel","parallel lives","lives collide","collide when","when they","they reunite","reunite to","to celebrate","celebrate the","the 30th","30th anniversary","anniversary of","of this","this day","Compelled to","to revisit","revisit the","the hotel","hotel where","where 13","13 of","of their","their birthdays","birthdays were","were celebrated","celebrated ,",", Christopher","Christopher and","and James","James confront","confront the","the tragic","tragic event","event that","that drove","drove them","them apart","In the","the room","room filled","filled with","with their","their mother","mother 's","'s stories","stories as","as told","told by","by their","their fragile","fragile ,",", resentful","resentful father","father ,",", these","these two","two struggle","struggle toward","toward the","the resolution","resolution that","that will","will finally","finally restore","restore balance","balance to","to their","their lives"]}

{"title":"Impact After the Crash","plot":"IMPACT: AFTER THE CRASH, explores the horrific Carrolton, Kentucky bus crash of May 14, 1988, which killed 27 people (mostly children) and injured nearly 35 others, the worst drunk-driving related accident in U.S. history. The Kentucky tragedy became nationally known, not only because of the devastation it caused, but also because it gave prominence to the then-fledgling national anti-drunk driving organization, Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Our documentary takes viewers back to that fateful night including a dramatic recreation of the accident and explores how those who lost family and friends have over the years both suffered and recovered from their pain and losses The film offers a stirring exploration of what it means to try to recover your life, when in an instant, everything is turned upside down.","genres":["Documentary"," Family","

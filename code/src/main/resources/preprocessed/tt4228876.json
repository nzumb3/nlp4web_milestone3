{"title":"Sam Klemke's Time Machine","plot":"In 1977, Sam Klemke started obsessively documenting his entire life on film. Beginning decades before the modern obsession with selfies and status updates, we see Sam grow from an optimistic teen to a self-important 20-year-old, into an obese, self-loathing thirty-something and onwards into his philosophical fifties. The same year that Sam began his project, NASA launched the Voyager craft into deep space carrying the Golden Record, a portrait of humanity that would try to explain to extra terrestrials who we are. From director Matthew Bate (Shut Up Little Man! An Audio Misadventure), Sam Klemke's Time Machine follows two unique self-portraits as they travel in parallel - one hurtling through the infinity of space and the other stuck in the suburbs of Earth - in a freewheeling look at time, memory, mortality and what it means to be human.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","1977",",","Sam","Klemk","start","obsess","document","his","entir","life","on","film",".","Begin","decad","befor","the","modern","obsess","with","selfi","and","status","updat",",","we","see","Sam","grow","from","an","optimist","teen","to","a","self-import","20-year-old",",","into","an","obes",",","self-loath","thirty-someth","and","onward","into","his","philosoph","fifti",".","The","same","year","that","Sam","began","his","project",",","NASA","launch","the","Voyag","craft","into","deep","space","carri","the","Golden","Record",",","a","portrait","of","human","that","would","tri","to","explain","to","extra","terrestri","who","we","are",".","From","director","Matthew","Bate","(","Shut","Up","Littl","Man","!","An","Audio","Misadventur",")",",","Sam","Klemk","'s","Time","Machin","follow","two","uniqu","self-portrait","as","they","travel","in","parallel","-","one","hurtl","through","the","infin","of","space","and","the","other","stuck","in","the","suburb","of","Earth","-","in","a","freewheel","look","at","time",",","memori",",","mortal","and","what","it","mean","to","be","human","."],"lemmas":["in","1977",",","Sam","Klemke","start","obsessively","document","he","entire","life","on","film",".","beginning","decade","before","the","modern","obsession","with","selfy","and","status","update",",","we","see","Sam","grow","from","a","optimistic","teen","to","a","self-important","20-year-old",",","into","a","obese",",","self-loathing","thirty-something","and","onward","into","he","philosophical","fifty",".","the","same","year","that","Sam","begin","he","project",",","NASA","launch","the","Voyager","craft","into","deep","space","carry","the","Golden","Record",",","a","portrait","of","humanity","that","would","try","to","explain","to","extra","terrestrial","who","we","be",".","from","director","Matthew","Bate","-lrb-","Shut","up","Little","Man","!","a","Audio","Misadventure","-rrb-",",","Sam","Klemke","'s","Time","Machine","follow","two","unique","self-portrait","as","they","travel","in","parallel","-","one","hurtle","through","the","infinity","of","space","and","the","other","stick","in","the","suburb","of","Earth","-","in","a","freewheeling","look","at","time",",","memory",",","mortality","and","what","it","mean","to","be","human","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1977 ,","1977 , Sam",", Sam Klemke","Sam Klemke started","Klemke started obsessively","started obsessively documenting","obsessively documenting his","documenting his entire","his entire life","entire life on","life on film","Beginning decades before","decades before the","before the modern","the modern obsession","modern obsession with","obsession with selfies","with selfies and","selfies and status","and status updates","status updates ,","updates , we",", we see","we see Sam","see Sam grow","Sam grow from","grow from an","from an optimistic","an optimistic teen","optimistic teen to","teen to a","to a self-important","a self-important 20-year-old","self-important 20-year-old ,","20-year-old , into",", into an","into an obese","an obese ,","obese , self-loathing",", self-loathing thirty-something","self-loathing thirty-something and","thirty-something and onwards","and onwards into","onwards into his","into his philosophical","his philosophical fifties","The same year","same year that","year that Sam","that Sam began","Sam began his","began his project","his project ,","project , NASA",", NASA launched","NASA launched the","launched the Voyager","the Voyager craft","Voyager craft into","craft into deep","into deep space","deep space carrying","space carrying the","carrying the Golden","the Golden Record","Golden Record ,","Record , a",", a portrait","a portrait of","portrait of humanity","of humanity that","humanity that would","that would try","would try to","try to explain","to explain to","explain to extra","to extra terrestrials","extra terrestrials who","terrestrials who we","who we are","From director Matthew","director Matthew Bate","Matthew Bate (","Bate ( Shut","( Shut Up","Shut Up Little","Up Little Man","An Audio Misadventure","Audio Misadventure )","Misadventure ) ,",") , Sam",", Sam Klemke","Sam Klemke 's","Klemke 's Time","'s Time Machine","Time Machine follows","Machine follows two","follows two unique","two unique self-portraits","unique self-portraits as","self-portraits as they","as they travel","they travel in","travel in parallel","in parallel -","parallel -

{"title":"Apna Bana Ke Dekho","plot":"Jankiraman alias Johny is a hoodlum, known to the local police, has been arrested several times, and lives a poor lifestyle in a city in South India along with his widowed mom. His mother and father had a love marriage, but he died a violent death. She kept her Mangalsutra around his photo frame. Once she talked to a parrot astrologer, who predicted great things in Janikiraman's life, as he will soon be associating with rich people, as well as getting married to a very wealthy girl. These predictions come true when Jankiraman introduces her to Sandhya Anand, a pretty young woman, who even comes to visit and eat at their humble dwelling. She and Jankiraman will, however, soon find out that she regards Jankiraman just as a friend and will soon ask him to pick a groom for her from an envelope containing photographs. A broken-hearted Jankiraman is unable to convey his true feelings, and picks the photo of Dhinesh Nallathambi, the only son of a Politician. Sandhya instantly approves of Jankiraman's choice, and an engagement party takes place. Shortly thereafter Jankiraman's life spirals out of control as his mother passes away, and he gets into a confrontation with a hoodlum named Sadhaa - and it is during this confrontation that will lead to even more changes in his life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Jankiraman","alia","Johni","is","a","hoodlum",",","known","to","the","local","polic",",","has","been","arrest","sever","time",",","and","live","a","poor","lifestyl","in","a","citi","in","South","India","along","with","his","widow","mom",".","His","mother","and","father","had","a","love","marriag",",","but","he","die","a","violent","death",".","She","kept","her","Mangalsutra","around","his","photo","frame",".","Once","she","talk","to","a","parrot","astrolog",",","who","predict","great","thing","in","Janikiraman","'s","life",",","as","he","will","soon","be","associ","with","rich","peopl",",","as","well","as","get","marri","to","a","veri","wealthi","girl",".","These","predict","come","true","when","Jankiraman","introduc","her","to","Sandhya","Anand",",","a","pretti","young","woman",",","who","even","come","to","visit","and","eat","at","their","humbl","dwell",".","She","and","Jankiraman","will",",","howev",",","soon","find","out","that","she","regard","Jankiraman","just","as","a","friend","and","will","soon","ask","him","to","pick","a","groom","for","her","from","an","envelop","contain","photograph",".","A","broken-heart","Jankiraman","is","unabl","to","convey","his","true","feel",",","and","pick","the","photo","of","Dhinesh","Nallathambi",",","the","onli","son","of","a","Politician",".","Sandhya","instant","approv","of","Jankiraman","'s","choic",",","and","an","engag","parti","take","place",".","Short","thereaft","Jankiraman","'s","life","spiral","out","of","control","as","his","mother","pass","away",",","and","he","get","into","a","confront","with","a","hoodlum","name","Sadhaa","-","and","it","is","dure","this","confront","that","will","lead","to","even","more","chang","in","his","life","."],"lemmas":["Jankiraman","alia","Johny","be","a","hoodlum",",","know","to","the","local","police",",","have","be","arrest","several","time",",","and","live","a","poor","lifestyle","in","a","city","in","South","India","along","with","he","widow","mom",".","he","mother","and","father","have","a","love","marriage",",","but","he","die","a","violent","death",".","she","keep","she","Mangalsutra","around","he","photo","frame",".","once","she","talk","to","a","parrot","astrologer",",","who","predict","great","thing","in","Janikiraman","'s","life",",","as","he","will","soon","be","associate","with","rich","people",",","as","well","as","get","marry","to","a","very","wealthy","girl",".","these","prediction","come","true","when","Jankiraman","introduce","she","to","Sandhya","Anand",",","a","pretty","young","woman",",","who","even","come","to","visit","and","eat","at","they","humble","dwelling",".","she","and","Jankiraman","will",",","however",",","soon","find","out","that","she","regard","Jankiraman","just","as","a","friend","and","will","soon","ask","he","to","pick","a","groom","for","she","from","a","envelope","contain","photograph",".","a","broken-hearted","Jankiraman","be","unable","to","convey","he","true","feeling",",","and","pick","the","photo","of","Dhinesh","Nallathambi",",","the","only","son","of","a","politician",".","Sandhya","instantly","approve","of","Jankiraman","'s","choice",",","and","a","engagement","party","take","place",".","shortly","thereafter","Jankiraman","'s","life","spiral","out","of","control","as","he","mother","pass","away",",","and","he","get","into","a","confrontation","with","a","hoodlum","name","Sadhaa","-","and","it","be","during","this","confrontation","that","will","lead","to","even","more","change","in","he","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jankiraman

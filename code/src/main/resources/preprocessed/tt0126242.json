{"title":"Clando","plot":"Proud and determined, the hunter set out, leaving behind his village ravaged by a terrible drought. All the villagers came out to wish him well, and everyone gave what he could: an egg, a handful of peanuts or a few kola nuts... As in the folktale, Sobgui, a former computer programmer who now drives a \"clando\" cab in Douala, flees to Europe to escape a life in Cameroon which has become unbearable. In Cologne (Germany), Sobgui joins a community of African emigrants. Most are hard-working and ambitious people. Sobgui begins a love affair with Madeleine, a German political activist who encourages Sobgui and his friends to return home and fight for change.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Proud","and","determin",",","the","hunter","set","out",",","leav","behind","his","villag","ravag","by","a","terribl","drought",".","All","the","villag","came","out","to","wish","him","well",",","and","everyon","gave","what","he","could",":","an","egg",",","a","hand","of","peanut","or","a","few","kola","nut","...","As","in","the","folktal",",","Sobgui",",","a","former","comput","programm","who","now","drive","a","\"","clando","\"","cab","in","Douala",",","flee","to","Europ","to","escap","a","life","in","Cameroon","which","has","becom","unbear",".","In","Cologn","(","Germani",")",",","Sobgui","join","a","communiti","of","African","emigr",".","Most","are","hard-work","and","ambiti","peopl",".","Sobgui","begin","a","love","affair","with","Madelein",",","a","German","polit","activist","who","encourag","Sobgui","and","his","friend","to","return","home","and","fight","for","chang","."],"lemmas":["proud","and","determined",",","the","hunter","set","out",",","leave","behind","he","village","ravage","by","a","terrible","drought",".","all","the","villager","come","out","to","wish","he","well",",","and","everyone","give","what","he","could",":","a","egg",",","a","handful","of","peanut","or","a","few","kola","nut","...","as","in","the","folktale",",","Sobgui",",","a","former","computer","programmer","who","now","drive","a","``","clando","''","cab","in","Douala",",","flee","to","Europe","to","escape","a","life","in","Cameroon","which","have","become","unbearable",".","in","Cologne","-lrb-","Germany","-rrb-",",","Sobgui","join","a","community","of","african","emigrant",".","most","be","hard-working","and","ambitious","people",".","Sobgui","begin","a","love","affair","with","Madeleine",",","a","german","political","activist","who","encourage","Sobgui","and","he","friend","to","return","home","and","fight","for","change","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Proud and determined","and determined ,","determined , the",", the hunter","the hunter set","hunter set out","set out ,","out , leaving",", leaving behind","leaving behind his","behind his village","his village ravaged","village ravaged by","ravaged by a","by a terrible","a terrible drought","All the villagers","the villagers came","villagers came out","came out to","out to wish","to wish him","wish him well","him well ,","well , and",", and everyone","and everyone gave","everyone gave what","gave what he","what he could","he could :","could : an",": an egg","an egg ,","egg , a",", a handful","a handful of","handful of peanuts","of peanuts or","peanuts or a","or a few","a few kola","few kola nuts","kola nuts ...","nuts ...

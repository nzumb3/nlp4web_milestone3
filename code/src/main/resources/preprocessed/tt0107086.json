He was considered the lowest common denominator of our society by some, an avant-garde artist by others. He died of an overdose in the early 90's.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Documentari","about","the","life","and","death","of","the","notori","underground","punk","icon","GG","Allin",",","the","foul","mouth",",","heroin","shoot","lead","singer","of","the","Murder","Junki",",","who","would","throw","excrement","at","the","crowd",",","start","fight","with","the","biggest","guy","in","the","audienc",",","and","threaten","to","kill","himself","onstag",".","He","was","consid","the","lowest","common","denomin","of","our","societi","by","some",",","an","avant-gard","artist","by","other",".","He","die","of","an","overdos","in","the","earli","90","'s","."],"lemmas":["documentary","about","the","life","and","death","of","the","notorious","underground","punk","icon","gg","Allin",",","the","foul","mouth",",","heroin","shooting","lead","singer","of","the","murder","Junkies",",","who","would","throw","excrement","at","the","crowd",",","start","fight","with","the","biggest","guy","in","the","audience",",","and","threaten","to","kill","himself","onstage",".","he","be","consider","the","lowest","common","denominator","of","we","society","by","some",",","a","avant-garde","artist","by","other",".","he","die","of","a","overdose","in","the","early","90","'s","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Documentary about the","about the life","the life and","life and death","and death of","death of the","of the notorious","the notorious underground","notorious underground punk","underground punk icon","punk icon GG","icon GG Allin","GG Allin ,","Allin , the",", the foul","the foul mouthed","foul mouthed ,","mouthed , heroin",", heroin shooting","heroin shooting lead","shooting lead singer","lead singer of","singer of the","of the Murder","the Murder Junkies","Murder Junkies ,","Junkies , who",", who would","who would throw","would throw excrement","throw excrement at","excrement at the","at the crowd","the crowd ,","crowd , start",", start fights","start fights with","fights with the","with the biggest","the biggest guys","biggest guys in","guys in the","in the audience","the audience ,","audience , and",", and threatened","and threatened to","threatened to kill","to kill himself","kill himself onstage","He was considered","was considered the","considered the lowest","the lowest common","lowest common denominator","common denominator of","denominator of our","of our society","our society by","society by some","by some ,","some , an",", an avant-garde","an avant-garde artist","avant-garde artist by","artist by others","He died of","died of an","of an overdose","an overdose in","overdose in the","in the early","the early 90","early 90 's"],"2grams":["Documentary about","about the","the life","life and","and death","death of","of the","the notorious","notorious underground","underground punk","punk icon","icon GG","GG Allin","Allin ,",", the","the foul","foul mouthed","mouthed ,",", heroin","heroin shooting","shooting lead","lead singer","singer of","of the","the Murder","Murder Junkies","Junkies ,",", who","who would","would throw","throw excrement","excrement at","at the","the crowd","crowd ,",", start","start fights","fights with","with the","the biggest","biggest guys","guys in","in the","the audience","audience ,",", and","and threatened","threatened to","to kill","kill himself","himself onstage","He was","was considered","considered the","the lowest","lowest common","common denominator","denominator of","of our","our society","society by","by some","some ,",", an","an avant-garde","avant-garde artist","artist by","by others","He died","died of","of an","an overdose","overdose in","in the","the early","early 90","90 's"]}

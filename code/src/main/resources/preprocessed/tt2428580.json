{"title":"Suddenly It's Magic","plot":"Joey Hermosa (Erich Gonzales) and Marcus Hanson (Mario Maurer) only have two things in common. One: they live to make fairy-tale romances happen - Joey through her exquisite wedding cakes; Marcus through the numerous romantic comedies he stars in. Two: their own love stories do not have the fairy-tale happy endings - she was just recently dumped at the altar; he just discovered that his on-screen partner and real-life girlfriend had fallen in love with another man. These two broken-hearted people will find love again when they least expect it. Sounds like the perfect recipe for a sweet ever after! Desperate to escape the media frenzy and the intrusive questions of the public about his love life and career, Marcus impulsively decides to go on vacation in the Philippines where he meets Joey who is determined to move forward with her life. Marcus finds himself drawn to Joey's passion for baking, and rediscovers his love for acting. In love once again, he invites her to join him in Thailand. Joey refuses at first, but she eventually follows him to Bangkok and allows herself to fall in love again. But their love encounters opposition from Marcus' fans who are desperate to see him reunite with his ex-girlfriend, and from his overprotective mother. Moreover, Joey's responsibilities back home cause a strain in their relationship. Despite their love for each other, Joey and Marcus begin to question if their dreams are worth sacrificing for holiday romance suddenly turned serious. Can Marcus and Joey's fairytale romance survive life's realities?.","genres":["Comedy","

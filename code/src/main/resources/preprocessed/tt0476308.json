{"title":"The 1001 Gags of Spiff and Hercules","plot":"Hercule wishes to be recognized at last as the star that he always was. He does not accept that Pif, this fleabag, can delight stardom. He decides, therefore, on an impulse, to change his life and retire to a deserted island- or the nearest thing: to relate his career and write his own film. In a paradise-like setting, Hercule recounts the biggest roles of his career. Pif isn't absent from his memories, but Hercule still considers him to be a fifth wheel... However, this, in reality, is not exactly the case...","genres":["Animation"],"stems":["Hercul","wish","to","be","recogn","at","last","as","the","star","that","he","alway","was",".","He","doe","not","accept","that","Pif",",","this","fleabag",",","can","delight","stardom",".","He","decid",",","therefor",",","on","an","impuls",",","to","chang","his","life","and","retir","to","a","desert","island","-","or","the","nearest","thing",":","to","relat","his","career","and","write","his","own","film",".","In","a","paradise-lik","set",",","Hercul","recount","the","biggest","role","of","his","career",".","Pif","is","n't","absent","from","his","memori",",","but","Hercul","still","consid","him","to","be","a","fifth","wheel","...","Howev",",","this",",","in","realiti",",","is","not","exact","the","case","..."],"lemmas":["Hercule","wish","to","be","recognize","at","last","as","the","star","that","he","always","be",".","he","do","not","accept","that","Pif",",","this","fleabag",",","can","delight","stardom",".","he","decide",",","therefore",",","on","a","impulse",",","to","change","he","life","and","retire","to","a","desert","island","-","or","the","nearest","thing",":","to","relate","he","career","and","write","he","own","film",".","in","a","paradise-like","setting",",","Hercule","recount","the","biggest","role","of","he","career",".","pif","be","not","absent","from","he","memory",",","but","Hercule","still","consider","he","to","be","a","fifth","wheel","...","however",",","this",",","in","reality",",","be","not","exactly","the","case","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hercule wishes to","wishes to be","to be recognized","be recognized at","recognized at last","at last as","last as the","as the star","the star that","star that he","that he always","he always was","He does not","does not accept","not accept that","accept that Pif","that Pif ,","Pif , this",", this fleabag","this fleabag ,","fleabag , can",", can delight","can delight stardom","He decides ,","decides , therefore",", therefore ,","therefore , on",", on an","on an impulse","an impulse ,","impulse , to",", to change","to change his","change his life","his life and","life and retire","and retire to","retire to a","to a deserted","a deserted island","deserted island -","island - or","- or the","or the nearest","the nearest thing","nearest thing :","thing : to",": to relate","to relate his","relate his career","his career and","career and write","and write his","write his own","his own film","In a paradise-like","a paradise-like setting","paradise-like setting ,","setting , Hercule",", Hercule recounts","Hercule recounts the","recounts the biggest","the biggest roles","biggest roles of","roles of his","of his career","Pif is n't","is n't absent","n't absent from","absent from his","from his memories","his memories ,","memories , but",", but Hercule","but Hercule still","Hercule still considers","still considers him","considers him to","him to be","to be a","be a fifth","a fifth wheel","fifth wheel ...","wheel ...

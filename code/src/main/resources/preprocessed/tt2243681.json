{"title":"Valentino's Ghost","plot":"The documentary exposes the ways in which America's foreign policy agenda in the Middle East drives the U.S. media's portrayals of Arabs and Muslims. The film lays bare the truths behind taboo subjects that are conspicuously avoided, or merely treated as sound bites, by the mainstream American media: \"Why do they hate us?\" \"Why do we hate them?\" What were the events that led to the 9/11 attacks? What are the politics behind the U.S.-Israeli relationship? Why is there a robust debate about these subjects in Europe, the Arab World and in Israel itself, but not in the U.S.? Valentino's Ghost provides a fresh inquiry which challenges the media's daily barrage of rhetoric and misinformation about our complex and vital relationship with this part of the world.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["The","documentari","expos","the","way","in","which","America","'s","foreign","polici","agenda","in","the","Middl","East","drive","the","U.S.","media","'s","portray","of","Arab","and","Muslim",".","The","film","lay","bare","the","truth","behind","taboo","subject","that","are","conspicu","avoid",",","or","mere","treat","as","sound","bite",",","by","the","mainstream","American","media",":","\"","Whi","do","they","hate","us","?","\"","\"","Whi","do","we","hate","them","?","\"","What","were","the","event","that","led","to","the","9/11","attack","?","What","are","the","polit","behind","the","U.S.-Israeli","relationship","?","Whi","is","there","a","robust","debat","about","these","subject","in","Europ",",","the","Arab","World","and","in","Israel","itself",",","but","not","in","the","U.S.","?","Valentino","'s","Ghost","provid","a","fresh","inquiri","which","challeng","the","media","'s","daili","barrag","of","rhetor","and","misinform","about","our","complex","and","vital","relationship","with","this","part","of","the","world","."],"lemmas":["the","documentary","expose","the","way","in","which","America","'s","foreign","policy","agenda","in","the","Middle","East","drive","the","U.S.","media","'s","portrayal","of","Arabs","and","Muslims",".","the","film","lay","bare","the","truth","behind","taboo","subject","that","be","conspicuously","avoid",",","or","merely","treat","as","sound","bite",",","by","the","mainstream","american","media",":","``","why","do","they","hate","we","?","''","``","why","do","we","hate","they","?","''","what","be","the","event","that","lead","to","the","9/11","attack","?","what","be","the","politics","behind","the","u.s.-israeli","relationship","?","why","be","there","a","robust","debate","about","these","subject","in","Europe",",","the","Arab","World","and","in","Israel","itself",",","but","not","in","the","U.S.","?","Valentino","'s","ghost","provide","a","fresh","inquiry","which","challenge","the","media","'s","daily","barrage","of","rhetoric","and","misinformation","about","we","complex","and","vital","relationship","with","this","part","of","the","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The documentary exposes","documentary exposes the","exposes the ways","the ways in","ways in which","in which America","which America 's","America 's foreign","'s foreign policy","foreign policy agenda","policy agenda in","agenda in the","in the Middle","the Middle East","Middle East drives","East drives the","drives the U.S.","the U.S. media","U.S. media 's","media 's portrayals","'s portrayals of","portrayals of Arabs","of Arabs and","Arabs and Muslims","The film lays","film lays bare","lays bare the","bare the truths","the truths behind","truths behind taboo","behind taboo subjects","taboo subjects that","subjects that are","that are conspicuously","are conspicuously avoided","conspicuously avoided ,","avoided , or",", or merely","or merely treated","merely treated as","treated as sound","as sound bites","sound bites ,","bites , by",", by the","by the mainstream","the mainstream American","mainstream American media","American media :","media : \"",": \" Why","\" Why do","Why do they","do they hate","they hate us","hate us ?","us ?

{"title":"Chronic Town","plot":"Truman Korovin is a lonely, sharp-witted cab driver in Fairbanks, Alaska, 1980. The usual routine of picking up fares and spending his nights at his favorite bar, the Boatel, is disrupted when his girlfriend, Emily, dumps him on one of the coldest nights of the year. After an acid trip, Truman winds up in the local loony bin. Imprisoned in a grueling therapy group, Truman gets re-acquainted with loonies who are his old cab fares, which includes a local stripper he has insulted more than once. In this world, Truman must find or lose himself.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Truman","Korovin","is","a","lone",",","sharp-wit","cab","driver","in","Fairbank",",","Alaska",",","1980",".","The","usual","routin","of","pick","up","fare","and","spend","his","night","at","his","favorit","bar",",","the","Boatel",",","is","disrupt","when","his","girlfriend",",","Emili",",","dump","him","on","one","of","the","coldest","night","of","the","year",".","After","an","acid","trip",",","Truman","wind","up","in","the","local","looni","bin",".","Imprison","in","a","gruel","therapi","group",",","Truman","get","re-acquaint","with","looni","who","are","his","old","cab","fare",",","which","includ","a","local","stripper","he","has","insult","more","than","onc",".","In","this","world",",","Truman","must","find","or","lose","himself","."],"lemmas":["Truman","Korovin","be","a","lonely",",","sharp-witted","cab","driver","in","Fairbanks",",","Alaska",",","1980",".","the","usual","routine","of","pick","up","fare","and","spend","he","night","at","he","favorite","bar",",","the","Boatel",",","be","disrupt","when","he","girlfriend",",","Emily",",","dump","he","on","one","of","the","coldest","night","of","the","year",".","after","a","acid","trip",",","Truman","wind","up","in","the","local","loony","bin",".","imprison","in","a","grueling","therapy","group",",","Truman","get","re-acquainted","with","loony","who","be","he","old","cab","fare",",","which","include","a","local","stripper","he","have","insult","more","than","once",".","in","this","world",",","Truman","must","find","or","lose","himself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Truman Korovin is","Korovin is a","is a lonely","a lonely ,","lonely , sharp-witted",", sharp-witted cab","sharp-witted cab driver","cab driver in","driver in Fairbanks","in Fairbanks ,","Fairbanks , Alaska",", Alaska ,","Alaska , 1980","The usual routine","usual routine of","routine of picking","of picking up","picking up fares","up fares and","fares and spending","and spending his","spending his nights","his nights at","nights at his","at his favorite","his favorite bar","favorite bar ,","bar , the",", the Boatel","the Boatel ,","Boatel , is",", is disrupted","is disrupted when","disrupted when his","when his girlfriend","his girlfriend ,","girlfriend , Emily",", Emily ,","Emily , dumps",", dumps him","dumps him on","him on one","on one of","one of the","of the coldest","the coldest nights","coldest nights of","nights of the","of the year","After an acid","an acid trip","acid trip ,","trip , Truman",", Truman winds","Truman winds up","winds up in","up in the","in the local","the local loony","local loony bin","Imprisoned in a","in a grueling","a grueling therapy","grueling therapy group","therapy group ,","group , Truman",", Truman gets","Truman gets re-acquainted","gets re-acquainted with","re-acquainted with loonies","with loonies who","loonies who are","who are his","are his old","his old cab","old cab fares","cab fares ,","fares , which",", which includes","which includes a","includes a local","a local stripper","local stripper he","stripper he has","he has insulted","has insulted more","insulted more than","more than once","In this world","this world ,","world , Truman",", Truman must","Truman must find","must find or","find or lose","or lose himself"],"2grams":["Truman Korovin","Korovin is","is a","a lonely","lonely ,",", sharp-witted","sharp-witted cab","cab driver","driver in","in Fairbanks","Fairbanks ,",", Alaska","Alaska ,",", 1980","The usual","usual routine","routine of","of picking","picking up","up fares","fares and","and spending","spending his","his nights","nights at","at his","his favorite","favorite bar","bar ,",", the","the Boatel","Boatel ,",", is","is disrupted","disrupted when","when his","his girlfriend","girlfriend ,",", Emily","Emily ,",", dumps","dumps him","him on","on one","one of","of the","the coldest","coldest nights","nights of","of the","the year","After an","an acid","acid trip","trip ,",", Truman","Truman winds","winds up","up in","in the","the local","local loony","loony bin","Imprisoned in","in a","a grueling","grueling therapy","therapy group","group ,",", Truman","Truman gets","gets re-acquainted","re-acquainted with","with loonies","loonies who","who are","are his","his old","old cab","cab fares","fares ,",", which","which includes","includes a","a local","local stripper","stripper he","he has","has insulted","insulted more","more than","than once","In this","this world","world ,",", Truman","Truman must","must find","find or","or lose","lose himself"]}

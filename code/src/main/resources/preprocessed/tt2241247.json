A nationally-ranked shot putter in college, Adriane's dream of making the USA Olympic Team in 2004 was sidelined due to a serious illness. While remaining competitive in the shot put following her recovery, Adriane discovered another field of competition in which she could test her strength and technique with heavy implements. Into the Distance is a film about the spirit of a competitor, whose challenges lie in the distance, where a thrower must ultimately measure her resolve and strength.","genres":["Biography"," Sport","

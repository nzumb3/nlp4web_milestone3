{"title":"Merqana","plot":"\"Merqana\" explores the social universe of qat, cutting through an only apparently ordinary day in the plant's commodity chain. It follows the fascinating work of Ramadan, a young farmer; Jarso, a successful merchant; and Amir, a young religious leader with a passion for long chewing sessions and traditional Sufi chants. The film unfolds the ways this little-known plant has become extremely popular among the people of Harar, becoming the main source of income for poor farmers and wealthy businessmen.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Merqana","\"","explor","the","social","univers","of","qat",",","cut","through","an","onli","appar","ordinari","day","in","the","plant","'s","commod","chain",".","It","follow","the","fascin","work","of","Ramadan",",","a","young","farmer",";","Jarso",",","a","success","merchant",";","and","Amir",",","a","young","religi","leader","with","a","passion","for","long","chew","session","and","tradit","Sufi","chant",".","The","film","unfold","the","way","this","little-known","plant","has","becom","extrem","popular","among","the","peopl","of","Harar",",","becom","the","main","sourc","of","incom","for","poor","farmer","and","wealthi","businessmen","."],"lemmas":["``","Merqana","''","explore","the","social","universe","of","qat",",","cut","through","a","only","apparently","ordinary","day","in","the","plant","'s","commodity","chain",".","it","follow","the","fascinating","work","of","Ramadan",",","a","young","farmer",";","Jarso",",","a","successful","merchant",";","and","Amir",",","a","young","religious","leader","with","a","passion","for","long","chewing","session","and","traditional","sufi","chant",".","the","film","unfold","the","way","this","little-known","plant","have","become","extremely","popular","among","the","people","of","Harar",",","become","the","main","source","of","income","for","poor","farmer","and","wealthy","businessman","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" Merqana \"","Merqana \" explores","\" explores the","explores the social","the social universe","social universe of","universe of qat","of qat ,","qat , cutting",", cutting through","cutting through an","through an only","an only apparently","only apparently ordinary","apparently ordinary day","ordinary day in","day in the","in the plant","the plant 's","plant 's commodity","'s commodity chain","It follows the","follows the fascinating","the fascinating work","fascinating work of","work of Ramadan","of Ramadan ,","Ramadan , a",", a young","a young farmer","young farmer ;","farmer ; Jarso","; Jarso ,","Jarso , a",", a successful","a successful merchant","successful merchant ;","merchant ; and","; and Amir","and Amir ,","Amir , a",", a young","a young religious","young religious leader","religious leader with","leader with a","with a passion","a passion for","passion for long","for long chewing","long chewing sessions","chewing sessions and","sessions and traditional","and traditional Sufi","traditional Sufi chants","The film unfolds","film unfolds the","unfolds the ways","the ways this","ways this little-known","this little-known plant","little-known plant has","plant has become","has become extremely","become extremely popular","extremely popular among","popular among the","among the people","the people of","people of Harar","of Harar ,","Harar , becoming",", becoming the","becoming the main","the main source","main source of","source of income","of income for","income for poor","for poor farmers","poor farmers and","farmers and wealthy","and wealthy businessmen"],"2grams":["\" Merqana","Merqana \"","\" explores","explores the","the social","social universe","universe of","of qat","qat ,",", cutting","cutting through","through an","an only","only apparently","apparently ordinary","ordinary day","day in","in the","the plant","plant 's","'s commodity","commodity chain","It follows","follows the","the fascinating","fascinating work","work of","of Ramadan","Ramadan ,",", a","a young","young farmer","farmer ;","; Jarso","Jarso ,",", a","a successful","successful merchant","merchant ;","; and","and Amir","Amir ,",", a","a young","young religious","religious leader","leader with","with a","a passion","passion for","for long","long chewing","chewing sessions","sessions and","and traditional","traditional Sufi","Sufi chants","The film","film unfolds","unfolds the","the ways","ways this","this little-known","little-known plant","plant has","has become","become extremely","extremely popular","popular among","among the","the people","people of","of Harar","Harar ,",", becoming","becoming the","the main","main source","source of","of income","income for","for poor","poor farmers","farmers and","and wealthy","wealthy businessmen"]}

{"title":"From the Heart of Odessa","plot":"Alec Kopyt, a musician from Amsterdam returns to Moldavanka - the former Jewish neighbourhood of Odessa - his place of birth and the cradle of old-time Russian Mafia songs (Blatnyak). He is looking for musicians to play together these songs in the restaurant of an old friend. While strolling along the picturesque yards of the ruinous slums, we meet colourful Odesits who resemble the ancient heroes of the street songs we hear. A touching portrait of a neighbourhood, its music and performers.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Alec","Kopyt",",","a","musician","from","Amsterdam","return","to","Moldavanka","-","the","former","Jewish","neighbourhood","of","Odessa","-","his","place","of","birth","and","the","cradl","of","old-tim","Russian","Mafia","song","(","Blatnyak",")",".","He","is","look","for","musician","to","play","togeth","these","song","in","the","restaur","of","an","old","friend",".","While","stroll","along","the","picturesqu","yard","of","the","ruinous","slum",",","we","meet","colour","Odesit","who","resembl","the","ancient","hero","of","the","street","song","we","hear",".","A","touch","portrait","of","a","neighbourhood",",","it","music","and","perform","."],"lemmas":["Alec","Kopyt",",","a","musician","from","Amsterdam","return","to","Moldavanka","-","the","former","jewish","neighbourhood","of","Odessa","-","he","place","of","birth","and","the","cradle","of","old-time","Russian","Mafia","song","-lrb-","blatnyak","-rrb-",".","he","be","look","for","musician","to","play","together","these","song","in","the","restaurant","of","a","old","friend",".","while","stroll","along","the","picturesque","yard","of","the","ruinous","slum",",","we","meet","colourful","odesit","who","resemble","the","ancient","hero","of","the","street","song","we","hear",".","a","touch","portrait","of","a","neighbourhood",",","its","music","and","performer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Alec Kopyt ,","Kopyt , a",", a musician","a musician from","musician from Amsterdam","from Amsterdam returns","Amsterdam returns to","returns to Moldavanka","to Moldavanka -","Moldavanka - the","- the former","the former Jewish","former Jewish neighbourhood","Jewish neighbourhood of","neighbourhood of Odessa","of Odessa -","Odessa - his","- his place","his place of","place of birth","of birth and","birth and the","and the cradle","the cradle of","cradle of old-time","of old-time Russian","old-time Russian Mafia","Russian Mafia songs","Mafia songs (","songs ( Blatnyak","( Blatnyak )","He is looking","is looking for","looking for musicians","for musicians to","musicians to play","to play together","play together these","together these songs","these songs in","songs in the","in the restaurant","the restaurant of","restaurant of an","of an old","an old friend","While strolling along","strolling along the","along the picturesque","the picturesque yards","picturesque yards of","yards of the","of the ruinous","the ruinous slums","ruinous slums ,","slums , we",", we meet","we meet colourful","meet colourful Odesits","colourful Odesits who","Odesits who resemble","who resemble the","resemble the ancient","the ancient heroes","ancient heroes of","heroes of the","of the street","the street songs","street songs we","songs we hear","A touching portrait","touching portrait of","portrait of a","of a neighbourhood","a neighbourhood ,","neighbourhood , its",", its music","its music and","music and performers"],"2grams":["Alec Kopyt","Kopyt ,",", a","a musician","musician from","from Amsterdam","Amsterdam returns","returns to","to Moldavanka","Moldavanka -","- the","the former","former Jewish","Jewish neighbourhood","neighbourhood of","of Odessa","Odessa -","- his","his place","place of","of birth","birth and","and the","the cradle","cradle of","of old-time","old-time Russian","Russian Mafia","Mafia songs","songs (","( Blatnyak","Blatnyak )","He is","is looking","looking for","for musicians","musicians to","to play","play together","together these","these songs","songs in","in the","the restaurant","restaurant of","of an","an old","old friend","While strolling","strolling along","along the","the picturesque","picturesque yards","yards of","of the","the ruinous","ruinous slums","slums ,",", we","we meet","meet colourful","colourful Odesits","Odesits who","who resemble","resemble the","the ancient","ancient heroes","heroes of","of the","the street","street songs","songs we","we hear","A touching","touching portrait","portrait of","of a","a neighbourhood","neighbourhood ,",", its","its music","music and","and performers"]}

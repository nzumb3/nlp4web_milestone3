{"title":"Terra Mia Terra Nostra","plot":"\"Terra Mia Terra Nostra\" is more than a family movie. Through the life of characters we first met 14 years ago, the film tackles the universal question of belonging to a particular country. It looks at the clash of languages, traditions and cultures, as well as the passage of generations that means memories are lost to an imaginary Italy. Today's life is elsewhere. The sense of double belonging and of dual nationality is transposed into a constant search for meaning. Where can one find balance? How can one define oneself?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Terra","Mia","Terra","Nostra","\"","is","more","than","a","famili","movi",".","Through","the","life","of","charact","we","first","met","14","year","ago",",","the","film","tackl","the","univers","question","of","belong","to","a","particular","countri",".","It","look","at","the","clash","of","languag",",","tradit","and","cultur",",","as","well","as","the","passag","of","generat","that","mean","memori","are","lost","to","an","imaginari","Itali",".","Today","'s","life","is","elsewher",".","The","sens","of","doubl","belong","and","of","dual","nation","is","transpos","into","a","constant","search","for","mean",".","Where","can","one","find","balanc","?","How","can","one","defin","oneself","?"],"lemmas":["``","Terra","Mia","Terra","Nostra","''","be","more","than","a","family","movie",".","through","the","life","of","character","we","first","meet","14","year","ago",",","the","film","tackle","the","universal","question","of","belong","to","a","particular","country",".","it","look","at","the","clash","of","language",",","tradition","and","culture",",","as","well","as","the","passage","of","generation","that","mean","memory","be","lose","to","a","imaginary","Italy",".","today","'s","life","be","elsewhere",".","the","sense","of","double","belong","and","of","dual","nationality","be","transpose","into","a","constant","search","for","meaning",".","where","can","one","find","balance","?","how","can","one","define","oneself","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" Terra Mia","Terra Mia Terra","Mia Terra Nostra","Terra Nostra \"","Nostra \" is","\" is more","is more than","more than a","than a family","a family movie","Through the life","the life of","life of characters","of characters we","characters we first","we first met","first met 14","met 14 years","14 years ago","years ago ,","ago , the",", the film","the film tackles","film tackles the","tackles the universal","the universal question","universal question of","question of belonging","of belonging to","belonging to a","to a particular","a particular country","It looks at","looks at the","at the clash","the clash of","clash of languages","of languages ,","languages , traditions",", traditions and","traditions and cultures","and cultures ,","cultures , as",", as well","as well as","well as the","as the passage","the passage of","passage of generations","of generations that","generations that means","that means memories","means memories are","memories are lost","are lost to","lost to an","to an imaginary","an imaginary Italy","Today 's life","'s life is","life is elsewhere","The sense of","sense of double","of double belonging","double belonging and","belonging and of","and of dual","of dual nationality","dual nationality is","nationality is transposed","is transposed into","transposed into a","into a constant","a constant search","constant search for","search for meaning","Where can one","can one find","one find balance","How can one","can one define","one define oneself"],"2grams":["\" Terra","Terra Mia","Mia Terra","Terra Nostra","Nostra \"","\" is","is more","more than","than a","a family","family movie","Through the","the life","life of","of characters","characters we","we first","first met","met 14","14 years","years ago","ago ,",", the","the film","film tackles","tackles the","the universal","universal question","question of","of belonging","belonging to","to a","a particular","particular country","It looks","looks at","at the","the clash","clash of","of languages","languages ,",", traditions","traditions and","and cultures","cultures ,",", as","as well","well as","as the","the passage","passage of","of generations","generations that","that means","means memories","memories are","are lost","lost to","to an","an imaginary","imaginary Italy","Today 's","'s life","life is","is elsewhere","The sense","sense of","of double","double belonging","belonging and","and of","of dual","dual nationality","nationality is","is transposed","transposed into","into a","a constant","constant search","search for","for meaning","Where can","can one","one find","find balance","How can","can one","one define","define oneself"]}

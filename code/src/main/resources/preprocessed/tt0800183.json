{"title":"Dead Write","plot":"After driving husband Martin to infidelity and catching him with another, mentally unstable author Jade returns to her New Zealand home. The plan is to write a book based on the town's history, helped by the local school teacher and her college thesis protégée, and visit her father Christopher. As her editor later explains, her suspicions concerning ever more locals stem from a pathological mental condition. However, more then just paranoia comes with the horse riding incident which killed her ma, an obsessive guilt matter for her and Christopher.","genres":["Mystery"," Thriller"],"stems":["After","drive","husband","Martin","to","infidel","and","catch","him","with","anoth",",","mental","unstabl","author","Jade","return","to","her","New","Zealand","home",".","The","plan","is","to","write","a","book","base","on","the","town","'s","histori",",","help","by","the","local","school","teacher","and","her","colleg","thesi","protégé",",","and","visit","her","father","Christoph",".","As","her","editor","later","explain",",","her","suspicion","concern","ever","more","local","stem","from","a","patholog","mental","condit",".","Howev",",","more","then","just","paranoia","come","with","the","hors","ride","incid","which","kill","her","ma",",","an","obsess","guilt","matter","for","her","and","Christoph","."],"lemmas":["after","drive","husband","Martin","to","infidelity","and","catch","he","with","another",",","mentally","unstable","author","jade","return","to","she","New","Zealand","home",".","the","plan","be","to","write","a","book","base","on","the","town","'s","history",",","help","by","the","local","school","teacher","and","she","college","thesis","protégée",",","and","visit","she","father","Christopher",".","as","she","editor","later","explain",",","she","suspicion","concern","ever","more","local","stem","from","a","pathological","mental","condition",".","however",",","more","then","just","paranoia","come","with","the","horse","ride","incident","which","kill","she","ma",",","a","obsessive","guilt","matter","for","she","and","Christopher","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After driving husband","driving husband Martin","husband Martin to","Martin to infidelity","to infidelity and","infidelity and catching","and catching him","catching him with","him with another","with another ,","another , mentally",", mentally unstable","mentally unstable author","unstable author Jade","author Jade returns","Jade returns to","returns to her","to her New","her New Zealand","New Zealand home","The plan is","plan is to","is to write","to write a","write a book","a book based","book based on","based on the","on the town","the town 's","town 's history","'s history ,","history , helped",", helped by","helped by the","by the local","the local school","local school teacher","school teacher and","teacher and her","and her college","her college thesis","college thesis protégée","thesis protégée ,","protégée , and",", and visit","and visit her","visit her father","her father Christopher","As her editor","her editor later","editor later explains","later explains ,","explains , her",", her suspicions","her suspicions concerning","suspicions concerning ever","concerning ever more","ever more locals","more locals stem","locals stem from","stem from a","from a pathological","a pathological mental","pathological mental condition","However , more",", more then","more then just","then just paranoia","just paranoia comes","paranoia comes with","comes with the","with the horse","the horse riding","horse riding incident","riding incident which","incident which killed","which killed her","killed her ma","her ma ,","ma , an",", an obsessive","an obsessive guilt","obsessive guilt matter","guilt matter for","matter for her","for her and","her and Christopher"],"2grams":["After driving","driving husband","husband Martin","Martin to","to infidelity","infidelity and","and catching","catching him","him with","with another","another ,",", mentally","mentally unstable","unstable author","author Jade","Jade returns","returns to","to her","her New","New Zealand","Zealand home","The plan","plan is","is to","to write","write a","a book","book based","based on","on the","the town","town 's","'s history","history ,",", helped","helped by","by the","the local","local school","school teacher","teacher and","and her","her college","college thesis","thesis protégée","protégée ,",", and","and visit","visit her","her father","father Christopher","As her","her editor","editor later","later explains","explains ,",", her","her suspicions","suspicions concerning","concerning ever","ever more","more locals","locals stem","stem from","from a","a pathological","pathological mental","mental condition","However ,",", more","more then","then just","just paranoia","paranoia comes","comes with","with the","the horse","horse riding","riding incident","incident which","which killed","killed her","her ma","ma ,",", an","an obsessive","obsessive guilt","guilt matter","matter for","for her","her and","and Christopher"]}

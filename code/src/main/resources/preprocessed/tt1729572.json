{"title":"The Son of the Olive Merchant","plot":"For their honeymoon, Anna and Mathieu went to Turkey. With camera in hand, they traced the footsteps of Garabed, the Armenian grand-father of Mathieu, who escape the 1915 genocide. They are determined to learn more about Mathew's Armenian origins. In this country where speaking of the Armenian genocide could be dangerous, their name with Turkish intonations serves a purpose to get people talking about their idea of the Turkish involvement during 1915 tragedy. A road trip across the country mixing animation with documentary, to report a sad confirmation: The denial has become an institution, rewriting the history books and pretending that there was a genocide, but a genocide committed by the Armenians against the Turks.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary","

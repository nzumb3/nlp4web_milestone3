{"title":"Father and Son","plot":"A father and his son live together in a roof-top apartment. They have lived alone for years in their own private world, full of memories and daily rites. Sometimes they seem like brothers. Sometimes even like lovers. Following in his father's path, Aleksei attends military school. He likes sports, tends to be irresponsible and has problems with his girlfriend. She is jealous of Aleksei's close relationship with his father. Despite knowing that all sons must one day live their own lives, Aleksei is conflicted; his father knows he should accept a better job in another city, perhaps search for a new wife, but who will ease the pain of Aleksei's nightmares?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","father","and","his","son","live","togeth","in","a","roof-top","apart",".","They","have","live","alon","for","year","in","their","own","privat","world",",","full","of","memori","and","daili","rite",".","Sometim","they","seem","like","brother",".","Sometim","even","like","lover",".","Follow","in","his","father","'s","path",",","Aleksei","attend","militari","school",".","He","like","sport",",","tend","to","be","irrespons","and","has","problem","with","his","girlfriend",".","She","is","jealous","of","Aleksei","'s","close","relationship","with","his","father",".","Despit","know","that","all","son","must","one","day","live","their","own","live",",","Aleksei","is","conflict",";","his","father","know","he","should","accept","a","better","job","in","anoth","citi",",","perhap","search","for","a","new","wife",",","but","who","will","eas","the","pain","of","Aleksei","'s","nightmar","?"],"lemmas":["a","father","and","he","son","live","together","in","a","roof-top","apartment",".","they","have","live","alone","for","year","in","they","own","private","world",",","full","of","memory","and","daily","rite",".","sometimes","they","seem","like","brother",".","sometimes","even","like","lover",".","follow","in","he","father","'s","path",",","Aleksei","attend","military","school",".","he","like","sport",",","tend","to","be","irresponsible","and","have","problem","with","he","girlfriend",".","she","be","jealous","of","Aleksei","'s","close","relationship","with","he","father",".","despite","know","that","all","son","must","one","day","live","they","own","life",",","Aleksei","be","conflict",";","he","father","know","he","should","accept","a","better","job","in","another","city",",","perhaps","search","for","a","new","wife",",","but","who","will","ease","the","pain","of","Aleksei","'s","nightmare","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A father and","father and his","and his son","his son live","son live together","live together in","together in a","in a roof-top","a roof-top apartment","They have lived","have lived alone","lived alone for","alone for years","for years in","years in their","in their own","their own private","own private world","private world ,","world , full",", full of","full of memories","of memories and","memories and daily","and daily rites","Sometimes they seem","they seem like","seem like brothers","Sometimes even like","even like lovers","Following in his","in his father","his father 's","father 's path","'s path ,","path , Aleksei",", Aleksei attends","Aleksei attends military","attends military school","He likes sports","likes sports ,","sports , tends",", tends to","tends to be","to be irresponsible","be irresponsible and","irresponsible and has","and has problems","has problems with","problems with his","with his girlfriend","She is jealous","is jealous of","jealous of Aleksei","of Aleksei 's","Aleksei 's close","'s close relationship","close relationship with","relationship with his","with his father","Despite knowing that","knowing that all","that all sons","all sons must","sons must one","must one day","one day live","day live their","live their own","their own lives","own lives ,","lives , Aleksei",", Aleksei is","Aleksei is conflicted","is conflicted ;","conflicted ;

{"title":"Russian Kids of Montreal","plot":"Who needs the Russian language outside of Russia? Can it just be forgotten? How do Russian immigrants living in Montreal relate to their motherland? Do they want to pass the culture and traditions on to their children? The authors of \"Russian Kids of Montreal\" attempt to answer these questions. The result is a collective image of families that have crossed paths in the bilingual Canadian City of Montreal. The documentary addresses the problems of adaptation to a new life and the will to preserve a cultural heritage. It is a reflection on how people's self-perception evolves away from their motherland and an attempt to find an answer to the question \"Who am I?\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Who","need","the","Russian","languag","outsid","of","Russia","?","Can","it","just","be","forgotten","?","How","do","Russian","immigr","live","in","Montreal","relat","to","their","motherland","?","Do","they","want","to","pass","the","cultur","and","tradit","on","to","their","children","?","The","author","of","\"","Russian","Kid","of","Montreal","\"","attempt","to","answer","these","question",".","The","result","is","a","collect","imag","of","famili","that","have","cross","path","in","the","bilingu","Canadian","Citi","of","Montreal",".","The","documentari","address","the","problem","of","adapt","to","a","new","life","and","the","will","to","preserv","a","cultur","heritag",".","It","is","a","reflect","on","how","peopl","'s","self-percept","evolv","away","from","their","motherland","and","an","attempt","to","find","an","answer","to","the","question","\"","Who","am","I","?","\""],"lemmas":["who","need","the","russian","language","outside","of","Russia","?","can","it","just","be","forget","?","how","do","russian","immigrant","live","in","Montreal","relate","to","they","motherland","?","do","they","want","to","pass","the","culture","and","tradition","on","to","they","child","?","the","author","of","``","russian","kid","of","Montreal","''","attempt","to","answer","these","question",".","the","result","be","a","collective","image","of","family","that","have","cross","path","in","the","bilingual","Canadian","City","of","Montreal",".","the","documentary","address","the","problem","of","adaptation","to","a","new","life","and","the","will","to","preserve","a","cultural","heritage",".","it","be","a","reflection","on","how","people","'s","self-perception","evolve","away","from","they","motherland","and","a","attempt","to","find","a","answer","to","the","question","``","who","be","I","?","''"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Who needs the","needs the Russian","the Russian language","Russian language outside","language outside of","outside of Russia","Can it just","it just be","just be forgotten","How do Russian","do Russian immigrants","Russian immigrants living","immigrants living in","living in Montreal","in Montreal relate","Montreal relate to","relate to their","to their motherland","Do they want","they want to","want to pass","to pass the","pass the culture","the culture and","culture and traditions","and traditions on","traditions on to","on to their","to their children","The authors of","authors of \"","of \" Russian","\" Russian Kids","Russian Kids of","Kids of Montreal","of Montreal \"","Montreal \" attempt","\" attempt to","attempt to answer","to answer these","answer these questions","The result is","result is a","is a collective","a collective image","collective image of","image of families","of families that","families that have","that have crossed","have crossed paths","crossed paths in","paths in the","in the bilingual","the bilingual Canadian","bilingual Canadian City","Canadian City of","City of Montreal","The documentary addresses","documentary addresses the","addresses the problems","the problems of","problems of adaptation","of adaptation to","adaptation to a","to a new","a new life","new life and","life and the","and the will","the will to","will to preserve","to preserve a","preserve a cultural","a cultural heritage","It is a","is a reflection","a reflection on","reflection on how","on how people","how people 's","people 's self-perception","'s self-perception evolves","self-perception evolves away","evolves away from","away from their","from their motherland","their motherland and","motherland and an","and an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to find","to find an","find an answer","an answer to","answer to the","to the question","the question \"","question \" Who","\" Who am","Who am I","am I ?","I ?

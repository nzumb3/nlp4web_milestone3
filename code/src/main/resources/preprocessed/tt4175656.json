{"title":"Surviving the Peace","plot":"Struggling to come to terms with her father's suicide, a daughter unearths the elusive layers of his mental health when Veterans Affairs reopens his medical records. Andy Pelecis's case is one of the first psychological autopsies in the VA system. Andy's death drove his daughter, Mara, to ask: 'How could he survive the war, but not the peace?' She seeks out other veterans to resolve questions he refused to answer. Rolling Thunder bikers, Veterans for Peace, National Guard and Native American veterans share stories of flashbacks, feelings of survival guilt, and fears of being committed. Combining Andy's Bolex footage with Mara's documentation of the family for 20 years- this is a true story of the fallout of war on a veteran and his family over decades.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Struggl","to","come","to","term","with","her","father","'s","suicid",",","a","daughter","unearth","the","elus","layer","of","his","mental","health","when","Veteran","Affair","reopen","his","medic","record",".","Andi","Peleci","'s","case","is","one","of","the","first","psycholog","autopsi","in","the","VA","system",".","Andi","'s","death","drove","his","daughter",",","Mara",",","to","ask",":","'","How","could","he","surviv","the","war",",","but","not","the","peac","?","'","She","seek","out","other","veteran","to","resolv","question","he","refus","to","answer",".","Roll","Thunder","biker",",","Veteran","for","Peac",",","Nation","Guard","and","Nativ","American","veteran","share","stori","of","flashback",",","feel","of","surviv","guilt",",","and","fear","of","be","commit",".","Combin","Andi","'s","Bolex","footag","with","Mara","'s","document","of","the","famili","for","20","year","-","this","is","a","true","stori","of","the","fallout","of","war","on","a","veteran","and","his","famili","over","decad","."],"lemmas":["struggle","to","come","to","term","with","she","father","'s","suicide",",","a","daughter","unearth","the","elusive","layer","of","he","mental","health","when","Veterans","Affairs","reopen","he","medical","record",".","Andy","Pelecis","'s","case","be","one","of","the","first","psychological","autopsy","in","the","va","system",".","Andy","'s","death","drive","he","daughter",",","Mara",",","to","ask",":","'","how","could","he","survive","the","war",",","but","not","the","peace","?","'","she","seek","out","other","veteran","to","resolve","question","he","refuse","to","answer",".","Rolling","Thunder","biker",",","Veterans","for","Peace",",","National","Guard","and","native","american","veteran","share","story","of","flashback",",","feeling","of","survival","guilt",",","and","fear","of","be","commit",".","combine","Andy","'s","Bolex","footage","with","Mara","'s","documentation","of","the","family","for","20","year","-","this","be","a","true","story","of","the","fallout","of","war","on","a","veteran","and","he","family","over","decade","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Struggling to come","to come to","come to terms","to terms with","terms with her","with her father","her father 's","father 's suicide","'s suicide ,","suicide , a",", a daughter","a daughter unearths","daughter unearths the","unearths the elusive","the elusive layers","elusive layers of","layers of his","of his mental","his mental health","mental health when","health when Veterans","when Veterans Affairs","Veterans Affairs reopens","Affairs reopens his","reopens his medical","his medical records","Andy Pelecis 's","Pelecis 's case","'s case is","case is one","is one of","one of the","of the first","the first psychological","first psychological autopsies","psychological autopsies in","autopsies in the","in the VA","the VA system","Andy 's death","'s death drove","death drove his","drove his daughter","his daughter ,","daughter , Mara",", Mara ,","Mara , to",", to ask","to ask :","ask : '",": ' How","' How could","How could he","could he survive","he survive the","survive the war","the war ,","war , but",", but not","but not the","not the peace","the peace ?","peace ?

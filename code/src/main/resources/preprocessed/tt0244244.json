{"title":"Swordfish","plot":"When the DEA shut down its dummy corporation operation codenamed SWORDFISH in 1986, they had generated $400 million which they let sit around; fifteen years of compound interest has swelled it to $9.5 billion. A covert counter-terrorist unit called Black Cell, headed by the duplicitious and suave Gabriel Shear, wants the money to help finance their raise-the-stakes vengeance war against international terrorism, but it's all locked away behind super-encryption. He brings in convicted hacker Stanley Jobson, who only wants to see his daughter Holly again but can't afford the legal fees, to slice into the government mainframes and get the money.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Crime"],"stems":["When","the","DEA","shut","down","it","dummi","corpor","oper","codenam","SWORDFISH","in","1986",",","they","had","generat","$","400","million","which","they","let","sit","around",";","fifteen","year","of","compound","interest","has","swell","it","to","$","9.5","billion",".","A","covert","counter-terrorist","unit","call","Black","Cell",",","head","by","the","dupliciti","and","suav","Gabriel","Shear",",","want","the","money","to","help","financ","their","raise-the-stak","vengeanc","war","against","intern","terror",",","but","it","'s","all","lock","away","behind","super-encrypt",".","He","bring","in","convict","hacker","Stanley","Jobson",",","who","onli","want","to","see","his","daughter","Holli","again","but","ca","n't","afford","the","legal","fee",",","to","slice","into","the","govern","mainfram","and","get","the","money","."],"lemmas":["when","the","DEA","shut","down","its","dummy","corporation","operation","codename","SWORDFISH","in","1986",",","they","have","generate","$","400","million","which","they","let","sit","around",";","fifteen","year","of","compound","interest","have","swell","it","to","$","9.5","billion",".","a","covert","counter-terrorist","unit","call","Black","Cell",",","head","by","the","duplicitious","and","suave","Gabriel","Shear",",","want","the","money","to","help","finance","they","raise-the-stakes","vengeance","war","against","international","terrorism",",","but","it","be","all","lock","away","behind","super-encryption",".","he","bring","in","convict","hacker","Stanley","Jobson",",","who","only","want","to","see","he","daughter","Holly","again","but","can","not","afford","the","legal","fee",",","to","slice","into","the","government","mainframe","and","get","the","money","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When the DEA","the DEA shut","DEA shut down","shut down its","down its dummy","its dummy corporation","dummy corporation operation","corporation operation codenamed","operation codenamed SWORDFISH","codenamed SWORDFISH in","SWORDFISH in 1986","in 1986 ,","1986 , they",", they had","they had generated","had generated $","generated $ 400","$ 400 million","400 million which","million which they","which they let","they let sit","let sit around","sit around ;","around ;

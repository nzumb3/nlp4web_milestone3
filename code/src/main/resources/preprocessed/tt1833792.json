{"title":"Speaking of Abstraction: A Universal Language","plot":"At the beginning of the twenty-first century, abstraction - that most quintessentially modernist innovation - maintains a peculiarly contradictory position. Used, on one hand, by post-modernist artists as just one more quotable style amongst many, it is on the other hand still considered an elitist or hermetic language by audiences intimidated by its lack of recognizable subject matter. Yet ultimately, abstraction continues to be a viable creative path for contemporary artists of all generations, many of whom embrace it as the most inclusive and fundamentally resonant of artistic languages. Filmed at the artists' studios, the Dia Center for the Arts, and the Guggenheim Museum during their exhibition, \"Abstraction in the Twentieth Century.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["At","the","begin","of","the","twenty-first","centuri",",","abstract","-","that","most","quintessenti","modernist","innov","-","maintain","a","peculiar","contradictori","posit",".","Used",",","on","one","hand",",","by","post-modernist","artist","as","just","one","more","quotabl","style","amongst","mani",",","it","is","on","the","other","hand","still","consid","an","elitist","or","hermet","languag","by","audienc","intimid","by","it","lack","of","recogniz","subject","matter",".","Yet","ultim",",","abstract","continu","to","be","a","viabl","creativ","path","for","contemporari","artist","of","all","generat",",","mani","of","whom","embrac","it","as","the","most","inclus","and","fundament","reson","of","artist","languag",".","Film","at","the","artist","'","studio",",","the","Dia","Center","for","the","Arts",",","and","the","Guggenheim","Museum","dure","their","exhibit",",","\"","Abstraction","in","the","Twentieth","Centuri",".","\""],"lemmas":["at","the","beginning","of","the","twenty-first","century",",","abstraction","-","that","most","quintessentially","modernist","innovation","-","maintain","a","peculiarly","contradictory","position",".","use",",","on","one","hand",",","by","post-modernist","artist","as","just","one","more","quotable","style","amongst","many",",","it","be","on","the","other","hand","still","consider","a","elitist","or","hermetic","language","by","audience","intimidate","by","its","lack","of","recognizable","subject","matter",".","yet","ultimately",",","abstraction","continue","to","be","a","viable","creative","path","for","contemporary","artist","of","all","generation",",","many","of","whom","embrace","it","as","the","most","inclusive","and","fundamentally","resonant","of","artistic","language",".","film","at","the","artist","'","studio",",","the","Dia","Center","for","the","Arts",",","and","the","Guggenheim","Museum","during","they","exhibition",",","``","abstraction","in","the","Twentieth","Century",".","''"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["At the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of the","of the twenty-first","the twenty-first century","twenty-first century ,","century , abstraction",", abstraction -","abstraction -

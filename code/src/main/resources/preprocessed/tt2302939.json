{"title":"Trannysnatchers!","plot":"Outside a small, typical American town, an elusive cult of demon worshiping gender queer assassins live in infamy, awaiting the day their savior will return to Earth & end the Gender Binary. Within the context of an avant-garde horror film, we examine cinematic stereotypes and exploit them to our darkest advantage. This film was made over two summers in Portland, Oregon by a group of young artists as an exercise in trust & complete collaboration. Trannysnatchers! is a document of a life-changing work for all involved.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["Outsid","a","small",",","typic","American","town",",","an","elus","cult","of","demon","worship","gender","queer","assassin","live","in","infami",",","await","the","day","their","savior","will","return","to","Earth","&","end","the","Gender","Binari",".","Within","the","context","of","an","avant-gard","horror","film",",","we","examin","cinemat","stereotyp","and","exploit","them","to","our","darkest","advantag",".","This","film","was","made","over","two","summer","in","Portland",",","Oregon","by","a","group","of","young","artist","as","an","exercis","in","trust","&","complet","collabor",".","Trannysnatch","!","is","a","document","of","a","life-chang","work","for","all","involv","."],"lemmas":["outside","a","small",",","typical","american","town",",","a","elusive","cult","of","demon","worship","gender","queer","assassin","live","in","infamy",",","await","the","day","they","savior","will","return","to","Earth","&","end","the","gender","Binary",".","within","the","context","of","a","avant-garde","horror","film",",","we","examine","cinematic","stereotype","and","exploit","they","to","we","darkest","advantage",".","this","film","be","make","over","two","summer","in","Portland",",","Oregon","by","a","group","of","young","artist","as","a","exercise","in","trust","&","complete","collaboration",".","trannysnatcher","!","be","a","document","of","a","life-changing","work","for","all","involve","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Outside a small","a small ,","small , typical",", typical American","typical American town","American town ,","town , an",", an elusive","an elusive cult","elusive cult of","cult of demon","of demon worshiping","demon worshiping gender","worshiping gender queer","gender queer assassins","queer assassins live","assassins live in","live in infamy","in infamy ,","infamy , awaiting",", awaiting the","awaiting the day","the day their","day their savior","their savior will","savior will return","will return to","return to Earth","to Earth &","Earth & end","& end the","end the Gender","the Gender Binary","Within the context","the context of","context of an","of an avant-garde","an avant-garde horror","avant-garde horror film","horror film ,","film , we",", we examine","we examine cinematic","examine cinematic stereotypes","cinematic stereotypes and","stereotypes and exploit","and exploit them","exploit them to","them to our","to our darkest","our darkest advantage","This film was","film was made","was made over","made over two","over two summers","two summers in","summers in Portland","in Portland ,","Portland , Oregon",", Oregon by","Oregon by a","by a group","a group of","group of young","of young artists","young artists as","artists as an","as an exercise","an exercise in","exercise in trust","in trust &","trust & complete","& complete collaboration","is a document","a document of","document of a","of a life-changing","a life-changing work","life-changing work for","work for all","for all involved"],"2grams":["Outside a","a small","small ,",", typical","typical American","American town","town ,",", an","an elusive","elusive cult","cult of","of demon","demon worshiping","worshiping gender","gender queer","queer assassins","assassins live","live in","in infamy","infamy ,",", awaiting","awaiting the","the day","day their","their savior","savior will","will return","return to","to Earth","Earth &","& end","end the","the Gender","Gender Binary","Within the","the context","context of","of an","an avant-garde","avant-garde horror","horror film","film ,",", we","we examine","examine cinematic","cinematic stereotypes","stereotypes and","and exploit","exploit them","them to","to our","our darkest","darkest advantage","This film","film was","was made","made over","over two","two summers","summers in","in Portland","Portland ,",", Oregon","Oregon by","by a","a group","group of","of young","young artists","artists as","as an","an exercise","exercise in","in trust","trust &","& complete","complete collaboration","is a","a document","document of","of a","a life-changing","life-changing work","work for","for all","all involved"]}

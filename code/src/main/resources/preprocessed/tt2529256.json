{"title":"The Girl from Nagasaki","plot":"'The Girl from Nagasaki' is a 3D feature film production of the classic Puccini Opera 'Madam Butterfly,' directed by world renown photographer Michel Comte. It's a modern day tale that starts with the young Madame Butterfly emerging from the ashes of the atomic bomb in Nagasaki. By a subtle meshing of reality and fantasy, Michel Comte and his team bring to the screen a visual orgy of modern ballet, opera and narrative film-making.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["'","The","Girl","from","Nagasaki","'","is","a","3D","featur","film","product","of","the","classic","Puccini","Opera","'","Madam","Butterfli",",","'","direct","by","world","renown","photograph","Michel","Comt",".","It","'s","a","modern","day","tale","that","start","with","the","young","Madam","Butterfli","emerg","from","the","ash","of","the","atom","bomb","in","Nagasaki",".","By","a","subtl","mesh","of","realiti","and","fantasi",",","Michel","Comt","and","his","team","bring","to","the","screen","a","visual","orgi","of","modern","ballet",",","opera","and","narrat","film-mak","."],"lemmas":["'","the","Girl","from","Nagasaki","'","be","a","3d","feature","film","production","of","the","classic","Puccini","Opera","'","Madam","Butterfly",",","'","direct","by","world","renown","photographer","Michel","Comte",".","it","be","a","modern","day","tale","that","start","with","the","young","Madame","Butterfly","emerge","from","the","ash","of","the","atomic","bomb","in","Nagasaki",".","by","a","subtle","meshing","of","reality","and","fantasy",",","Michel","Comte","and","he","team","bring","to","the","screen","a","visual","orgy","of","modern","ballet",",","opera","and","narrative","film-making","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["' The Girl","The Girl from","Girl from Nagasaki","from Nagasaki '","Nagasaki ' is","' is a","is a 3D","a 3D feature","3D feature film","feature film production","film production of","production of the","of the classic","the classic Puccini","classic Puccini Opera","Puccini Opera '","Opera ' Madam","' Madam Butterfly","Madam Butterfly ,","Butterfly , '",", ' directed","' directed by","directed by world","by world renown","world renown photographer","renown photographer Michel","photographer Michel Comte","It 's a","'s a modern","a modern day","modern day tale","day tale that","tale that starts","that starts with","starts with the","with the young","the young Madame","young Madame Butterfly","Madame Butterfly emerging","Butterfly emerging from","emerging from the","from the ashes","the ashes of","ashes of the","of the atomic","the atomic bomb","atomic bomb in","bomb in Nagasaki","By a subtle","a subtle meshing","subtle meshing of","meshing of reality","of reality and","reality and fantasy","and fantasy ,","fantasy , Michel",", Michel Comte","Michel Comte and","Comte and his","and his team","his team bring","team bring to","bring to the","to the screen","the screen a","screen a visual","a visual orgy","visual orgy of","orgy of modern","of modern ballet","modern ballet ,","ballet , opera",", opera and","opera and narrative","and narrative film-making"],"2grams":["' The","The Girl","Girl from","from Nagasaki","Nagasaki '","' is","is a","a 3D","3D feature","feature film","film production","production of","of the","the classic","classic Puccini","Puccini Opera","Opera '","' Madam","Madam Butterfly","Butterfly ,",", '","' directed","directed by","by world","world renown","renown photographer","photographer Michel","Michel Comte","It 's","'s a","a modern","modern day","day tale","tale that","that starts","starts with","with the","the young","young Madame","Madame Butterfly","Butterfly emerging","emerging from","from the","the ashes","ashes of","of the","the atomic","atomic bomb","bomb in","in Nagasaki","By a","a subtle","subtle meshing","meshing of","of reality","reality and","and fantasy","fantasy ,",", Michel","Michel Comte","Comte and","and his","his team","team bring","bring to","to the","the screen","screen a","a visual","visual orgy","orgy of","of modern","modern ballet","ballet ,",", opera","opera and","and narrative","narrative film-making"]}

{"title":"Our Homeland","plot":"Based on the director's own experience, Our Homeland follows a Korean family living in Japan, of which the father (Masane Tsukayama) decided to take North Korean nationality because of his strong belief decades ago. In 1997, Sonho (Arata Iura), the son of the family who was sent to North Korea under a \"repatriation program\" with the promise of a \"paradise\" free of discrimination, returns to Japan for the first time in 25 years to seek treatment for his brain tumor due to the difference in medical technology between the two countries. Allowed to stay for only three months and closely monitored by a North Korean officer (Yang Ik-Joon), Sonho is welcomed and embraced by his family and old friends but his father, who is still sticking to the belief but also feeling guilty about sending his son to North Korea at the same time, while Sonho's younger sister Rie (Sakura Andô) develops the aversion to North Korea and its political ideas.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Base","on","the","director","'s","own","experi",",","Our","Homeland","follow","a","Korean","famili","live","in","Japan",",","of","which","the","father","(","Masan","Tsukayama",")","decid","to","take","North","Korean","nation","becaus","of","his","strong","belief","decad","ago",".","In","1997",",","Sonho","(","Arata","Iura",")",",","the","son","of","the","famili","who","was","sent","to","North","Korea","under","a","\"","repatri","program","\"","with","the","promis","of","a","\"","paradis","\"","free","of","discrimin",",","return","to","Japan","for","the","first","time","in","25","year","to","seek","treatment","for","his","brain","tumor","due","to","the","differ","in","medic","technolog","between","the","two","countri",".","Allow","to","stay","for","onli","three","month","and","close","monitor","by","a","North","Korean","offic","(","Yang","Ik-Joon",")",",","Sonho","is","welcom","and","embrac","by","his","famili","and","old","friend","but","his","father",",","who","is","still","stick","to","the","belief","but","also","feel","guilti","about","send","his","son","to","North","Korea","at","the","same","time",",","while","Sonho","'s","younger","sister","Rie","(","Sakura","Andô",")","develop","the","avers","to","North","Korea","and","it","polit","idea","."],"lemmas":["base","on","the","director","'s","own","experience",",","Our","Homeland","follow","a","korean","family","live","in","Japan",",","of","which","the","father","-lrb-","masane","tsukayama","-rrb-","decide","to","take","north","korean","nationality","because","of","he","strong","belief","decade","ago",".","in","1997",",","Sonho","-lrb-","Arata","Iura","-rrb-",",","the","son","of","the","family","who","be","send","to","North","Korea","under","a","``","repatriation","program","''","with","the","promise","of","a","``","paradise","''","free","of","discrimination",",","return","to","Japan","for","the","first","time","in","25","year","to","seek","treatment","for","he","brain","tumor","due","to","the","difference","in","medical","technology","between","the","two","country",".","allow","to","stay","for","only","three","month","and","closely","monitor","by","a","north","korean","officer","-lrb-","Yang","Ik-Joon","-rrb-",",","Sonho","be","welcome","and","embrace","by","he","family","and","old","friend","but","he","father",",","who","be","still","stick","to","the","belief","but","also","feeling","guilty","about","send","he","son","to","North","Korea","at","the","same","time",",","while","Sonho","'s","younger","sister","rie","-lrb-","Sakura","Andô","-rrb-","develop","the","aversion","to","North","Korea","and","its","political","idea","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Based

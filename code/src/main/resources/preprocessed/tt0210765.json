{"title":"Inside Out: Portraits of Children","plot":"Documentary filmmaker Joanna Lipper sat down with a dozen children from America, Ireland and England and let them interpret the world in this look at the internal life of children, sharing their dreams, wishes and hopes. An American boy talks about his Hungarian grandmother, a survivor of the Holocaust; two African-American girls speak of their imaginative fantasies and a boy who lives in a New York shelter discusses his drawings. Interviews are interwoven with fantasy sequences based on the children's play, highlighting the realness and importance of the children's mental life. Lipper says she not only wanted to record these children's dreams and fantasies, but also examine how different lifestyles and beliefs affected children's imaginations.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Documentari","filmmak","Joanna","Lipper","sat","down","with","a","dozen","children","from","America",",","Ireland","and","England","and","let","them","interpret","the","world","in","this","look","at","the","intern","life","of","children",",","share","their","dream",",","wish","and","hope",".","An","American","boy","talk","about","his","Hungarian","grandmoth",",","a","survivor","of","the","Holocaust",";","two","African-American","girl","speak","of","their","imagin","fantasi","and","a","boy","who","live","in","a","New","York","shelter","discuss","his","draw",".","Interview","are","interwoven","with","fantasi","sequenc","base","on","the","children","'s","play",",","highlight","the","real","and","import","of","the","children","'s","mental","life",".","Lipper","say","she","not","onli","want","to","record","these","children","'s","dream","and","fantasi",",","but","also","examin","how","differ","lifestyl","and","belief","affect","children","'s","imagin","."],"lemmas":["documentary","filmmaker","Joanna","Lipper","sit","down","with","a","dozen","child","from","America",",","Ireland","and","England","and","let","they","interpret","the","world","in","this","look","at","the","internal","life","of","child",",","share","they","dream",",","wish","and","hope",".","a","american","boy","talk","about","he","hungarian","grandmother",",","a","survivor","of","the","Holocaust",";","two","african-american","girl","speak","of","they","imaginative","fantasy","and","a","boy","who","live","in","a","New","York","shelter","discuss","he","drawing",".","interview","be","interwoven","with","fantasy","sequence","base","on","the","child","'s","play",",","highlight","the","realness","and","importance","of","the","child","'s","mental","life",".","Lipper","say","she","not","only","want","to","record","these","child","'s","dream","and","fantasy",",","but","also","examine","how","different","lifestyle","and","belief","affect","child","'s","imagination","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Documentary filmmaker Joanna","filmmaker Joanna Lipper","Joanna Lipper sat","Lipper sat down","sat down with","down with a","with a dozen","a dozen children","dozen children from","children from America","from America ,","America , Ireland",", Ireland and","Ireland and England","and England and","England and let","and let them","let them interpret","them interpret the","interpret the world","the world in","world in this","in this look","this look at","look at the","at the internal","the internal life","internal life of","life of children","of children ,","children , sharing",", sharing their","sharing their dreams","their dreams ,","dreams , wishes",", wishes and","wishes and hopes","An American boy","American boy talks","boy talks about","talks about his","about his Hungarian","his Hungarian grandmother","Hungarian grandmother ,","grandmother , a",", a survivor","a survivor of","survivor of the","of the Holocaust","the Holocaust ;","Holocaust ;

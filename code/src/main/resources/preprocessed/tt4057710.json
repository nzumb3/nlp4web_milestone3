{"title":"Teen Exorcists","plot":"They are young, all-American girls who enjoy horse riding, karate and Sherlock Holmes. But there's more to Brynne, Tess and Savannah than wholesome pursuits - they're exorcists. The girls believe much of the world's population is possessed by evil spirits which are causing addiction, depression and suffering. In a fight against the devil's army, they have been touring America performing public exorcisms on their believers. Now they are taking the fight to a city they think of as one of the most spiritually corrupt in the world - London. But what will Brits make of these evangelical American exorcists?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["They","are","young",",","all-American","girl","who","enjoy","hors","ride",",","karat","and","Sherlock","Holm",".","But","there","'s","more","to","Brynn",",","Tess","and","Savannah","than","wholesom","pursuit","-","they","re","exorcist",".","The","girl","believ","much","of","the","world","'s","popul","is","possess","by","evil","spirit","which","are","caus","addict",",","depress","and","suffer",".","In","a","fight","against","the","devil","'s","armi",",","they","have","been","tour","America","perform","public","exorc","on","their","believ",".","Now","they","are","take","the","fight","to","a","citi","they","think","of","as","one","of","the","most","spiritu","corrupt","in","the","world","-","London",".","But","what","will","Brit","make","of","these","evangel","American","exorcist","?"],"lemmas":["they","be","young",",","all-american","girl","who","enjoy","horse","ride",",","karate","and","Sherlock","Holmes",".","but","there","be","more","to","Brynne",",","Tess","and","Savannah","than","wholesome","pursuit","-","they","be","exorcist",".","the","girl","believe","much","of","the","world","'s","population","be","possess","by","evil","spirit","which","be","cause","addiction",",","depression","and","suffering",".","in","a","fight","against","the","devil","'s","army",",","they","have","be","tour","America","perform","public","exorcism","on","they","believer",".","now","they","be","take","the","fight","to","a","city","they","think","of","as","one","of","the","most","spiritually","corrupt","in","the","world","-","London",".","but","what","will","brit","make","of","these","evangelical","american","exorcist","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["They are young","are young ,","young , all-American",", all-American girls","all-American girls who","girls who enjoy","who enjoy horse","enjoy horse riding","horse riding ,","riding , karate",", karate and","karate and Sherlock","and Sherlock Holmes","But there 's","there 's more","'s more to","more to Brynne","to Brynne ,","Brynne , Tess",", Tess and","Tess and Savannah","and Savannah than","Savannah than wholesome","than wholesome pursuits","wholesome pursuits -","pursuits - they","- they 're","they 're exorcists","The girls believe","girls believe much","believe much of","much of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's population","'s population is","population is possessed","is possessed by","possessed by evil","by evil spirits","evil spirits which","spirits which are","which are causing","are causing addiction","causing addiction ,","addiction , depression",", depression and","depression and suffering","In a fight","a fight against","fight against the","against the devil","the devil 's","devil 's army","'s army ,","army , they",", they have","they have been","have been touring","been touring America","touring America performing","America performing public","performing public exorcisms","public exorcisms on","exorcisms on their","on their believers","Now they are","they are taking","are taking the","taking the fight","the fight to","fight to a","to a city","a city they","city they think","they think of","think of as","of as one","as one of","one of the","of the most","the most spiritually","most spiritually corrupt","spiritually corrupt in","corrupt in the","in the world","the world -","world - London","But what will","what will Brits","will Brits make","Brits make of","make of these","of these evangelical","these evangelical American","evangelical American exorcists"],"2grams":["They are","are young","young ,",", all-American","all-American girls","girls who","who enjoy","enjoy horse","horse riding","riding ,",", karate","karate and","and Sherlock","Sherlock Holmes","But there","there 's","'s more","more to","to Brynne","Brynne ,",", Tess","Tess and","and Savannah","Savannah than","than wholesome","wholesome pursuits","pursuits -","- they","they 're","'re exorcists","The girls","girls believe","believe much","much of","of the","the world","world 's","'s population","population is","is possessed","possessed by","by evil","evil spirits","spirits which","which are","are causing","causing addiction","addiction ,",", depression","depression and","and suffering","In a","a fight","fight against","against the","the devil","devil 's","'s army","army ,",", they","they have","have been","been touring","touring America","America performing","performing public","public exorcisms","exorcisms on","on their","their believers","Now they","they are","are taking","taking the","the fight","fight to","to a","a city","city they","they think","think of","of as","as one","one of","of the","the most","most spiritually","spiritually corrupt","corrupt in","in the","the world","world -","- London","But what","what will","will Brits","Brits make","make of","of these","these evangelical","evangelical American","American exorcists"]}

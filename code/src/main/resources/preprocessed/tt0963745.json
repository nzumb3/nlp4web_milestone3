{"title":"Art in the Face of War","plot":"Eight World War II artists/veterans recount their service experience and their use of art for journalism, as a tactical tool and to preserve their own sanity. Having served in all theaters of operation and in all branches of the U.S. military, including the once-secret Army division known as The Deception Corps, their powerful imagery (some done on the spot, some done years later from haunting memories) will enlighten, challenge, even amuse, showing that war is hell but that creativity can exist in the face of destruction.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["Eight","World","War","II","artists/veteran","recount","their","servic","experi","and","their","use","of","art","for","journal",",","as","a","tactic","tool","and","to","preserv","their","own","saniti",".","Have","serv","in","all","theater","of","oper","and","in","all","branch","of","the","U.S.","militari",",","includ","the","once-secret","Armi","divis","known","as","The","Decept","Corp",",","their","power","imageri","(","some","done","on","the","spot",",","some","done","year","later","from","haunt","memori",")","will","enlighten",",","challeng",",","even","amus",",","show","that","war","is","hell","but","that","creativ","can","exist","in","the","face","of","destruct","."],"lemmas":["eight","World","War","II","artists/veterans","recount","they","service","experience","and","they","use","of","art","for","journalism",",","as","a","tactical","tool","and","to","preserve","they","own","sanity",".","have","serve","in","all","theater","of","operation","and","in","all","branch","of","the","U.S.","military",",","include","the","once-secret","Army","division","know","as","the","Deception","Corps",",","they","powerful","imagery","-lrb-","some","do","on","the","spot",",","some","do","year","later","from","haunt","memory","-rrb-","will","enlighten",",","challenge",",","even","amuse",",","show","that","war","be","hell","but","that","creativity","can","exist","in","the","face","of","destruction","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Eight World War","World War II","War II artists/veterans","II artists/veterans recount","artists/veterans recount their","recount their service","their service experience","service experience and","experience and their","and their use","their use of","use of art","of art for","art for journalism","for journalism ,","journalism , as",", as a","as a tactical","a tactical tool","tactical tool and","tool and to","and to preserve","to preserve their","preserve their own","their own sanity","Having served in","served in all","in all theaters","all theaters of","theaters of operation","of operation and","operation and in","and in all","in all branches","all branches of","branches of the","of the U.S.","the U.S. military","U.S. military ,","military , including",", including the","including the once-secret","the once-secret Army","once-secret Army division","Army division known","division known as","known as The","as The Deception","The Deception Corps","Deception Corps ,","Corps , their",", their powerful","their powerful imagery","powerful imagery (","imagery ( some","( some done","some done on","done on the","on the spot","the spot ,","spot , some",", some done","some done years","done years later","years later from","later from haunting","from haunting memories","haunting memories )","memories ) will",") will enlighten","will enlighten ,","enlighten , challenge",", challenge ,","challenge , even",", even amuse","even amuse ,","amuse , showing",", showing that","showing that war","that war is","war is hell","is hell but","hell but that","but that creativity","that creativity can","creativity can exist","can exist in","exist in the","in the face","the face of","face of destruction"],"2grams":["Eight World","World War","War II","II artists/veterans","artists/veterans recount","recount their","their service","service experience","experience and","and their","their use","use of","of art","art for","for journalism","journalism ,",", as","as a","a tactical","tactical tool","tool and","and to","to preserve","preserve their","their own","own sanity","Having served","served in","in all","all theaters","theaters of","of operation","operation and","and in","in all","all branches","branches of","of the","the U.S.","U.S. military","military ,",", including","including the","the once-secret","once-secret Army","Army division","division known","known as","as The","The Deception","Deception Corps","Corps ,",", their","their powerful","powerful imagery","imagery (","( some","some done","done on","on the","the spot","spot ,",", some","some done","done years","years later","later from","from haunting","haunting memories","memories )",") will","will enlighten","enlighten ,",", challenge","challenge ,",", even","even amuse","amuse ,",", showing","showing that","that war","war is","is hell","hell but","but that","that creativity","creativity can","can exist","exist in","in the","the face","face of","of destruction"]}

{"title":"They Returned","plot":"They Returned is a beautifully touching and unnerving story about the unexplained disappearance of three children, two boys and one girl, and their reappearance three days later in a semi-autistic state. Not even the children themselves are able to help anyone understand what happened. No clues or signs are left, other than the fact that, as we discover later, two of them were mutilated. As the police carry out their investigation, and the town slowly sinks into a deep state of suspiciousness, small community of children - classroom colleagues of the missing three - run their own parallel search. Only one person is a potential suspect: the children's own classroom teacher, recently arrived from another town. He does not help his case when he attempts to make the school psychologist understand that the children were in fact murdered.","genres":["Crime"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["They","Return","is","a","beauti","touch","and","unnerv","stori","about","the","unexplain","disappear","of","three","children",",","two","boy","and","one","girl",",","and","their","reappear","three","day","later","in","a","semi-autist","state",".","Not","even","the","children","themselv","are","abl","to","help","anyon","understand","what","happen",".","No","clue","or","sign","are","left",",","other","than","the","fact","that",",","as","we","discov","later",",","two","of","them","were","mutil",".","As","the","polic","carri","out","their","investig",",","and","the","town","slowli","sink","into","a","deep","state","of","suspici",",","small","communiti","of","children","-","classroom","colleagu","of","the","miss","three","-","run","their","own","parallel","search",".","Onli","one","person","is","a","potenti","suspect",":","the","children","'s","own","classroom","teacher",",","recent","arriv","from","anoth","town",".","He","doe","not","help","his","case","when","he","attempt","to","make","the","school","psychologist","understand","that","the","children","were","in","fact","murder","."],"lemmas":["they","return","be","a","beautifully","touch","and","unnerve","story","about","the","unexplained","disappearance","of","three","child",",","two","boy","and","one","girl",",","and","they","reappearance","three","day","later","in","a","semi-autistic","state",".","not","even","the","child","themselves","be","able","to","help","anyone","understand","what","happen",".","no","clue","or","sign","be","leave",",","other","than","the","fact","that",",","as","we","discover","later",",","two","of","they","be","mutilate",".","as","the","police","carry","out","they","investigation",",","and","the","town","slowly","sink","into","a","deep","state","of","suspiciousness",",","small","community","of","child","-","classroom","colleague","of","the","miss","three","-","run","they","own","parallel","search",".","only","one","person","be","a","potential","suspect",":","the","child","'s","own","classroom","teacher",",","recently","arrive","from","another","town",".","he","do","not","help","he","case","when","he","attempt","to","make","the","school","psychologist","understand","that","the","child","be","in","fact","murder","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["They Returned is","Returned is a","is a beautifully","a beautifully touching","beautifully touching and","touching and unnerving","and unnerving story","unnerving story about","story about the","about the unexplained","the unexplained disappearance","unexplained disappearance of","disappearance of three","of three children","three children ,","children , two",", two boys","two boys and","boys and one","and one girl","one girl ,","girl , and",", and their","and their reappearance","their reappearance three","reappearance three days","three days later","days later in","later in a","in a semi-autistic","a semi-autistic state","Not even the","even the children","the children themselves","children themselves are","themselves are able","are able to","able to help","to help anyone","help anyone understand","anyone understand what","understand what happened","No clues or","clues or signs","or signs are","signs are left","are left ,","left , other",", other than","other than the","than the fact","the fact that","fact that ,","that , as",", as we","as we discover","we discover later","discover later ,","later , two",", two of","two of them","of them were","them were mutilated","As the police","the police carry","police carry out","carry out their","out their investigation","their investigation ,","investigation , and",", and the","and the town","the town slowly","town slowly sinks","slowly sinks into","sinks into a","into a deep","a deep state","deep state of","state of suspiciousness","of suspiciousness ,","suspiciousness , small",", small community","small community of","community of children","of children -","children -

{"title":"Stair Dad","plot":"Fazli is known as an insignificant and inadequate man by everyone around him, including his family. However, his routine life changes with an old stair car he buys, which people are only used to seeing at airports while passengers are getting on and off planes. Although The Stair Car is a subject of ridicule at first, it changes our hero's life like a magic wand. The ensuing events turn a sheepish man into a folk hero overnight.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Fazli","is","known","as","an","insignific","and","inadequ","man","by","everyon","around","him",",","includ","his","famili",".","Howev",",","his","routin","life","chang","with","an","old","stair","car","he","buy",",","which","peopl","are","onli","use","to","see","at","airport","while","passeng","are","get","on","and","off","plane",".","Although","The","Stair","Car","is","a","subject","of","ridicul","at","first",",","it","chang","our","hero","'s","life","like","a","magic","wand",".","The","ensu","event","turn","a","sheepish","man","into","a","folk","hero","overnight","."],"lemmas":["Fazli","be","know","as","a","insignificant","and","inadequate","man","by","everyone","around","he",",","include","he","family",".","however",",","he","routine","life","change","with","a","old","stair","car","he","buy",",","which","people","be","only","use","to","see","at","airport","while","passenger","be","get","on","and","off","plane",".","although","the","Stair","Car","be","a","subject","of","ridicule","at","first",",","it","change","we","hero","'s","life","like","a","magic","wand",".","the","ensue","event","turn","a","sheepish","man","into","a","folk","hero","overnight","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Fazli is known","is known as","known as an","as an insignificant","an insignificant and","insignificant and inadequate","and inadequate man","inadequate man by","man by everyone","by everyone around","everyone around him","around him ,","him , including",", including his","including his family","However , his",", his routine","his routine life","routine life changes","life changes with","changes with an","with an old","an old stair","old stair car","stair car he","car he buys","he buys ,","buys , which",", which people","which people are","people are only","are only used","only used to","used to seeing","to seeing at","seeing at airports","at airports while","airports while passengers","while passengers are","passengers are getting","are getting on","getting on and","on and off","and off planes","Although The Stair","The Stair Car","Stair Car is","Car is a","is a subject","a subject of","subject of ridicule","of ridicule at","ridicule at first","at first ,","first , it",", it changes","it changes our","changes our hero","our hero 's","hero 's life","'s life like","life like a","like a magic","a magic wand","The ensuing events","ensuing events turn","events turn a","turn a sheepish","a sheepish man","sheepish man into","man into a","into a folk","a folk hero","folk hero overnight"],"2grams":["Fazli is","is known","known as","as an","an insignificant","insignificant and","and inadequate","inadequate man","man by","by everyone","everyone around","around him","him ,",", including","including his","his family","However ,",", his","his routine","routine life","life changes","changes with","with an","an old","old stair","stair car","car he","he buys","buys ,",", which","which people","people are","are only","only used","used to","to seeing","seeing at","at airports","airports while","while passengers","passengers are","are getting","getting on","on and","and off","off planes","Although The","The Stair","Stair Car","Car is","is a","a subject","subject of","of ridicule","ridicule at","at first","first ,",", it","it changes","changes our","our hero","hero 's","'s life","life like","like a","a magic","magic wand","The ensuing","ensuing events","events turn","turn a","a sheepish","sheepish man","man into","into a","a folk","folk hero","hero overnight"]}

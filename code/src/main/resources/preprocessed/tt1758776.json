{"title":"The Airborne Patrols","plot":"The Airborne Patrols follows the infamous 1st Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division from their departure for Iraq in June 2007 to their return home in July 2008. The producers were granted unprecedented access to the Paratroopers through video cameras provided directly to the troops on the ground who were a part of the 'Surge' effort. These soldier-camera operators take us across the battlefield as they investigate, track down, chase and subdue suspected insurgents who attack our troops. We also see the smiles on the faces of Iraqi children as the troops give out toys, build hospitals, open schools and ensure the streets are safe again. With less than 50,000 troops left in Iraq today, our film may be the final look at the war.","genres":["Documentary"," News","

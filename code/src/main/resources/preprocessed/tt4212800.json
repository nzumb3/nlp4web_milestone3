{"title":"Wakers","plot":"A father reads a story to a young girl about a rebellious young girl who lives in a dreary, black and white version of New York with her religious fanatic mother. After trying an experimental new drug given to her by the mysterious \"Cultural Olympiad\" she finds herself in a vivid, colorful fantasy world - but with one catch. As she and her friends enter the hallucinations, they begin to drop off, one by one. Is it the drug killing them - or is there something more sinister at play? As the dark force causing these fatal mishaps begins to manifest itself into a living being, Blessing's mission becomes stopping it - or him - at all costs. Meanwhile, a man named Bug Lord, who controls the flow of the drug into Blessing's world suffers for all of her sins.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["A","father","read","a","stori","to","a","young","girl","about","a","rebelli","young","girl","who","live","in","a","dreari",",","black","and","white","version","of","New","York","with","her","religi","fanat","mother",".","After","tri","an","experiment","new","drug","given","to","her","by","the","mysteri","\"","Cultur","Olympiad","\"","she","find","herself","in","a","vivid",",","color","fantasi","world","-","but","with","one","catch",".","As","she","and","her","friend","enter","the","hallucin",",","they","begin","to","drop","off",",","one","by","one",".","Is","it","the","drug","kill","them","-","or","is","there","someth","more","sinist","at","play","?","As","the","dark","forc","caus","these","fatal","mishap","begin","to","manifest","itself","into","a","live","be",",","Bless","'s","mission","becom","stop","it","-","or","him","-","at","all","cost",".","Meanwhil",",","a","man","name","Bug","Lord",",","who","control","the","flow","of","the","drug","into","Bless","'s","world","suffer","for","all","of","her","sin","."],"lemmas":["a","father","read","a","story","to","a","young","girl","about","a","rebellious","young","girl","who","live","in","a","dreary",",","black","and","white","version","of","New","York","with","she","religious","fanatic","mother",".","after","try","a","experimental","new","drug","give","to","she","by","the","mysterious","``","Cultural","Olympiad","''","she","find","herself","in","a","vivid",",","colorful","fantasy","world","-","but","with","one","catch",".","as","she","and","she","friend","enter","the","hallucination",",","they","begin","to","drop","off",",","one","by","one",".","be","it","the","drug","kill","they","-","or","be","there","something","more","sinister","at","play","?","as","the","dark","force","cause","these","fatal","mishap","begin","to","manifest","itself","into","a","living","be",",","Blessing","'s","mission","become","stop","it","-","or","he","-","at","all","cost",".","meanwhile",",","a","man","name","bug","Lord",",","who","control","the","flow","of","the","drug","into","blessing","'s","world","suffer","for","all","of","she","sin","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A father reads","father reads a","reads a story","a story to","story to a","to a young","a young girl","young girl about","girl about a","about a rebellious","a rebellious young","rebellious young girl","young girl who","girl who lives","who lives in","lives in a","in a dreary","a dreary ,","dreary , black",", black and","black and white","and white version","white version of","version of New","of New York","New York with","York with her","with her religious","her religious fanatic","religious fanatic mother","After trying an","trying an experimental","an experimental new","experimental new drug","new drug given","drug given to","given to her","to her by","her by the","by the mysterious","the mysterious \"","mysterious \" Cultural","\" Cultural Olympiad","Cultural Olympiad \"","Olympiad \" she","\" she finds","she finds herself","finds herself in","herself in a","in a vivid","a vivid ,","vivid , colorful",", colorful fantasy","colorful fantasy world","fantasy world -","world -

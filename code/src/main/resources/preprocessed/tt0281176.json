{"title":"The Seagull's Laughter","plot":"Post-war provincial Iceland: around 1950, Freyja, who'd been a plump teen, returns from America, a widow with a 20-inch waist, seven suitcases of dresses, and a list of who ever wronged or slighted her. She moves in with an aunt and socialist uncle: finding a new husband is high on her agenda, and she's mistrusted by Agga, a pre-teen who's our eyes and ears. The social order and Freyja are more complicated than they seem at first, and so may be her prospects. Class divisions, families ties, pride, the onset of puberty, and the power of Eros sliver the ice.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Post-war","provinci","Iceland",":","around","1950",",","Freyja",",","who","'d","been","a","plump","teen",",","return","from","America",",","a","widow","with","a","20-inch","waist",",","seven","suitcas","of","dress",",","and","a","list","of","who","ever","wrong","or","slight","her",".","She","move","in","with","an","aunt","and","socialist","uncl",":","find","a","new","husband","is","high","on","her","agenda",",","and","she","'s","mistrust","by","Agga",",","a","pre-teen","who","'s","our","eye","and","ear",".","The","social","order","and","Freyja","are","more","complic","than","they","seem","at","first",",","and","so","may","be","her","prospect",".","Class","divis",",","famili","tie",",","pride",",","the","onset","of","puberti",",","and","the","power","of","Eros","sliver","the","ice","."],"lemmas":["post-war","provincial","Iceland",":","around","1950",",","Freyja",",","who","have","be","a","plump","teen",",","return","from","America",",","a","widow","with","a","20-inch","waist",",","seven","suitcase","of","dress",",","and","a","list","of","who","ever","wrong","or","slight","she",".","she","move","in","with","a","aunt","and","socialist","uncle",":","find","a","new","husband","be","high","on","she","agenda",",","and","she","be","mistrust","by","Agga",",","a","pre-teen","who","be","we","eye","and","ear",".","the","social","order","and","freyja","be","more","complicated","than","they","seem","at","first",",","and","so","may","be","she","prospects",".","class","division",",","family","tie",",","pride",",","the","onset","of","puberty",",","and","the","power","of","Eros","sliver","the","ice","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Post-war provincial Iceland","provincial Iceland :","Iceland : around",": around 1950","around 1950 ,","1950 , Freyja",", Freyja ,","Freyja , who",", who 'd","who 'd been","'d been a","been a plump","a plump teen","plump teen ,","teen , returns",", returns from","returns from America","from America ,","America , a",", a widow","a widow with","widow with a","with a 20-inch","a 20-inch waist","20-inch waist ,","waist , seven",", seven suitcases","seven suitcases of","suitcases of dresses","of dresses ,","dresses , and",", and a","and a list","a list of","list of who","of who ever","who ever wronged","ever wronged or","wronged or slighted","or slighted her","She moves in","moves in with","in with an","with an aunt","an aunt and","aunt and socialist","and socialist uncle","socialist uncle :","uncle : finding",": finding a","finding a new","a new husband","new husband is","husband is high","is high on","high on her","on her agenda","her agenda ,","agenda , and",", and she","and she 's","she 's mistrusted","'s mistrusted by","mistrusted by Agga","by Agga ,","Agga , a",", a pre-teen","a pre-teen who","pre-teen who 's","who 's our","'s our eyes","our eyes and","eyes and ears","The social order","social order and","order and Freyja","and Freyja are","Freyja are more","are more complicated","more complicated than","complicated than they","than they seem","they seem at","seem at first","at first ,","first , and",", and so","and so may","so may be","may be her","be her prospects","Class divisions ,","divisions , families",", families ties","families ties ,","ties , pride",", pride ,","pride , the",", the onset","the onset of","onset of puberty","of puberty ,","puberty , and",", and the","and the power","the power of","power of Eros","of Eros sliver","Eros sliver the","sliver the ice"],"2grams":["Post-war provincial","provincial Iceland","Iceland :",": around","around 1950","1950 ,",", Freyja","Freyja ,",", who","who 'd","'d been","been a","a plump","plump teen","teen ,",", returns","returns from","from America","America ,",", a","a widow","widow with","with a","a 20-inch","20-inch waist","waist ,",", seven","seven suitcases","suitcases of","of dresses","dresses ,",", and","and a","a list","list of","of who","who ever","ever wronged","wronged or","or slighted","slighted her","She moves","moves in","in with","with an","an aunt","aunt and","and socialist","socialist uncle","uncle :",": finding","finding a","a new","new husband","husband is","is high","high on","on her","her agenda","agenda ,",", and","and she","she 's","'s mistrusted","mistrusted by","by Agga","Agga ,",", a","a pre-teen","pre-teen who","who 's","'s our","our eyes","eyes and","and ears","The social","social order","order and","and Freyja","Freyja are","are more","more complicated","complicated than","than they","they seem","seem at","at first","first ,",", and","and so","so may","may be","be her","her prospects","Class divisions","divisions ,",", families","families ties","ties ,",", pride","pride ,",", the","the onset","onset of","of puberty","puberty ,",", and","and the","the power","power of","of Eros","Eros sliver","sliver the","the ice"]}

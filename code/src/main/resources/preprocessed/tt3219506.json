{"title":"The Ultimate Commitment","plot":"A victim of rape experiences a great deal of depression as they struggle to come to terms with their emotional and traumatic experience. Stacia was molested as a child, the veil was torn and trust was broken. Stacia conceals her pain and projects her frustrations through her magazine, where she bashes men, thus, depicting an act of transgression inspired by her rape experience. In her world, a man is a tool of satisfaction and deserves no respect. Sarah unexpectedly falls in love with Bill, who is a friend from Stacia's past. Bill immediately sweeps Sarah off her feet. However, Bill has a secret which re-positions Sarah's world. Stacia's parents adopted Sarah at an early age and Sarah became part of the family. Love does not see color as Stacia and Sarah bonded as sisters. After their parents passed away, Stacia strayed from the word of God but Sarah's faith grew stronger in God. When does she return? Will she return? Does she learn true forgiveness? Can she forgive herself?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","victim","of","rape","experi","a","great","deal","of","depress","as","they","struggl","to","come","to","term","with","their","emot","and","traumat","experi",".","Stacia","was","molest","as","a","child",",","the","veil","was","torn","and","trust","was","broken",".","Stacia","conceal","her","pain","and","project","her","frustrat","through","her","magazin",",","where","she","bash","men",",","thus",",","depict","an","act","of","transgress","inspir","by","her","rape","experi",".","In","her","world",",","a","man","is","a","tool","of","satisfact","and","deserv","no","respect",".","Sarah","unexpect","fall","in","love","with","Bill",",","who","is","a","friend","from","Stacia","'s","past",".","Bill","immedi","sweep","Sarah","off","her","feet",".","Howev",",","Bill","has","a","secret","which","re-posit","Sarah","'s","world",".","Stacia","'s","parent","adopt","Sarah","at","an","earli","age","and","Sarah","becam","part","of","the","famili",".","Love","doe","not","see","color","as","Stacia","and","Sarah","bond","as","sister",".","After","their","parent","pass","away",",","Stacia","stray","from","the","word","of","God","but","Sarah","'s","faith","grew","stronger","in","God",".","When","doe","she","return","?","Will","she","return","?","Doe","she","learn","true","forgiv","?","Can","she","forgiv","herself","?"],"lemmas":["a","victim","of","rape","experience","a","great","deal","of","depression","as","they","struggle","to","come","to","term","with","they","emotional","and","traumatic","experience",".","Stacia","be","molest","as","a","child",",","the","veil","be","tear","and","trust","be","break",".","Stacia","conceal","she","pain","and","project","she","frustration","through","she","magazine",",","where","she","bash","man",",","thus",",","depict","a","act","of","transgression","inspire","by","she","rape","experience",".","in","she","world",",","a","man","be","a","tool","of","satisfaction","and","deserve","no","respect",".","Sarah","unexpectedly","fall","in","love","with","Bill",",","who","be","a","friend","from","Stacia","'s","past",".","Bill","immediately","sweep","Sarah","off","she","foot",".","however",",","Bill","have","a","secret","which","re-position","Sarah","'s","world",".","Stacia","'s","parent","adopt","Sarah","at","a","early","age","and","Sarah","become","part","of","the","family",".","love","do","not","see","color","as","Stacia","and","Sarah","bond","as","sister",".","after","they","parent","pass","away",",","Stacia","stray","from","the","word","of","God","but","Sarah","'s","faith","grow","stronger","in","God",".","when","do","she","return","?","will","she","return","?","do","she","learn","true","forgiveness","?","can","she","forgive","herself","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"Tsunami in the Sky","plot":"The Morning Glory is a natural phenomenon that happens only a few weeks a year in the skies above Burketown on outback Australia's crocodile coast. These waves in the sky, marked by clouds over 3,000 feet high, blow off the sea at 60 kilometres an hour, attracting sailplane, trike, and hang glider pilots from across Australia, and the world, all hoping for the chance to surf them. This documentary follows the journey of six men with the desire to do just that.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Morn","Glori","is","a","natur","phenomenon","that","happen","onli","a","few","week","a","year","in","the","sky","abov","Burketown","on","outback","Australia","'s","crocodil","coast",".","These","wave","in","the","sky",",","mark","by","cloud","over","3,000","feet","high",",","blow","off","the","sea","at","60","kilometr","an","hour",",","attract","sailplan",",","trike",",","and","hang","glider","pilot","from","across","Australia",",","and","the","world",",","all","hope","for","the","chanc","to","surf","them",".","This","documentari","follow","the","journey","of","six","men","with","the","desir","to","do","just","that","."],"lemmas":["the","morning","glory","be","a","natural","phenomenon","that","happen","only","a","few","week","a","year","in","the","sky","above","burketown","on","outback","Australia","'s","crocodile","coast",".","these","wave","in","the","sky",",","mark","by","cloud","over","3,000","foot","high",",","blow","off","the","sea","at","60","kilometre","a","hour",",","attract","sailplane",",","trike",",","and","hang","glider","pilot","from","across","Australia",",","and","the","world",",","all","hope","for","the","chance","to","surf","they",".","this","documentary","follow","the","journey","of","six","man","with","the","desire","to","do","just","that","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Morning Glory","Morning Glory is","Glory is a","is a natural","a natural phenomenon","natural phenomenon that","phenomenon that happens","that happens only","happens only a","only a few","a few weeks","few weeks a","weeks a year","a year in","year in the","in the skies","the skies above","skies above Burketown","above Burketown on","Burketown on outback","on outback Australia","outback Australia 's","Australia 's crocodile","'s crocodile coast","These waves in","waves in the","in the sky","the sky ,","sky , marked",", marked by","marked by clouds","by clouds over","clouds over 3,000","over 3,000 feet","3,000 feet high","feet high ,","high , blow",", blow off","blow off the","off the sea","the sea at","sea at 60","at 60 kilometres","60 kilometres an","kilometres an hour","an hour ,","hour , attracting",", attracting sailplane","attracting sailplane ,","sailplane , trike",", trike ,","trike , and",", and hang","and hang glider","hang glider pilots","glider pilots from","pilots from across","from across Australia","across Australia ,","Australia , and",", and the","and the world","the world ,","world , all",", all hoping","all hoping for","hoping for the","for the chance","the chance to","chance to surf","to surf them","This documentary follows","documentary follows the","follows the journey","the journey of","journey of six","of six men","six men with","men with the","with the desire","the desire to","desire to do","to do just","do just that"],"2grams":["The Morning","Morning Glory","Glory is","is a","a natural","natural phenomenon","phenomenon that","that happens","happens only","only a","a few","few weeks","weeks a","a year","year in","in the","the skies","skies above","above Burketown","Burketown on","on outback","outback Australia","Australia 's","'s crocodile","crocodile coast","These waves","waves in","in the","the sky","sky ,",", marked","marked by","by clouds","clouds over","over 3,000","3,000 feet","feet high","high ,",", blow","blow off","off the","the sea","sea at","at 60","60 kilometres","kilometres an","an hour","hour ,",", attracting","attracting sailplane","sailplane ,",", trike","trike ,",", and","and hang","hang glider","glider pilots","pilots from","from across","across Australia","Australia ,",", and","and the","the world","world ,",", all","all hoping","hoping for","for the","the chance","chance to","to surf","surf them","This documentary","documentary follows","follows the","the journey","journey of","of six","six men","men with","with the","the desire","desire to","to do","do just","just that"]}

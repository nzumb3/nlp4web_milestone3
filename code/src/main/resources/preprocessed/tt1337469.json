{"title":"Connect USA","plot":"CONNECT USA follows one man's search for human connections across a divided nation. Using the board game Connect Four as device to both engage and disarm, Gregory Rossi travels the country and constructs a unique narrative of shared human struggle and triumph. CONNECT USA includes footage from over 200 personal interviews with strangers encountered on the road, and features an extended interview with Howard Wexler, the inventor of Connect Four. Shot over six weeks spent traversing the country, Gregory Rossi uses his personal journey to draw out a variety of truly American stories-accounts of tragedy, conflict, courage, and personal victories. CONNECT USA synthesizes memoir, travelogue, personal interviews, and innovative graphic illustrations to explore personal conflict as an element of our shared humanity and national identity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["CONNECT","USA","follow","one","man","'s","search","for","human","connect","across","a","divid","nation",".","Using","the","board","game","Connect","Four","as","devic","to","both","engag","and","disarm",",","Gregori","Rossi","travel","the","countri","and","construct","a","uniqu","narrat","of","share","human","struggl","and","triumph",".","CONNECT","USA","includ","footag","from","over","200","person","interview","with","stranger","encount","on","the","road",",","and","featur","an","extend","interview","with","Howard","Wexler",",","the","inventor","of","Connect","Four",".","Shot","over","six","week","spent","travers","the","countri",",","Gregori","Rossi","use","his","person","journey","to","draw","out","a","varieti","of","truli","American","stories-account","of","tragedi",",","conflict",",","courag",",","and","person","victori",".","CONNECT","USA","synthes","memoir",",","travelogu",",","person","interview",",","and","innov","graphic","illustr","to","explor","person","conflict","as","an","element","of","our","share","human","and","nation","ident","."],"lemmas":["CONNECT","USA","follow","one","man","'s","search","for","human","connection","across","a","divided","nation",".","use","the","board","game","connect","Four","as","device","to","both","engage","and","disarm",",","Gregory","Rossi","travel","the","country","and","construct","a","unique","narrative","of","shared","human","struggle","and","triumph",".","CONNECT","USA","include","footage","from","over","200","personal","interview","with","stranger","encounter","on","the","road",",","and","feature","a","extended","interview","with","Howard","Wexler",",","the","inventor","of","connect","Four",".","shot","over","six","week","spend","traverse","the","country",",","Gregory","Rossi","use","he","personal","journey","to","draw","out","a","variety","of","truly","american","stories-account","of","tragedy",",","conflict",",","courage",",","and","personal","victory",".","CONNECT","USA","synthesize","memoir",",","travelogue",",","personal","interview",",","and","innovative","graphic","illustration","to","explore","personal","conflict","as","a","element","of","we","shared","humanity","and","national","identity","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["CONNECT

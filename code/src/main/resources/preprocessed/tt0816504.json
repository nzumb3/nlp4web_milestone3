{"title":"Gary Cooper: The Face of a Hero","plot":"Known for his personification of the Western Hero, it was Montana-born Cooper's horse-riding skills that first brought him bit parts in movies. And he never lost his love of the great American outdoors. Though he rarely played a villain and was an adept comedian, Cooper is best remembered for his strong, silent heroes. With his lanky countryboy looks and shy hesitancy he created a unique screen presence, though his real life was one of sophisticated elegance. Over 100 movies brought him three Academy Award Nominations and two Academy Awards. Cooper's most memorable films include A Farewell to Arms, Mr. Deeds Goes To Town, Meet John Doe, The Pride of the Yankees and High Noon. Daughter Maria Cooper Janis and actors George C. Scott, Charlton Heston, Patricia Neal and Joan Leslie are among those appearing in this profile of one of Hollywood's greatest stars.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Known","for","his","personif","of","the","Western","Hero",",","it","was","Montana-born","Cooper","'s","horse-rid","skill","that","first","brought","him","bit","part","in","movi",".","And","he","never","lost","his","love","of","the","great","American","outdoor",".","Though","he","rare","play","a","villain","and","was","an","adept","comedian",",","Cooper","is","best","rememb","for","his","strong",",","silent","hero",".","With","his","lanki","countryboy","look","and","shi","hesit","he","creat","a","uniqu","screen","presenc",",","though","his","real","life","was","one","of","sophist","eleg",".","Over","100","movi","brought","him","three","Academi","Award","Nomin","and","two","Academi","Award",".","Cooper","'s","most","memor","film","includ","A","Farewel","to","Arms",",","Mr.","Deed","Goe","To","Town",",","Meet","John","Doe",",","The","Pride","of","the","Yanke","and","High","Noon",".","Daughter","Maria","Cooper","Jani","and","actor","Georg","C.","Scott",",","Charlton","Heston",",","Patricia","Neal","and","Joan","Lesli","are","among","those","appear","in","this","profil","of","one","of","Hollywood","'s","greatest","star","."],"lemmas":["know","for","he","personification","of","the","Western","Hero",",","it","be","montana-born","Cooper","'s","horse-riding","skill","that","first","bring","he","bit","part","in","movie",".","and","he","never","lose","he","love","of","the","great","american","outdoors",".","though","he","rarely","play","a","villain","and","be","a","adept","comedian",",","Cooper","be","best","remember","for","he","strong",",","silent","hero",".","with","he","lanky","countryboy","look","and","shy","hesitancy","he","create","a","unique","screen","presence",",","though","he","real","life","be","one","of","sophisticated","elegance",".","over","100","movie","bring","he","three","Academy","award","nomination","and","two","Academy","award",".","Cooper","'s","most","memorable","film","include","A","Farewell","to","arm",",","Mr.","Deeds","go","to","Town",",","Meet","John","Doe",",","the","pride","of","the","Yankees","and","High","Noon",".","Daughter","Maria","Cooper","Janis","and","actor","George","C.","Scott",",","Charlton","Heston",",","Patricia","Neal","and","Joan","Leslie","be","among","those","appear","in","this","profile","of","one","of","Hollywood","'s","greatest","star","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Known for his","for his personification","his personification of","personification of the","of the Western","the Western Hero","Western Hero ,","Hero , it",", it was","it was Montana-born","was Montana-born Cooper","Montana-born Cooper 's","Cooper 's horse-riding","'s horse-riding skills","horse-riding skills that","skills that first","that first brought","first brought him","brought him bit","him bit parts","bit parts in","parts in movies","And he never","he never lost","never lost his","lost his love","his love of","love of the","of the great","the great American","great American outdoors","Though he rarely","he rarely played","rarely played a","played a villain","a villain and","villain and was","and was an","was an adept","an adept comedian","adept comedian ,","comedian , Cooper",", Cooper is","Cooper is best","is best remembered","best remembered for","remembered for his","for his strong","his strong ,","strong , silent",", silent heroes","With his lanky","his lanky countryboy","lanky countryboy looks","countryboy looks and","looks and shy","and shy hesitancy","shy hesitancy he","hesitancy he created","he created a","created a unique","a unique screen","unique screen presence","screen presence ,","presence , though",", though his","though his real","his real life","real life was","life was one","was one of","one of sophisticated","of sophisticated elegance","Over 100 movies","100 movies brought","movies brought him","brought him three","him three Academy","three Academy Award","Academy Award Nominations","Award Nominations and","Nominations and two","and two Academy","two Academy Awards","Cooper 's most","'s most memorable","most memorable films","memorable films include","films include A","include A Farewell","A Farewell to","Farewell to Arms","to Arms ,","Arms , Mr.",", Mr. Deeds","Mr. Deeds Goes","Deeds Goes To","Goes To Town","To Town ,","Town , Meet",", Meet John","Meet John Doe","John Doe ,","Doe , The",", The Pride","The Pride of","Pride of the","of the Yankees","the Yankees and","Yankees and High","and High Noon","Daughter Maria Cooper","Maria Cooper Janis","Cooper Janis and","Janis and actors","and actors George","actors George C.","George C.

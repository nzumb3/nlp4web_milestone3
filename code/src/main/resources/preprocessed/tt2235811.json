{"title":"What Is Love","plot":"This film is a portrait of life, a portrait of people with varying life plans. It asks the meaning of life, about how to fill the gap between birth and death, and what is happiness. Short documentary pieces tell the stories of some very different protagonists of a generation: from the forest-owning family in their stately home to the factory worker following her daily routine.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","film","is","a","portrait","of","life",",","a","portrait","of","peopl","with","vari","life","plan",".","It","ask","the","mean","of","life",",","about","how","to","fill","the","gap","between","birth","and","death",",","and","what","is","happi",".","Short","documentari","piec","tell","the","stori","of","some","veri","differ","protagonist","of","a","generat",":","from","the","forest-own","famili","in","their","state","home","to","the","factori","worker","follow","her","daili","routin","."],"lemmas":["this","film","be","a","portrait","of","life",",","a","portrait","of","people","with","vary","life","plan",".","it","ask","the","meaning","of","life",",","about","how","to","fill","the","gap","between","birth","and","death",",","and","what","be","happiness",".","short","documentary","piece","tell","the","story","of","some","very","different","protagonist","of","a","generation",":","from","the","forest-owning","family","in","they","stately","home","to","the","factory","worker","follow","she","daily","routine","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["This film is","film is a","is a portrait","a portrait of","portrait of life","of life ,","life , a",", a portrait","a portrait of","portrait of people","of people with","people with varying","with varying life","varying life plans","It asks the","asks the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of life","of life ,","life , about",", about how","about how to","how to fill","to fill the","fill the gap","the gap between","gap between birth","between birth and","birth and death","and death ,","death , and",", and what","and what is","what is happiness","Short documentary pieces","documentary pieces tell","pieces tell the","tell the stories","the stories of","stories of some","of some very","some very different","very different protagonists","different protagonists of","protagonists of a","of a generation","a generation :","generation : from",": from the","from the forest-owning","the forest-owning family","forest-owning family in","family in their","in their stately","their stately home","stately home to","home to the","to the factory","the factory worker","factory worker following","worker following her","following her daily","her daily routine"],"2grams":["This film","film is","is a","a portrait","portrait of","of life","life ,",", a","a portrait","portrait of","of people","people with","with varying","varying life","life plans","It asks","asks the","the meaning","meaning of","of life","life ,",", about","about how","how to","to fill","fill the","the gap","gap between","between birth","birth and","and death","death ,",", and","and what","what is","is happiness","Short documentary","documentary pieces","pieces tell","tell the","the stories","stories of","of some","some very","very different","different protagonists","protagonists of","of a","a generation","generation :",": from","from the","the forest-owning","forest-owning family","family in","in their","their stately","stately home","home to","to the","the factory","factory worker","worker following","following her","her daily","daily routine"]}

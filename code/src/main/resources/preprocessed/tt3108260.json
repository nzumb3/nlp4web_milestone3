{"title":"These Hopeless Savages","plot":"Based on an original screenplay, THESE HOPELESS SAVAGES stars Matt Dellapina ('Safe', 'The Quitter') alongside Sean Christopher Lewis ('God's Country'), MacKenzie Meehan ('The Wolf Of Wall Street') and newcomer Maria Vorhis in this bromantic comedy/drama co-directed by Sean Christopher Lewis and Kaitlyn Busbee ('Molly's Girl'). When big news comes in for the constant bachelor Shawn, he makes it a mission to visit everyone who has shunned him for years. This includes his old friend Greg - a children's musician living in the cozy, domestic confines of Brooklyn. After the two old friends hit some hilarious re-acquainting pains, they soon hit the American road for a trip that will show them the gifts and the costs of real friendship.","genres":["Comedy"," Musical"," Drama"],"stems":["Base","on","an","origin","screenplay",",","THESE","HOPELESS","SAVAGES","star","Matt","Dellapina","(","'","Safe","'",",","'","The","Quitter","'",")","alongsid","Sean","Christoph","Lewi","(","'","God","'s","Countri","'",")",",","MacKenzi","Meehan","(","'","The","Wolf","Of","Wall","Street","'",")","and","newcom","Maria","Vorhi","in","this","bromant","comedy/drama","co-direct","by","Sean","Christoph","Lewi","and","Kaitlyn","Busbe","(","'","Molli","'s","Girl","'",")",".","When","big","news","come","in","for","the","constant","bachelor","Shawn",",","he","make","it","a","mission","to","visit","everyon","who","has","shun","him","for","year",".","This","includ","his","old","friend","Greg","-","a","children","'s","musician","live","in","the","cozi",",","domest","confin","of","Brooklyn",".","After","the","two","old","friend","hit","some","hilari","re-acquaint","pain",",","they","soon","hit","the","American","road","for","a","trip","that","will","show","them","the","gift","and","the","cost","of","real","friendship","."],"lemmas":["base","on","a","original","screenplay",",","THESE","HOPELESS","SAVAGES","star","Matt","Dellapina","-lrb-","'","safe","'",",","'","the","quitter","'","-rrb-","alongside","Sean","Christopher","Lewis","-lrb-","'","God","'s","Country","'","-rrb-",",","MacKenzie","Meehan","-lrb-","'","the","Wolf","of","Wall","Street","'","-rrb-","and","newcomer","Maria","Vorhis","in","this","bromantic","comedy/drama","co-direct","by","Sean","Christopher","Lewis","and","Kaitlyn","Busbee","-lrb-","'","Molly","'s","Girl","'","-rrb-",".","when","big","news","come","in","for","the","constant","bachelor","Shawn",",","he","make","it","a","mission","to","visit","everyone","who","have","shun","he","for","year",".","this","include","he","old","friend","Greg","-","a","children","'s","musician","live","in","the","cozy",",","domestic","confines","of","Brooklyn",".","after","the","two","old","friend","hit","some","hilarious","re-acquainting","pain",",","they","soon","hit","the","american","road","for","a","trip","that","will","show","they","the","gift","and","the","cost","of","real","friendship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Based on an","on an original","an original screenplay","original screenplay ,","screenplay , THESE",", THESE HOPELESS","THESE HOPELESS SAVAGES","HOPELESS SAVAGES stars","SAVAGES stars Matt","stars Matt Dellapina","Matt Dellapina (","Dellapina ( '","( ' Safe","' Safe '","Safe ' ,","' , '",", ' The","' The Quitter","The Quitter '","Quitter ' )","' ) alongside",") alongside Sean","alongside Sean Christopher","Sean Christopher Lewis","Christopher Lewis (","Lewis ( '","( ' God","' God 's","God 's Country","'s Country '","Country ' )","' ) ,",") , MacKenzie",", MacKenzie Meehan","MacKenzie Meehan (","Meehan ( '","( ' The","' The Wolf","The Wolf Of","Wolf Of Wall","Of Wall Street","Wall Street '","Street ' )","' ) and",") and newcomer","and newcomer Maria","newcomer Maria Vorhis","Maria Vorhis in","Vorhis in this","in this bromantic","this bromantic comedy/drama","bromantic comedy/drama co-directed","comedy/drama co-directed by","co-directed by Sean","by Sean Christopher","Sean Christopher Lewis","Christopher Lewis and","Lewis and Kaitlyn","and Kaitlyn Busbee","Kaitlyn Busbee (","Busbee ( '","( ' Molly","' Molly 's","Molly 's Girl","'s Girl '","Girl ' )","When big news","big news comes","news comes in","comes in for","in for the","for the constant","the constant bachelor","constant bachelor Shawn","bachelor Shawn ,","Shawn , he",", he makes","he makes it","makes it a","it a mission","a mission to","mission to visit","to visit everyone","visit everyone who","everyone who has","who has shunned","has shunned him","shunned him for","him for years","This includes his","includes his old","his old friend","old friend Greg","friend Greg -","Greg -

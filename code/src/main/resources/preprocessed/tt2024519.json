{"title":"The Broken Circle Breakdown","plot":"Elise and Didier fall in love at first sight. She has her own tattoo shop and he plays the banjo in a bluegrass band. They bond over their shared enthusiasm for American music and culture, and dive headfirst into a sweeping romance that plays out on and off stage - but when an unexpected tragedy hits their new family, everything they know and love is tested. An intensely moving portrait of a relationship from beginning to end, propelled by a soundtrack of foot-stomping bluegrass, The Broken Circle Breakdown is a romantic melodrama of the highest order.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["Elise","and","Didier","fall","in","love","at","first","sight",".","She","has","her","own","tattoo","shop","and","he","play","the","banjo","in","a","bluegrass","band",".","They","bond","over","their","share","enthusiasm","for","American","music","and","cultur",",","and","dive","headfirst","into","a","sweep","romanc","that","play","out","on","and","off","stage","-","but","when","an","unexpect","tragedi","hit","their","new","famili",",","everyth","they","know","and","love","is","test",".","An","intens","move","portrait","of","a","relationship","from","begin","to","end",",","propel","by","a","soundtrack","of","foot-stomp","bluegrass",",","The","Broken","Circl","Breakdown","is","a","romant","melodrama","of","the","highest","order","."],"lemmas":["Elise","and","Didier","fall","in","love","at","first","sight",".","she","have","she","own","tattoo","shop","and","he","play","the","banjo","in","a","bluegrass","band",".","they","bond","over","they","shared","enthusiasm","for","american","music","and","culture",",","and","dive","headfirst","into","a","sweeping","romance","that","play","out","on","and","off","stage","-","but","when","a","unexpected","tragedy","hit","they","new","family",",","everything","they","know","and","love","be","test",".","a","intensely","move","portrait","of","a","relationship","from","begin","to","end",",","propel","by","a","soundtrack","of","foot-stomping","bluegrass",",","the","Broken","Circle","Breakdown","be","a","romantic","melodrama","of","the","highest","order","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Elise and Didier","and Didier fall","Didier fall in","fall in love","in love at","love at first","at first sight","She has her","has her own","her own tattoo","own tattoo shop","tattoo shop and","shop and he","and he plays","he plays the","plays the banjo","the banjo in","banjo in a","in a bluegrass","a bluegrass band","They bond over","bond over their","over their shared","their shared enthusiasm","shared enthusiasm for","enthusiasm for American","for American music","American music and","music and culture","and culture ,","culture , and",", and dive","and dive headfirst","dive headfirst into","headfirst into a","into a sweeping","a sweeping romance","sweeping romance that","romance that plays","that plays out","plays out on","out on and","on and off","and off stage","off stage -","stage - but","- but when","but when an","when an unexpected","an unexpected tragedy","unexpected tragedy hits","tragedy hits their","hits their new","their new family","new family ,","family , everything",", everything they","everything they know","they know and","know and love","and love is","love is tested","An intensely moving","intensely moving portrait","moving portrait of","portrait of a","of a relationship","a relationship from","relationship from beginning","from beginning to","beginning to end","to end ,","end , propelled",", propelled by","propelled by a","by a soundtrack","a soundtrack of","soundtrack of foot-stomping","of foot-stomping bluegrass","foot-stomping bluegrass ,","bluegrass , The",", The Broken","The Broken Circle","Broken Circle Breakdown","Circle Breakdown is","Breakdown is a","is a romantic","a romantic melodrama","romantic melodrama of","melodrama of the","of the highest","the highest order"],"2grams":["Elise and","and Didier","Didier fall","fall in","in love","love at","at first","first sight","She has","has her","her own","own tattoo","tattoo shop","shop and","and he","he plays","plays the","the banjo","banjo in","in a","a bluegrass","bluegrass band","They bond","bond over","over their","their shared","shared enthusiasm","enthusiasm for","for American","American music","music and","and culture","culture ,",", and","and dive","dive headfirst","headfirst into","into a","a sweeping","sweeping romance","romance that","that plays","plays out","out on","on and","and off","off stage","stage -","- but","but when","when an","an unexpected","unexpected tragedy","tragedy hits","hits their","their new","new family","family ,",", everything","everything they","they know","know and","and love","love is","is tested","An intensely","intensely moving","moving portrait","portrait of","of a","a relationship","relationship from","from beginning","beginning to","to end","end ,",", propelled","propelled by","by a","a soundtrack","soundtrack of","of foot-stomping","foot-stomping bluegrass","bluegrass ,",", The","The Broken","Broken Circle","Circle Breakdown","Breakdown is","is a","a romantic","romantic melodrama","melodrama of","of the","the highest","highest order"]}

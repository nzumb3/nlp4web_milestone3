In the hospital he has to care mostly for shotgun wounds, while in the streets he falls in love with a stall-holder who cares for some of the children involved in drug trafficking and criminal violence. Alienating his colleagues and his host family while befriending the kids, he soon finds himself trapped in the center of the violent conflict between the gangs and has to come to a decision.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Marc",",","an","unexperienc","medic","doctor","from","Germani","arriv","at","the","Hospit","Universitario","del","Vall","in","Cali",",","Colombia","for","his","internship","and","soon","find","himself","in-between","a","rage","gang","war","in","Siloé",",","a","Cali","barrio",".","In","the","hospit","he","has","to","care","most","for","shotgun","wound",",","while","in","the","street","he","fall","in","love","with","a","stall-hold","who","care","for","some","of","the","children","involv","in","drug","traffick","and","crimin","violenc",".","Alienat","his","colleagu","and","his","host","famili","while","befriend","the","kid",",","he","soon","find","himself","trap","in","the","center","of","the","violent","conflict","between","the","gang","and","has","to","come","to","a","decis","."],"lemmas":["Marc",",","a","unexperienced","medical","doctor","from","Germany","arrive","at","the","Hospital","Universitario","del","Valle","in","Cali",",","Colombia","for","he","internship","and","soon","find","himself","in-between","a","rage","gang","war","in","Siloé",",","a","cali","barrio",".","in","the","hospital","he","have","to","care","mostly","for","shotgun","wound",",","while","in","the","street","he","fall","in","love","with","a","stall-holder","who","care","for","some","of","the","child","involve","in","drug","trafficking","and","criminal","violence",".","alienate","he","colleague","and","he","host","family","while","befriend","the","kid",",","he","soon","find","himself","trap","in","the","center","of","the","violent","conflict","between","the","gang","and","have","to","come","to","a","decision","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Marc

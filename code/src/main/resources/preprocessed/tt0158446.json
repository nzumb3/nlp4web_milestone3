{"title":"2 Seconds","plot":"Laurie, a professional downhill racer gets fired because of her slight overindulgence in irresponsibility. She returns to Montreal where she is welcomed by her geeky but cute brother. She meets Lorenzo, a cranky, ex-racer who owns a bike shop. The two become friends. Laurie gets a job with a local bicycle courier company, but a member of the group is intent on shutting her out of their circles, making her life difficult and sad. After a bonding truth-revealing discussion between Laurie and Lorenzo, Laurie begins to see what she has to do to make things better for herself.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Lauri",",","a","profession","downhil","racer","get","fire","becaus","of","her","slight","overindulg","in","irrespons",".","She","return","to","Montreal","where","she","is","welcom","by","her","geeki","but","cute","brother",".","She","meet","Lorenzo",",","a","cranki",",","ex-rac","who","own","a","bike","shop",".","The","two","becom","friend",".","Lauri","get","a","job","with","a","local","bicycl","courier","compani",",","but","a","member","of","the","group","is","intent","on","shut","her","out","of","their","circl",",","make","her","life","difficult","and","sad",".","After","a","bond","truth-rev","discuss","between","Lauri","and","Lorenzo",",","Lauri","begin","to","see","what","she","has","to","do","to","make","thing","better","for","herself","."],"lemmas":["Laurie",",","a","professional","downhill","racer","get","fire","because","of","she","slight","overindulgence","in","irresponsibility",".","she","return","to","Montreal","where","she","be","welcome","by","she","geeky","but","cute","brother",".","she","meet","Lorenzo",",","a","cranky",",","ex-racer","who","own","a","bike","shop",".","the","two","become","friend",".","Laurie","get","a","job","with","a","local","bicycle","courier","company",",","but","a","member","of","the","group","be","intent","on","shut","she","out","of","they","circle",",","make","she","life","difficult","and","sad",".","after","a","bonding","truth-revealing","discussion","between","Laurie","and","Lorenzo",",","Laurie","begin","to","see","what","she","have","to","do","to","make","thing","better","for","herself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Laurie , a",", a professional","a professional downhill","professional downhill racer","downhill racer gets","racer gets fired","gets fired because","fired because of","because of her","of her slight","her slight overindulgence","slight overindulgence in","overindulgence in irresponsibility","She returns to","returns to Montreal","to Montreal where","Montreal where she","where she is","she is welcomed","is welcomed by","welcomed by her","by her geeky","her geeky but","geeky but cute","but cute brother","She meets Lorenzo","meets Lorenzo ,","Lorenzo , a",", a cranky","a cranky ,","cranky , ex-racer",", ex-racer who","ex-racer who owns","who owns a","owns a bike","a bike shop","The two become","two become friends","Laurie gets a","gets a job","a job with","job with a","with a local","a local bicycle","local bicycle courier","bicycle courier company","courier company ,","company , but",", but a","but a member","a member of","member of the","of the group","the group is","group is intent","is intent on","intent on shutting","on shutting her","shutting her out","her out of","out of their","of their circles","their circles ,","circles , making",", making her","making her life","her life difficult","life difficult and","difficult and sad","After a bonding","a bonding truth-revealing","bonding truth-revealing discussion","truth-revealing discussion between","discussion between Laurie","between Laurie and","Laurie and Lorenzo","and Lorenzo ,","Lorenzo , Laurie",", Laurie begins","Laurie begins to","begins to see","to see what","see what she","what she has","she has to","has to do","to do to","do to make","to make things","make things better","things better for","better for herself"],"2grams":["Laurie ,",", a","a professional","professional downhill","downhill racer","racer gets","gets fired","fired because","because of","of her","her slight","slight overindulgence","overindulgence in","in irresponsibility","She returns","returns to","to Montreal","Montreal where","where she","she is","is welcomed","welcomed by","by her","her geeky","geeky but","but cute","cute brother","She meets","meets Lorenzo","Lorenzo ,",", a","a cranky","cranky ,",", ex-racer","ex-racer who","who owns","owns a","a bike","bike shop","The two","two become","become friends","Laurie gets","gets a","a job","job with","with a","a local","local bicycle","bicycle courier","courier company","company ,",", but","but a","a member","member of","of the","the group","group is","is intent","intent on","on shutting","shutting her","her out","out of","of their","their circles","circles ,",", making","making her","her life","life difficult","difficult and","and sad","After a","a bonding","bonding truth-revealing","truth-revealing discussion","discussion between","between Laurie","Laurie and","and Lorenzo","Lorenzo ,",", Laurie","Laurie begins","begins to","to see","see what","what she","she has","has to","to do","do to","to make","make things","things better","better for","for herself"]}

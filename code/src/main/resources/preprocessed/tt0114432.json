To prevent another attack of the terrorists at the US-Cuba-summit in Prague the CIA sends one of their best federal agents, Michael Dane (Dolph Lundgren). The suspected killer Nikita is a lesbian club owner, Simone Rosset. But as usual everything is much more complicated than it seemed at first; and therefore Dane has to work much more with his brain than with his muscles to survive.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["The","Ambassador","of","Cuba","was","kill","in","New","York",".","To","prevent","anoth","attack","of","the","terrorist","at","the","US-Cuba-summit","in","Pragu","the","CIA","send","one","of","their","best","feder","agent",",","Michael","Dane","(","Dolph","Lundgren",")",".","The","suspect","killer","Nikita","is","a","lesbian","club","owner",",","Simon","Rosset",".","But","as","usual","everyth","is","much","more","complic","than","it","seem","at","first",";","and","therefor","Dane","has","to","work","much","more","with","his","brain","than","with","his","muscl","to","surviv","."],"lemmas":["the","Ambassador","of","Cuba","be","kill","in","New","York",".","to","prevent","another","attack","of","the","terrorist","at","the","us-cuba-summit","in","Prague","the","CIA","send","one","of","they","best","federal","agent",",","Michael","dane","-lrb-","Dolph","Lundgren","-rrb-",".","the","suspected","killer","Nikita","be","a","lesbian","club","owner",",","Simone","Rosset",".","but","as","usual","everything","be","much","more","complicated","than","it","seem","at","first",";","and","therefore","dane","have","to","work","much","more","with","he","brain","than","with","he","muscle","to","survive","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Ambassador of","Ambassador of Cuba","of Cuba was","Cuba was killed","was killed in","killed in New","in New York","To prevent another","prevent another attack","another attack of","attack of the","of the terrorists","the terrorists at","terrorists at the","at the US-Cuba-summit","the US-Cuba-summit in","US-Cuba-summit in Prague","in Prague the","Prague the CIA","the CIA sends","CIA sends one","sends one of","one of their","of their best","their best federal","best federal agents","federal agents ,","agents , Michael",", Michael Dane","Michael Dane (","Dane ( Dolph","( Dolph Lundgren","Dolph Lundgren )","The suspected killer","suspected killer Nikita","killer Nikita is","Nikita is a","is a lesbian","a lesbian club","lesbian club owner","club owner ,","owner , Simone",", Simone Rosset","But as usual","as usual everything","usual everything is","everything is much","is much more","much more complicated","more complicated than","complicated than it","than it seemed","it seemed at","seemed at first","at first ;","first ; and","; and therefore","and therefore Dane","therefore Dane has","Dane has to","has to work","to work much","work much more","much more with","more with his","with his brain","his brain than","brain than with","than with his","with his muscles","his muscles to","muscles to survive"],"2grams":["The Ambassador","Ambassador of","of Cuba","Cuba was","was killed","killed in","in New","New York","To prevent","prevent another","another attack","attack of","of the","the terrorists","terrorists at","at the","the US-Cuba-summit","US-Cuba-summit in","in Prague","Prague the","the CIA","CIA sends","sends one","one of","of their","their best","best federal","federal agents","agents ,",", Michael","Michael Dane","Dane (","( Dolph","Dolph Lundgren","Lundgren )","The suspected","suspected killer","killer Nikita","Nikita is","is a","a lesbian","lesbian club","club owner","owner ,",", Simone","Simone Rosset","But as","as usual","usual everything","everything is","is much","much more","more complicated","complicated than","than it","it seemed","seemed at","at first","first ;","; and","and therefore","therefore Dane","Dane has","has to","to work","work much","much more","more with","with his","his brain","brain than","than with","with his","his muscles","muscles to","to survive"]}

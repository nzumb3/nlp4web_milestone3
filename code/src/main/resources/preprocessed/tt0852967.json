{"title":"IceBreaker","plot":"Gary just wants a date. But his confidence has taken a hit after three straight years of rejection. Now he sets his sights on Lindsay. Will she finally break his streak and give him a chance, or will she be one more name to add to his list of rejections? With help from his friends Eric and Roach, he hopes to find out. Sam just wants an adult relationship. But her boyfriend, Keith, is a little slow on the uptake. Should Sam move on and subject herself to an onslaught of idiot men in search of a better fit, or is it just safer to 'settle' and stay with Keith? You think war is hell? Try dating.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Gari","just","want","a","date",".","But","his","confid","has","taken","a","hit","after","three","straight","year","of","reject",".","Now","he","set","his","sight","on","Lindsay",".","Will","she","final","break","his","streak","and","give","him","a","chanc",",","or","will","she","be","one","more","name","to","add","to","his","list","of","reject","?","With","help","from","his","friend","Eric","and","Roach",",","he","hope","to","find","out",".","Sam","just","want","an","adult","relationship",".","But","her","boyfriend",",","Keith",",","is","a","littl","slow","on","the","uptak",".","Should","Sam","move","on","and","subject","herself","to","an","onslaught","of","idiot","men","in","search","of","a","better","fit",",","or","is","it","just","safer","to","'","settl","'","and","stay","with","Keith","?","You","think","war","is","hell","?","Tri","date","."],"lemmas":["Gary","just","want","a","date",".","but","he","confidence","have","take","a","hit","after","three","straight","year","of","rejection",".","now","he","set","he","sight","on","Lindsay",".","will","she","finally","break","he","streak","and","give","he","a","chance",",","or","will","she","be","one","more","name","to","add","to","he","list","of","rejection","?","with","help","from","he","friend","Eric","and","Roach",",","he","hope","to","find","out",".","Sam","just","want","a","adult","relationship",".","but","she","boyfriend",",","Keith",",","be","a","little","slow","on","the","uptake",".","should","Sam","move","on","and","subject","herself","to","a","onslaught","of","idiot","man","in","search","of","a","better","fit",",","or","be","it","just","safer","to","'","settle","'","and","stay","with","Keith","?","you","think","war","be","hell","?","try","date","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gary just wants","just wants a","wants a date","But his confidence","his confidence has","confidence has taken","has taken a","taken a hit","a hit after","hit after three","after three straight","three straight years","straight years of","years of rejection","Now he sets","he sets his","sets his sights","his sights on","sights on Lindsay","Will she finally","she finally break","finally break his","break his streak","his streak and","streak and give","and give him","give him a","him a chance","a chance ,","chance , or",", or will","or will she","will she be","she be one","be one more","one more name","more name to","name to add","to add to","add to his","to his list","his list of","list of rejections","With help from","help from his","from his friends","his friends Eric","friends Eric and","Eric and Roach","and Roach ,","Roach , he",", he hopes","he hopes to","hopes to find","to find out","Sam just wants","just wants an","wants an adult","an adult relationship","But her boyfriend","her boyfriend ,","boyfriend , Keith",", Keith ,","Keith , is",", is a","is a little","a little slow","little slow on","slow on the","on the uptake","Should Sam move","Sam move on","move on and","on and subject","and subject herself","subject herself to","herself to an","to an onslaught","an onslaught of","onslaught of idiot","of idiot men","idiot men in","men in search","in search of","search of a","of a better","a better fit","better fit ,","fit , or",", or is","or is it","is it just","it just safer","just safer to","safer to '","to ' settle","' settle '","settle ' and","' and stay","and stay with","stay with Keith","You think war","think war is","war is hell"],"2grams":["Gary just","just wants","wants a","a date","But his","his confidence","confidence has","has taken","taken a","a hit","hit after","after three","three straight","straight years","years of","of rejection","Now he","he sets","sets his","his sights","sights on","on Lindsay","Will she","she finally","finally break","break his","his streak","streak and","and give","give him","him a","a chance","chance ,",", or","or will","will she","she be","be one","one more","more name","name to","to add","add to","to his","his list","list of","of rejections","With help","help from","from his","his friends","friends Eric","Eric and","and Roach","Roach ,",", he","he hopes","hopes to","to find","find out","Sam just","just wants","wants an","an adult","adult relationship","But her","her boyfriend","boyfriend ,",", Keith","Keith ,",", is","is a","a little","little slow","slow on","on the","the uptake","Should Sam","Sam move","move on","on and","and subject","subject herself","herself to","to an","an onslaught","onslaught of","of idiot","idiot men","men in","in search","search of","of a","a better","better fit","fit ,",", or","or is","is it","it just","just safer","safer to","to '","' settle","settle '","' and","and stay","stay with","with Keith","You think","think war","war is","is hell","Try dating"]}

{"title":"Aaya Toofan","plot":"The disputed area between the borders of India and Pakistan is the scene of heavy terrorist activity, as they intent to intensify their agitation to put pressure on the Indian Government to free Kashmir and Kashmiris and let them govern themselves independently. An attempt is made on the Home Minister himself, in vain though. Then the police raid the Home Minister's bodyguard, Noor Mohamed Azaad, house killing his mother, father, a journalist friend, and sister, arresting him, beating him up and then throwing him out from their jeep. The Home Minister and the police promise action, but a devastated Noor decides to take up arms against the Indian forces and joins the terrorists, headed by Masood Qadri. Alarmed at these actions, the Home Minister meets with the Indian Army Major, and together they decide to reinstate dishonorably discharged Arjun Singh Toofan back into the army and assign him with the task of apprehending the terrorists who are now led by Masood, Noor, Sultan Baluchi, and Colonel Gaddafi. Arjun apprehends Masood, but not for long, as his gang abducts a bus-load of passengers and hold them hostage until Masood's release. A dithering army major, whose daughter is amongst the hostages, releases Masood, and suspends Arjun for disobeying orders. Enraged with the Indian army and it's tactics, Arjun turns renegade and decides to join the terrorists. Masood would like to welcome him with open arms, but first Arjun must prove his worth - he must kill an important person in the Indian Government to qualify. The question remains - who is the one that Arjun must kill?","genres":["Action"],"stems":["The","disput","area","between","the","border","of","India","and","Pakistan","is","the","scene","of","heavi","terrorist","activ",",","as","they","intent","to","intensifi","their","agit","to","put","pressur","on","the","Indian","Govern","to","free","Kashmir","and","Kashmiri","and","let","them","govern","themselv","independ",".","An","attempt","is","made","on","the","Home","Minist","himself",",","in","vain","though",".","Then","the","polic","raid","the","Home","Minist","'s","bodyguard",",","Noor","Moham","Azaad",",","hous","kill","his","mother",",","father",",","a","journalist","friend",",","and","sister",",","arrest","him",",","beat","him","up","and","then","throw","him","out","from","their","jeep",".","The","Home","Minist","and","the","polic","promis","action",",","but","a","devast","Noor","decid","to","take","up","arm","against","the","Indian","forc","and","join","the","terrorist",",","head","by","Masood","Qadri",".","Alarm","at","these","action",",","the","Home","Minist","meet","with","the","Indian","Armi","Major",",","and","togeth","they","decid","to","reinstat","dishonor","discharg","Arjun","Singh","Toofan","back","into","the","armi","and","assign","him","with","the","task","of","apprehend","the","terrorist","who","are","now","led","by","Masood",",","Noor",",","Sultan","Baluchi",",","and","Colonel","Gaddafi",".","Arjun","apprehend","Masood",",","but","not","for","long",",","as","his","gang","abduct","a","bus-load","of","passeng","and","hold","them","hostag","until","Masood","'s","releas",".","A","dither","armi","major",",","whose","daughter","is","amongst","the","hostag",",","releas","Masood",",","and","suspend","Arjun","for","disobey","order",".","Enrage","with","the","Indian","armi","and","it","'s","tactic",",","Arjun","turn","renegad","and","decid","to","join","the","terrorist",".","Masood","would","like","to","welcom","him","with","open","arm",",","but","first","Arjun","must","prove","his","worth","-","he","must","kill","an","import","person","in","the","Indian","Govern","to","qualifi",".","The","question","remain","-","who","is","the","one","that","Arjun","must","kill","?"],"lemmas":["the","disputed","area","between","the","border","of","India","and","Pakistan","be","the","scene","of","heavy","terrorist","activity",",","as","they","intent","to","intensify","they","agitation","to","put","pressure","on","the","Indian","Government","to","free","Kashmir","and","Kashmiris","and","let","they","govern","themselves","independently",".","a","attempt","be","make","on","the","Home","Minister","himself",",","in","vain","though",".","then","the","police","raid","the","Home","Minister","'s","bodyguard",",","Noor","Mohamed","Azaad",",","house","kill","he","mother",",","father",",","a","journalist","friend",",","and","sister",",","arrest","he",",","beat","he","up","and","then","throw","he","out","from","they","jeep",".","the","Home","Minister","and","the","police","promise","action",",","but","a","devastate","Noor","decide","to","take","up","arm","against","the","Indian","force","and","join","the","terrorist",",","head","by","Masood","Qadri",".","alarm","at","these","action",",","the","Home","Minister","meet","with","the","Indian","Army","Major",",","and","together","they","decide","to","reinstate","dishonorably","discharge","Arjun","Singh","Toofan","back","into","the","army","and","assign","he","with","the","task","of","apprehend","the","terrorist","who","be","now","lead","by","Masood",",","Noor",",","Sultan","Baluchi",",","and","Colonel","Gaddafi",".","Arjun","apprehend","Masood",",","but","not","for","long",",","as","he","gang","abduct","a","bus-load","of","passenger","and","hold","they","hostage","until","Masood","'s","release",".","a","dither","army","major",",","whose","daughter","be","amongst","the","hostage",",","release","Masood",",","and","suspend","Arjun","for","disobey","order",".","enraged","with","the","indian","army","and","it","be","tactic",",","Arjun","turn","renegade","and","decide","to","join","the","terrorist",".","Masood","would","like","to","welcome","he","with","open","arm",",","but","first","Arjun","must","prove","he","worth","-","he","must","kill","a","important","person","in","the","Indian","Government","to","qualify",".","the","question","remain","-","who","be","the","one","that","Arjun","must","kill","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

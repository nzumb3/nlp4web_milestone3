{"title":"The Loser's Club","plot":"Nam is a small-time radio producer eager to be hottest producer in town. Nam promotes washed-up singer Kenny to gain public awareness and support. Kenny's loony stunts and bizarre diva-like behavior make him the talk of the town, and with Nam in tow, the two dominate the airwaves. They're called upon to host a countdown show. However, before the show goes on air, program manager Yiu asks that either Kenny be removed from the program or Nam will lose his job.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Nam","is","a","small-tim","radio","produc","eager","to","be","hottest","produc","in","town",".","Nam","promot","washed-up","singer","Kenni","to","gain","public","awar","and","support",".","Kenni","'s","looni","stunt","and","bizarr","diva-lik","behavior","make","him","the","talk","of","the","town",",","and","with","Nam","in","tow",",","the","two","domin","the","airwav",".","They","re","call","upon","to","host","a","countdown","show",".","Howev",",","befor","the","show","goe","on","air",",","program","manag","Yiu","ask","that","either","Kenni","be","remov","from","the","program","or","Nam","will","lose","his","job","."],"lemmas":["Nam","be","a","small-time","radio","producer","eager","to","be","hottest","producer","in","town",".","Nam","promote","washed-up","singer","Kenny","to","gain","public","awareness","and","support",".","Kenny","'s","loony","stunt","and","bizarre","diva-like","behavior","make","he","the","talk","of","the","town",",","and","with","Nam","in","tow",",","the","two","dominate","the","airwave",".","they","be","call","upon","to","host","a","countdown","show",".","however",",","before","the","show","go","on","air",",","program","manager","yiu","ask","that","either","Kenny","be","remove","from","the","program","or","Nam","will","lose","he","job","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nam is a","is a small-time","a small-time radio","small-time radio producer","radio producer eager","producer eager to","eager to be","to be hottest","be hottest producer","hottest producer in","producer in town","Nam promotes washed-up","promotes washed-up singer","washed-up singer Kenny","singer Kenny to","Kenny to gain","to gain public","gain public awareness","public awareness and","awareness and support","Kenny 's loony","'s loony stunts","loony stunts and","stunts and bizarre","and bizarre diva-like","bizarre diva-like behavior","diva-like behavior make","behavior make him","make him the","him the talk","the talk of","talk of the","of the town","the town ,","town , and",", and with","and with Nam","with Nam in","Nam in tow","in tow ,","tow , the",", the two","the two dominate","two dominate the","dominate the airwaves","They 're called","'re called upon","called upon to","upon to host","to host a","host a countdown","a countdown show","However , before",", before the","before the show","the show goes","show goes on","goes on air","on air ,","air , program",", program manager","program manager Yiu","manager Yiu asks","Yiu asks that","asks that either","that either Kenny","either Kenny be","Kenny be removed","be removed from","removed from the","from the program","the program or","program or Nam","or Nam will","Nam will lose","will lose his","lose his job"],"2grams":["Nam is","is a","a small-time","small-time radio","radio producer","producer eager","eager to","to be","be hottest","hottest producer","producer in","in town","Nam promotes","promotes washed-up","washed-up singer","singer Kenny","Kenny to","to gain","gain public","public awareness","awareness and","and support","Kenny 's","'s loony","loony stunts","stunts and","and bizarre","bizarre diva-like","diva-like behavior","behavior make","make him","him the","the talk","talk of","of the","the town","town ,",", and","and with","with Nam","Nam in","in tow","tow ,",", the","the two","two dominate","dominate the","the airwaves","They 're","'re called","called upon","upon to","to host","host a","a countdown","countdown show","However ,",", before","before the","the show","show goes","goes on","on air","air ,",", program","program manager","manager Yiu","Yiu asks","asks that","that either","either Kenny","Kenny be","be removed","removed from","from the","the program","program or","or Nam","Nam will","will lose","lose his","his job"]}

{"title":"The Runaway","plot":"Jon Chryst, now 60, has been an outlaw for his entire adult life. After 30 years in isolation, the law has finally caught up to him. As he makes a final attempt to escape with his life, Jon reflects on the events that led him here. Jon's life begins on a farm in a seemingly wholesome Christian family. When Jon is 14, tragedy strikes, forcing him to flee his home and begin his life on the run. Shortly thereafter, Jon encounters Morris, a fellow outcast who takes Jon in and raises him like a son. For several years, Morris teaches Jon the necessities of adulthood- how to hunt, how to build, and how to rob small businesses. Their partnership ends abruptly, and Jon uses his new skills to pursue a life of crime. Over nearly a decade, Jon develops a powerful notoriety for his criminal activity. But everything changes when he meets Cat Donovan. Jon gives up his lifestyle and adopts a new identity to be with her. He proves his worth and is accepted into the Donovan family, leaving his loneliness behind. It almost looks like a happy ending for Jon Chryst, but he cannot escape the law forever.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Jon","Chryst",",","now","60",",","has","been","an","outlaw","for","his","entir","adult","life",".","After","30","year","in","isol",",","the","law","has","final","caught","up","to","him",".","As","he","make","a","final","attempt","to","escap","with","his","life",",","Jon","reflect","on","the","event","that","led","him","here",".","Jon","'s","life","begin","on","a","farm","in","a","seem","wholesom","Christian","famili",".","When","Jon","is","14",",","tragedi","strike",",","forc","him","to","flee","his","home","and","begin","his","life","on","the","run",".","Short","thereaft",",","Jon","encount","Morri",",","a","fellow","outcast","who","take","Jon","in","and","rais","him","like","a","son",".","For","sever","year",",","Morri","teach","Jon","the","necess","of","adulthood","-","how","to","hunt",",","how","to","build",",","and","how","to","rob","small","busi",".","Their","partnership","end","abrupt",",","and","Jon","use","his","new","skill","to","pursu","a","life","of","crime",".","Over","near","a","decad",",","Jon","develop","a","power","notorieti","for","his","crimin","activ",".","But","everyth","chang","when","he","meet","Cat","Donovan",".","Jon","give","up","his","lifestyl","and","adopt","a","new","ident","to","be","with","her",".","He","prove","his","worth","and","is","accept","into","the","Donovan","famili",",","leav","his","loneli","behind",".","It","almost","look","like","a","happi","end","for","Jon","Chryst",",","but","he","can","not","escap","the","law","forev","."],"lemmas":["Jon","Chryst",",","now","60",",","have","be","a","outlaw","for","he","entire","adult","life",".","after","30","year","in","isolation",",","the","law","have","finally","catch","up","to","he",".","as","he","make","a","final","attempt","to","escape","with","he","life",",","Jon","reflect","on","the","event","that","lead","he","here",".","Jon","'s","life","begin","on","a","farm","in","a","seemingly","wholesome","Christian","family",".","when","Jon","be","14",",","tragedy","strike",",","force","he","to","flee","he","home","and","begin","he","life","on","the","run",".","shortly","thereafter",",","Jon","encounter","Morris",",","a","fellow","outcast","who","take","Jon","in","and","raise","he","like","a","son",".","for","several","year",",","Morris","teach","Jon","the","necessity","of","adulthood","-","how","to","hunt",",","how","to","build",",","and","how","to","rob","small","business",".","they","partnership","end","abruptly",",","and","Jon","use","he","new","skill","to","pursue","a","life","of","crime",".","over","nearly","a","decade",",","Jon","develop","a","powerful","notoriety","for","he","criminal","activity",".","but","everything","change","when","he","meet","Cat","Donovan",".","Jon","give","up","he","lifestyle","and","adopt","a","new","identity","to","be","with","she",".","he","prove","he","worth","and","be","accept","into","the","Donovan","family",",","leave","he","loneliness","behind",".","it","almost","look","like","a","happy","ending","for","Jon","Chryst",",","but","he","can","not","escape","the","law","forever","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jon

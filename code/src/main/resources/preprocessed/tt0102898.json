{"title":"Shakes the Clown","plot":"Shakes plods about his duties as party clown, and uses all of his free time getting seriously drunk. Binky, another clown, wins the spot on a local kiddie show, which depresses Shakes even more, and his boss threatens him with unemployment if he can't get his act under control. When someone murders Shakes' boss and makes it look like Shakes did it, he goes undercover, posing as a hated mime, and tries to find information that will clear his name.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Shake","plod","about","his","duti","as","parti","clown",",","and","use","all","of","his","free","time","get","serious","drunk",".","Binki",",","anoth","clown",",","win","the","spot","on","a","local","kiddi","show",",","which","depress","Shake","even","more",",","and","his","boss","threaten","him","with","unemploy","if","he","ca","n't","get","his","act","under","control",".","When","someon","murder","Shake","'","boss","and","make","it","look","like","Shake","did","it",",","he","goe","undercov",",","pose","as","a","hate","mime",",","and","tri","to","find","inform","that","will","clear","his","name","."],"lemmas":["shakes","plods","about","he","duty","as","party","clown",",","and","use","all","of","he","free","time","get","seriously","drunk",".","Binky",",","another","clown",",","win","the","spot","on","a","local","kiddie","show",",","which","depress","shake","even","more",",","and","he","boss","threaten","he","with","unemployment","if","he","can","not","get","he","act","under","control",".","when","someone","murder","shake","'","boss","and","make","it","look","like","shake","do","it",",","he","go","undercover",",","pose","as","a","hated","mime",",","and","try","to","find","information","that","will","clear","he","name","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Shakes plods about","plods about his","about his duties","his duties as","duties as party","as party clown","party clown ,","clown , and",", and uses","and uses all","uses all of","all of his","of his free","his free time","free time getting","time getting seriously","getting seriously drunk","Binky , another",", another clown","another clown ,","clown , wins",", wins the","wins the spot","the spot on","spot on a","on a local","a local kiddie","local kiddie show","kiddie show ,","show , which",", which depresses","which depresses Shakes","depresses Shakes even","Shakes even more","even more ,","more , and",", and his","and his boss","his boss threatens","boss threatens him","threatens him with","him with unemployment","with unemployment if","unemployment if he","if he ca","he ca n't","ca n't get","n't get his","get his act","his act under","act under control","When someone murders","someone murders Shakes","murders Shakes '","Shakes ' boss","' boss and","boss and makes","and makes it","makes it look","it look like","look like Shakes","like Shakes did","Shakes did it","did it ,","it , he",", he goes","he goes undercover","goes undercover ,","undercover , posing",", posing as","posing as a","as a hated","a hated mime","hated mime ,","mime , and",", and tries","and tries to","tries to find","to find information","find information that","information that will","that will clear","will clear his","clear his name"],"2grams":["Shakes plods","plods about","about his","his duties","duties as","as party","party clown","clown ,",", and","and uses","uses all","all of","of his","his free","free time","time getting","getting seriously","seriously drunk","Binky ,",", another","another clown","clown ,",", wins","wins the","the spot","spot on","on a","a local","local kiddie","kiddie show","show ,",", which","which depresses","depresses Shakes","Shakes even","even more","more ,",", and","and his","his boss","boss threatens","threatens him","him with","with unemployment","unemployment if","if he","he ca","ca n't","n't get","get his","his act","act under","under control","When someone","someone murders","murders Shakes","Shakes '","' boss","boss and","and makes","makes it","it look","look like","like Shakes","Shakes did","did it","it ,",", he","he goes","goes undercover","undercover ,",", posing","posing as","as a","a hated","hated mime","mime ,",", and","and tries","tries to","to find","find information","information that","that will","will clear","clear his","his name"]}

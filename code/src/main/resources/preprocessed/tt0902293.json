{"title":"Iyi Seneler Londra","plot":"What if the unexpected becomes your faith? Would you lay claim to it and stay or would you run away? International Performer Yasar Nur has arrived in London the night before her concert and a few days away from the New Year. A formidable destination for Yasar, and one that will resurface a history best left forgotten, on a night that can change it all. Pain, responsibility, decision and courage get Yasar through the night in her hotel room where communication becomes hope for everyone involved. What will happen when an old friend is forced to give Yasar a great responsibility she may be unable to handle, or when a disturbed and powerful fan decides to change his life by meeting his obsession face to face, or when a disheartened husband makes a drastic decision to end his pain and set his wife free? The actions of one young man will bring these characters together and force them to communicate firstly with themselves, and then with each other, and only some will survive","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["What","if","the","unexpect","becom","your","faith","?","Would","you","lay","claim","to","it","and","stay","or","would","you","run","away","?","Internat","Perform","Yasar","Nur","has","arriv","in","London","the","night","befor","her","concert","and","a","few","day","away","from","the","New","Year",".","A","formid","destin","for","Yasar",",","and","one","that","will","resurfac","a","histori","best","left","forgotten",",","on","a","night","that","can","chang","it","all",".","Pain",",","respons",",","decis","and","courag","get","Yasar","through","the","night","in","her","hotel","room","where","communic","becom","hope","for","everyon","involv",".","What","will","happen","when","an","old","friend","is","forc","to","give","Yasar","a","great","respons","she","may","be","unabl","to","handl",",","or","when","a","disturb","and","power","fan","decid","to","chang","his","life","by","meet","his","obsess","face","to","face",",","or","when","a","dishearten","husband","make","a","drastic","decis","to","end","his","pain","and","set","his","wife","free","?","The","action","of","one","young","man","will","bring","these","charact","togeth","and","forc","them","to","communic","first","with","themselv",",","and","then","with","each","other",",","and","onli","some","will","surviv"],"lemmas":["what","if","the","unexpected","become","you","faith","?","would","you","lay","claim","to","it","and","stay","or","would","you","run","away","?","International","Performer","Yasar","Nur","have","arrive","in","London","the","night","before","she","concert","and","a","few","day","away","from","the","New","Year",".","a","formidable","destination","for","Yasar",",","and","one","that","will","resurface","a","history","best","leave","forget",",","on","a","night","that","can","change","it","all",".","pain",",","responsibility",",","decision","and","courage","get","Yasar","through","the","night","in","she","hotel","room","where","communication","become","hope","for","everyone","involve",".","what","will","happen","when","a","old","friend","be","force","to","give","Yasar","a","great","responsibility","she","may","be","unable","to","handle",",","or","when","a","disturbed","and","powerful","fan","decide","to","change","he","life","by","meet","he","obsession","face","to","face",",","or","when","a","disheartened","husband","make","a","drastic","decision","to","end","he","pain","and","set","he","wife","free","?","the","action","of","one","young","man","will","bring","these","character","together","and","force","they","to","communicate","firstly","with","themselves",",","and","then","with","each","other",",","and","only","some","will","survive"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What

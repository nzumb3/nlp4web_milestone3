{"title":"Devil's Harvest","plot":"It seems innocent enough. Struggling young artist Daniel King is invited by his childhood friend Natasha, back to the coastal village where they grew up. Natasha has even offered him the use of a house that she has recently acquired. Daniel readily accepts, bringing brushes and unenthusiastic fiancee Laura with him. The moment that the couple reach the house, Daniel races off to meet Natasha, leaving Laura to settle in on her own. There's something not quite right. The house is far colder than it should be, even for this time of year. Strange things start to happen, scaring Laura out of her wits. Daniel soon begins to share Laura's anxieties about the house and an old recurring dream comes back to haunt him. There is some terrible, near forgotten secret from the past tied up with Daniel, Natasha, the house and the sea. But when Daniel chances to hear an old local legend in the village pub, some nonsense about a demon living in the sea who preys on the guilty, the long submerged memories start falling into place. Monstrous events are about to occur at the house; the lives and souls of everyone involved are in danger, threatened by an ancient evil whose time has finally come.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

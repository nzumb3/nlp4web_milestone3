{"title":"Nixon","plot":"Director Oliver Stone's exploration of former president Richard Nixon's strict Quaker upbringing, his nascent political strivings in law school, and his strangely self-effacing courtship of his wife, Pat. The contradictions in his character are revealed early, in the vicious campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas and the oddly masochistic Checkers speech. His defeat at the hands of the hated and envied John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, followed by the loss of the 1962 California gubernatorial race, seem to signal the end of his career. Yet, although wholly lacking in charisma, Nixon remains a brilliant political operator, seizing the opportunity provided by the backlash against the antiwar movement to take the presidency in 1968. It is only when safely in office, running far ahead in the polls for the 1972 presidential election, that his growing paranoia comes to full flower, triggering the Watergate scandal.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["Director","Oliver","Stone","'s","explor","of","former","presid","Richard","Nixon","'s","strict","Quaker","upbring",",","his","nascent","polit","strive","in","law","school",",","and","his","strang","self-effac","courtship","of","his","wife",",","Pat",".","The","contradict","in","his","charact","are","reveal","earli",",","in","the","vicious","campaign","against","Helen","Gahagan","Dougla","and","the","odd","masochist","Checker","speech",".","His","defeat","at","the","hand","of","the","hate","and","envi","John","F.","Kennedi","in","the","1960","presidenti","elect",",","follow","by","the","loss","of","the","1962","California","gubernatori","race",",","seem","to","signal","the","end","of","his","career",".","Yet",",","although","wholli","lack","in","charisma",",","Nixon","remain","a","brilliant","polit","oper",",","seiz","the","opportun","provid","by","the","backlash","against","the","antiwar","movement","to","take","the","presid","in","1968",".","It","is","onli","when","safe","in","offic",",","run","far","ahead","in","the","poll","for","the","1972","presidenti","elect",",","that","his","grow","paranoia","come","to","full","flower",",","trigger","the","Waterg","scandal","."],"lemmas":["Director","Oliver","Stone","'s","exploration","of","former","president","Richard","Nixon","'s","strict","Quaker","upbringing",",","he","nascent","political","striving","in","law","school",",","and","he","strangely","self-effacing","courtship","of","he","wife",",","Pat",".","the","contradiction","in","he","character","be","reveal","early",",","in","the","vicious","campaign","against","Helen","Gahagan","Douglas","and","the","oddly","masochistic","Checkers","speech",".","he","defeat","at","the","hand","of","the","hate","and","envy","John","F.","Kennedy","in","the","1960","presidential","election",",","follow","by","the","loss","of","the","1962","California","gubernatorial","race",",","seem","to","signal","the","end","of","he","career",".","yet",",","although","wholly","lack","in","charisma",",","Nixon","remain","a","brilliant","political","operator",",","seize","the","opportunity","provide","by","the","backlash","against","the","antiwar","movement","to","take","the","presidency","in","1968",".","it","be","only","when","safely","in","office",",","run","far","ahead","in","the","poll","for","the","1972","presidential","election",",","that","he","grow","paranoia","come","to","full","flower",",","trigger","the","Watergate","scandal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Director Oliver Stone","Oliver Stone 's","Stone 's exploration","'s exploration of","exploration of former","of former president","former president Richard","president Richard Nixon","Richard Nixon 's","Nixon 's strict","'s strict Quaker","strict Quaker upbringing","Quaker upbringing ,","upbringing , his",", his nascent","his nascent political","nascent political strivings","political strivings in","strivings in law","in law school","law school ,","school , and",", and his","and his strangely","his strangely self-effacing","strangely self-effacing courtship","self-effacing courtship of","courtship of his","of his wife","his wife ,","wife , Pat","The contradictions in","contradictions in his","in his character","his character are","character are revealed","are revealed early","revealed early ,","early , in",", in the","in the vicious","the vicious campaign","vicious campaign against","campaign against Helen","against Helen Gahagan","Helen Gahagan Douglas","Gahagan Douglas and","Douglas and the","and the oddly","the oddly masochistic","oddly masochistic Checkers","masochistic Checkers speech","His defeat at","defeat at the","at the hands","the hands of","hands of the","of the hated","the hated and","hated and envied","and envied John","envied John F.","John F.

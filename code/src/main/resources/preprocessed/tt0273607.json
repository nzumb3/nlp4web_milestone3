{"title":"Festival in Cannes","plot":"Cannes, 1999. Alice, an actress, wants to direct an indie picture. Kaz, a talkative (and maybe bogus) deal maker, promises $3 million if she'll use Millie, an aging French star. But, Rick, a big producer, needs Millie for a small part in a fall movie or he loses his star, Tom Hanks. Is Kaz for real? Can Rick sweet-talk Alice and sabotage Kaz to keep Millie from taking that deal? Millie consults with Victor, her ex, about which picture to make, Rick needs money, an ingenue named Blue is discovered, Kaz hits on Victor's new love, and Rick's factotum connects with Blue. Knives go in various backs. Wheels spin. Which deals - and pairings - will be consummated?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Cann",",","1999",".","Alice",",","an","actress",",","want","to","direct","an","indi","pictur",".","Kaz",",","a","talkat","(","and","mayb","bogus",")","deal","maker",",","promis","$","3","million","if","she","ll","use","Milli",",","an","age","French","star",".","But",",","Rick",",","a","big","produc",",","need","Milli","for","a","small","part","in","a","fall","movi","or","he","lose","his","star",",","Tom","Hank",".","Is","Kaz","for","real","?","Can","Rick","sweet-talk","Alice","and","sabotag","Kaz","to","keep","Milli","from","take","that","deal","?","Milli","consult","with","Victor",",","her","ex",",","about","which","pictur","to","make",",","Rick","need","money",",","an","ingenu","name","Blue","is","discov",",","Kaz","hit","on","Victor","'s","new","love",",","and","Rick","'s","factotum","connect","with","Blue",".","Knive","go","in","various","back",".","Wheel","spin",".","Which","deal","-","and","pair","-","will","be","consumm","?"],"lemmas":["Cannes",",","1999",".","Alice",",","a","actress",",","want","to","direct","a","indie","picture",".","Kaz",",","a","talkative","-lrb-","and","maybe","bogus","-rrb-","deal","maker",",","promise","$","3","million","if","she","will","use","Millie",",","a","aging","french","star",".","but",",","Rick",",","a","big","producer",",","need","Millie","for","a","small","part","in","a","fall","movie","or","he","lose","he","star",",","Tom","Hanks",".","be","kaz","for","real","?","can","Rick","sweet-talk","Alice","and","sabotage","Kaz","to","keep","Millie","from","take","that","deal","?","Millie","consult","with","Victor",",","she","ex",",","about","which","picture","to","make",",","Rick","need","money",",","a","ingenue","name","Blue","be","discover",",","Kaz","hit","on","Victor","'s","new","love",",","and","Rick","'s","factotum","connect","with","Blue",".","knife","go","in","various","back",".","Wheels","spin",".","which","deal","-","and","pairing","-","will","be","consummate","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cannes , 1999","Alice , an",", an actress","an actress ,","actress , wants",", wants to","wants to direct","to direct an","direct an indie","an indie picture","Kaz , a",", a talkative","a talkative (","talkative ( and","( and maybe","and maybe bogus","maybe bogus )","bogus ) deal",") deal maker","deal maker ,","maker , promises",", promises $","promises $ 3","$ 3 million","3 million if","million if she","if she 'll","she 'll use","'ll use Millie","use Millie ,","Millie , an",", an aging","an aging French","aging French star","But , Rick",", Rick ,","Rick , a",", a big","a big producer","big producer ,","producer , needs",", needs Millie","needs Millie for","Millie for a","for a small","a small part","small part in","part in a","in a fall","a fall movie","fall movie or","movie or he","or he loses","he loses his","loses his star","his star ,","star , Tom",", Tom Hanks","Is Kaz for","Kaz for real","Can Rick sweet-talk","Rick sweet-talk Alice","sweet-talk Alice and","Alice and sabotage","and sabotage Kaz","sabotage Kaz to","Kaz to keep","to keep Millie","keep Millie from","Millie from taking","from taking that","taking that deal","Millie consults with","consults with Victor","with Victor ,","Victor , her",", her ex","her ex ,","ex , about",", about which","about which picture","which picture to","picture to make","to make ,","make , Rick",", Rick needs","Rick needs money","needs money ,","money , an",", an ingenue","an ingenue named","ingenue named Blue","named Blue is","Blue is discovered","is discovered ,","discovered , Kaz",", Kaz hits","Kaz hits on","hits on Victor","on Victor 's","Victor 's new","'s new love","new love ,","love , and",", and Rick","and Rick 's","Rick 's factotum","'s factotum connects","factotum connects with","connects with Blue","Knives go in","go in various","in various backs","Which deals -","deals -

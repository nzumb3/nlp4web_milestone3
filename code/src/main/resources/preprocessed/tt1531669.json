{"title":"Five Ways to Dario","plot":"Since more than ten years Dario lives between two different worlds, Germany and Ecuador. He decides to make an extraordinary journey, trying to find himself. The adventure into the unknown begins at the moment when he tries to find answers on the internet. Searching for his name he becomes aware that he is not the only Dario Aguirre, as he once thought, but that there are hundreds of people with the same name. Foreseeing that this perhaps could be a clue to finding his identity, Dario writes mails and letters to many of them, with the intention of learning more about their lives and visiting them. Five Dario Aguirres answer him and invite him to their homes, From now on, for all, a reconcilement begins: with their past lives, the present and the point of view of their wives.","genres":["Biography","

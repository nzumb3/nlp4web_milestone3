{"title":"Time Share","plot":"A residence on Balboa holiday island gets rented to two families, who meet while fighting for first spot on the ferry. Restaurant chef Matthew 'Matt' Farragher work long hours, but is such fun when at home that cheerful son Lewis and nagging daughter Daphne still love him to death. German genetics researcher Dr. Julia Weiland raised her sons from an American father, adolescent Thomas and preteen Max, well-behaved but boring. Her lab partner and fiancée Russel's true passion is GM vegetables. All the boys bond naturally, despite Julia's over-protective objections. Matt coaches Thomas on his love-life and Lewis teaches Max sailing. Bridging the gorge between the parents will take much more - what will some drama do for them all?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["A","resid","on","Balboa","holiday","island","get","rent","to","two","famili",",","who","meet","while","fight","for","first","spot","on","the","ferri",".","Restaur","chef","Matthew","'","Matt","'","Farragh","work","long","hour",",","but","is","such","fun","when","at","home","that","cheer","son","Lewi","and","nag","daughter","Daphn","still","love","him","to","death",".","German","genet","research","Dr.","Julia","Weiland","rais","her","son","from","an","American","father",",","adolesc","Thoma","and","preteen","Max",",","well-behav","but","bore",".","Her","lab","partner","and","fiancé","Russel","'s","true","passion","is","GM","veget",".","All","the","boy","bond","natur",",","despit","Julia","'s","over-protect","object",".","Matt","coach","Thoma","on","his","love-lif","and","Lewi","teach","Max","sail",".","Bridg","the","gorg","between","the","parent","will","take","much","more","-","what","will","some","drama","do","for","them","all","?"],"lemmas":["a","residence","on","Balboa","holiday","island","get","rent","to","two","family",",","who","meet","while","fight","for","first","spot","on","the","ferry",".","Restaurant","chef","Matthew","'","Matt","'","Farragher","work","long","hour",",","but","be","such","fun","when","at","home","that","cheerful","son","Lewis","and","nagging","daughter","Daphne","still","love","he","to","death",".","german","genetics","researcher","Dr.","Julia","Weiland","raise","she","son","from","a","american","father",",","adolescent","Thomas","and","preteen","max",",","well-behaved","but","boring",".","she","lab","partner","and","fiancée","Russel","'s","true","passion","be","GM","vegetable",".","all","the","boy","bond","naturally",",","despite","Julia","'s","over-protective","objection",".","Matt","coach","Thomas","on","he","love-life","and","Lewis","teach","Max","sailing",".","bridge","the","gorge","between","the","parent","will","take","much","more","-","what","will","some","drama","do","for","they","all","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A residence on","residence on Balboa","on Balboa holiday","Balboa holiday island","holiday island gets","island gets rented","gets rented to","rented to two","to two families","two families ,","families , who",", who meet","who meet while","meet while fighting","while fighting for","fighting for first","for first spot","first spot on","spot on the","on the ferry","Restaurant chef Matthew","chef Matthew '","Matthew ' Matt","' Matt '","Matt ' Farragher","' Farragher work","Farragher work long","work long hours","long hours ,","hours , but",", but is","but is such","is such fun","such fun when","fun when at","when at home","at home that","home that cheerful","that cheerful son","cheerful son Lewis","son Lewis and","Lewis and nagging","and nagging daughter","nagging daughter Daphne","daughter Daphne still","Daphne still love","still love him","love him to","him to death","German genetics researcher","genetics researcher Dr.","researcher Dr. Julia","Dr. Julia Weiland","Julia Weiland raised","Weiland raised her","raised her sons","her sons from","sons from an","from an American","an American father","American father ,","father , adolescent",", adolescent Thomas","adolescent Thomas and","Thomas and preteen","and preteen Max","preteen Max ,","Max , well-behaved",", well-behaved but","well-behaved but boring","Her lab partner","lab partner and","partner and fiancée","and fiancée Russel","fiancée Russel 's","Russel 's true","'s true passion","true passion is","passion is GM","is GM vegetables","All the boys","the boys bond","boys bond naturally","bond naturally ,","naturally , despite",", despite Julia","despite Julia 's","Julia 's over-protective","'s over-protective objections","Matt coaches Thomas","coaches Thomas on","Thomas on his","on his love-life","his love-life and","love-life and Lewis","and Lewis teaches","Lewis teaches Max","teaches Max sailing","Bridging the gorge","the gorge between","gorge between the","between the parents","the parents will","parents will take","will take much","take much more","much more -","more -

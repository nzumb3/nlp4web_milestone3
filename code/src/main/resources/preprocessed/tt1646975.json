{"title":"Le Quattro Volte","plot":"An old shepherd lives his last days in a quiet medieval village perched high on the hills of Calabria, at the southernmost tip of Italy. He herds goats under skies that most villagers have deserted long ago. He is sick, and believes to find his medicine in the dust he collects on the church floor, which he drinks in his water every day.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["An","old","shepherd","live","his","last","day","in","a","quiet","mediev","villag","perch","high","on","the","hill","of","Calabria",",","at","the","southernmost","tip","of","Itali",".","He","herd","goat","under","sky","that","most","villag","have","desert","long","ago",".","He","is","sick",",","and","believ","to","find","his","medicin","in","the","dust","he","collect","on","the","church","floor",",","which","he","drink","in","his","water","everi","day","."],"lemmas":["a","old","shepherd","live","he","last","day","in","a","quiet","medieval","village","perch","high","on","the","hill","of","Calabria",",","at","the","southernmost","tip","of","Italy",".","he","herd","goat","under","sky","that","most","villager","have","desert","long","ago",".","he","be","sick",",","and","believe","to","find","he","medicine","in","the","dust","he","collect","on","the","church","floor",",","which","he","drink","in","he","water","every","day","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An old shepherd","old shepherd lives","shepherd lives his","lives his last","his last days","last days in","days in a","in a quiet","a quiet medieval","quiet medieval village","medieval village perched","village perched high","perched high on","high on the","on the hills","the hills of","hills of Calabria","of Calabria ,","Calabria , at",", at the","at the southernmost","the southernmost tip","southernmost tip of","tip of Italy","He herds goats","herds goats under","goats under skies","under skies that","skies that most","that most villagers","most villagers have","villagers have deserted","have deserted long","deserted long ago","He is sick","is sick ,","sick , and",", and believes","and believes to","believes to find","to find his","find his medicine","his medicine in","medicine in the","in the dust","the dust he","dust he collects","he collects on","collects on the","on the church","the church floor","church floor ,","floor , which",", which he","which he drinks","he drinks in","drinks in his","in his water","his water every","water every day"],"2grams":["An old","old shepherd","shepherd lives","lives his","his last","last days","days in","in a","a quiet","quiet medieval","medieval village","village perched","perched high","high on","on the","the hills","hills of","of Calabria","Calabria ,",", at","at the","the southernmost","southernmost tip","tip of","of Italy","He herds","herds goats","goats under","under skies","skies that","that most","most villagers","villagers have","have deserted","deserted long","long ago","He is","is sick","sick ,",", and","and believes","believes to","to find","find his","his medicine","medicine in","in the","the dust","dust he","he collects","collects on","on the","the church","church floor","floor ,",", which","which he","he drinks","drinks in","in his","his water","water every","every day"]}

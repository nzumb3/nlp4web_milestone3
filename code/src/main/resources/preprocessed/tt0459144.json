{"title":"Moon Wolf","plot":"27-year-old Guy lives in an old bus in Ramat Hagolan, not far from the Moshav where he grew up. He raises a herd of cattle for beef together with his younger brother, Jerry. One night, after hunting a wolf that was threatening the cattle, Guy celebrates and ends up drunk. On a dark road he causes an accident and crashes into another car. The driver of the other car, his best friend Yoav, is now paralyzed from the neck down. Two years later Guy comes out of prison to find only Jerry waiting to welcome him. His mother, Rachel, a nurse, cannot bring herself to forgive him. Guy braces himself and goes to visit Yoav, who only has one request, that Guy kill him. Guy is at a loss; the only thing he knows is that he loves Yoav. Guy tries to rebuild his life, to work with the herd, but can't put the accident and Yoav's request out of his mind. Meanwhile, the herd is under attack from a pack of wolves that must be killed. But Guy is unable to reach a decision: should he kill the wolves, Yoav or himself?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["27-year-old","Guy","live","in","an","old","bus","in","Ramat","Hagolan",",","not","far","from","the","Moshav","where","he","grew","up",".","He","rais","a","herd","of","cattl","for","beef","togeth","with","his","younger","brother",",","Jerri",".","One","night",",","after","hunt","a","wolf","that","was","threaten","the","cattl",",","Guy","celebr","and","end","up","drunk",".","On","a","dark","road","he","caus","an","accid","and","crash","into","anoth","car",".","The","driver","of","the","other","car",",","his","best","friend","Yoav",",","is","now","paralyz","from","the","neck","down",".","Two","year","later","Guy","come","out","of","prison","to","find","onli","Jerri","wait","to","welcom","him",".","His","mother",",","Rachel",",","a","nurs",",","can","not","bring","herself","to","forgiv","him",".","Guy","brace","himself","and","goe","to","visit","Yoav",",","who","onli","has","one","request",",","that","Guy","kill","him",".","Guy","is","at","a","loss",";","the","onli","thing","he","know","is","that","he","love","Yoav",".","Guy","tri","to","rebuild","his","life",",","to","work","with","the","herd",",","but","ca","n't","put","the","accid","and","Yoav","'s","request","out","of","his","mind",".","Meanwhil",",","the","herd","is","under","attack","from","a","pack","of","wolv","that","must","be","kill",".","But","Guy","is","unabl","to","reach","a","decis",":","should","he","kill","the","wolv",",","Yoav","or","himself","?"],"lemmas":["27-year-old","Guy","live","in","a","old","bus","in","Ramat","Hagolan",",","not","far","from","the","Moshav","where","he","grow","up",".","he","raise","a","herd","of","cattle","for","beef","together","with","he","younger","brother",",","Jerry",".","one","night",",","after","hunting","a","wolf","that","be","threaten","the","cattle",",","Guy","celebrate","and","end","up","drunk",".","on","a","dark","road","he","cause","a","accident","and","crash","into","another","car",".","the","driver","of","the","other","car",",","he","best","friend","Yoav",",","be","now","paralyze","from","the","neck","down",".","two","year","later","Guy","come","out","of","prison","to","find","only","Jerry","wait","to","welcome","he",".","he","mother",",","Rachel",",","a","nurse",",","can","not","bring","herself","to","forgive","he",".","Guy","brace","himself","and","go","to","visit","Yoav",",","who","only","have","one","request",",","that","Guy","kill","he",".","Guy","be","at","a","loss",";","the","only","thing","he","know","be","that","he","love","Yoav",".","Guy","try","to","rebuild","he","life",",","to","work","with","the","herd",",","but","can","not","put","the","accident","and","Yoav","'s","request","out","of","he","mind",".","meanwhile",",","the","herd","be","under","attack","from","a","pack","of","wolf","that","must","be","kill",".","but","Guy","be","unable","to","reach","a","decision",":","should","he","kill","the","wolf",",","Yoav","or","himself","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["27-year-old

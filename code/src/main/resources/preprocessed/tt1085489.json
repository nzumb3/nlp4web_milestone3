{"title":"Pied-de-biche","plot":"We hear a lot about male violence. But what about female violence? There's no question it exists, but because it generally takes the form of verbal or psychological abuse it leaves no physical evidence, and is usually unreported by the media, which tends to depict women as victims. Violence by women is perpetrated against men who don't report it and against children who don't speak out, and is neither harmless nor trivial. Through interviews with violent women and their male victims, Pied-de-Biche explores the flip side of conjugal violence.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["We","hear","a","lot","about","male","violenc",".","But","what","about","femal","violenc","?","There","'s","no","question","it","exist",",","but","becaus","it","general","take","the","form","of","verbal","or","psycholog","abus","it","leav","no","physic","evid",",","and","is","usual","unreport","by","the","media",",","which","tend","to","depict","women","as","victim",".","Violenc","by","women","is","perpetr","against","men","who","do","n't","report","it","and","against","children","who","do","n't","speak","out",",","and","is","neither","harmless","nor","trivial",".","Through","interview","with","violent","women","and","their","male","victim",",","Pied-de-Bich","explor","the","flip","side","of","conjug","violenc","."],"lemmas":["we","hear","a","lot","about","male","violence",".","but","what","about","female","violence","?","there","be","no","question","it","exist",",","but","because","it","generally","take","the","form","of","verbal","or","psychological","abuse","it","leave","no","physical","evidence",",","and","be","usually","unreported","by","the","media",",","which","tend","to","depict","woman","as","victim",".","violence","by","woman","be","perpetrate","against","man","who","do","not","report","it","and","against","child","who","do","not","speak","out",",","and","be","neither","harmless","nor","trivial",".","through","interview","with","violent","woman","and","they","male","victim",",","Pied-de-Biche","explore","the","flip","side","of","conjugal","violence","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["We hear a","hear a lot","a lot about","lot about male","about male violence","But what about","what about female","about female violence","There 's no","'s no question","no question it","question it exists","it exists ,","exists , but",", but because","but because it","because it generally","it generally takes","generally takes the","takes the form","the form of","form of verbal","of verbal or","verbal or psychological","or psychological abuse","psychological abuse it","abuse it leaves","it leaves no","leaves no physical","no physical evidence","physical evidence ,","evidence , and",", and is","and is usually","is usually unreported","usually unreported by","unreported by the","by the media","the media ,","media , which",", which tends","which tends to","tends to depict","to depict women","depict women as","women as victims","Violence by women","by women is","women is perpetrated","is perpetrated against","perpetrated against men","against men who","men who do","who do n't","do n't report","n't report it","report it and","it and against","and against children","against children who","children who do","who do n't","do n't speak","n't speak out","speak out ,","out , and",", and is","and is neither","is neither harmless","neither harmless nor","harmless nor trivial","Through interviews with","interviews with violent","with violent women","violent women and","women and their","and their male","their male victims","male victims ,","victims , Pied-de-Biche",", Pied-de-Biche explores","Pied-de-Biche explores the","explores the flip","the flip side","flip side of","side of conjugal","of conjugal violence"],"2grams":["We hear","hear a","a lot","lot about","about male","male violence","But what","what about","about female","female violence","There 's","'s no","no question","question it","it exists","exists ,",", but","but because","because it","it generally","generally takes","takes the","the form","form of","of verbal","verbal or","or psychological","psychological abuse","abuse it","it leaves","leaves no","no physical","physical evidence","evidence ,",", and","and is","is usually","usually unreported","unreported by","by the","the media","media ,",", which","which tends","tends to","to depict","depict women","women as","as victims","Violence by","by women","women is","is perpetrated","perpetrated against","against men","men who","who do","do n't","n't report","report it","it and","and against","against children","children who","who do","do n't","n't speak","speak out","out ,",", and","and is","is neither","neither harmless","harmless nor","nor trivial","Through interviews","interviews with","with violent","violent women","women and","and their","their male","male victims","victims ,",", Pied-de-Biche","Pied-de-Biche explores","explores the","the flip","flip side","side of","of conjugal","conjugal violence"]}

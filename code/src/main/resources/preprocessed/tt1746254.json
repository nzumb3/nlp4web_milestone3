{"title":"The Road to Nasiriyah","plot":"The Road to Nasiriyah is the extraordinary journey of two American filmmakers to document the unprecedented looting of archaeological sites following the 2003 Iraq war. The film is a poetic meditation on postwar Iraq and an intellectual thriller that ends in a dramatic kidnapping. The journey includes characters whose stories become intertwined - an Iraqi archaeologist who risks his life to protect sites, our interpreter who quotes Hegel and Shakespeare, and a man who plays both sides for profit; protector and looter. This is a story about the chaos of war and the loss of values. It's a cautionary tale about a dark time when the beginnings of recorded human history, buried in the sands of southern Iraq, were destroyed.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Road","to","Nasiriyah","is","the","extraordinari","journey","of","two","American","filmmak","to","document","the","unpreced","loot","of","archaeolog","site","follow","the","2003","Iraq","war",".","The","film","is","a","poetic","medit","on","postwar","Iraq","and","an","intellectu","thriller","that","end","in","a","dramat","kidnap",".","The","journey","includ","charact","whose","stori","becom","intertwin","-","an","Iraqi","archaeologist","who","risk","his","life","to","protect","site",",","our","interpret","who","quot","Hegel","and","Shakespear",",","and","a","man","who","play","both","side","for","profit",";","protector","and","looter",".","This","is","a","stori","about","the","chao","of","war","and","the","loss","of","valu",".","It","'s","a","cautionari","tale","about","a","dark","time","when","the","begin","of","record","human","histori",",","buri","in","the","sand","of","southern","Iraq",",","were","destroy","."],"lemmas":["the","Road","to","Nasiriyah","be","the","extraordinary","journey","of","two","american","filmmaker","to","document","the","unprecedented","looting","of","archaeological","site","follow","the","2003","Iraq","war",".","the","film","be","a","poetic","meditation","on","postwar","Iraq","and","a","intellectual","thriller","that","end","in","a","dramatic","kidnapping",".","the","journey","include","character","whose","story","become","intertwine","-","a","iraqi","archaeologist","who","risk","he","life","to","protect","site",",","we","interpreter","who","quote","Hegel","and","Shakespeare",",","and","a","man","who","play","both","side","for","profit",";","protector","and","looter",".","this","be","a","story","about","the","chaos","of","war","and","the","loss","of","value",".","it","be","a","cautionary","tale","about","a","dark","time","when","the","beginning","of","recorded","human","history",",","bury","in","the","sand","of","southern","Iraq",",","be","destroy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Road to","Road to Nasiriyah","to Nasiriyah is","Nasiriyah is the","is the extraordinary","the extraordinary journey","extraordinary journey of","journey of two","of two American","two American filmmakers","American filmmakers to","filmmakers to document","to document the","document the unprecedented","the unprecedented looting","unprecedented looting of","looting of archaeological","of archaeological sites","archaeological sites following","sites following the","following the 2003","the 2003 Iraq","2003 Iraq war","The film is","film is a","is a poetic","a poetic meditation","poetic meditation on","meditation on postwar","on postwar Iraq","postwar Iraq and","Iraq and an","and an intellectual","an intellectual thriller","intellectual thriller that","thriller that ends","that ends in","ends in a","in a dramatic","a dramatic kidnapping","The journey includes","journey includes characters","includes characters whose","characters whose stories","whose stories become","stories become intertwined","become intertwined -","intertwined - an","- an Iraqi","an Iraqi archaeologist","Iraqi archaeologist who","archaeologist who risks","who risks his","risks his life","his life to","life to protect","to protect sites","protect sites ,","sites , our",", our interpreter","our interpreter who","interpreter who quotes","who quotes Hegel","quotes Hegel and","Hegel and Shakespeare","and Shakespeare ,","Shakespeare , and",", and a","and a man","a man who","man who plays","who plays both","plays both sides","both sides for","sides for profit","for profit ;","profit ;

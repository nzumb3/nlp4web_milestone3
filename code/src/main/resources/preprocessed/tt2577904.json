{"title":"Nami no oto","plot":"March 11th, 2011, a huge earthquake followed by a giant tsunami strikes the coastal regions of Tohoku in Japan. Starting in the district of Taro, where an old lady and her sister reflect on their fear of the deadly wave that has already struck before in 1896 and 1933, the two directors drive south along the coast. Listening to the inhabitants, they wonder why people continue to live in these dangerous regions, knowing that disaster can hit without warning.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["March","11th",",","2011",",","a","huge","earthquak","follow","by","a","giant","tsunami","strike","the","coastal","region","of","Tohoku","in","Japan",".","Start","in","the","district","of","Taro",",","where","an","old","ladi","and","her","sister","reflect","on","their","fear","of","the","dead","wave","that","has","alreadi","struck","befor","in","1896","and","1933",",","the","two","director","drive","south","along","the","coast",".","Listen","to","the","inhabit",",","they","wonder","whi","peopl","continu","to","live","in","these","danger","region",",","know","that","disast","can","hit","without","warn","."],"lemmas":["March","11th",",","2011",",","a","huge","earthquake","follow","by","a","giant","tsunami","strike","the","coastal","region","of","Tohoku","in","Japan",".","start","in","the","district","of","Taro",",","where","a","old","lady","and","she","sister","reflect","on","they","fear","of","the","deadly","wave","that","have","already","strike","before","in","1896","and","1933",",","the","two","director","drive","south","along","the","coast",".","listen","to","the","inhabitant",",","they","wonder","why","people","continue","to","live","in","these","dangerous","region",",","know","that","disaster","can","hit","without","warning","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["March 11th ,","11th , 2011",", 2011 ,","2011 , a",", a huge","a huge earthquake","huge earthquake followed","earthquake followed by","followed by a","by a giant","a giant tsunami","giant tsunami strikes","tsunami strikes the","strikes the coastal","the coastal regions","coastal regions of","regions of Tohoku","of Tohoku in","Tohoku in Japan","Starting in the","in the district","the district of","district of Taro","of Taro ,","Taro , where",", where an","where an old","an old lady","old lady and","lady and her","and her sister","her sister reflect","sister reflect on","reflect on their","on their fear","their fear of","fear of the","of the deadly","the deadly wave","deadly wave that","wave that has","that has already","has already struck","already struck before","struck before in","before in 1896","in 1896 and","1896 and 1933","and 1933 ,","1933 , the",", the two","the two directors","two directors drive","directors drive south","drive south along","south along the","along the coast","Listening to the","to the inhabitants","the inhabitants ,","inhabitants , they",", they wonder","they wonder why","wonder why people","why people continue","people continue to","continue to live","to live in","live in these","in these dangerous","these dangerous regions","dangerous regions ,","regions , knowing",", knowing that","knowing that disaster","that disaster can","disaster can hit","can hit without","hit without warning"],"2grams":["March 11th","11th ,",", 2011","2011 ,",", a","a huge","huge earthquake","earthquake followed","followed by","by a","a giant","giant tsunami","tsunami strikes","strikes the","the coastal","coastal regions","regions of","of Tohoku","Tohoku in","in Japan","Starting in","in the","the district","district of","of Taro","Taro ,",", where","where an","an old","old lady","lady and","and her","her sister","sister reflect","reflect on","on their","their fear","fear of","of the","the deadly","deadly wave","wave that","that has","has already","already struck","struck before","before in","in 1896","1896 and","and 1933","1933 ,",", the","the two","two directors","directors drive","drive south","south along","along the","the coast","Listening to","to the","the inhabitants","inhabitants ,",", they","they wonder","wonder why","why people","people continue","continue to","to live","live in","in these","these dangerous","dangerous regions","regions ,",", knowing","knowing that","that disaster","disaster can","can hit","hit without","without warning"]}

{"title":"Aaron Cohen's Debt","plot":"A cheerful birthday party is interrupted by the arrival of the police. They've come for the honoree himself, Aaron Cohen. Bewildered and annoyed, Aaron is informed that he owes child support. Although, to the best of his knowledge such debt doesn't exist, the police march him off to the local jail. Despite his frail health and his daughter's frantic attempts to bail him out, Aaron is forced to spend the night behind bars. Indifferent guards, an over-crowded cell and an infected ulcer thrust Aaron into a Kafkaesque nightmare. The following morning a hurried investigation struggles to make sense out of Aaron's encounter with fate. Past, present and future blend with illusion in the intricate story of this award-winning drama.","genres":["Crime","

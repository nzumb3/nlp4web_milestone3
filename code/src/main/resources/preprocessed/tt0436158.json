{"title":"Carpool Guy","plot":"Joel Goodman is a hotshot advertising executive angling for a promotion, but he feels stuck - not least of all in traffic. A seeming answer to his prayers comes in the form of a homeless man whom Joel pays to sit in his passenger seat so he can use the carpool lane. The two form an unexpected bond, and Joel comes to realize that sometimes changing lanes can change your life.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Joel","Goodman","is","a","hotshot","advertis","execut","angl","for","a","promot",",","but","he","feel","stuck","-","not","least","of","all","in","traffic",".","A","seem","answer","to","his","prayer","come","in","the","form","of","a","homeless","man","whom","Joel","pay","to","sit","in","his","passeng","seat","so","he","can","use","the","carpool","lane",".","The","two","form","an","unexpect","bond",",","and","Joel","come","to","realiz","that","sometim","chang","lane","can","chang","your","life","."],"lemmas":["Joel","Goodman","be","a","hotshot","advertising","executive","angle","for","a","promotion",",","but","he","feel","stick","-","not","least","of","all","in","traffic",".","a","seeming","answer","to","he","prayer","come","in","the","form","of","a","homeless","man","whom","Joel","pay","to","sit","in","he","passenger","seat","so","he","can","use","the","carpool","lane",".","the","two","form","a","unexpected","bond",",","and","Joel","come","to","realize","that","sometimes","change","lane","can","change","you","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Joel Goodman is","Goodman is a","is a hotshot","a hotshot advertising","hotshot advertising executive","advertising executive angling","executive angling for","angling for a","for a promotion","a promotion ,","promotion , but",", but he","but he feels","he feels stuck","feels stuck -","stuck - not","- not least","not least of","least of all","of all in","all in traffic","A seeming answer","seeming answer to","answer to his","to his prayers","his prayers comes","prayers comes in","comes in the","in the form","the form of","form of a","of a homeless","a homeless man","homeless man whom","man whom Joel","whom Joel pays","Joel pays to","pays to sit","to sit in","sit in his","in his passenger","his passenger seat","passenger seat so","seat so he","so he can","he can use","can use the","use the carpool","the carpool lane","The two form","two form an","form an unexpected","an unexpected bond","unexpected bond ,","bond , and",", and Joel","and Joel comes","Joel comes to","comes to realize","to realize that","realize that sometimes","that sometimes changing","sometimes changing lanes","changing lanes can","lanes can change","can change your","change your life"],"2grams":["Joel Goodman","Goodman is","is a","a hotshot","hotshot advertising","advertising executive","executive angling","angling for","for a","a promotion","promotion ,",", but","but he","he feels","feels stuck","stuck -","- not","not least","least of","of all","all in","in traffic","A seeming","seeming answer","answer to","to his","his prayers","prayers comes","comes in","in the","the form","form of","of a","a homeless","homeless man","man whom","whom Joel","Joel pays","pays to","to sit","sit in","in his","his passenger","passenger seat","seat so","so he","he can","can use","use the","the carpool","carpool lane","The two","two form","form an","an unexpected","unexpected bond","bond ,",", and","and Joel","Joel comes","comes to","to realize","realize that","that sometimes","sometimes changing","changing lanes","lanes can","can change","change your","your life"]}

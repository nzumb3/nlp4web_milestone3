Finally, there's Juvencio, an old retired teacher whose major concern is his quadriplegic daughter, whose future without his or his wife Anita's assistance is a great worry to him. The paths of all these three characters become increasingly entangled.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["\"","El","Jairo","\"",",","a","young","schizophren",",","believ","in","extraterrestri","be","and","feel","that","he","should","battl","against","them",".","Claudia","is","an","overweight","woman","who","has","a","strong","weak","for","pornographi",",","a","fact","that","lead","her","into","a","number","of","conflict",".","Final",",","there","'s","Juvencio",",","an","old","retir","teacher","whose","major","concern","is","his","quadripleg","daughter",",","whose","futur","without","his","or","his","wife","Anita","'s","assist","is","a","great","worri","to","him",".","The","path","of","all","these","three","charact","becom","increas","entangl","."],"lemmas":["``","El","Jairo","''",",","a","young","schizophrenic",",","believe","in","extraterrestrial","being","and","feel","that","he","should","battle","against","they",".","Claudia","be","a","overweight","woman","who","have","a","strong","weakness","for","pornography",",","a","fact","that","lead","she","into","a","number","of","conflict",".","finally",",","there","be","Juvencio",",","a","old","retired","teacher","whose","major","concern","be","he","quadriplegic","daughter",",","whose","future","without","he","or","he","wife","Anita","'s","assistance","be","a","great","worry","to","he",".","the","path","of","all","these","three","character","become","increasingly","entangled","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" El Jairo","El Jairo \"","Jairo \" ,","\" , a",", a young","a young schizophrenic","young schizophrenic ,","schizophrenic , believes",", believes in","believes in extraterrestrial","in extraterrestrial beings","extraterrestrial beings and","beings and feels","and feels that","feels that he","that he should","he should battle","should battle against","battle against them","Claudia is an","is an overweight","an overweight woman","overweight woman who","woman who has","who has a","has a strong","a strong weakness","strong weakness for","weakness for pornography","for pornography ,","pornography , a",", a fact","a fact that","fact that leads","that leads her","leads her into","her into a","into a number","a number of","number of conflicts","Finally , there",", there 's","there 's Juvencio","'s Juvencio ,","Juvencio , an",", an old","an old retired","old retired teacher","retired teacher whose","teacher whose major","whose major concern","major concern is","concern is his","is his quadriplegic","his quadriplegic daughter","quadriplegic daughter ,","daughter , whose",", whose future","whose future without","future without his","without his or","his or his","or his wife","his wife Anita","wife Anita 's","Anita 's assistance","'s assistance is","assistance is a","is a great","a great worry","great worry to","worry to him","The paths of","paths of all","of all these","all these three","these three characters","three characters become","characters become increasingly","become increasingly entangled"],"2grams":["\" El","El Jairo","Jairo \"","\" ,",", a","a young","young schizophrenic","schizophrenic ,",", believes","believes in","in extraterrestrial","extraterrestrial beings","beings and","and feels","feels that","that he","he should","should battle","battle against","against them","Claudia is","is an","an overweight","overweight woman","woman who","who has","has a","a strong","strong weakness","weakness for","for pornography","pornography ,",", a","a fact","fact that","that leads","leads her","her into","into a","a number","number of","of conflicts","Finally ,",", there","there 's","'s Juvencio","Juvencio ,",", an","an old","old retired","retired teacher","teacher whose","whose major","major concern","concern is","is his","his quadriplegic","quadriplegic daughter","daughter ,",", whose","whose future","future without","without his","his or","or his","his wife","wife Anita","Anita 's","'s assistance","assistance is","is a","a great","great worry","worry to","to him","The paths","paths of","of all","all these","these three","three characters","characters become","become increasingly","increasingly entangled"]}

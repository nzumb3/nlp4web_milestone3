{"title":"When America Was Russian","plot":"Discover the magical history and treasures of Russia's California coast. Hang on a moment! Isn't California part of the United States? Finding the answer to this seemingly paradoxical question is a good reason to dive into the true and intriguing story of an explorer, a dream, a trading company, and a time when indeed 'America was Russian'. From relations with and impact on the native people, to the political infighting in the capital of Russia that really fueled the 'Alaska Purchase, this documentary is an interesting look at an important part of the two countries' shared history.","genres":["Biography"," History","

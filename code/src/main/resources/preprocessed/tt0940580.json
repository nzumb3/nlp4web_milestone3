{"title":"Afterwards","plot":"Nathan, a brilliant New York lawyer who leads a life of professional success, but his private life is pretty dismal since he divorced Claire, his only love. Until he meets Doctor Kay, a mysterious doctor who introduces himself as a \"Messenger.\" He claims that he can sense when certain people are about to die, and that he is sent to help them put their life in order before it's too late. Nathan doesn't believe a word of this, but soon afterwards he witnesses some disconcerting scenes which seem to confirm the doctor's claims.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Nathan",",","a","brilliant","New","York","lawyer","who","lead","a","life","of","profession","success",",","but","his","privat","life","is","pretti","dismal","sinc","he","divorc","Clair",",","his","onli","love",".","Until","he","meet","Doctor","Kay",",","a","mysteri","doctor","who","introduc","himself","as","a","\"","Messeng",".","\"","He","claim","that","he","can","sens","when","certain","peopl","are","about","to","die",",","and","that","he","is","sent","to","help","them","put","their","life","in","order","befor","it","'s","too","late",".","Nathan","doe","n't","believ","a","word","of","this",",","but","soon","afterward","he","wit","some","disconcert","scene","which","seem","to","confirm","the","doctor","'s","claim","."],"lemmas":["Nathan",",","a","brilliant","New","York","lawyer","who","lead","a","life","of","professional","success",",","but","he","private","life","be","pretty","dismal","since","he","divorce","Claire",",","he","only","love",".","until","he","meet","Doctor","Kay",",","a","mysterious","doctor","who","introduce","himself","as","a","``","messenger",".","''","he","claim","that","he","can","sense","when","certain","people","be","about","to","die",",","and","that","he","be","send","to","help","they","put","they","life","in","order","before","it","be","too","late",".","Nathan","do","not","believe","a","word","of","this",",","but","soon","afterwards","he","witness","some","disconcerting","scene","which","seem","to","confirm","the","doctor","'s","claim","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nathan , a",", a brilliant","a brilliant New","brilliant New York","New York lawyer","York lawyer who","lawyer who leads","who leads a","leads a life","a life of","life of professional","of professional success","professional success ,","success , but",", but his","but his private","his private life","private life is","life is pretty","is pretty dismal","pretty dismal since","dismal since he","since he divorced","he divorced Claire","divorced Claire ,","Claire , his",", his only","his only love","Until he meets","he meets Doctor","meets Doctor Kay","Doctor Kay ,","Kay , a",", a mysterious","a mysterious doctor","mysterious doctor who","doctor who introduces","who introduces himself","introduces himself as","himself as a","as a \"","a \" Messenger","\" Messenger .","Messenger . \"","He claims that","claims that he","that he can","he can sense","can sense when","sense when certain","when certain people","certain people are","people are about","are about to","about to die","to die ,","die , and",", and that","and that he","that he is","he is sent","is sent to","sent to help","to help them","help them put","them put their","put their life","their life in","life in order","in order before","order before it","before it 's","it 's too","'s too late","Nathan does n't","does n't believe","n't believe a","believe a word","a word of","word of this","of this ,","this , but",", but soon","but soon afterwards","soon afterwards he","afterwards he witnesses","he witnesses some","witnesses some disconcerting","some disconcerting scenes","disconcerting scenes which","scenes which seem","which seem to","seem to confirm","to confirm the","confirm the doctor","the doctor 's","doctor 's claims"],"2grams":["Nathan ,",", a","a brilliant","brilliant New","New York","York lawyer","lawyer who","who leads","leads a","a life","life of","of professional","professional success","success ,",", but","but his","his private","private life","life is","is pretty","pretty dismal","dismal since","since he","he divorced","divorced Claire","Claire ,",", his","his only","only love","Until he","he meets","meets Doctor","Doctor Kay","Kay ,",", a","a mysterious","mysterious doctor","doctor who","who introduces","introduces himself","himself as","as a","a \"","\" Messenger","Messenger .",". \"","He claims","claims that","that he","he can","can sense","sense when","when certain","certain people","people are","are about","about to","to die","die ,",", and","and that","that he","he is","is sent","sent to","to help","help them","them put","put their","their life","life in","in order","order before","before it","it 's","'s too","too late","Nathan does","does n't","n't believe","believe a","a word","word of","of this","this ,",", but","but soon","soon afterwards","afterwards he","he witnesses","witnesses some","some disconcerting","disconcerting scenes","scenes which","which seem","seem to","to confirm","confirm the","the doctor","doctor 's","'s claims"]}

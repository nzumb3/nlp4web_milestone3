{"title":"Merica","plot":"25 million Brazilians are of Italian origin. Almost all of them are the descendants of the Italians who left poor rural Italy at the end of the 1800's for a continent which promised riches and a better life. After only a century however, the direction of migration has been completely reversed. Italy, a century ago the place to escape from, has in time taken its place in the first world, the longed for final destination of immigrants throughout the world. The only thing which does not seem to change is the plight of those forced to migrate.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["25","million","Brazilian","are","of","Italian","origin",".","Almost","all","of","them","are","the","descend","of","the","Italian","who","left","poor","rural","Itali","at","the","end","of","the","1800","'s","for","a","contin","which","promis","rich","and","a","better","life",".","After","onli","a","centuri","howev",",","the","direct","of","migrat","has","been","complet","revers",".","Itali",",","a","centuri","ago","the","place","to","escap","from",",","has","in","time","taken","it","place","in","the","first","world",",","the","long","for","final","destin","of","immigr","throughout","the","world",".","The","onli","thing","which","doe","not","seem","to","chang","is","the","plight","of","those","forc","to","migrat","."],"lemmas":["25","million","brazilian","be","of","italian","origin",".","almost","all","of","they","be","the","descendant","of","the","Italians","who","leave","poor","rural","Italy","at","the","end","of","the","1800","'s","for","a","continent","which","promise","riches","and","a","better","life",".","after","only","a","century","however",",","the","direction","of","migration","have","be","completely","reverse",".","Italy",",","a","century","ago","the","place","to","escape","from",",","have","in","time","take","its","place","in","the","first","world",",","the","longed","for","final","destination","of","immigrant","throughout","the","world",".","the","only","thing","which","do","not","seem","to","change","be","the","plight","of","those","force","to","migrate","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["25 million Brazilians","million Brazilians are","Brazilians are of","are of Italian","of Italian origin","Almost all of","all of them","of them are","them are the","are the descendants","the descendants of","descendants of the","of the Italians","the Italians who","Italians who left","who left poor","left poor rural","poor rural Italy","rural Italy at","Italy at the","at the end","the end of","end of the","of the 1800","the 1800 's","1800 's for","'s for a","for a continent","a continent which","continent which promised","which promised riches","promised riches and","riches and a","and a better","a better life","After only a","only a century","a century however","century however ,","however , the",", the direction","the direction of","direction of migration","of migration has","migration has been","has been completely","been completely reversed","Italy , a",", a century","a century ago","century ago the","ago the place","the place to","place to escape","to escape from","escape from ,","from , has",", has in","has in time","in time taken","time taken its","taken its place","its place in","place in the","in the first","the first world","first world ,","world , the",", the longed","the longed for","longed for final","for final destination","final destination of","destination of immigrants","of immigrants throughout","immigrants throughout the","throughout the world","The only thing","only thing which","thing which does","which does not","does not seem","not seem to","seem to change","to change is","change is the","is the plight","the plight of","plight of those","of those forced","those forced to","forced to migrate"],"2grams":["25 million","million Brazilians","Brazilians are","are of","of Italian","Italian origin","Almost all","all of","of them","them are","are the","the descendants","descendants of","of the","the Italians","Italians who","who left","left poor","poor rural","rural Italy","Italy at","at the","the end","end of","of the","the 1800","1800 's","'s for","for a","a continent","continent which","which promised","promised riches","riches and","and a","a better","better life","After only","only a","a century","century however","however ,",", the","the direction","direction of","of migration","migration has","has been","been completely","completely reversed","Italy ,",", a","a century","century ago","ago the","the place","place to","to escape","escape from","from ,",", has","has in","in time","time taken","taken its","its place","place in","in the","the first","first world","world ,",", the","the longed","longed for","for final","final destination","destination of","of immigrants","immigrants throughout","throughout the","the world","The only","only thing","thing which","which does","does not","not seem","seem to","to change","change is","is the","the plight","plight of","of those","those forced","forced to","to migrate"]}

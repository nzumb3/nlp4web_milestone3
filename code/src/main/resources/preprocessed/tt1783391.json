{"title":"The Mountain","plot":"Night falls over Beirut. Fadi, a forty year old, packs his luggage and sets out to the airport with his friend driving him. He is supposed to leave for a month, but instead of going up the plane, he heads to the arrivals section and rents a car. He takes the highway heading North then continues on a mountainous route. Far from anyone, on a deserted highway, a deviation forces him to quit the main road. A distinct sound coming from far is heard; the sound of a car honk. Fadi gets closer and closer to the sound and sees a wrecked car crashed in a tree alongside the road. A couple lay still inside. Fadi moves the head of the young man that was resting on the horn and the sound faints away. He watches their bloody faces, hears a hiss coming from the motor and then sees it catch fire. Instinctively, he steps back. Flames eat the car up as Fadi watches in horror. After a while, having continued on his way, he pulls over to the side of the road and sleeps off what he experienced earlier. The next morning, he drives to a hotel in the middle of nowhere where he is expected. He is given a room at the highest level. The food, towels and sheets are waiting for him in the hall. Not a soul will bother him. Fadi will isolate himself in that hotel, literally locking himself in his own room.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Night","fall","over","Beirut",".","Fadi",",","a","forti","year","old",",","pack","his","luggag","and","set","out","to","the","airport","with","his","friend","drive","him",".","He","is","suppos","to","leav","for","a","month",",","but","instead","of","go","up","the","plane",",","he","head","to","the","arriv","section","and","rent","a","car",".","He","take","the","highway","head","North","then","continu","on","a","mountain","rout",".","Far","from","anyon",",","on","a","desert","highway",",","a","deviat","forc","him","to","quit","the","main","road",".","A","distinct","sound","come","from","far","is","heard",";","the","sound","of","a","car","honk",".","Fadi","get","closer","and","closer","to","the","sound","and","see","a","wreck","car","crash","in","a","tree","alongsid","the","road",".","A","coupl","lay","still","insid",".","Fadi","move","the","head","of","the","young","man","that","was","rest","on","the","horn","and","the","sound","faint","away",".","He","watch","their","bloodi","face",",","hear","a","hiss","come","from","the","motor","and","then","see","it","catch","fire",".","Instinctiv",",","he","step","back",".","Flame","eat","the","car","up","as","Fadi","watch","in","horror",".","After","a","while",",","have","continu","on","his","way",",","he","pull","over","to","the","side","of","the","road","and","sleep","off","what","he","experienc","earlier",".","The","next","morn",",","he","drive","to","a","hotel","in","the","middl","of","nowher","where","he","is","expect",".","He","is","given","a","room","at","the","highest","level",".","The","food",",","towel","and","sheet","are","wait","for","him","in","the","hall",".","Not","a","soul","will","bother","him",".","Fadi","will","isol","himself","in","that","hotel",",","liter","lock","himself","in","his","own","room","."],"lemmas":["Night","fall","over","Beirut",".","Fadi",",","a","forty","year","old",",","pack","he","luggage","and","set","out","to","the","airport","with","he","friend","drive","he",".","he","be","suppose","to","leave","for","a","month",",","but","instead","of","go","up","the","plane",",","he","head","to","the","arrival","section","and","rent","a","car",".","he","take","the","highway","head","North","then","continue","on","a","mountainous","route",".","far","from","anyone",",","on","a","desert","highway",",","a","deviation","force","he","to","quit","the","main","road",".","a","distinct","sound","come","from","far","be","hear",";","the","sound","of","a","car","honk",".","Fadi","get","closer","and","closer","to","the","sound","and","see","a","wreck","car","crash","in","a","tree","alongside","the","road",".","a","couple","lay","still","inside",".","Fadi","move","the","head","of","the","young","man","that","be","rest","on","the","horn","and","the","sound","faint","away",".","he","watch","they","bloody","face",",","hear","a","hiss","come","from","the","motor","and","then","see","it","catch","fire",".","instinctively",",","he","step","back",".","flame","eat","the","car","up","as","Fadi","watch","in","horror",".","after","a","while",",","have","continue","on","he","way",",","he","pull","over","to","the","side","of","the","road","and","sleep","off","what","he","experience","earlier",".","the","next","morning",",","he","drive","to","a","hotel","in","the","middle","of","nowhere","where","he","be","expect",".","he","be","give","a","room","at","the","highest","level",".","the","food",",","towel","and","sheet","be","wait","for","he","in","the","hall",".","not","a","soul","will","bother","he",".","Fadi","will","isolate","himself","in","that","hotel",",","literally","lock","himself","in","he","own","room","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Night

{"title":"Psychology and the New Heroism: Philip Zimbardo and Dan Ellsberg in Conversation","plot":"These two icons of progressive thought in America met for the first time to discuss a salient issue for our times: Why are some people known as whistle blowers willing to take courageous nonviolent action in defense of ethical principles and human rights--even at personal risk to themselves? This film explores the lives of whistle blowers and poses a further question: Why is so much money spent researching how to get people to obey external authority and no money is spent researching how to get people to obey their conscience? See this film and decide for yourself.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["These","two","icon","of","progress","thought","in","America","met","for","the","first","time","to","discuss","a","salient","issu","for","our","time",":","Whi","are","some","peopl","known","as","whistl","blower","will","to","take","courag","nonviol","action","in","defens","of","ethic","principl","and","human","right","--","even","at","person","risk","to","themselv","?","This","film","explor","the","live","of","whistl","blower","and","pose","a","further","question",":","Whi","is","so","much","money","spent","research","how","to","get","peopl","to","obey","extern","author","and","no","money","is","spent","research","how","to","get","peopl","to","obey","their","conscienc","?","See","this","film","and","decid","for","yourself","."],"lemmas":["these","two","icon","of","progressive","thought","in","America","meet","for","the","first","time","to","discuss","a","salient","issue","for","we","time",":","why","be","some","people","know","as","whistle","blower","willing","to","take","courageous","nonviolent","action","in","defense","of","ethical","principle","and","human","rights","--","even","at","personal","risk","to","themselves","?","this","film","explore","the","life","of","whistle","blower","and","pose","a","further","question",":","why","be","so","much","money","spend","research","how","to","get","people","to","obey","external","authority","and","no","money","be","spend","research","how","to","get","people","to","obey","they","conscience","?","see","this","film","and","decide","for","yourself","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["These two icons","two icons of","icons of progressive","of progressive thought","progressive thought in","thought in America","in America met","America met for","met for the","for the first","the first time","first time to","time to discuss","to discuss a","discuss a salient","a salient issue","salient issue for","issue for our","for our times","our times :","times : Why",": Why are","Why are some","are some people","some people known","people known as","known as whistle","as whistle blowers","whistle blowers willing","blowers willing to","willing to take","to take courageous","take courageous nonviolent","courageous nonviolent action","nonviolent action in","action in defense","in defense of","defense of ethical","of ethical principles","ethical principles and","principles and human","and human rights","human rights --","rights -- even","-- even at","even at personal","at personal risk","personal risk to","risk to themselves","This film explores","film explores the","explores the lives","the lives of","lives of whistle","of whistle blowers","whistle blowers and","blowers and poses","and poses a","poses a further","a further question","further question :","question : Why",": Why is","Why is so","is so much","so much money","much money spent","money spent researching","spent researching how","researching how to","how to get","to get people","get people to","people to obey","to obey external","obey external authority","external authority and","authority and no","and no money","no money is","money is spent","is spent researching","spent researching how","researching how to","how to get","to get people","get people to","people to obey","to obey their","obey their conscience","See this film","this film and","film and decide","and decide for","decide for yourself"],"2grams":["These two","two icons","icons of","of progressive","progressive thought","thought in","in America","America met","met for","for the","the first","first time","time to","to discuss","discuss a","a salient","salient issue","issue for","for our","our times","times :",": Why","Why are","are some","some people","people known","known as","as whistle","whistle blowers","blowers willing","willing to","to take","take courageous","courageous nonviolent","nonviolent action","action in","in defense","defense of","of ethical","ethical principles","principles and","and human","human rights","rights --","-- even","even at","at personal","personal risk","risk to","to themselves","This film","film explores","explores the","the lives","lives of","of whistle","whistle blowers","blowers and","and poses","poses a","a further","further question","question :",": Why","Why is","is so","so much","much money","money spent","spent researching","researching how","how to","to get","get people","people to","to obey","obey external","external authority","authority and","and no","no money","money is","is spent","spent researching","researching how","how to","to get","get people","people to","to obey","obey their","their conscience","See this","this film","film and","and decide","decide for","for yourself"]}

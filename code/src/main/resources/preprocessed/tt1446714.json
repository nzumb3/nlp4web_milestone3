{"title":"Prometheus","plot":"This film is set in 2093 and takes place in the same universe as the 'Alien' movies. A group of explorers, including some archaeologists, are on an \"undisclosed\" mission. They arrive at a moon trillions of miles away from Earth. The team spot what they believe to be signs of civilization. They go to investigate and find more than just signs, they find conclusive evidence. But some of them have an ulterior motive for being there, including the Weyland Corporation. They believe that this is where the human race actually came from. Things soon turn from excitement to survival once inside their discovery.","genres":["Adventure"," Sci-Fi"," Mystery"],"stems":["This","film","is","set","in","2093","and","take","place","in","the","same","univers","as","the","'","Alien","'","movi",".","A","group","of","explor",",","includ","some","archaeologist",",","are","on","an","\"","undisclos","\"","mission",".","They","arriv","at","a","moon","trillion","of","mile","away","from","Earth",".","The","team","spot","what","they","believ","to","be","sign","of","civil",".","They","go","to","investig","and","find","more","than","just","sign",",","they","find","conclus","evid",".","But","some","of","them","have","an","ulterior","motiv","for","be","there",",","includ","the","Weyland","Corpor",".","They","believ","that","this","is","where","the","human","race","actual","came","from",".","Thing","soon","turn","from","excit","to","surviv","onc","insid","their","discoveri","."],"lemmas":["this","film","be","set","in","2093","and","take","place","in","the","same","universe","as","the","'","Alien","'","movie",".","a","group","of","explorer",",","include","some","archaeologist",",","be","on","a","``","undisclosed","''","mission",".","they","arrive","at","a","moon","trillion","of","mile","away","from","Earth",".","the","team","spot","what","they","believe","to","be","sign","of","civilization",".","they","go","to","investigate","and","find","more","than","just","sign",",","they","find","conclusive","evidence",".","but","some","of","they","have","a","ulterior","motive","for","be","there",",","include","the","Weyland","Corporation",".","they","believe","that","this","be","where","the","human","race","actually","come","from",".","thing","soon","turn","from","excitement","to","survival","once","inside","they","discovery","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This film is","film is set","is set in","set in 2093","in 2093 and","2093 and takes","and takes place","takes place in","place in the","in the same","the same universe","same universe as","universe as the","as the '","the ' Alien","' Alien '","Alien ' movies","A group of","group of explorers","of explorers ,","explorers , including",", including some","including some archaeologists","some archaeologists ,","archaeologists , are",", are on","are on an","on an \"","an \" undisclosed","\" undisclosed \"","undisclosed \" mission","They arrive at","arrive at a","at a moon","a moon trillions","moon trillions of","trillions of miles","of miles away","miles away from","away from Earth","The team spot","team spot what","spot what they","what they believe","they believe to","believe to be","to be signs","be signs of","signs of civilization","They go to","go to investigate","to investigate and","investigate and find","and find more","find more than","more than just","than just signs","just signs ,","signs , they",", they find","they find conclusive","find conclusive evidence","But some of","some of them","of them have","them have an","have an ulterior","an ulterior motive","ulterior motive for","motive for being","for being there","being there ,","there , including",", including the","including the Weyland","the Weyland Corporation","They believe that","believe that this","that this is","this is where","is where the","where the human","the human race","human race actually","race actually came","actually came from","Things soon turn","soon turn from","turn from excitement","from excitement to","excitement to survival","to survival once","survival once inside","once inside their","inside their discovery"],"2grams":["This film","film is","is set","set in","in 2093","2093 and","and takes","takes place","place in","in the","the same","same universe","universe as","as the","the '","' Alien","Alien '","' movies","A group","group of","of explorers","explorers ,",", including","including some","some archaeologists","archaeologists ,",", are","are on","on an","an \"","\" undisclosed","undisclosed \"","\" mission","They arrive","arrive at","at a","a moon","moon trillions","trillions of","of miles","miles away","away from","from Earth","The team","team spot","spot what","what they","they believe","believe to","to be","be signs","signs of","of civilization","They go","go to","to investigate","investigate and","and find","find more","more than","than just","just signs","signs ,",", they","they find","find conclusive","conclusive evidence","But some","some of","of them","them have","have an","an ulterior","ulterior motive","motive for","for being","being there","there ,",", including","including the","the Weyland","Weyland Corporation","They believe","believe that","that this","this is","is where","where the","the human","human race","race actually","actually came","came from","Things soon","soon turn","turn from","from excitement","excitement to","to survival","survival once","once inside","inside their","their discovery"]}

{"title":"Count to 100","plot":"When we meet Thomas and his mother, Anne, for the first time, they are about to run away as so often before. Now, the escape brings Thomas and Anne to a cosy provincial town. They stop their car to fill up the tank and here Thomas meets Helene, who he instantly falls in love with. Thomas takes the initiative to rent rooms at the local junk dealer Lars. Thomas starts school in a new class, where he sits next to the guitar freak Jonas. In the beginning, Thomas and his mother try to keep to themselves, as they have all too often experienced having to say goodbye to new friends. But Thomas can't let go of Helene and his friend Jonas doesn't give up easily. When the schoolteacher arranges a concert, Jonas, Helene and Thomas form a band. Meanwhile, Lars falls in love with Anne, who also slowly begins to warm up to him. But the moment the future looks brightest, the past catches up with them and Thomas and Anne prepare to run away. But their stay in the little town has left its traces. The experience of a \"normal\" life with friends and new love is not easily shaken off. The thought of having to live life as a game of hide and seek makes Thomas find the courage to take up the fight.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","we","meet","Thoma","and","his","mother",",","Anne",",","for","the","first","time",",","they","are","about","to","run","away","as","so","often","befor",".","Now",",","the","escap","bring","Thoma","and","Anne","to","a","cosi","provinci","town",".","They","stop","their","car","to","fill","up","the","tank","and","here","Thoma","meet","Helen",",","who","he","instant","fall","in","love","with",".","Thoma","take","the","initi","to","rent","room","at","the","local","junk","dealer","Lar",".","Thoma","start","school","in","a","new","class",",","where","he","sit","next","to","the","guitar","freak","Jona",".","In","the","begin",",","Thoma","and","his","mother","tri","to","keep","to","themselv",",","as","they","have","all","too","often","experienc","have","to","say","goodby","to","new","friend",".","But","Thoma","ca","n't","let","go","of","Helen","and","his","friend","Jona","doe","n't","give","up","easili",".","When","the","schoolteach","arrang","a","concert",",","Jona",",","Helen","and","Thoma","form","a","band",".","Meanwhil",",","Lar","fall","in","love","with","Anne",",","who","also","slowli","begin","to","warm","up","to","him",".","But","the","moment","the","futur","look","brightest",",","the","past","catch","up","with","them","and","Thoma","and","Anne","prepar","to","run","away",".","But","their","stay","in","the","littl","town","has","left","it","trace",".","The","experi","of","a","\"","normal","\"","life","with","friend","and","new","love","is","not","easili","shaken","off",".","The","thought","of","have","to","live","life","as","a","game","of","hide","and","seek","make","Thoma","find","the","courag","to","take","up","the","fight","."],"lemmas":["when","we","meet","Thomas","and","he","mother",",","Anne",",","for","the","first","time",",","they","be","about","to","run","away","as","so","often","before",".","now",",","the","escape","bring","Thomas","and","Anne","to","a","cosy","provincial","town",".","they","stop","they","car","to","fill","up","the","tank","and","here","Thomas","meet","Helene",",","who","he","instantly","fall","in","love","with",".","Thomas","take","the","initiative","to","rent","room","at","the","local","junk","dealer","Lars",".","Thomas","start","school","in","a","new","class",",","where","he","sit","next","to","the","guitar","freak","Jonas",".","in","the","beginning",",","Thomas","and","he","mother","try","to","keep","to","themselves",",","as","they","have","all","too","often","experienced","have","to","say","goodbye","to","new","friend",".","but","Thomas","can","not","let","go","of","Helene","and","he","friend","Jonas","do","not","give","up","easily",".","when","the","schoolteacher","arrange","a","concert",",","Jonas",",","Helene","and","Thomas","form","a","band",".","meanwhile",",","Lars","fall","in","love","with","Anne",",","who","also","slowly","begin","to","warm","up","to","he",".","but","the","moment","the","future","look","brightest",",","the","past","catch","up","with","they","and","Thomas","and","Anne","prepare","to","run","away",".","but","they","stay","in","the","little","town","have","leave","its","trace",".","the","experience","of","a","``","normal","''","life","with","friend","and","new","love","be","not","easily","shake","off",".","the","thought","of","have","to","live","life","as","a","game","of","hide","and","seek","make","Thomas","find","the","courage","to","take","up","the","fight","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When

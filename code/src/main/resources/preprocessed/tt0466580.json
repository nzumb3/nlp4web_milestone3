On his way home, Vishwas finds out that Javed has forgotten some documents in his car, and drives back to return them. He does not know that soon he will be taken captive by a gun-toting Ayesha, who also suspects that Javed is having an affair with a woman named Madhu, and who believes that Vishwas had sexually

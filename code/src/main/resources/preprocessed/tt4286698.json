{"title":"Blood of the Martyrs","plot":"On November 16, 1989, six Jesuits and two women were brutally murdered in El Salvador by US trained and funded commandos of the Salvadoran army. The executions, carried out in the middle of the night in the Jesuits' backyard, reminded the world just how dangerous preaching the Gospel and serving the poor in a politically fraught landscape could be. With twenty-five years of conflicting stories, ample questions remain: who, exactly, is responsible? Why did the US spend over $1,000,000 a day to fund the Salvadoran army? Finally, does the martyrs' sacrifice affect El Salvador--still the second most dangerous country--today? The Blood of the Martyrs reveals the definitive story in the words of the people who lived it.","genres":["Crime"," History","

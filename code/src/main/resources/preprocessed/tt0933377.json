{"title":"Leimert Park: The Story of a Village in South Central Los Angeles","plot":"This film documents and celebrates the deep spirit and the profound struggles of a small group of extraordinary artists and musicians who transformed a few blocks of modest storefronts in South Central Los Angeles into a vibrant and inspiring cultural oasis. The film focuses on the ex-homeless Richard Fulton, whose coffeehouse, Fifth Street Dick's, became a gathering spot for the community, and ultimately sparked a remarkable underground renaissance of African-American art and culture. Also included are interviews and performances by Dwight Trible, Lady Walquer Vereen, Kamau Daaood, John Outterbridge, Billy Higgins, Horace Tapscott, and more.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","film","document","and","celebr","the","deep","spirit","and","the","profound","struggl","of","a","small","group","of","extraordinari","artist","and","musician","who","transform","a","few","block","of","modest","storefront","in","South","Central","Los","Angele","into","a","vibrant","and","inspir","cultur","oasi",".","The","film","focus","on","the","ex-homeless","Richard","Fulton",",","whose","coffeehous",",","Fifth","Street","Dick","'s",",","becam","a","gather","spot","for","the","communiti",",","and","ultim","spark","a","remark","underground","renaiss","of","African-American","art","and","cultur",".","Also","includ","are","interview","and","perform","by","Dwight","Tribl",",","Ladi","Walquer","Vereen",",","Kamau","Daaood",",","John","Outterbridg",",","Billi","Higgin",",","Horac","Tapscott",",","and","more","."],"lemmas":["this","film","document","and","celebrate","the","deep","spirit","and","the","profound","struggle","of","a","small","group","of","extraordinary","artist","and","musician","who","transform","a","few","block","of","modest","storefront","in","South","Central","Los","Angeles","into","a","vibrant","and","inspiring","cultural","oasis",".","the","film","focus","on","the","ex-homeless","Richard","Fulton",",","whose","coffeehouse",",","Fifth","Street","Dick","'s",",","become","a","gathering","spot","for","the","community",",","and","ultimately","spark","a","remarkable","underground","renaissance","of","african-american","art","and","culture",".","also","include","be","interview","and","performance","by","Dwight","Trible",",","Lady","Walquer","Vereen",",","Kamau","Daaood",",","John","Outterbridge",",","Billy","Higgins",",","Horace","Tapscott",",","and","more","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

{"title":"Love Bite","plot":"School is over and summer has begun in the dead-end seaside town of Rainmouth. While Jamie's friends seem to be happy working in the local pie factory by day and looking for sex by night, Jamie is bored out of his mind, running his pot-head mother's B&B. He's desperate to get out of there. But when he meets beautiful, smart and sexy American traveler Juliana at a party, he's smitten - the world is not so small after all. But soon after Juliana's arrival, strange things start happening. One of the local teens goes missing at a party. Then, another. Jamie is warned by an enigmatic stranger that a werewolf is in town - and preying solely on virgin flesh! The only way to be safe seems to be to pop your cherry. (But that can't be true... can it?) As the locals are picked off one by one, the boys fear that a werewolf is indeed after them. And for all their talk, it turns out none of them have ever had sex before... Pretty soon, everyone is dying to get laid.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"],"stems":["School","is","over","and","summer","has","begun","in","the","dead-end","seasid","town","of","Rainmouth",".","While","Jami","'s","friend","seem","to","be","happi","work","in","the","local","pie","factori","by","day","and","look","for","sex","by","night",",","Jami","is","bore","out","of","his","mind",",","run","his","pot-head","mother","'s","B&B",".","He","'s","desper","to","get","out","of","there",".","But","when","he","meet","beauti",",","smart","and","sexi","American","travel","Juliana","at","a","parti",",","he","'s","smitten","-","the","world","is","not","so","small","after","all",".","But","soon","after","Juliana","'s","arriv",",","strang","thing","start","happen",".","One","of","the","local","teen","goe","miss","at","a","parti",".","Then",",","anoth",".","Jami","is","warn","by","an","enigmat","stranger","that","a","werewolf","is","in","town","-","and","prey","sole","on","virgin","flesh","!","The","onli","way","to","be","safe","seem","to","be","to","pop","your","cherri",".","(","But","that","ca","n't","be","true","...","can","it","?",")","As","the","local","are","pick","off","one","by","one",",","the","boy","fear","that","a","werewolf","is","inde","after","them",".","And","for","all","their","talk",",","it","turn","out","none","of","them","have","ever","had","sex","befor","...","Pretti","soon",",","everyon","is","die","to","get","laid","."],"lemmas":["School","be","over","and","summer","have","begin","in","the","dead-end","seaside","town","of","Rainmouth",".","while","Jamie","'s","friend","seem","to","be","happy","work","in","the","local","pie","factory","by","day","and","look","for","sex","by","night",",","Jamie","be","bore","out","of","he","mind",",","run","he","pot-head","mother","'s","b&b",".","he","be","desperate","to","get","out","of","there",".","but","when","he","meet","beautiful",",","smart","and","sexy","american","traveler","juliana","at","a","party",",","he","be","smitten","-","the","world","be","not","so","small","after","all",".","but","soon","after","Juliana","'s","arrival",",","strange","thing","start","happen",".","one","of","the","local","teens","go","miss","at","a","party",".","then",",","another",".","Jamie","be","warn","by","a","enigmatic","stranger","that","a","werewolf","be","in","town","-","and","prey","solely","on","virgin","flesh","!","the","only","way","to","be","safe","seem","to","be","to","pop","you","cherry",".","-lrb-","but","that","can","not","be","true","...","can","it","?","-rrb-","as","the","local","be","pick","off","one","by","one",",","the","boy","fear","that","a","werewolf","be","indeed","after","they",".","and","for","all","they","talk",",","it","turn","out","none","of","they","have","ever","have","sex","before","...","Pretty","soon",",","everyone","be","die","to","get","lay","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["School is over","is over and","over and summer","and summer has","summer has begun","has begun in","begun in the","in the dead-end","the dead-end seaside","dead-end seaside town","seaside town of","town of Rainmouth","While Jamie 's","Jamie 's friends","'s friends seem","friends seem to","seem to be","to be happy","be happy working","happy working in","working in the","in the local","the local pie","local pie factory","pie factory by","factory by day","by day and","day and looking","and looking for","looking for sex","for sex by","sex by night","by night ,","night , Jamie",", Jamie is","Jamie is bored","is bored out","bored out of","out of his","of his mind","his mind ,","mind , running",", running his","running his pot-head","his pot-head mother","pot-head mother 's","mother 's B&B","He 's desperate","'s desperate to","desperate to get","to get out","get out of","out of there","But when he","when he meets","he meets beautiful","meets beautiful ,","beautiful , smart",", smart and","smart and sexy","and sexy American","sexy American traveler","American traveler Juliana","traveler Juliana at","Juliana at a","at a party","a party ,","party , he",", he 's","he 's smitten","'s smitten -","smitten -

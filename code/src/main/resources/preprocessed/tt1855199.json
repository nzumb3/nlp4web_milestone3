{"title":"End of Watch","plot":"In South Central Los Angeles, street cops Brian and Mike are partners - balls-out cowboys patrolling the streets as Latino gangs are in a power struggle with Blacks. Brian and Mike get lucky a couple of times, making big drug and human-trafficking busts, so a Mexican cartel orders their deaths. We meet Mike's pregnant wife (whom he married out of high school) and watch Brian's search for a soul mate. There are internal squabbles within the ranks of the LAPD and lots of squad-car conversation. Can the lads escape the cartel's murderous reach?","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["In","South","Central","Los","Angele",",","street","cop","Brian","and","Mike","are","partner","-","balls-out","cowboy","patrol","the","street","as","Latino","gang","are","in","a","power","struggl","with","Black",".","Brian","and","Mike","get","lucki","a","coupl","of","time",",","make","big","drug","and","human-traffick","bust",",","so","a","Mexican","cartel","order","their","death",".","We","meet","Mike","'s","pregnant","wife","(","whom","he","marri","out","of","high","school",")","and","watch","Brian","'s","search","for","a","soul","mate",".","There","are","intern","squabbl","within","the","rank","of","the","LAPD","and","lot","of","squad-car","convers",".","Can","the","lad","escap","the","cartel","'s","murder","reach","?"],"lemmas":["in","South","Central","Los","Angeles",",","street","cop","Brian","and","Mike","be","partner","-","balls-out","cowboy","patrolling","the","street","as","latino","gang","be","in","a","power","struggle","with","Blacks",".","Brian","and","Mike","get","lucky","a","couple","of","time",",","make","big","drug","and","human-trafficking","bust",",","so","a","mexican","cartel","order","they","death",".","we","meet","Mike","'s","pregnant","wife","-lrb-","whom","he","marry","out","of","high","school","-rrb-","and","watch","Brian","'s","search","for","a","soul","mate",".","there","be","internal","squabble","within","the","rank","of","the","lapd","and","lot","of","squad-car","conversation",".","can","the","lad","escape","the","cartel","'s","murderous","reach","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In South Central","South Central Los","Central Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , street",", street cops","street cops Brian","cops Brian and","Brian and Mike","and Mike are","Mike are partners","are partners -","partners - balls-out","- balls-out cowboys","balls-out cowboys patrolling","cowboys patrolling the","patrolling the streets","the streets as","streets as Latino","as Latino gangs","Latino gangs are","gangs are in","are in a","in a power","a power struggle","power struggle with","struggle with Blacks","Brian and Mike","and Mike get","Mike get lucky","get lucky a","lucky a couple","a couple of","couple of times","of times ,","times , making",", making big","making big drug","big drug and","drug and human-trafficking","and human-trafficking busts","human-trafficking busts ,","busts , so",", so a","so a Mexican","a Mexican cartel","Mexican cartel orders","cartel orders their","orders their deaths","We meet Mike","meet Mike 's","Mike 's pregnant","'s pregnant wife","pregnant wife (","wife ( whom","( whom he","whom he married","he married out","married out of","out of high","of high school","high school )","school ) and",") and watch","and watch Brian","watch Brian 's","Brian 's search","'s search for","search for a","for a soul","a soul mate","There are internal","are internal squabbles","internal squabbles within","squabbles within the","within the ranks","the ranks of","ranks of the","of the LAPD","the LAPD and","LAPD and lots","and lots of","lots of squad-car","of squad-car conversation","Can the lads","the lads escape","lads escape the","escape the cartel","the cartel 's","cartel 's murderous","'s murderous reach"],"2grams":["In South","South Central","Central Los","Los Angeles","Angeles ,",", street","street cops","cops Brian","Brian and","and Mike","Mike are","are partners","partners -","- balls-out","balls-out cowboys","cowboys patrolling","patrolling the","the streets","streets as","as Latino","Latino gangs","gangs are","are in","in a","a power","power struggle","struggle with","with Blacks","Brian and","and Mike","Mike get","get lucky","lucky a","a couple","couple of","of times","times ,",", making","making big","big drug","drug and","and human-trafficking","human-trafficking busts","busts ,",", so","so a","a Mexican","Mexican cartel","cartel orders","orders their","their deaths","We meet","meet Mike","Mike 's","'s pregnant","pregnant wife","wife (","( whom","whom he","he married","married out","out of","of high","high school","school )",") and","and watch","watch Brian","Brian 's","'s search","search for","for a","a soul","soul mate","There are","are internal","internal squabbles","squabbles within","within the","the ranks","ranks of","of the","the LAPD","LAPD and","and lots","lots of","of squad-car","squad-car conversation","Can the","the lads","lads escape","escape the","the cartel","cartel 's","'s murderous","murderous reach"]}

{"title":"Lethal Games","plot":"A corrupt businessman hires two ruthless goons to force the locals in a small town to sell their properties to him. The owner of the local bar Mike Stevens refuses, so one of the goons pulls out a shotgun and guns him down in front of his horrified fiancee. Since she's now a witness to murder, the two creeps kidnap her and take her to their lair at the local junkyard to have some fun with her before they kill her. The girlfriend of one of them is also there and she becomes so horrified when the other goon tries to rape the girl that she turns on them and runs away. The two go after her and the local corrupt sheriff helps them. The girlfriend is helped by the fearless local female kook, who hides her in her trailer. Meanwhile, Mike's fiancee's sister and her female friend arrive in town to take law into their own hands and rescue the captive woman. Their unenthusiastic ally eventually becomes the sister's boyfriend, Mac Richards, a Vietnam War veteran who owns and runs the town's paintball range.","genres":["Action","

{"title":"Fools Never Grow Old","plot":"Martin Lax is 86 years old and is struggling with aging and his past. As he goes about his daily routines, he recounts his memories with capricious wit and moody nostalgia to his 20-year-old grandson. We hear how the past inserts its haunting presence, with humor and sadness, into his everyday life. From the small town of Caraseu, to the gates of Auschwitz, to the pool at the Jewish Community Center in Cleveland, Fools Never Grow Old is the portrait of a man looking back as his life draws to a close.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Martin","Lax","is","86","year","old","and","is","struggl","with","age","and","his","past",".","As","he","goe","about","his","daili","routin",",","he","recount","his","memori","with","caprici","wit","and","moodi","nostalgia","to","his","20-year-old","grandson",".","We","hear","how","the","past","insert","it","haunt","presenc",",","with","humor","and","sad",",","into","his","everyday","life",".","From","the","small","town","of","Caraseu",",","to","the","gate","of","Auschwitz",",","to","the","pool","at","the","Jewish","Commun","Center","in","Cleveland",",","Fool","Never","Grow","Old","is","the","portrait","of","a","man","look","back","as","his","life","draw","to","a","close","."],"lemmas":["Martin","Lax","be","86","year","old","and","be","struggle","with","aging","and","he","past",".","as","he","go","about","he","daily","routine",",","he","recount","he","memory","with","capricious","wit","and","moody","nostalgia","to","he","20-year-old","grandson",".","we","hear","how","the","past","insert","its","haunting","presence",",","with","humor","and","sadness",",","into","he","everyday","life",".","from","the","small","town","of","Caraseu",",","to","the","gate","of","Auschwitz",",","to","the","pool","at","the","Jewish","Community","Center","in","Cleveland",",","Fools","Never","Grow","Old","be","the","portrait","of","a","man","look","back","as","he","life","draw","to","a","close","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Martin Lax is","Lax is 86","is 86 years","86 years old","years old and","old and is","and is struggling","is struggling with","struggling with aging","with aging and","aging and his","and his past","As he goes","he goes about","goes about his","about his daily","his daily routines","daily routines ,","routines , he",", he recounts","he recounts his","recounts his memories","his memories with","memories with capricious","with capricious wit","capricious wit and","wit and moody","and moody nostalgia","moody nostalgia to","nostalgia to his","to his 20-year-old","his 20-year-old grandson","We hear how","hear how the","how the past","the past inserts","past inserts its","inserts its haunting","its haunting presence","haunting presence ,","presence , with",", with humor","with humor and","humor and sadness","and sadness ,","sadness , into",", into his","into his everyday","his everyday life","From the small","the small town","small town of","town of Caraseu","of Caraseu ,","Caraseu , to",", to the","to the gates","the gates of","gates of Auschwitz","of Auschwitz ,","Auschwitz , to",", to the","to the pool","the pool at","pool at the","at the Jewish","the Jewish Community","Jewish Community Center","Community Center in","Center in Cleveland","in Cleveland ,","Cleveland , Fools",", Fools Never","Fools Never Grow","Never Grow Old","Grow Old is","Old is the","is the portrait","the portrait of","portrait of a","of a man","a man looking","man looking back","looking back as","back as his","as his life","his life draws","life draws to","draws to a","to a close"],"2grams":["Martin Lax","Lax is","is 86","86 years","years old","old and","and is","is struggling","struggling with","with aging","aging and","and his","his past","As he","he goes","goes about","about his","his daily","daily routines","routines ,",", he","he recounts","recounts his","his memories","memories with","with capricious","capricious wit","wit and","and moody","moody nostalgia","nostalgia to","to his","his 20-year-old","20-year-old grandson","We hear","hear how","how the","the past","past inserts","inserts its","its haunting","haunting presence","presence ,",", with","with humor","humor and","and sadness","sadness ,",", into","into his","his everyday","everyday life","From the","the small","small town","town of","of Caraseu","Caraseu ,",", to","to the","the gates","gates of","of Auschwitz","Auschwitz ,",", to","to the","the pool","pool at","at the","the Jewish","Jewish Community","Community Center","Center in","in Cleveland","Cleveland ,",", Fools","Fools Never","Never Grow","Grow Old","Old is","is the","the portrait","portrait of","of a","a man","man looking","looking back","back as","as his","his life","life draws","draws to","to a","a close"]}

After faking yet another girlfriend, his mother takes matters into her own hands and signs him up with a dating coach. But Toby has finally found Phoebe. She's intelligent, enchanting and she's hot, everything Toby has been looking for. But this girl brings challenges that Toby hasn't had to face before including a boyfriend.

{"title":"Accidental Tourists","plot":"The film is a meditative art experiment, meant to evoke that sense of psychological shift that happens with quiet time in nature. It documents the trip of a group of dancers through different landscapes in western North America, a collage of images of physical and sensory meditations on place following a set of minimalist filming and editing rules. Both the subject matter and the rules of filming are intended to evoke the kind of calm and simplicity of presence that opens up the senses to the 'more-than-human' world.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","film","is","a","medit","art","experi",",","meant","to","evok","that","sens","of","psycholog","shift","that","happen","with","quiet","time","in","natur",".","It","document","the","trip","of","a","group","of","dancer","through","differ","landscap","in","western","North","America",",","a","collag","of","imag","of","physic","and","sensori","medit","on","place","follow","a","set","of","minimalist","film","and","edit","rule",".","Both","the","subject","matter","and","the","rule","of","film","are","intend","to","evok","the","kind","of","calm","and","simplic","of","presenc","that","open","up","the","sens","to","the","'","more-than-human","'","world","."],"lemmas":["the","film","be","a","meditative","art","experiment",",","mean","to","evoke","that","sense","of","psychological","shift","that","happen","with","quiet","time","in","nature",".","it","document","the","trip","of","a","group","of","dancer","through","different","landscape","in","western","North","America",",","a","collage","of","image","of","physical","and","sensory","meditation","on","place","follow","a","set","of","minimalist","film","and","editing","rule",".","both","the","subject","matter","and","the","rule","of","film","be","intend","to","evoke","the","kind","of","calm","and","simplicity","of","presence","that","open","up","the","sens","to","the","'","more-than-human","'","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film is","film is a","is a meditative","a meditative art","meditative art experiment","art experiment ,","experiment , meant",", meant to","meant to evoke","to evoke that","evoke that sense","that sense of","sense of psychological","of psychological shift","psychological shift that","shift that happens","that happens with","happens with quiet","with quiet time","quiet time in","time in nature","It documents the","documents the trip","the trip of","trip of a","of a group","a group of","group of dancers","of dancers through","dancers through different","through different landscapes","different landscapes in","landscapes in western","in western North","western North America","North America ,","America , a",", a collage","a collage of","collage of images","of images of","images of physical","of physical and","physical and sensory","and sensory meditations","sensory meditations on","meditations on place","on place following","place following a","following a set","a set of","set of minimalist","of minimalist filming","minimalist filming and","filming and editing","and editing rules","Both the subject","the subject matter","subject matter and","matter and the","and the rules","the rules of","rules of filming","of filming are","filming are intended","are intended to","intended to evoke","to evoke the","evoke the kind","the kind of","kind of calm","of calm and","calm and simplicity","and simplicity of","simplicity of presence","of presence that","presence that opens","that opens up","opens up the","up the senses","the senses to","senses to the","to the '","the ' more-than-human","' more-than-human '","more-than-human ' world"],"2grams":["The film","film is","is a","a meditative","meditative art","art experiment","experiment ,",", meant","meant to","to evoke","evoke that","that sense","sense of","of psychological","psychological shift","shift that","that happens","happens with","with quiet","quiet time","time in","in nature","It documents","documents the","the trip","trip of","of a","a group","group of","of dancers","dancers through","through different","different landscapes","landscapes in","in western","western North","North America","America ,",", a","a collage","collage of","of images","images of","of physical","physical and","and sensory","sensory meditations","meditations on","on place","place following","following a","a set","set of","of minimalist","minimalist filming","filming and","and editing","editing rules","Both the","the subject","subject matter","matter and","and the","the rules","rules of","of filming","filming are","are intended","intended to","to evoke","evoke the","the kind","kind of","of calm","calm and","and simplicity","simplicity of","of presence","presence that","that opens","opens up","up the","the senses","senses to","to the","the '","' more-than-human","more-than-human '","' world"]}

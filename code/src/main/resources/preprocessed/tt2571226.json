{"title":"The Anonymous People","plot":"Deeply entrenched social stigma have kept recovery voices silent and faces hidden for decades. The vacuum created by this silence has been filled by sensational mass media depictions of addiction that continue to perpetuate a lurid public fascination with the dysfunctional side of what is a preventable and treatable health condition. Just like women with breast cancer, or people with HIV/AIDS, a grass roots social justice movement is emerging. Courageous addiction recovery advocates have come out of the shadows and are organizing to end discrimination and move toward recovery-based solutions. The moving story of The Anonymous People is told through the faces and voices of the citizens, leaders, volunteers, corporate executives, and public figures who are laying it all on the line to save the lives of others just like them. This passionate new public recovery movement is fueling a changing conversation that aims to transform public opinion, and finally shift problematic policy toward lasting solutions.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Deepli","entrench","social","stigma","have","kept","recoveri","voic","silent","and","face","hidden","for","decad",".","The","vacuum","creat","by","this","silenc","has","been","fill","by","sensat","mass","media","depict","of","addict","that","continu","to","perpetu","a","lurid","public","fascin","with","the","dysfunct","side","of","what","is","a","prevent","and","treatabl","health","condit",".","Just","like","women","with","breast","cancer",",","or","peopl","with","HIV/AIDS",",","a","grass","root","social","justic","movement","is","emerg",".","Courag","addict","recoveri","advoc","have","come","out","of","the","shadow","and","are","organ","to","end","discrimin","and","move","toward","recovery-bas","solut",".","The","move","stori","of","The","Anonym","Peopl","is","told","through","the","face","and","voic","of","the","citizen",",","leader",",","volunt",",","corpor","execut",",","and","public","figur","who","are","lay","it","all","on","the","line","to","save","the","live","of","other","just","like","them",".","This","passion","new","public","recoveri","movement","is","fuel","a","chang","convers","that","aim","to","transform","public","opinion",",","and","final","shift","problemat","polici","toward","last","solut","."],"lemmas":["deeply","entrench","social","stigma","have","keep","recovery","voice","silent","and","face","hide","for","decade",".","the","vacuum","create","by","this","silence","have","be","fill","by","sensational","mass","media","depiction","of","addiction","that","continue","to","perpetuate","a","lurid","public","fascination","with","the","dysfunctional","side","of","what","be","a","preventable","and","treatable","health","condition",".","just","like","woman","with","breast","cancer",",","or","people","with","hiv/aids",",","a","grass","root","social","justice","movement","be","emerge",".","courageous","addiction","recovery","advocate","have","come","out","of","the","shadow","and","be","organize","to","end","discrimination","and","move","toward","recovery-based","solution",".","the","move","story","of","the","anonymous","people","be","tell","through","the","face","and","voice","of","the","citizen",",","leader",",","volunteer",",","corporate","executive",",","and","public","figure","who","be","lay","it","all","on","the","line","to","save","the","life","of","other","just","like","they",".","this","passionate","new","public","recovery","movement","be","fuel","a","change","conversation","that","aim","to","transform","public","opinion",",","and","finally","shift","problematic","policy","toward","lasting","solution","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Deeply

{"title":"Glam God: The Story of Bobby Holiday and His Band Metal Snake Featuring Bobby Holiday","plot":"Glam God is the story of Bobby Holiday, lead singer of an 80's hair metal glam cover band called Metal Snake. His whole life he's dreamed of becoming famous, not for his amazing vocal abilities or his musical talents or his song writing skills, but for his bronzed chiseled abs, his custom made leopard pants, his high kicks, his high screams and his impeccable blond wig (that sometimes looks like Vince Neil and then sometimes looks like Pamela Anderson.) Beneath Bobby's narcissism lies the true heart of what the documentary is about, which is having a dream and then making that dream come true. Bobby, who's dream was to become a lead singer of an 80's cover band, made his dream come true, it doesn't matter that his dream was only alive for a total of 5 performance shows. Bobby had it all, the groupies, the screaming fans, the spot light, the drugs, the sex and he owned the Rock 'n Roll. Bobby became famous...in his mind. Bobby created a world where he could high kick his way into a shit load of threesomes and outrageous backstage naughtiness. When something sounds or is too good to be true, it usually is and so it was with the rise and fall of Metal Snake, taking place over the course of just 4 live performance shows. It's actually scary to think that this is all real.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary","

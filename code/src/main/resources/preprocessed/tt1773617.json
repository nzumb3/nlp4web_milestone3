{"title":"Singularity Principle","plot":"Singularity Principle is a feature length science-fiction film about the consequences of renegade experiments into Parallel Universes. Co-written and directed (with Austin Hines) by physicist Dr. David Deranian, the film pays particular attention to accurate scientific detail and uses the fascinating science of parallel universes to bring audiences a story that will both illuminate and entertain. The story starts off with the disappearance of noted scientist Professor Jack Brenner (John Diehl) during a fateful parallel universe experiment. Jack's protege, Dr. Peter Tanning (Michael Denis) is being interrogated by Dr. Lawrence Cason (William B. Davis) of a clandestine Black-Ops Agency to learn about the experiment and to find out what happened to Jack Brenner. Lawrence makes it clear that he wants to know everything about the experiment, including how parallel universes can be manipulated...","genres":["Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Singular","Principl","is","a","featur","length","science-fict","film","about","the","consequ","of","renegad","experi","into","Parallel","Univers",".","Co-written","and","direct","(","with","Austin","Hine",")","by","physicist","Dr.","David","Deranian",",","the","film","pay","particular","attent","to","accur","scientif","detail","and","use","the","fascin","scienc","of","parallel","univers","to","bring","audienc","a","stori","that","will","both","illumin","and","entertain",".","The","stori","start","off","with","the","disappear","of","note","scientist","Professor","Jack","Brenner","(","John","Diehl",")","dure","a","fate","parallel","univers","experi",".","Jack","'s","proteg",",","Dr.","Peter","Tan","(","Michael","Deni",")","is","be","interrog","by","Dr.","Lawrenc","Cason","(","William","B.","Davi",")","of","a","clandestin","Black-Op","Agenci","to","learn","about","the","experi","and","to","find","out","what","happen","to","Jack","Brenner",".","Lawrenc","make","it","clear","that","he","want","to","know","everyth","about","the","experi",",","includ","how","parallel","univers","can","be","manipul","..."],"lemmas":["Singularity","Principle","be","a","feature","length","science-fiction","film","about","the","consequence","of","renegade","experiment","into","parallel","universe",".","co-written","and","directed","-lrb-","with","Austin","Hines","-rrb-","by","physicist","Dr.","David","Deranian",",","the","film","pay","particular","attention","to","accurate","scientific","detail","and","use","the","fascinating","science","of","parallel","universe","to","bring","audience","a","story","that","will","both","illuminate","and","entertain",".","the","story","start","off","with","the","disappearance","of","noted","scientist","Professor","Jack","Brenner","-lrb-","John","Diehl","-rrb-","during","a","fateful","parallel","universe","experiment",".","Jack","'s","protege",",","Dr.","Peter","Tanning","-lrb-","Michael","Denis","-rrb-","be","be","interrogate","by","Dr.","Lawrence","Cason","-lrb-","William","B.","Davis","-rrb-","of","a","clandestine","Black-Ops","Agency","to","learn","about","the","experiment","and","to","find","out","what","happen","to","Jack","Brenner",".","Lawrence","make","it","clear","that","he","want","to","know","everything","about","the","experiment",",","include","how","parallel","universe","can","be","manipulate","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Singularity Principle is","Principle is a","is a feature","a feature length","feature length science-fiction","length science-fiction film","science-fiction film about","film about the","about the consequences","the consequences of","consequences of renegade","of renegade experiments","renegade experiments into","experiments into Parallel","into Parallel Universes","Co-written and directed","and directed (","directed ( with","( with Austin","with Austin Hines","Austin Hines )","Hines ) by",") by physicist","by physicist Dr.","physicist Dr. David","Dr. David Deranian","David Deranian ,","Deranian , the",", the film","the film pays","film pays particular","pays particular attention","particular attention to","attention to accurate","to accurate scientific","accurate scientific detail","scientific detail and","detail and uses","and uses the","uses the fascinating","the fascinating science","fascinating science of","science of parallel","of parallel universes","parallel universes to","universes to bring","to bring audiences","bring audiences a","audiences a story","a story that","story that will","that will both","will both illuminate","both illuminate and","illuminate and entertain","The story starts","story starts off","starts off with","off with the","with the disappearance","the disappearance of","disappearance of noted","of noted scientist","noted scientist Professor","scientist Professor Jack","Professor Jack Brenner","Jack Brenner (","Brenner ( John","( John Diehl","John Diehl )","Diehl ) during",") during a","during a fateful","a fateful parallel","fateful parallel universe","parallel universe experiment","Jack 's protege","'s protege ,","protege , Dr.",", Dr. Peter","Dr. Peter Tanning","Peter Tanning (","Tanning ( Michael","( Michael Denis","Michael Denis )","Denis ) is",") is being","is being interrogated","being interrogated by","interrogated by Dr.","by Dr. Lawrence","Dr. Lawrence Cason","Lawrence Cason (","Cason ( William","( William B.","William B.

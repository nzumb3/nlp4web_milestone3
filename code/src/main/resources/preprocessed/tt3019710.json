{"title":"Niemals Allein","plot":"Once the female FC St. Pauli rugby team was the best in Germany. Eight times they won the German Championship, but then the crisis hit. The wrong trainer took the lead and hardly integrated new players in the team. And then most women who played for more than 10 years left the team at the same time. But slowly the team recovers, although there are still some troubles. But Johanna Jahnke the Captain of the team is taking the lead and helps the New Zealand Trainer Phil to get his voice across.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["Once","the","femal","FC","St.","Pauli","rugbi","team","was","the","best","in","Germani",".","Eight","time","they","won","the","German","Championship",",","but","then","the","crisi","hit",".","The","wrong","trainer","took","the","lead","and","hard","integr","new","player","in","the","team",".","And","then","most","women","who","play","for","more","than","10","year","left","the","team","at","the","same","time",".","But","slowli","the","team","recov",",","although","there","are","still","some","troubl",".","But","Johanna","Jahnk","the","Captain","of","the","team","is","take","the","lead","and","help","the","New","Zealand","Trainer","Phil","to","get","his","voic","across","."],"lemmas":["once","the","female","FC","St.","Pauli","rugby","team","be","the","best","in","Germany",".","eight","time","they","win","the","German","Championship",",","but","then","the","crisis","hit",".","the","wrong","trainer","take","the","lead","and","hardly","integrate","new","player","in","the","team",".","and","then","most","woman","who","play","for","more","than","10","year","leave","the","team","at","the","same","time",".","but","slowly","the","team","recover",",","although","there","be","still","some","trouble",".","but","Johanna","Jahnke","the","Captain","of","the","team","be","take","the","lead","and","help","the","New","Zealand","Trainer","Phil","to","get","he","voice","across","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Once the female","the female FC","female FC St.","FC St. Pauli","St. Pauli rugby","Pauli rugby team","rugby team was","team was the","was the best","the best in","best in Germany","Eight times they","times they won","they won the","won the German","the German Championship","German Championship ,","Championship , but",", but then","but then the","then the crisis","the crisis hit","The wrong trainer","wrong trainer took","trainer took the","took the lead","the lead and","lead and hardly","and hardly integrated","hardly integrated new","integrated new players","new players in","players in the","in the team","And then most","then most women","most women who","women who played","who played for","played for more","for more than","more than 10","than 10 years","10 years left","years left the","left the team","the team at","team at the","at the same","the same time","But slowly the","slowly the team","the team recovers","team recovers ,","recovers , although",", although there","although there are","there are still","are still some","still some troubles","But Johanna Jahnke","Johanna Jahnke the","Jahnke the Captain","the Captain of","Captain of the","of the team","the team is","team is taking","is taking the","taking the lead","the lead and","lead and helps","and helps the","helps the New","the New Zealand","New Zealand Trainer","Zealand Trainer Phil","Trainer Phil to","Phil to get","to get his","get his voice","his voice across"],"2grams":["Once the","the female","female FC","FC St.","St. Pauli","Pauli rugby","rugby team","team was","was the","the best","best in","in Germany","Eight times","times they","they won","won the","the German","German Championship","Championship ,",", but","but then","then the","the crisis","crisis hit","The wrong","wrong trainer","trainer took","took the","the lead","lead and","and hardly","hardly integrated","integrated new","new players","players in","in the","the team","And then","then most","most women","women who","who played","played for","for more","more than","than 10","10 years","years left","left the","the team","team at","at the","the same","same time","But slowly","slowly the","the team","team recovers","recovers ,",", although","although there","there are","are still","still some","some troubles","But Johanna","Johanna Jahnke","Jahnke the","the Captain","Captain of","of the","the team","team is","is taking","taking the","the lead","lead and","and helps","helps the","the New","New Zealand","Zealand Trainer","Trainer Phil","Phil to","to get","get his","his voice","voice across"]}

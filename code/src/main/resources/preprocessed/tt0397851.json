Having won 151 straight games and counting, De La Salle has the longest winning streak in the history of football. What De La Salle is not, is a series of X's and O's. 1 is a feature length documentary that chronicles a truly remarkable community, illustrated by one of the most significant sports stories of modern times. Many know that the De La Salle Spartans are a high school football team - second to none. What people do not know is that this accomplishment is the result of a yearly journey to become a cohesive community bound by love. Through the lens of first-time filmmakers, the audience shares a never-before-seen, behind-the-scenes look at an unparalleled story, team and community. Over the course of an hour and a half, the viewer participates in De La Salle's philosophy and experience of team throughout the season. The viewer witnesses firsthand the amount of time, dedication and commitment that is required to excel, and begins to discover a love which elevates the Spartans above physically stronger, faster and more talented opponents. All preconceived notions of high school football are quickly lost, as the viewer begins to question the importance of being #1 while beginning to understand the power of being 1.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["De","La","Sall","is","the","#","1","high","school","footbal","team","in","the","nation","and","has","been","for","5","year",".","Have","won","151","straight","game","and","count",",","De","La","Sall","has","the","longest","win","streak","in","the","histori","of","footbal",".","What","De","La","Sall","is","not",",","is","a","seri","of","X","'s","and","O","'s",".","1","is","a","featur","length","documentari","that","chronicl","a","truli","remark","communiti",",","illustr","by","one","of","the","most","signific","sport","stori","of","modern","time",".","Mani","know","that","the","De","La","Sall","Spartan","are","a","high","school","footbal","team","-","second","to","none",".","What","peopl","do","not","know","is","that","this","accomplish","is","the","result","of","a","year","journey","to","becom","a","cohes","communiti","bound","by","love",".","Through","the","len","of","first-tim","filmmak",",","the","audienc","share","a","never-before-seen",",","behind-the-scen","look","at","an","unparallel","stori",",","team","and","communiti",".","Over","the","cours","of","an","hour","and","a","half",",","the","viewer","particip","in","De","La","Sall","'s","philosophi","and","experi","of","team","throughout","the","season",".","The","viewer","wit","firsthand","the","amount","of","time",",","dedic","and","commit","that","is","requir","to","excel",",","and","begin","to","discov","a","love","which","elev","the","Spartan","abov","physic","stronger",",","faster","and","more","talent","oppon",".","All","preconceiv","notion","of","high","school","footbal","are","quick","lost",",","as","the","viewer","begin","to","question","the","import","of","be","#","1","while","begin","to","understand","the","power","of","be","1","."],"lemmas":["De","La","Salle","be","the","#","1","high","school","football","team","in","the","nation","and","have","be","for","5","year",".","have","win","151","straight","game","and","counting",",","De","La","Salle","have","the","longest","winning","streak","in","the","history","of","football",".","what","De","La","Salle","be","not",",","be","a","series","of","x","'s","and","o","'s",".","1","be","a","feature","length","documentary","that","chronicle","a","truly","remarkable","community",",","illustrate","by","one","of","the","most","significant","sport","story","of","modern","time",".","many","know","that","the","De","La","Salle","Spartans","be","a","high","school","football","team","-","second","to","none",".","what","people","do","not","know","be","that","this","accomplishment","be","the","result","of","a","yearly","journey","to","become","a","cohesive","community","bind","by","love",".","through","the","lens","of","first-time","filmmaker",",","the","audience","share","a","never-before-seen",",","behind-the-scenes","look","at","a","unparalleled","story",",","team","and","community",".","over","the","course","of","a","hour","and","a","half",",","the","viewer","participate","in","De","La","Salle","'s","philosophy","and","experience","of","team","throughout","the","season",".","the","viewer","witness","firsthand","the","amount","of","time",",","dedication","and","commitment","that","be","require","to","excel",",","and","begin","to","discover","a","love","which","elevate","the","Spartans","above","physically","stronger",",","faster","and","more","talented","opponent",".","all","preconceived","notion","of","high","school","football","be","quickly","lose",",","as","the","viewer","begin","to","question","the","importance","of","be","#","1","while","begin","to","understand","the","power","of","be","1","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["De La Salle","La Salle is","Salle is the","is the #","the #

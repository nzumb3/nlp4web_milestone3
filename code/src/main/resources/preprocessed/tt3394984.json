{"title":"Bulgaria, This Eternal Heresy","plot":"A heretic film about life outside of the System, made outside of the System. This is a fictional documentary, musical anthropological, scientific magical, eco anarchic utopian journey in a landscape of 8 parts. You're Kaloyan, the sax player. Or Diana, the Gypsy dancer. You journey together through Bulgaria in search of the utopian village Dolphinovo. It's not Sofia, Paris or New York. That's why this story is rural, rustic and polyphonic. It's like a string of painted walls of village houses, folk songs and allegories. However, who is Ivo? And why does he lead you through these winter landscapes a year later?","genres":["Adventure"," Drama","

{"title":"Coraline","plot":"When Coraline moves to an old house, she feels bored and neglected by her parents. She finds a hidden door with a bricked up passage. During the night, she crosses the passage and finds a parallel world where everybody has buttons instead of eyes, with caring parents and all her dreams coming true. When the Other Mother invites Coraline to stay in her world forever, the girl refuses and finds that the alternate reality where she is trapped is only a trick to lure her.","genres":["Animation"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["When","Coralin","move","to","an","old","hous",",","she","feel","bore","and","neglect","by","her","parent",".","She","find","a","hidden","door","with","a","brick","up","passag",".","Dure","the","night",",","she","cross","the","passag","and","find","a","parallel","world","where","everybodi","has","button","instead","of","eye",",","with","care","parent","and","all","her","dream","come","true",".","When","the","Other","Mother","invit","Coralin","to","stay","in","her","world","forev",",","the","girl","refus","and","find","that","the","altern","realiti","where","she","is","trap","is","onli","a","trick","to","lure","her","."],"lemmas":["when","Coraline","move","to","a","old","house",",","she","feel","bore","and","neglect","by","she","parent",".","she","find","a","hidden","door","with","a","brick","up","passage",".","during","the","night",",","she","cross","the","passage","and","find","a","parallel","world","where","everybody","have","button","instead","of","eye",",","with","care","parent","and","all","she","dream","come","true",".","when","the","Other","Mother","invite","Coraline","to","stay","in","she","world","forever",",","the","girl","refuse","and","find","that","the","alternate","reality","where","she","be","trap","be","only","a","trick","to","lure","she","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["When Coraline moves","Coraline moves to","moves to an","to an old","an old house","old house ,","house , she",", she feels","she feels bored","feels bored and","bored and neglected","and neglected by","neglected by her","by her parents","She finds a","finds a hidden","a hidden door","hidden door with","door with a","with a bricked","a bricked up","bricked up passage","During the night","the night ,","night , she",", she crosses","she crosses the","crosses the passage","the passage and","passage and finds","and finds a","finds a parallel","a parallel world","parallel world where","world where everybody","where everybody has","everybody has buttons","has buttons instead","buttons instead of","instead of eyes","of eyes ,","eyes , with",", with caring","with caring parents","caring parents and","parents and all","and all her","all her dreams","her dreams coming","dreams coming true","When the Other","the Other Mother","Other Mother invites","Mother invites Coraline","invites Coraline to","Coraline to stay","to stay in","stay in her","in her world","her world forever","world forever ,","forever , the",", the girl","the girl refuses","girl refuses and","refuses and finds","and finds that","finds that the","that the alternate","the alternate reality","alternate reality where","reality where she","where she is","she is trapped","is trapped is","trapped is only","is only a","only a trick","a trick to","trick to lure","to lure her"],"2grams":["When Coraline","Coraline moves","moves to","to an","an old","old house","house ,",", she","she feels","feels bored","bored and","and neglected","neglected by","by her","her parents","She finds","finds a","a hidden","hidden door","door with","with a","a bricked","bricked up","up passage","During the","the night","night ,",", she","she crosses","crosses the","the passage","passage and","and finds","finds a","a parallel","parallel world","world where","where everybody","everybody has","has buttons","buttons instead","instead of","of eyes","eyes ,",", with","with caring","caring parents","parents and","and all","all her","her dreams","dreams coming","coming true","When the","the Other","Other Mother","Mother invites","invites Coraline","Coraline to","to stay","stay in","in her","her world","world forever","forever ,",", the","the girl","girl refuses","refuses and","and finds","finds that","that the","the alternate","alternate reality","reality where","where she","she is","is trapped","trapped is","is only","only a","a trick","trick to","to lure","lure her"]}

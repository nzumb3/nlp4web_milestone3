{"title":"Four Nights with Anna","plot":"A worker, Leon, is deeply in love with Anna. (None of them are really young). During night time Leon will enter an open window and merely be sitting and looking at the sleeping Anna. He may also paint her toenails with nail polish. - Since he may also in daytime use different ways of being secretly near her, he is near in the barn, when another man binds her and rapes her. But here Leon makes a great mistake. He leaves the barn immediately after the rapist - almost as if they were together. Leon is the only one Anna could recognize. In the court he gives primitive answers. Why did he do it? \"Love.\" He gets a 5-year prison sentence. - In a pause, maybe in an appellate court, Anna says to Leon, that she does not believe that he did it.","genres":["Crime"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["A","worker",",","Leon",",","is","deepli","in","love","with","Anna",".","(","None","of","them","are","realli","young",")",".","Dure","night","time","Leon","will","enter","an","open","window","and","mere","be","sit","and","look","at","the","sleep","Anna",".","He","may","also","paint","her","toenail","with","nail","polish",".","-","Sinc","he","may","also","in","daytim","use","differ","way","of","be","secret","near","her",",","he","is","near","in","the","barn",",","when","anoth","man","bind","her","and","rape","her",".","But","here","Leon","make","a","great","mistak",".","He","leav","the","barn","immedi","after","the","rapist","-","almost","as","if","they","were","togeth",".","Leon","is","the","onli","one","Anna","could","recogn",".","In","the","court","he","give","primit","answer",".","Whi","did","he","do","it","?","\"","Love",".","\"","He","get","a","5-year","prison","sentenc",".","-","In","a","paus",",","mayb","in","an","appel","court",",","Anna","say","to","Leon",",","that","she","doe","not","believ","that","he","did","it","."],"lemmas":["a","worker",",","Leon",",","be","deeply","in","love","with","Anna",".","-lrb-","none","of","they","be","really","young","-rrb-",".","during","night","time","Leon","will","enter","a","open","window","and","merely","be","sit","and","look","at","the","sleep","Anna",".","he","may","also","paint","she","toenail","with","nail","polish",".","-","since","he","may","also","in","daytime","use","different","way","of","be","secretly","near","she",",","he","be","near","in","the","barn",",","when","another","man","bind","she","and","rape","she",".","but","here","Leon","make","a","great","mistake",".","he","leave","the","barn","immediately","after","the","rapist","-","almost","as","if","they","be","together",".","Leon","be","the","only","one","Anna","could","recognize",".","in","the","court","he","give","primitive","answer",".","why","do","he","do","it","?","``","love",".","''","he","get","a","5-year","prison","sentence",".","-","in","a","pause",",","maybe","in","a","appellate","court",",","Anna","say","to","Leon",",","that","she","do","not","believe","that","he","do","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A worker ,","worker , Leon",", Leon ,","Leon , is",", is deeply","is deeply in","deeply in love","in love with","love with Anna","( None of","None of them","of them are","them are really","are really young","really young )","During night time","night time Leon","time Leon will","Leon will enter","will enter an","enter an open","an open window","open window and","window and merely","and merely be","merely be sitting","be sitting and","sitting and looking","and looking at","looking at the","at the sleeping","the sleeping Anna","He may also","may also paint","also paint her","paint her toenails","her toenails with","toenails with nail","with nail polish","- Since he","Since he may","he may also","may also in","also in daytime","in daytime use","daytime use different","use different ways","different ways of","ways of being","of being secretly","being secretly near","secretly near her","near her ,","her , he",", he is","he is near","is near in","near in the","in the barn","the barn ,","barn , when",", when another","when another man","another man binds","man binds her","binds her and","her and rapes","and rapes her","But here Leon","here Leon makes","Leon makes a","makes a great","a great mistake","He leaves the","leaves the barn","the barn immediately","barn immediately after","immediately after the","after the rapist","the rapist -","rapist -

{"title":"Saxon","plot":"Soon after leaving prison, EDDIE has his eye cut out by a loan shark chasing an old debt. Eddie's other eye will only be spared upon repayment. Desperate for cash, Eddie phones LINDA, a childhood sweetheart. She lives in Saxon - a nightmare sprawl of boarded-up and crumbling flats run by a corrupt council. But Linda is very wealthy. Her husband won a million pounds on a TV quiz show. She draws Eddie back to Saxon: the place where he grew up; the place where his mother works as a prostitute; the place where he murdered a bailiff. When Eddie arrives, Linda offers him a reward to find her missing husband whom she fears dead. Eddie turns amateur investigator and so embarks on a comically gruesome journey through a surreal underworld.","genres":["Comedy"," Mystery"," Drama"],"stems":["Soon","after","leav","prison",",","EDDIE","has","his","eye","cut","out","by","a","loan","shark","chase","an","old","debt",".","Eddie","'s","other","eye","will","onli","be","spare","upon","repay",".","Desper","for","cash",",","Eddie","phone","LINDA",",","a","childhood","sweetheart",".","She","live","in","Saxon","-","a","nightmar","sprawl","of","boarded-up","and","crumbl","flat","run","by","a","corrupt","council",".","But","Linda","is","veri","wealthi",".","Her","husband","won","a","million","pound","on","a","TV","quiz","show",".","She","draw","Eddie","back","to","Saxon",":","the","place","where","he","grew","up",";","the","place","where","his","mother","work","as","a","prostitut",";","the","place","where","he","murder","a","bailiff",".","When","Eddie","arriv",",","Linda","offer","him","a","reward","to","find","her","miss","husband","whom","she","fear","dead",".","Eddie","turn","amateur","investig","and","so","embark","on","a","comic","gruesom","journey","through","a","surreal","underworld","."],"lemmas":["soon","after","leave","prison",",","EDDIE","have","he","eye","cut","out","by","a","loan","shark","chase","a","old","debt",".","Eddie","'s","other","eye","will","only","be","spare","upon","repayment",".","desperate","for","cash",",","Eddie","phone","LINDA",",","a","childhood","sweetheart",".","she","live","in","Saxon","-","a","nightmare","sprawl","of","boarded-up","and","crumble","flat","run","by","a","corrupt","council",".","but","Linda","be","very","wealthy",".","she","husband","win","a","million","pound","on","a","tv","quiz","show",".","she","draw","Eddie","back","to","Saxon",":","the","place","where","he","grow","up",";","the","place","where","he","mother","work","as","a","prostitute",";","the","place","where","he","murder","a","bailiff",".","when","Eddie","arrive",",","Linda","offer","he","a","reward","to","find","she","miss","husband","whom","she","fear","dead",".","Eddie","turn","amateur","investigator","and","so","embark","on","a","comically","gruesome","journey","through","a","surreal","underworld","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Soon after leaving","after leaving prison","leaving prison ,","prison , EDDIE",", EDDIE has","EDDIE has his","has his eye","his eye cut","eye cut out","cut out by","out by a","by a loan","a loan shark","loan shark chasing","shark chasing an","chasing an old","an old debt","Eddie 's other","'s other eye","other eye will","eye will only","will only be","only be spared","be spared upon","spared upon repayment","Desperate for cash","for cash ,","cash , Eddie",", Eddie phones","Eddie phones LINDA","phones LINDA ,","LINDA , a",", a childhood","a childhood sweetheart","She lives in","lives in Saxon","in Saxon -","Saxon - a","- a nightmare","a nightmare sprawl","nightmare sprawl of","sprawl of boarded-up","of boarded-up and","boarded-up and crumbling","and crumbling flats","crumbling flats run","flats run by","run by a","by a corrupt","a corrupt council","But Linda is","Linda is very","is very wealthy","Her husband won","husband won a","won a million","a million pounds","million pounds on","pounds on a","on a TV","a TV quiz","TV quiz show","She draws Eddie","draws Eddie back","Eddie back to","back to Saxon","to Saxon :","Saxon : the",": the place","the place where","place where he","where he grew","he grew up","grew up ;","up ;

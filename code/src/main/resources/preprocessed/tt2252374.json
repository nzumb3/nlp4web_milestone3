{"title":"LowerTown Paducah","plot":"Paducah, Kentucky is a charming river town in the heart of America. Its LowerTown district is a place where artists from all over the country moved into beautiful old houses, revitalizing a troubled neighborhood with the largest Artist Relocation Program ever. From an egg carver, to a print maker, to a sculptural ceramicist, to an art quilt master, this documentary combines artist profiles with interviews and archival photos to explore city history and the tradition of quilting in America. Lush cinematography meets a diverse music score by composer/performer Josh Coffey (of \"Bawn in the Mash\") in this first feature-length documentary by award-winning filmmaker H. Paul Moon.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Paducah",",","Kentucki","is","a","charm","river","town","in","the","heart","of","America",".","Its","LowerTown","district","is","a","place","where","artist","from","all","over","the","countri","move","into","beauti","old","hous",",","revit","a","troubl","neighborhood","with","the","largest","Artist","Reloc","Program","ever",".","From","an","egg","carver",",","to","a","print","maker",",","to","a","sculptur","ceramicist",",","to","an","art","quilt","master",",","this","documentari","combin","artist","profil","with","interview","and","archiv","photo","to","explor","citi","histori","and","the","tradit","of","quilt","in","America",".","Lush","cinematographi","meet","a","divers","music","score","by","composer/perform","Josh","Coffey","(","of","\"","Bawn","in","the","Mash","\"",")","in","this","first","feature-length","documentari","by","award-win","filmmak","H.","Paul","Moon","."],"lemmas":["Paducah",",","Kentucky","be","a","charming","river","town","in","the","heart","of","America",".","its","LowerTown","district","be","a","place","where","artist","from","all","over","the","country","move","into","beautiful","old","house",",","revitalize","a","troubled","neighborhood","with","the","largest","Artist","Relocation","Program","ever",".","from","a","egg","carver",",","to","a","print","maker",",","to","a","sculptural","ceramicist",",","to","a","art","quilt","master",",","this","documentary","combine","artist","profile","with","interview","and","archival","photo","to","explore","city","history","and","the","tradition","of","quilting","in","America",".","lush","cinematography","meet","a","diverse","music","score","by","composer/performer","Josh","Coffey","-lrb-","of","``","Bawn","in","the","Mash","''","-rrb-","in","this","first","feature-length","documentary","by","award-winning","filmmaker","H.","Paul","Moon","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Paducah , Kentucky",", Kentucky is","Kentucky is a","is a charming","a charming river","charming river town","river town in","town in the","in the heart","the heart of","heart of America","Its LowerTown district","LowerTown district is","district is a","is a place","a place where","place where artists","where artists from","artists from all","from all over","all over the","over the country","the country moved","country moved into","moved into beautiful","into beautiful old","beautiful old houses","old houses ,","houses , revitalizing",", revitalizing a","revitalizing a troubled","a troubled neighborhood","troubled neighborhood with","neighborhood with the","with the largest","the largest Artist","largest Artist Relocation","Artist Relocation Program","Relocation Program ever","From an egg","an egg carver","egg carver ,","carver , to",", to a","to a print","a print maker","print maker ,","maker , to",", to a","to a sculptural","a sculptural ceramicist","sculptural ceramicist ,","ceramicist , to",", to an","to an art","an art quilt","art quilt master","quilt master ,","master , this",", this documentary","this documentary combines","documentary combines artist","combines artist profiles","artist profiles with","profiles with interviews","with interviews and","interviews and archival","and archival photos","archival photos to","photos to explore","to explore city","explore city history","city history and","history and the","and the tradition","the tradition of","tradition of quilting","of quilting in","quilting in America","Lush cinematography meets","cinematography meets a","meets a diverse","a diverse music","diverse music score","music score by","score by composer/performer","by composer/performer Josh","composer/performer Josh Coffey","Josh Coffey (","Coffey ( of","( of \"","of \" Bawn","\" Bawn in","Bawn in the","in the Mash","the Mash \"","Mash \" )","\" ) in",") in this","in this first","this first feature-length","first feature-length documentary","feature-length documentary by","documentary by award-winning","by award-winning filmmaker","award-winning filmmaker H.","filmmaker H.

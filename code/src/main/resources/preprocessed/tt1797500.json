{"title":"Survivor Stories","plot":"Most everyone knows that Hitler was a liar-and his lies about the Jewish people cost six million lives. Those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust have compelling stories that must be heard to counter current lies about what did or did not happen. We have the true stories of survivors whose inspiring experiences challenge yet another lie: that the Holocaust was perpetrated because of Christianity. The Nazi shadow has darkened the Jewish view of Jesus for too long. Now you can hear/read the stories of Jewish men and women who survived the Holocaust and found amazing hope and healing in Jesus.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Most","everyon","know","that","Hitler","was","a","liar-and","his","lie","about","the","Jewish","peopl","cost","six","million","live",".","Those","who","surviv","the","horror","of","the","Holocaust","have","compel","stori","that","must","be","heard","to","counter","current","lie","about","what","did","or","did","not","happen",".","We","have","the","true","stori","of","survivor","whose","inspir","experi","challeng","yet","anoth","lie",":","that","the","Holocaust","was","perpetr","becaus","of","Christian",".","The","Nazi","shadow","has","darken","the","Jewish","view","of","Jesus","for","too","long",".","Now","you","can","hear/read","the","stori","of","Jewish","men","and","women","who","surviv","the","Holocaust","and","found","amaz","hope","and","heal","in","Jesus","."],"lemmas":["most","everyone","know","that","Hitler","be","a","liar-and","he","lie","about","the","jewish","people","cost","six","million","life",".","those","who","survive","the","horror","of","the","Holocaust","have","compelling","story","that","must","be","hear","to","counter","current","lie","about","what","do","or","do","not","happen",".","we","have","the","true","story","of","survivor","whose","inspiring","experience","challenge","yet","another","lie",":","that","the","Holocaust","be","perpetrate","because","of","Christianity",".","the","Nazi","shadow","have","darken","the","jewish","view","of","Jesus","for","too","long",".","now","you","can","hear/read","the","story","of","jewish","man","and","woman","who","survive","the","Holocaust","and","find","amazing","hope","and","healing","in","Jesus","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Most everyone knows","everyone knows that","knows that Hitler","that Hitler was","Hitler was a","was a liar-and","a liar-and his","liar-and his lies","his lies about","lies about the","about the Jewish","the Jewish people","Jewish people cost","people cost six","cost six million","six million lives","Those who survived","who survived the","survived the horrors","the horrors of","horrors of the","of the Holocaust","the Holocaust have","Holocaust have compelling","have compelling stories","compelling stories that","stories that must","that must be","must be heard","be heard to","heard to counter","to counter current","counter current lies","current lies about","lies about what","about what did","what did or","did or did","or did not","did not happen","We have the","have the true","the true stories","true stories of","stories of survivors","of survivors whose","survivors whose inspiring","whose inspiring experiences","inspiring experiences challenge","experiences challenge yet","challenge yet another","yet another lie","another lie :","lie : that",": that the","that the Holocaust","the Holocaust was","Holocaust was perpetrated","was perpetrated because","perpetrated because of","because of Christianity","The Nazi shadow","Nazi shadow has","shadow has darkened","has darkened the","darkened the Jewish","the Jewish view","Jewish view of","view of Jesus","of Jesus for","Jesus for too","for too long","Now you can","you can hear/read","can hear/read the","hear/read the stories","the stories of","stories of Jewish","of Jewish men","Jewish men and","men and women","and women who","women who survived","who survived the","survived the Holocaust","the Holocaust and","Holocaust and found","and found amazing","found amazing hope","amazing hope and","hope and healing","and healing in","healing in Jesus"],"2grams":["Most everyone","everyone knows","knows that","that Hitler","Hitler was","was a","a liar-and","liar-and his","his lies","lies about","about the","the Jewish","Jewish people","people cost","cost six","six million","million lives","Those who","who survived","survived the","the horrors","horrors of","of the","the Holocaust","Holocaust have","have compelling","compelling stories","stories that","that must","must be","be heard","heard to","to counter","counter current","current lies","lies about","about what","what did","did or","or did","did not","not happen","We have","have the","the true","true stories","stories of","of survivors","survivors whose","whose inspiring","inspiring experiences","experiences challenge","challenge yet","yet another","another lie","lie :",": that","that the","the Holocaust","Holocaust was","was perpetrated","perpetrated because","because of","of Christianity","The Nazi","Nazi shadow","shadow has","has darkened","darkened the","the Jewish","Jewish view","view of","of Jesus","Jesus for","for too","too long","Now you","you can","can hear/read","hear/read the","the stories","stories of","of Jewish","Jewish men","men and","and women","women who","who survived","survived the","the Holocaust","Holocaust and","and found","found amazing","amazing hope","hope and","and healing","healing in","in Jesus"]}

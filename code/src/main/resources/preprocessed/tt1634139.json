{"title":"Soldiers of Paint","plot":"Join 4,000 participants as they restage D-Day, the notorious 6th of June invasion of Normandy. Instead of bullets, it's paintball; instead of the French coast, it's Oklahoma. And, every year, it's any man's game, which means the Germans could win! Staged on a 700-acre battlefield owned by the grand-son of a veteran of Omaha Beach, this yearly battle of paint is fought as a tribute to all veterans. These paintball soldiers take \"gung ho\" to an all-time high, utilizing real tanks and airplanes for this epic fight.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"," History"],"stems":["Join","4,000","particip","as","they","restag","D-Day",",","the","notori","6th","of","June","invas","of","Normandi",".","Instead","of","bullet",",","it","'s","paintbal",";","instead","of","the","French","coast",",","it","'s","Oklahoma",".","And",",","everi","year",",","it","'s","ani","man","'s","game",",","which","mean","the","German","could","win","!","Stage","on","a","700-acr","battlefield","own","by","the","grand-son","of","a","veteran","of","Omaha","Beach",",","this","year","battl","of","paint","is","fought","as","a","tribut","to","all","veteran",".","These","paintbal","soldier","take","\"","gung","ho","\"","to","an","all-tim","high",",","util","real","tank","and","airplan","for","this","epic","fight","."],"lemmas":["join","4,000","participant","as","they","restage","D-Day",",","the","notorious","6th","of","June","invasion","of","Normandy",".","instead","of","bullet",",","it","be","paintball",";","instead","of","the","french","coast",",","it","be","Oklahoma",".","and",",","every","year",",","it","be","any","man","'s","game",",","which","mean","the","Germans","could","win","!","stage","on","a","700-acre","battlefield","own","by","the","grand-son","of","a","veteran","of","Omaha","Beach",",","this","yearly","battle","of","paint","be","fight","as","a","tribute","to","all","veteran",".","these","paintball","soldier","take","``","gung","ho","''","to","a","all-time","high",",","utilize","real","tank","and","airplane","for","this","epic","fight","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Join 4,000 participants","4,000 participants as","participants as they","as they restage","they restage D-Day","restage D-Day ,","D-Day , the",", the notorious","the notorious 6th","notorious 6th of","6th of June","of June invasion","June invasion of","invasion of Normandy","Instead of bullets","of bullets ,","bullets , it",", it 's","it 's paintball","'s paintball ;","paintball ; instead","; instead of","instead of the","of the French","the French coast","French coast ,","coast , it",", it 's","it 's Oklahoma","And , every",", every year","every year ,","year , it",", it 's","it 's any","'s any man","any man 's","man 's game","'s game ,","game , which",", which means","which means the","means the Germans","the Germans could","Germans could win","Staged on a","on a 700-acre","a 700-acre battlefield","700-acre battlefield owned","battlefield owned by","owned by the","by the grand-son","the grand-son of","grand-son of a","of a veteran","a veteran of","veteran of Omaha","of Omaha Beach","Omaha Beach ,","Beach , this",", this yearly","this yearly battle","yearly battle of","battle of paint","of paint is","paint is fought","is fought as","fought as a","as a tribute","a tribute to","tribute to all","to all veterans","These paintball soldiers","paintball soldiers take","soldiers take \"","take \" gung","\" gung ho","gung ho \"","ho \" to","\" to an","to an all-time","an all-time high","all-time high ,","high , utilizing",", utilizing real","utilizing real tanks","real tanks and","tanks and airplanes","and airplanes for","airplanes for this","for this epic","this epic fight"],"2grams":["Join 4,000","4,000 participants","participants as","as they","they restage","restage D-Day","D-Day ,",", the","the notorious","notorious 6th","6th of","of June","June invasion","invasion of","of Normandy","Instead of","of bullets","bullets ,",", it","it 's","'s paintball","paintball ;","; instead","instead of","of the","the French","French coast","coast ,",", it","it 's","'s Oklahoma","And ,",", every","every year","year ,",", it","it 's","'s any","any man","man 's","'s game","game ,",", which","which means","means the","the Germans","Germans could","could win","Staged on","on a","a 700-acre","700-acre battlefield","battlefield owned","owned by","by the","the grand-son","grand-son of","of a","a veteran","veteran of","of Omaha","Omaha Beach","Beach ,",", this","this yearly","yearly battle","battle of","of paint","paint is","is fought","fought as","as a","a tribute","tribute to","to all","all veterans","These paintball","paintball soldiers","soldiers take","take \"","\" gung","gung ho","ho \"","\" to","to an","an all-time","all-time high","high ,",", utilizing","utilizing real","real tanks","tanks and","and airplanes","airplanes for","for this","this epic","epic fight"]}

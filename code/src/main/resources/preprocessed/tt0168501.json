{"title":"The Best Man","plot":"Harper's autobiographical novel is almost out, his girlfriend Robin desires commitment, and he's best man at the wedding of Lance, a pro athlete. He goes to New York early (Robin will come for the wedding) to hang out with Lance and other friends, including Jordan, his former almost-lover, now in media and privy to an advance copy of the book. The men discuss women, never facing their own double standard; Jordan wants to try again with Harper, at least for one night; and Harper fears that Lance will read his book and learn that the bride-to-be slept with him once to avenge Lance's many affairs. Can Harper mature before Lance kills him, Jordan seduces him, and he loses Robin?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Harper","'s","autobiograph","novel","is","almost","out",",","his","girlfriend","Robin","desir","commit",",","and","he","'s","best","man","at","the","wed","of","Lanc",",","a","pro","athlet",".","He","goe","to","New","York","earli","(","Robin","will","come","for","the","wed",")","to","hang","out","with","Lanc","and","other","friend",",","includ","Jordan",",","his","former","almost-lov",",","now","in","media","and","privi","to","an","advanc","copi","of","the","book",".","The","men","discuss","women",",","never","face","their","own","doubl","standard",";","Jordan","want","to","tri","again","with","Harper",",","at","least","for","one","night",";","and","Harper","fear","that","Lanc","will","read","his","book","and","learn","that","the","bride-to-b","slept","with","him","onc","to","aveng","Lanc","'s","mani","affair",".","Can","Harper","matur","befor","Lanc","kill","him",",","Jordan","seduc","him",",","and","he","lose","Robin","?"],"lemmas":["Harper","'s","autobiographical","novel","be","almost","out",",","he","girlfriend","Robin","desire","commitment",",","and","he","be","best","man","at","the","wedding","of","Lance",",","a","pro","athlete",".","he","go","to","New","York","early","-lrb-","Robin","will","come","for","the","wedding","-rrb-","to","hang","out","with","Lance","and","other","friend",",","include","Jordan",",","he","former","almost-lover",",","now","in","media","and","privy","to","a","advance","copy","of","the","book",".","the","man","discuss","woman",",","never","face","they","own","double","standard",";","Jordan","want","to","try","again","with","Harper",",","at","least","for","one","night",";","and","Harper","fear","that","Lance","will","read","he","book","and","learn","that","the","bride-to-be","sleep","with","he","once","to","avenge","Lance","'s","many","affair",".","can","Harper","mature","before","Lance","kill","he",",","Jordan","seduce","he",",","and","he","lose","Robin","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harper 's autobiographical","'s autobiographical novel","autobiographical novel is","novel is almost","is almost out","almost out ,","out , his",", his girlfriend","his girlfriend Robin","girlfriend Robin desires","Robin desires commitment","desires commitment ,","commitment , and",", and he","and he 's","he 's best","'s best man","best man at","man at the","at the wedding","the wedding of","wedding of Lance","of Lance ,","Lance , a",", a pro","a pro athlete","He goes to","goes to New","to New York","New York early","York early (","early ( Robin","( Robin will","Robin will come","will come for","come for the","for the wedding","the wedding )","wedding ) to",") to hang","to hang out","hang out with","out with Lance","with Lance and","Lance and other","and other friends","other friends ,","friends , including",", including Jordan","including Jordan ,","Jordan , his",", his former","his former almost-lover","former almost-lover ,","almost-lover , now",", now in","now in media","in media and","media and privy","and privy to","privy to an","to an advance","an advance copy","advance copy of","copy of the","of the book","The men discuss","men discuss women","discuss women ,","women , never",", never facing","never facing their","facing their own","their own double","own double standard","double standard ;","standard ;

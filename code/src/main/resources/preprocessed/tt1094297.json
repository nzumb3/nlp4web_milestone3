{"title":"Grapes on a Vine","plot":"Kyle is the art director at the High Museum in Atlanta Georgia. He wants two things in life, a male child and a van Gogh painting valued at 275,000. His wife Brandy cannot conceive so he plans a camping trip where he will have her killed and hung to make it look like a racially motivated killing so he can collect the 500,00 insurance policy which will enable him to get what he wants. Of course, things don't go as planned.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Kyle","is","the","art","director","at","the","High","Museum","in","Atlanta","Georgia",".","He","want","two","thing","in","life",",","a","male","child","and","a","van","Gogh","paint","valu","at","275,000",".","His","wife","Brandi","can","not","conceiv","so","he","plan","a","camp","trip","where","he","will","have","her","kill","and","hung","to","make","it","look","like","a","racial","motiv","kill","so","he","can","collect","the","500,00","insur","polici","which","will","enabl","him","to","get","what","he","want",".","Of","cours",",","thing","do","n't","go","as","plan","."],"lemmas":["Kyle","be","the","art","director","at","the","High","Museum","in","Atlanta","Georgia",".","he","want","two","thing","in","life",",","a","male","child","and","a","van","Gogh","painting","value","at","275,000",".","he","wife","Brandy","can","not","conceive","so","he","plan","a","camping","trip","where","he","will","have","she","kill","and","hang","to","make","it","look","like","a","racially","motivated","killing","so","he","can","collect","the","500,00","insurance","policy","which","will","enable","he","to","get","what","he","want",".","of","course",",","thing","do","not","go","as","plan","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kyle is the","is the art","the art director","art director at","director at the","at the High","the High Museum","High Museum in","Museum in Atlanta","in Atlanta Georgia","He wants two","wants two things","two things in","things in life","in life ,","life , a",", a male","a male child","male child and","child and a","and a van","a van Gogh","van Gogh painting","Gogh painting valued","painting valued at","valued at 275,000","His wife Brandy","wife Brandy can","Brandy can not","can not conceive","not conceive so","conceive so he","so he plans","he plans a","plans a camping","a camping trip","camping trip where","trip where he","where he will","he will have","will have her","have her killed","her killed and","killed and hung","and hung to","hung to make","to make it","make it look","it look like","look like a","like a racially","a racially motivated","racially motivated killing","motivated killing so","killing so he","so he can","he can collect","can collect the","collect the 500,00","the 500,00 insurance","500,00 insurance policy","insurance policy which","policy which will","which will enable","will enable him","enable him to","him to get","to get what","get what he","what he wants","Of course ,","course , things",", things do","things do n't","do n't go","n't go as","go as planned"],"2grams":["Kyle is","is the","the art","art director","director at","at the","the High","High Museum","Museum in","in Atlanta","Atlanta Georgia","He wants","wants two","two things","things in","in life","life ,",", a","a male","male child","child and","and a","a van","van Gogh","Gogh painting","painting valued","valued at","at 275,000","His wife","wife Brandy","Brandy can","can not","not conceive","conceive so","so he","he plans","plans a","a camping","camping trip","trip where","where he","he will","will have","have her","her killed","killed and","and hung","hung to","to make","make it","it look","look like","like a","a racially","racially motivated","motivated killing","killing so","so he","he can","can collect","collect the","the 500,00","500,00 insurance","insurance policy","policy which","which will","will enable","enable him","him to","to get","get what","what he","he wants","Of course","course ,",", things","things do","do n't","n't go","go as","as planned"]}

{"title":"The Last Will","plot":"Bartul Burt Marinkovich, a Croatian emigree-turned millionaire, dies and unexpectedly leaves his millions not to his beautiful young wife, Nicole, but to his heretofore unknown, illegitimate nephew, Bepo Stambuk, who is living in Bol on the island of Brac. This is Marinkovich's posthumous revenge on Nicole for his discovery that she has been having a long-standing affair with his personal secretary, Douglas Caine. A young lawyer of Croatian descent named Elisabeth Horvath is assigned to find Bepo and transfer his inheritance to him, but at the same time, Nicole and Caine hire two assassins to go to Brac and kill Marinkovich's heir. When Horvath and the two assassins arrive, they discover independently that there are three men in Bol named Bepo Stambuk, and must figure out which is the right one.","genres":["Action"," Romance","

{"title":"Gelecekten Bir Gün","plot":"Tolga (Hayrettin Karaoguz), having struggled with bad luck all his life, believes he is a total loser and the unluckiest man in the whole world. Following an unsuccessful presentation of his new project at work, he is fired. Believing he has ruined his last chance to win over the love of his life (Hande Subasi), he commits suicide. After he dies, he is met by two angels (Rasim Öztekin and Arda Kural), who, as a punishment, show Tolga scenes from how his life would have been in the future if he had not committed suicide.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Tolga","(","Hayrettin","Karaoguz",")",",","have","struggl","with","bad","luck","all","his","life",",","believ","he","is","a","total","loser","and","the","unluckiest","man","in","the","whole","world",".","Follow","an","unsuccess","present","of","his","new","project","at","work",",","he","is","fire",".","Believ","he","has","ruin","his","last","chanc","to","win","over","the","love","of","his","life","(","Hand","Subasi",")",",","he","commit","suicid",".","After","he","die",",","he","is","met","by","two","angel","(","Rasim","Öztekin","and","Arda","Kural",")",",","who",",","as","a","punish",",","show","Tolga","scene","from","how","his","life","would","have","been","in","the","futur","if","he","had","not","commit","suicid","."],"lemmas":["Tolga","-lrb-","Hayrettin","Karaoguz","-rrb-",",","have","struggle","with","bad","luck","all","he","life",",","believe","he","be","a","total","loser","and","the","unluckiest","man","in","the","whole","world",".","follow","a","unsuccessful","presentation","of","he","new","project","at","work",",","he","be","fire",".","believe","he","have","ruin","he","last","chance","to","win","over","the","love","of","he","life","-lrb-","hande","subasi","-rrb-",",","he","commit","suicide",".","after","he","die",",","he","be","meet","by","two","angel","-lrb-","Rasim","Öztekin","and","Arda","Kural","-rrb-",",","who",",","as","a","punishment",",","show","Tolga","scene","from","how","he","life","would","have","be","in","the","future","if","he","have","not","commit","suicide","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tolga ( Hayrettin","( Hayrettin Karaoguz","Hayrettin Karaoguz )","Karaoguz ) ,",") , having",", having struggled","having struggled with","struggled with bad","with bad luck","bad luck all","luck all his","all his life","his life ,","life , believes",", believes he","believes he is","he is a","is a total","a total loser","total loser and","loser and the","and the unluckiest","the unluckiest man","unluckiest man in","man in the","in the whole","the whole world","Following an unsuccessful","an unsuccessful presentation","unsuccessful presentation of","presentation of his","of his new","his new project","new project at","project at work","at work ,","work , he",", he is","he is fired","Believing he has","he has ruined","has ruined his","ruined his last","his last chance","last chance to","chance to win","to win over","win over the","over the love","the love of","love of his","of his life","his life (","life ( Hande","( Hande Subasi","Hande Subasi )","Subasi ) ,",") , he",", he commits","he commits suicide","After he dies","he dies ,","dies , he",", he is","he is met","is met by","met by two","by two angels","two angels (","angels ( Rasim","( Rasim Öztekin","Rasim Öztekin and","Öztekin and Arda","and Arda Kural","Arda Kural )","Kural ) ,",") , who",", who ,","who , as",", as a","as a punishment","a punishment ,","punishment , show",", show Tolga","show Tolga scenes","Tolga scenes from","scenes from how","from how his","how his life","his life would","life would have","would have been","have been in","been in the","in the future","the future if","future if he","if he had","he had not","had not committed","not committed suicide"],"2grams":["Tolga (","( Hayrettin","Hayrettin Karaoguz","Karaoguz )",") ,",", having","having struggled","struggled with","with bad","bad luck","luck all","all his","his life","life ,",", believes","believes he","he is","is a","a total","total loser","loser and","and the","the unluckiest","unluckiest man","man in","in the","the whole","whole world","Following an","an unsuccessful","unsuccessful presentation","presentation of","of his","his new","new project","project at","at work","work ,",", he","he is","is fired","Believing he","he has","has ruined","ruined his","his last","last chance","chance to","to win","win over","over the","the love","love of","of his","his life","life (","( Hande","Hande Subasi","Subasi )",") ,",", he","he commits","commits suicide","After he","he dies","dies ,",", he","he is","is met","met by","by two","two angels","angels (","( Rasim","Rasim Öztekin","Öztekin and","and Arda","Arda Kural","Kural )",") ,",", who","who ,",", as","as a","a punishment","punishment ,",", show","show Tolga","Tolga scenes","scenes from","from how","how his","his life","life would","would have","have been","been in","in the","the future","future if","if he","he had","had not","not committed","committed suicide"]}

{"title":"Setannya kok beneran?","plot":"With their career acting as ghost-busting paranormals in a fake reality show is about to end, the three phony losers accepted an invitation for a friendly meet and greet in a village out of town. At least a taste of being a celebrity before their television career is over. They did not realize that the villagers didn't invite them for a fan meet, instead to get rid of an angry ghost that's terrorizing the village. Trapped with nowhere else to go, our scared fake heroes are forced to deal with a real ghost, or everyone will know that they are nothing but impostors.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["With","their","career","act","as","ghost-bust","paranorm","in","a","fake","realiti","show","is","about","to","end",",","the","three","phoni","loser","accept","an","invit","for","a","friend","meet","and","greet","in","a","villag","out","of","town",".","At","least","a","tast","of","be","a","celebr","befor","their","televis","career","is","over",".","They","did","not","realiz","that","the","villag","did","n't","invit","them","for","a","fan","meet",",","instead","to","get","rid","of","an","angri","ghost","that","'s","terror","the","villag",".","Trap","with","nowher","els","to","go",",","our","scare","fake","hero","are","forc","to","deal","with","a","real","ghost",",","or","everyon","will","know","that","they","are","noth","but","impostor","."],"lemmas":["with","they","career","act","as","ghost-busting","paranormal","in","a","fake","reality","show","be","about","to","end",",","the","three","phony","loser","accept","a","invitation","for","a","friendly","meet","and","greet","in","a","village","out","of","town",".","at","least","a","taste","of","be","a","celebrity","before","they","television","career","be","over",".","they","do","not","realize","that","the","villager","do","not","invite","they","for","a","fan","meet",",","instead","to","get","rid","of","a","angry","ghost","that","be","terrorize","the","village",".","trap","with","nowhere","else","to","go",",","we","scared","fake","hero","be","force","to","deal","with","a","real","ghost",",","or","everyone","will","know","that","they","be","nothing","but","impostor","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["With their career","their career acting","career acting as","acting as ghost-busting","as ghost-busting paranormals","ghost-busting paranormals in","paranormals in a","in a fake","a fake reality","fake reality show","reality show is","show is about","is about to","about to end","to end ,","end , the",", the three","the three phony","three phony losers","phony losers accepted","losers accepted an","accepted an invitation","an invitation for","invitation for a","for a friendly","a friendly meet","friendly meet and","meet and greet","and greet in","greet in a","in a village","a village out","village out of","out of town","At least a","least a taste","a taste of","taste of being","of being a","being a celebrity","a celebrity before","celebrity before their","before their television","their television career","television career is","career is over","They did not","did not realize","not realize that","realize that the","that the villagers","the villagers did","villagers did n't","did n't invite","n't invite them","invite them for","them for a","for a fan","a fan meet","fan meet ,","meet , instead",", instead to","instead to get","to get rid","get rid of","rid of an","of an angry","an angry ghost","angry ghost that","ghost that 's","that 's terrorizing","'s terrorizing the","terrorizing the village","Trapped with nowhere","with nowhere else","nowhere else to","else to go","to go ,","go , our",", our scared","our scared fake","scared fake heroes","fake heroes are","heroes are forced","are forced to","forced to deal","to deal with","deal with a","with a real","a real ghost","real ghost ,","ghost , or",", or everyone","or everyone will","everyone will know","will know that","know that they","that they are","they are nothing","are nothing but","nothing but impostors"],"2grams":["With their","their career","career acting","acting as","as ghost-busting","ghost-busting paranormals","paranormals in","in a","a fake","fake reality","reality show","show is","is about","about to","to end","end ,",", the","the three","three phony","phony losers","losers accepted","accepted an","an invitation","invitation for","for a","a friendly","friendly meet","meet and","and greet","greet in","in a","a village","village out","out of","of town","At least","least a","a taste","taste of","of being","being a","a celebrity","celebrity before","before their","their television","television career","career is","is over","They did","did not","not realize","realize that","that the","the villagers","villagers did","did n't","n't invite","invite them","them for","for a","a fan","fan meet","meet ,",", instead","instead to","to get","get rid","rid of","of an","an angry","angry ghost","ghost that","that 's","'s terrorizing","terrorizing the","the village","Trapped with","with nowhere","nowhere else","else to","to go","go ,",", our","our scared","scared fake","fake heroes","heroes are","are forced","forced to","to deal","deal with","with a","a real","real ghost","ghost ,",", or","or everyone","everyone will","will know","know that","that they","they are","are nothing","nothing but","but impostors"]}

{"title":"Open Tables","plot":"Within the walls of the trendiest restaurants, behind the closed doors of private dinner parties, and on the banks of the Seine in Paris, Open Tables, uses the the exploding foodie scene as the backdrop for intertwining stories of true love, love lost, and the importance of a good main course. Sam and Kate host a group of friends for dinner in hopes that sparks will fly between Kate's younger sister Cassie and their friend Ryan. Joining them at the table is Jon (Desmin Borges from FX's You're the Worst) and Dana, a couple with a seemingly perfect relationship. The first act of OPEN TABLES embraces a world where true love prevails and where even the most complicated of people can find their soul mate, even when - and sometimes because - their circumstances are unique. As the group dines, stories emerge. To impress Cassie, Ryan boasts about his sexual conquests; Jon and Dana tell the tale of betrayal that led to their connection, and Sam and Kate share the story of their friend Hannah, who falls in love with Dean (David Pasquesi from HBO's Veep) - a man who has no memory. The meal ends and the friends go their separate ways, introducing the second act of OPEN TABLES, where the heartbreaking side of love surfaces. Cassie, though disinterested in Ryan's bragging, agrees to join him for an usual first date; Jon and Dana deal with the realities of deception; and Hannah copes with the fallout after Dean regains his memory with no help from his doctor (Joel Murray). Told in flashbacks but always returning to the warm glow of the dinner table, OPEN TABLES stars talent from the Chicago theater and improv stages and was filmed on location in Chicago, IL and Paris, France.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

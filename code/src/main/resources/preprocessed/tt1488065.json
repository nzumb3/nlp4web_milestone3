{"title":"Roulette City","plot":"Tak, from Mainland China, goes to Macau with his uncle Wai, hoping to win money to pay for his ill mother's operation. Together they begin to frequent Macau's underground gambling dens - and win big. But as their winnings grow, Wai becomes increasingly distracted by the temptations of the big city, including Tak's old lover from China - Wynnie. Misled to believe that he had killed Wai in a furied brawl over Wynnie, Tak must find a way to flee Macau with Wynnie. Wynnie lures Tak into a gamble that he cannot refuse: their freedom in exchange for information known to a local policeman, Kin. To gain Kin's trust, Tak befriends Kin's sister Armanda. Armanda's simple and honest nature catches Tak off-guard and he begins to fall for her. But as Tak grows closer to Kin and Armanda, and Kin gets closer to discovering Tak's true intentions, Tak must decide where his true loyalties lie.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Tak",",","from","Mainland","China",",","goe","to","Macau","with","his","uncl","Wai",",","hope","to","win","money","to","pay","for","his","ill","mother","'s","oper",".","Togeth","they","begin","to","frequent","Macau","'s","underground","gambl","den","-","and","win","big",".","But","as","their","win","grow",",","Wai","becom","increas","distract","by","the","temptat","of","the","big","citi",",","includ","Tak","'s","old","lover","from","China","-","Wynni",".","Misl","to","believ","that","he","had","kill","Wai","in","a","furi","brawl","over","Wynni",",","Tak","must","find","a","way","to","flee","Macau","with","Wynni",".","Wynni","lure","Tak","into","a","gambl","that","he","can","not","refus",":","their","freedom","in","exchang","for","inform","known","to","a","local","policeman",",","Kin",".","To","gain","Kin","'s","trust",",","Tak","befriend","Kin","'s","sister","Armanda",".","Armanda","'s","simpl","and","honest","natur","catch","Tak","off-guard","and","he","begin","to","fall","for","her",".","But","as","Tak","grow","closer","to","Kin","and","Armanda",",","and","Kin","get","closer","to","discov","Tak","'s","true","intent",",","Tak","must","decid","where","his","true","loyalti","lie","."],"lemmas":["tak",",","from","Mainland","China",",","go","to","Macau","with","he","uncle","Wai",",","hope","to","win","money","to","pay","for","he","ill","mother","'s","operation",".","together","they","begin","to","frequent","Macau","'s","underground","gambling","den","-","and","win","big",".","but","as","they","winnings","grow",",","Wai","become","increasingly","distract","by","the","temptation","of","the","big","city",",","include","Tak","'s","old","lover","from","China","-","wynnie",".","mislead","to","believe","that","he","have","kill","Wai","in","a","furied","brawl","over","Wynnie",",","Tak","must","find","a","way","to","flee","Macau","with","Wynnie",".","Wynnie","lure","Tak","into","a","gamble","that","he","can","not","refuse",":","they","freedom","in","exchange","for","information","know","to","a","local","policeman",",","kin",".","to","gain","Kin","'s","trust",",","tak","befriend","Kin","'s","sister","Armanda",".","Armanda","'s","simple","and","honest","nature","catch","tak","off-guard","and","he","begin","to","fall","for","she",".","but","as","tak","grow","closer","to","Kin","and","Armanda",",","and","Kin","get","closer","to","discover","Tak","'s","true","intention",",","Tak","must","decide","where","he","true","loyalty","lie","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tak , from",", from Mainland","from Mainland China","Mainland China ,","China , goes",", goes to","goes to Macau","to Macau with","Macau with his","with his uncle","his uncle Wai","uncle Wai ,","Wai , hoping",", hoping to","hoping to win","to win money","win money to","money to pay","to pay for","pay for his","for his ill","his ill mother","ill mother 's","mother 's operation","Together they begin","they begin to","begin to frequent","to frequent Macau","frequent Macau 's","Macau 's underground","'s underground gambling","underground gambling dens","gambling dens -","dens -

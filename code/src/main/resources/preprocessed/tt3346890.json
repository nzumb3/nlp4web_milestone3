{"title":"The Touched","plot":"The documentary 'Touched' provides a unique glimpse behind the walls of Maiti Nepal, an institution created by Anuradha Koirala (CNN hero 2011) to give shelter and strength to Nepalese women who escaped the brothels of Mumbai, Delhi and the Middle East. Some of these women were as young as eight when they were forced to work in the brothels, this happens to thousands of girls every year. Three artists from Australia went to Kathmandu to help the women paint the walls of the institution with images of color and beauty. As the mural unfolds, the lives of the women in the hospice is revealed and their stories are told, sharing their attitudes to life and hopes for the future. It is a story of courage and survival in the face of seemingly impossible odds.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","documentari","'","Touch","'","provid","a","uniqu","glimps","behind","the","wall","of","Maiti","Nepal",",","an","institut","creat","by","Anuradha","Koirala","(","CNN","hero","2011",")","to","give","shelter","and","strength","to","Nepales","women","who","escap","the","brothel","of","Mumbai",",","Delhi","and","the","Middl","East",".","Some","of","these","women","were","as","young","as","eight","when","they","were","forc","to","work","in","the","brothel",",","this","happen","to","thousand","of","girl","everi","year",".","Three","artist","from","Australia","went","to","Kathmandu","to","help","the","women","paint","the","wall","of","the","institut","with","imag","of","color","and","beauti",".","As","the","mural","unfold",",","the","live","of","the","women","in","the","hospic","is","reveal","and","their","stori","are","told",",","share","their","attitud","to","life","and","hope","for","the","futur",".","It","is","a","stori","of","courag","and","surviv","in","the","face","of","seem","imposs","odd","."],"lemmas":["the","documentary","'","touch","'","provide","a","unique","glimpse","behind","the","wall","of","Maiti","Nepal",",","a","institution","create","by","Anuradha","Koirala","-lrb-","CNN","hero","2011","-rrb-","to","give","shelter","and","strength","to","nepalese","woman","who","escape","the","brothel","of","Mumbai",",","Delhi","and","the","Middle","East",".","some","of","these","woman","be","as","young","as","eight","when","they","be","force","to","work","in","the","brothel",",","this","happen","to","thousand","of","girl","every","year",".","three","artist","from","Australia","go","to","Kathmandu","to","help","the","woman","paint","the","wall","of","the","institution","with","image","of","color","and","beauty",".","as","the","mural","unfold",",","the","life","of","the","woman","in","the","hospice","be","reveal","and","they","story","be","tell",",","share","they","attitude","to","life","and","hope","for","the","future",".","it","be","a","story","of","courage","and","survival","in","the","face","of","seemingly","impossible","odds","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

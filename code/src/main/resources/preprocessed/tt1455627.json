{"title":"Hawthorne Road","plot":"Three couples go to a haunted house for the weekend. Sounds simple, right? Not in Antone Anania's debut feature Hawthorne Road, where the people are what's haunted not the house... or is it? Exploring the notion that the world is what's scary, not mindless zombies or flesh eating diseases and the most dangerous thing in the world are people teetering on the edge, barely hanging onto their lives and the pressures the world puts on them and in turn what it makes them do, to each other and for survival.","genres":["Mystery"],"stems":["Three","coupl","go","to","a","haunt","hous","for","the","weekend",".","Sound","simpl",",","right","?","Not","in","Antone","Anania","'s","debut","featur","Hawthorn","Road",",","where","the","peopl","are","what","'s","haunt","not","the","hous","...","or","is","it","?","Explore","the","notion","that","the","world","is","what","'s","scari",",","not","mindless","zombi","or","flesh","eat","diseas","and","the","most","danger","thing","in","the","world","are","peopl","teeter","on","the","edg",",","bare","hang","onto","their","live","and","the","pressur","the","world","put","on","them","and","in","turn","what","it","make","them","do",",","to","each","other","and","for","surviv","."],"lemmas":["three","couple","go","to","a","haunted","house","for","the","weekend",".","sound","simple",",","right","?","not","in","Antone","Anania","'s","debut","feature","Hawthorne","Road",",","where","the","people","be","what","be","haunt","not","the","house","...","or","be","it","?","explore","the","notion","that","the","world","be","what","be","scary",",","not","mindless","zombie","or","flesh","eating","disease","and","the","most","dangerous","thing","in","the","world","be","people","teeter","on","the","edge",",","barely","hang","onto","they","life","and","the","pressure","the","world","put","on","they","and","in","turn","what","it","make","they","do",",","to","each","other","and","for","survival","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Three couples go","couples go to","go to a","to a haunted","a haunted house","haunted house for","house for the","for the weekend","Sounds simple ,","simple , right","Not in Antone","in Antone Anania","Antone Anania 's","Anania 's debut","'s debut feature","debut feature Hawthorne","feature Hawthorne Road","Hawthorne Road ,","Road , where",", where the","where the people","the people are","people are what","are what 's","what 's haunted","'s haunted not","haunted not the","not the house","the house ...","house ... or","... or is","or is it","Exploring the notion","the notion that","notion that the","that the world","the world is","world is what","is what 's","what 's scary","'s scary ,","scary , not",", not mindless","not mindless zombies","mindless zombies or","zombies or flesh","or flesh eating","flesh eating diseases","eating diseases and","diseases and the","and the most","the most dangerous","most dangerous thing","dangerous thing in","thing in the","in the world","the world are","world are people","are people teetering","people teetering on","teetering on the","on the edge","the edge ,","edge , barely",", barely hanging","barely hanging onto","hanging onto their","onto their lives","their lives and","lives and the","and the pressures","the pressures the","pressures the world","the world puts","world puts on","puts on them","on them and","them and in","and in turn","in turn what","turn what it","what it makes","it makes them","makes them do","them do ,","do , to",", to each","to each other","each other and","other and for","and for survival"],"2grams":["Three couples","couples go","go to","to a","a haunted","haunted house","house for","for the","the weekend","Sounds simple","simple ,",", right","Not in","in Antone","Antone Anania","Anania 's","'s debut","debut feature","feature Hawthorne","Hawthorne Road","Road ,",", where","where the","the people","people are","are what","what 's","'s haunted","haunted not","not the","the house","house ...","... or","or is","is it","Exploring the","the notion","notion that","that the","the world","world is","is what","what 's","'s scary","scary ,",", not","not mindless","mindless zombies","zombies or","or flesh","flesh eating","eating diseases","diseases and","and the","the most","most dangerous","dangerous thing","thing in","in the","the world","world are","are people","people teetering","teetering on","on the","the edge","edge ,",", barely","barely hanging","hanging onto","onto their","their lives","lives and","and the","the pressures","pressures the","the world","world puts","puts on","on them","them and","and in","in turn","turn what","what it","it makes","makes them","them do","do ,",", to","to each","each other","other and","and for","for survival"]}

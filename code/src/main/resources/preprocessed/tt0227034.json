{"title":"Marsal","plot":"Stipan is a policeman who comes to small Adriatic island off the Croatian coast in order to investigate reported strange phenomena that had frightened the whole population. At first, nobody wants to co-operate with him, but he finally finds that the island is being allegedly haunted by the ghost of Josip Broz Tito, Communist leader of former Yugoslavia. For Luka, the mayor, this is the opportunity to turn entire island into Tito-themed amusement park. Tito's WW2 veterans, on the other hand, don't believe in ghosts; for them, the apparition is actually Tito himself, who had returned in order to lead them into a new revolution which would restore Communism.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Stipan","is","a","policeman","who","come","to","small","Adriatic","island","off","the","Croatian","coast","in","order","to","investig","report","strang","phenomena","that","had","frighten","the","whole","popul",".","At","first",",","nobodi","want","to","co-oper","with","him",",","but","he","final","find","that","the","island","is","be","alleg","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","Josip","Broz","Tito",",","Communist","leader","of","former","Yugoslavia",".","For","Luka",",","the","mayor",",","this","is","the","opportun","to","turn","entir","island","into","Tito-them","amus","park",".","Tito","'s","WW2","veteran",",","on","the","other","hand",",","do","n't","believ","in","ghost",";","for","them",",","the","apparit","is","actual","Tito","himself",",","who","had","return","in","order","to","lead","them","into","a","new","revolut","which","would","restor","Commun","."],"lemmas":["Stipan","be","a","policeman","who","come","to","small","adriatic","island","off","the","croatian","coast","in","order","to","investigate","report","strange","phenomenon","that","have","frighten","the","whole","population",".","at","first",",","nobody","want","to","co-operate","with","he",",","but","he","finally","find","that","the","island","be","be","allegedly","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","Josip","Broz","Tito",",","Communist","leader","of","former","Yugoslavia",".","for","Luka",",","the","mayor",",","this","be","the","opportunity","to","turn","entire","island","into","tito-themed","amusement","park",".","Tito","'s","ww2","veteran",",","on","the","other","hand",",","do","not","believe","in","ghost",";","for","they",",","the","apparition","be","actually","Tito","himself",",","who","have","return","in","order","to","lead","they","into","a","new","revolution","which","would","restore","Communism","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Stipan is a","is a policeman","a policeman who","policeman who comes","who comes to","comes to small","to small Adriatic","small Adriatic island","Adriatic island off","island off the","off the Croatian","the Croatian coast","Croatian coast in","coast in order","in order to","order to investigate","to investigate reported","investigate reported strange","reported strange phenomena","strange phenomena that","phenomena that had","that had frightened","had frightened the","frightened the whole","the whole population","At first ,","first , nobody",", nobody wants","nobody wants to","wants to co-operate","to co-operate with","co-operate with him","with him ,","him , but",", but he","but he finally","he finally finds","finally finds that","finds that the","that the island","the island is","island is being","is being allegedly","being allegedly haunted","allegedly haunted by","haunted by the","by the ghost","the ghost of","ghost of Josip","of Josip Broz","Josip Broz Tito","Broz Tito ,","Tito , Communist",", Communist leader","Communist leader of","leader of former","of former Yugoslavia","For Luka ,","Luka , the",", the mayor","the mayor ,","mayor , this",", this is","this is the","is the opportunity","the opportunity to","opportunity to turn","to turn entire","turn entire island","entire island into","island into Tito-themed","into Tito-themed amusement","Tito-themed amusement park","Tito 's WW2","'s WW2 veterans","WW2 veterans ,","veterans , on",", on the","on the other","the other hand","other hand ,","hand , do",", do n't","do n't believe","n't believe in","believe in ghosts","in ghosts ;","ghosts ;

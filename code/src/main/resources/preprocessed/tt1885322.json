{"title":"About Bugs and Heroes","plot":"In a world full of fear, where love is slowly drifting away and becoming something unreachable, we come across unfortunate people, such as Rasha and his demanding sick father. Living on the edge of existence during pre-apocalyptic time, he becomes a guard of an old hotel, and stumbles upon strange characters with whom he shares misfortune. He meets Hero, stuck in past, when he lost his wife and son, he meets an orphan boy, who helps a Hero make a movie so he can remember what happened. Rasha also meets boys girlfriend when they escape the orphanage, but most of all, Rasha meets a girl, that he falls in love with but can never have. All this characters love, and all this characters end up losing their love. In the meantime, in a world beneath us, bugs are going through similar problems of loving and loosing. This dark fairy tale is closed with not so much of a happy end, as much as a hopeful end. Boy becomes a super hero that stands against upcoming dooms day. And bugs - well don't worry about bugs, for they are everlasting constant in this world.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","a","world","full","of","fear",",","where","love","is","slowli","drift","away","and","becom","someth","unreach",",","we","come","across","unfortun","peopl",",","such","as","Rasha","and","his","demand","sick","father",".","Live","on","the","edg","of","exist","dure","pre-apocalypt","time",",","he","becom","a","guard","of","an","old","hotel",",","and","stumbl","upon","strang","charact","with","whom","he","share","misfortun",".","He","meet","Hero",",","stuck","in","past",",","when","he","lost","his","wife","and","son",",","he","meet","an","orphan","boy",",","who","help","a","Hero","make","a","movi","so","he","can","rememb","what","happen",".","Rasha","also","meet","boy","girlfriend","when","they","escap","the","orphanag",",","but","most","of","all",",","Rasha","meet","a","girl",",","that","he","fall","in","love","with","but","can","never","have",".","All","this","charact","love",",","and","all","this","charact","end","up","lose","their","love",".","In","the","meantim",",","in","a","world","beneath","us",",","bug","are","go","through","similar","problem","of","love","and","loos",".","This","dark","fairi","tale","is","close","with","not","so","much","of","a","happi","end",",","as","much","as","a","hope","end",".","Boy","becom","a","super","hero","that","stand","against","upcom","doom","day",".","And","bug","-","well","do","n't","worri","about","bug",",","for","they","are","everlast","constant","in","this","world","."],"lemmas":["in","a","world","full","of","fear",",","where","love","be","slowly","drift","away","and","become","something","unreachable",",","we","come","across","unfortunate","people",",","such","as","Rasha","and","he","demand","sick","father",".","live","on","the","edge","of","existence","during","pre-apocalyptic","time",",","he","become","a","guard","of","a","old","hotel",",","and","stumble","upon","strange","character","with","whom","he","share","misfortune",".","he","meet","Hero",",","stick","in","past",",","when","he","lose","he","wife","and","son",",","he","meet","a","orphan","boy",",","who","help","a","hero","make","a","movie","so","he","can","remember","what","happen",".","Rasha","also","meet","boy","girlfriend","when","they","escape","the","orphanage",",","but","most","of","all",",","Rasha","meet","a","girl",",","that","he","fall","in","love","with","but","can","never","have",".","all","this","character","love",",","and","all","this","character","end","up","lose","they","love",".","in","the","meantime",",","in","a","world","beneath","we",",","bug","be","go","through","similar","problem","of","love","and","loose",".","this","dark","fairy","tale","be","close","with","not","so","much","of","a","happy","end",",","as","much","as","a","hopeful","end",".","boy","become","a","super","hero","that","stand","against","upcoming","doom","day",".","and","bug","-","well","do","not","worry","about","bug",",","for","they","be","everlasting","constant","in","this","world","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

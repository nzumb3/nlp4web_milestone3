{"title":"If I Were You","plot":"Two women who meet by chance make a pact to fix their unhappy lives: they will each do what the other one says. But one of them has a secret. She knows her husband is sleeping with the younger woman. Madelyn's plan backfires when Lucy, an aspiring actress, orders her to play King Lear in a very amateur production, with Lucy playing the Fool. Madelyn's life is transformed in unexpected ways as, like Lear, she struggles with matters of mortality and betrayal, loyalty and love.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","women","who","meet","by","chanc","make","a","pact","to","fix","their","unhappi","live",":","they","will","each","do","what","the","other","one","say",".","But","one","of","them","has","a","secret",".","She","know","her","husband","is","sleep","with","the","younger","woman",".","Madelyn","'s","plan","backfir","when","Luci",",","an","aspir","actress",",","order","her","to","play","King","Lear","in","a","veri","amateur","product",",","with","Luci","play","the","Fool",".","Madelyn","'s","life","is","transform","in","unexpect","way","as",",","like","Lear",",","she","struggl","with","matter","of","mortal","and","betray",",","loyalti","and","love","."],"lemmas":["two","woman","who","meet","by","chance","make","a","pact","to","fix","they","unhappy","life",":","they","will","each","do","what","the","other","one","say",".","but","one","of","they","have","a","secret",".","she","know","she","husband","be","sleep","with","the","younger","woman",".","Madelyn","'s","plan","backfire","when","Lucy",",","a","aspiring","actress",",","order","she","to","play","King","Lear","in","a","very","amateur","production",",","with","Lucy","play","the","fool",".","Madelyn","'s","life","be","transform","in","unexpected","way","as",",","like","Lear",",","she","struggle","with","matter","of","mortality","and","betrayal",",","loyalty","and","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two women who","women who meet","who meet by","meet by chance","by chance make","chance make a","make a pact","a pact to","pact to fix","to fix their","fix their unhappy","their unhappy lives","unhappy lives :","lives : they",": they will","they will each","will each do","each do what","do what the","what the other","the other one","other one says","But one of","one of them","of them has","them has a","has a secret","She knows her","knows her husband","her husband is","husband is sleeping","is sleeping with","sleeping with the","with the younger","the younger woman","Madelyn 's plan","'s plan backfires","plan backfires when","backfires when Lucy","when Lucy ,","Lucy , an",", an aspiring","an aspiring actress","aspiring actress ,","actress , orders",", orders her","orders her to","her to play","to play King","play King Lear","King Lear in","Lear in a","in a very","a very amateur","very amateur production","amateur production ,","production , with",", with Lucy","with Lucy playing","Lucy playing the","playing the Fool","Madelyn 's life","'s life is","life is transformed","is transformed in","transformed in unexpected","in unexpected ways","unexpected ways as","ways as ,","as , like",", like Lear","like Lear ,","Lear , she",", she struggles","she struggles with","struggles with matters","with matters of","matters of mortality","of mortality and","mortality and betrayal","and betrayal ,","betrayal , loyalty",", loyalty and","loyalty and love"],"2grams":["Two women","women who","who meet","meet by","by chance","chance make","make a","a pact","pact to","to fix","fix their","their unhappy","unhappy lives","lives :",": they","they will","will each","each do","do what","what the","the other","other one","one says","But one","one of","of them","them has","has a","a secret","She knows","knows her","her husband","husband is","is sleeping","sleeping with","with the","the younger","younger woman","Madelyn 's","'s plan","plan backfires","backfires when","when Lucy","Lucy ,",", an","an aspiring","aspiring actress","actress ,",", orders","orders her","her to","to play","play King","King Lear","Lear in","in a","a very","very amateur","amateur production","production ,",", with","with Lucy","Lucy playing","playing the","the Fool","Madelyn 's","'s life","life is","is transformed","transformed in","in unexpected","unexpected ways","ways as","as ,",", like","like Lear","Lear ,",", she","she struggles","struggles with","with matters","matters of","of mortality","mortality and","and betrayal","betrayal ,",", loyalty","loyalty and","and love"]}

{"title":"A Man's Story","plot":"Tailor to Hollywood's A-list, and a superstar in his own right, Ozwald Boateng is a dynamic force of energy, passion and colour. 1998: already celebrated as one of the most talented menswear designers in the world, Ozwald Boateng is about to go bankrupt and divorce his first wife. Through luck and circumstance director Varon Bonicos is able to switch on a camera. It continues to roll for the next twelve years. What emerges is a groundbreaking film that takes us on an exhilarating behind-the-scenes ride into the world of high fashion with one of one of the most influential menswear designers of his generation. Ending in 2010 when Boateng closes London Fashion Week with the biggest menswear show in history, Bonicos is able to get behind the headlines and chart Boateng's singular dream to succeed. Instinctive, flawed and generous, A Man's Story goes to the very heart of what Boateng has spent an entire career trying to distil: \"what it is to be a man.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Tailor","to","Hollywood","'s","A-list",",","and","a","superstar","in","his","own","right",",","Ozwald","Boateng","is","a","dynam","forc","of","energi",",","passion","and","colour",".","1998",":","alreadi","celebr","as","one","of","the","most","talent","menswear","design","in","the","world",",","Ozwald","Boateng","is","about","to","go","bankrupt","and","divorc","his","first","wife",".","Through","luck","and","circumst","director","Varon","Bonico","is","abl","to","switch","on","a","camera",".","It","continu","to","roll","for","the","next","twelv","year",".","What","emerg","is","a","groundbreak","film","that","take","us","on","an","exhilar","behind-the-scen","ride","into","the","world","of","high","fashion","with","one","of","one","of","the","most","influenti","menswear","design","of","his","generat",".","Ending","in","2010","when","Boateng","close","London","Fashion","Week","with","the","biggest","menswear","show","in","histori",",","Bonico","is","abl","to","get","behind","the","headlin","and","chart","Boateng","'s","singular","dream","to","succeed",".","Instinctiv",",","flaw","and","generous",",","A","Man","'s","Stori","goe","to","the","veri","heart","of","what","Boateng","has","spent","an","entir","career","tri","to","distil",":","\"","what","it","is","to","be","a","man",".","\""],"lemmas":["tailor","to","Hollywood","'s","a-list",",","and","a","superstar","in","he","own","right",",","Ozwald","Boateng","be","a","dynamic","force","of","energy",",","passion","and","colour",".","1998",":","already","celebrate","as","one","of","the","most","talented","menswear","designer","in","the","world",",","Ozwald","Boateng","be","about","to","go","bankrupt","and","divorce","he","first","wife",".","through","luck","and","circumstance","director","Varon","Bonicos","be","able","to","switch","on","a","camera",".","it","continue","to","roll","for","the","next","twelve","year",".","what","emerge","be","a","groundbreak","film","that","take","we","on","a","exhilarating","behind-the-scenes","ride","into","the","world","of","high","fashion","with","one","of","one","of","the","most","influential","menswear","designer","of","he","generation",".","end","in","2010","when","Boateng","close","London","Fashion","Week","with","the","biggest","menswear","show","in","history",",","Bonicos","be","able","to","get","behind","the","headline","and","chart","Boateng","'s","singular","dream","to","succeed",".","instinctive",",","flawed","and","generous",",","A","Man","'s","Story","go","to","the","very","heart","of","what","Boateng","have","spend","a","entire","career","try","to","distil",":","``","what","it","be","to","be","a","man",".","''"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tailor

{"title":"Ava","plot":"Ava's life is dictated by rules. Coming of age in Iran, she faces pressure to conform to the expectations of her parents, her school, and her friends. When Ava learns that her parents were once flagrant rule breakers themselves, she begins to rebel against the very foundations of her society. AVA masterfully demonstrates how a culture of authority can force denial and detachment, particularly among young women during their formative yet vulnerable high school years.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ava","'s","life","is","dictat","by","rule",".","Come","of","age","in","Iran",",","she","face","pressur","to","conform","to","the","expect","of","her","parent",",","her","school",",","and","her","friend",".","When","Ava","learn","that","her","parent","were","onc","flagrant","rule","breaker","themselv",",","she","begin","to","rebel","against","the","veri","foundat","of","her","societi",".","AVA","master","demonstr","how","a","cultur","of","author","can","forc","denial","and","detach",",","particular","among","young","women","dure","their","format","yet","vulner","high","school","year","."],"lemmas":["Ava","'s","life","be","dictate","by","rule",".","come","of","age","in","Iran",",","she","face","pressure","to","conform","to","the","expectation","of","she","parent",",","she","school",",","and","she","friend",".","when","ava","learn","that","she","parent","be","once","flagrant","rule","breaker","themselves",",","she","begin","to","rebel","against","the","very","foundation","of","she","society",".","AVA","masterfully","demonstrate","how","a","culture","of","authority","can","force","denial","and","detachment",",","particularly","among","young","woman","during","they","formative","yet","vulnerable","high","school","year","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Ava 's life","'s life is","life is dictated","is dictated by","dictated by rules","Coming of age","of age in","age in Iran","in Iran ,","Iran , she",", she faces","she faces pressure","faces pressure to","pressure to conform","to conform to","conform to the","to the expectations","the expectations of","expectations of her","of her parents","her parents ,","parents , her",", her school","her school ,","school , and",", and her","and her friends","When Ava learns","Ava learns that","learns that her","that her parents","her parents were","parents were once","were once flagrant","once flagrant rule","flagrant rule breakers","rule breakers themselves","breakers themselves ,","themselves , she",", she begins","she begins to","begins to rebel","to rebel against","rebel against the","against the very","the very foundations","very foundations of","foundations of her","of her society","AVA masterfully demonstrates","masterfully demonstrates how","demonstrates how a","how a culture","a culture of","culture of authority","of authority can","authority can force","can force denial","force denial and","denial and detachment","and detachment ,","detachment , particularly",", particularly among","particularly among young","among young women","young women during","women during their","during their formative","their formative yet","formative yet vulnerable","yet vulnerable high","vulnerable high school","high school years"],"2grams":["Ava 's","'s life","life is","is dictated","dictated by","by rules","Coming of","of age","age in","in Iran","Iran ,",", she","she faces","faces pressure","pressure to","to conform","conform to","to the","the expectations","expectations of","of her","her parents","parents ,",", her","her school","school ,",", and","and her","her friends","When Ava","Ava learns","learns that","that her","her parents","parents were","were once","once flagrant","flagrant rule","rule breakers","breakers themselves","themselves ,",", she","she begins","begins to","to rebel","rebel against","against the","the very","very foundations","foundations of","of her","her society","AVA masterfully","masterfully demonstrates","demonstrates how","how a","a culture","culture of","of authority","authority can","can force","force denial","denial and","and detachment","detachment ,",", particularly","particularly among","among young","young women","women during","during their","their formative","formative yet","yet vulnerable","vulnerable high","high school","school years"]}

{"title":"Cuak","plot":"CUAK, which roughly translates to 'cold feet', follows the story of Adam on the verge of getting married and having second thoughts as he goes through the events that lead up to this moment - how they first met, the in-laws and best friends and making tough decisions such as converting ones religion to get married. The film is uniquely told by 5 directors who each direct each of these events as segments of the film, combining together to make one full narrative in a variety of different styles - ranging from drama and comedy to noir and mockumentary - making CUAK a truly Malaysian movie with themes that resonate with a universal audience regardless of race or religion.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["CUAK",",","which","rough","translat","to","'","cold","feet","'",",","follow","the","stori","of","Adam","on","the","verg","of","get","marri","and","have","second","thought","as","he","goe","through","the","event","that","lead","up","to","this","moment","-","how","they","first","met",",","the","in-law","and","best","friend","and","make","tough","decis","such","as","convert","one","religion","to","get","marri",".","The","film","is","uniqu","told","by","5","director","who","each","direct","each","of","these","event","as","segment","of","the","film",",","combin","togeth","to","make","one","full","narrat","in","a","varieti","of","differ","style","-","rang","from","drama","and","comedi","to","noir","and","mockumentari","-","make","CUAK","a","truli","Malaysian","movi","with","theme","that","reson","with","a","univers","audienc","regardless","of","race","or","religion","."],"lemmas":["CUAK",",","which","roughly","translate","to","'","cold","foot","'",",","follow","the","story","of","Adam","on","the","verge","of","get","marry","and","have","second","thought","as","he","go","through","the","event","that","lead","up","to","this","moment","-","how","they","first","meet",",","the","in-law","and","best","friend","and","make","tough","decision","such","as","convert","one","religion","to","get","marry",".","the","film","be","uniquely","tell","by","5","director","who","each","direct","each","of","these","event","as","segment","of","the","film",",","combine","together","to","make","one","full","narrative","in","a","variety","of","different","style","-","range","from","drama","and","comedy","to","noir","and","mockumentary","-","make","CUAK","a","truly","malaysian","movie","with","theme","that","resonate","with","a","universal","audience","regardless","of","race","or","religion","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["CUAK , which",", which roughly","which roughly translates","roughly translates to","translates to '","to ' cold","' cold feet","cold feet '","feet ' ,","' , follows",", follows the","follows the story","the story of","story of Adam","of Adam on","Adam on the","on the verge","the verge of","verge of getting","of getting married","getting married and","married and having","and having second","having second thoughts","second thoughts as","thoughts as he","as he goes","he goes through","goes through the","through the events","the events that","events that lead","that lead up","lead up to","up to this","to this moment","this moment -","moment -

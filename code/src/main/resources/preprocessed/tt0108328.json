{"title":"Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould","plot":"As the title suggests, this dramatised documentary about the eccentric Canadian pianist Glenn Gould is broken up into thirty-two short films (mirroring the thirty-two part structure of Bach's 'Goldberg Variations', the recording that Gould made famous), each giving us an insight into some aspect of Gould's life and career. Out of respect for the music lead actor Colm Feore is never seen playing the piano, merely reacting to Gould's own recordings, which are extensively featured","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["As","the","titl","suggest",",","this","dramatis","documentari","about","the","eccentr","Canadian","pianist","Glenn","Gould","is","broken","up","into","thirty-two","short","film","(","mirror","the","thirty-two","part","structur","of","Bach","'s","'","Goldberg","Variat","'",",","the","record","that","Gould","made","famous",")",",","each","give","us","an","insight","into","some","aspect","of","Gould","'s","life","and","career",".","Out","of","respect","for","the","music","lead","actor","Colm","Feor","is","never","seen","play","the","piano",",","mere","react","to","Gould","'s","own","record",",","which","are","extens","featur"],"lemmas":["as","the","title","suggest",",","this","dramatise","documentary","about","the","eccentric","canadian","pianist","Glenn","Gould","be","break","up","into","thirty-two","short","film","-lrb-","mirroring","the","thirty-two","part","structure","of","Bach","'s","'","Goldberg","variation","'",",","the","recording","that","Gould","make","famous","-rrb-",",","each","give","we","a","insight","into","some","aspect","of","Gould","'s","life","and","career",".","out","of","respect","for","the","music","lead","actor","Colm","Feore","be","never","see","play","the","piano",",","merely","react","to","Gould","'s","own","recording",",","which","be","extensively","feature"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["As the title","the title suggests","title suggests ,","suggests , this",", this dramatised","this dramatised documentary","dramatised documentary about","documentary about the","about the eccentric","the eccentric Canadian","eccentric Canadian pianist","Canadian pianist Glenn","pianist Glenn Gould","Glenn Gould is","Gould is broken","is broken up","broken up into","up into thirty-two","into thirty-two short","thirty-two short films","short films (","films ( mirroring","( mirroring the","mirroring the thirty-two","the thirty-two part","thirty-two part structure","part structure of","structure of Bach","of Bach 's","Bach 's '","'s ' Goldberg","' Goldberg Variations","Goldberg Variations '","Variations ' ,","' , the",", the recording","the recording that","recording that Gould","that Gould made","Gould made famous","made famous )","famous ) ,",") , each",", each giving","each giving us","giving us an","us an insight","an insight into","insight into some","into some aspect","some aspect of","aspect of Gould","of Gould 's","Gould 's life","'s life and","life and career","Out of respect","of respect for","respect for the","for the music","the music lead","music lead actor","lead actor Colm","actor Colm Feore","Colm Feore is","Feore is never","is never seen","never seen playing","seen playing the","playing the piano","the piano ,","piano , merely",", merely reacting","merely reacting to","reacting to Gould","to Gould 's","Gould 's own","'s own recordings","own recordings ,","recordings , which",", which are","which are extensively","are extensively featured"],"2grams":["As the","the title","title suggests","suggests ,",", this","this dramatised","dramatised documentary","documentary about","about the","the eccentric","eccentric Canadian","Canadian pianist","pianist Glenn","Glenn Gould","Gould is","is broken","broken up","up into","into thirty-two","thirty-two short","short films","films (","( mirroring","mirroring the","the thirty-two","thirty-two part","part structure","structure of","of Bach","Bach 's","'s '","' Goldberg","Goldberg Variations","Variations '","' ,",", the","the recording","recording that","that Gould","Gould made","made famous","famous )",") ,",", each","each giving","giving us","us an","an insight","insight into","into some","some aspect","aspect of","of Gould","Gould 's","'s life","life and","and career","Out of","of respect","respect for","for the","the music","music lead","lead actor","actor Colm","Colm Feore","Feore is","is never","never seen","seen playing","playing the","the piano","piano ,",", merely","merely reacting","reacting to","to Gould","Gould 's","'s own","own recordings","recordings ,",", which","which are","are extensively","extensively featured"]}

{"title":"Hurricane Streets","plot":"Marcus is a kid on Manhattan's mean streets. He's turning 15, his father is dead, his mother is in prison for smuggling undocumented aliens. His grandmother is raising him. He has four close buddies who have a basement clubhouse; they shoplift and sell the wares to kids. One is moving toward selling drugs. Marcus wants to take a breather from the city and visit family in New Mexico. He also meets Melena, 14, a sweet kid who dreams of going to Alaska; her father is not just protective but angry and uncommunicative. The gang pressures Marcus to move up to burglary and car theft. He just wants to breathe open air. Can anything go right?","genres":["Crime"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Marcus","is","a","kid","on","Manhattan","'s","mean","street",".","He","'s","turn","15",",","his","father","is","dead",",","his","mother","is","in","prison","for","smuggl","undocu","alien",".","His","grandmoth","is","rais","him",".","He","has","four","close","buddi","who","have","a","basement","clubhous",";","they","shoplift","and","sell","the","ware","to","kid",".","One","is","move","toward","sell","drug",".","Marcus","want","to","take","a","breather","from","the","citi","and","visit","famili","in","New","Mexico",".","He","also","meet","Melena",",","14",",","a","sweet","kid","who","dream","of","go","to","Alaska",";","her","father","is","not","just","protect","but","angri","and","uncommun",".","The","gang","pressur","Marcus","to","move","up","to","burglari","and","car","theft",".","He","just","want","to","breath","open","air",".","Can","anyth","go","right","?"],"lemmas":["Marcus","be","a","kid","on","Manhattan","'s","mean","street",".","he","be","turn","15",",","he","father","be","dead",",","he","mother","be","in","prison","for","smuggling","undocumented","alien",".","he","grandmother","be","raise","he",".","he","have","four","close","buddy","who","have","a","basement","clubhouse",";","they","shoplift","and","sell","the","wares","to","kid",".","one","be","move","toward","sell","drug",".","Marcus","want","to","take","a","breather","from","the","city","and","visit","family","in","New","Mexico",".","he","also","meet","Melena",",","14",",","a","sweet","kid","who","dream","of","go","to","Alaska",";","she","father","be","not","just","protective","but","angry","and","uncommunicative",".","the","gang","pressure","Marcus","to","move","up","to","burglary","and","car","theft",".","he","just","want","to","breathe","open","air",".","can","anything","go","right","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Marcus is a","is a kid","a kid on","kid on Manhattan","on Manhattan 's","Manhattan 's mean","'s mean streets","He 's turning","'s turning 15","turning 15 ,","15 , his",", his father","his father is","father is dead","is dead ,","dead , his",", his mother","his mother is","mother is in","is in prison","in prison for","prison for smuggling","for smuggling undocumented","smuggling undocumented aliens","His grandmother is","grandmother is raising","is raising him","He has four","has four close","four close buddies","close buddies who","buddies who have","who have a","have a basement","a basement clubhouse","basement clubhouse ;","clubhouse ;

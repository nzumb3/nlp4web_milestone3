{"title":"Driven","plot":"Talented rookie race-car driver Jimmy Bly has started losing his focus and begins to slip in the race rankings. It's no wonder, with the immense pressure being shoveled on him by his overly ambitious promoter brother as well as Bly's romance with his arch rival's girlfriend Sophia. With much riding on Bly, car owner Carl Henry brings former racing star Joe Tanto on board to help Bly. To drive Bly back to the top of the rankings, Tanto must first deal with the emotional scars left over from a tragic racing accident which nearly took his life.","genres":["Action"," Sport"," Drama"],"stems":["Talent","rooki","race-car","driver","Jimmi","Bli","has","start","lose","his","focus","and","begin","to","slip","in","the","race","rank",".","It","'s","no","wonder",",","with","the","immens","pressur","be","shovel","on","him","by","his","over","ambiti","promot","brother","as","well","as","Bli","'s","romanc","with","his","arch","rival","'s","girlfriend","Sophia",".","With","much","ride","on","Bli",",","car","owner","Carl","Henri","bring","former","race","star","Joe","Tanto","on","board","to","help","Bli",".","To","drive","Bli","back","to","the","top","of","the","rank",",","Tanto","must","first","deal","with","the","emot","scar","left","over","from","a","tragic","race","accid","which","near","took","his","life","."],"lemmas":["talented","rookie","race-car","driver","Jimmy","Bly","have","start","lose","he","focus","and","begin","to","slip","in","the","race","ranking",".","it","be","no","wonder",",","with","the","immense","pressure","be","shovel","on","he","by","he","overly","ambitious","promoter","brother","as","well","as","Bly","'s","romance","with","he","arch","rival","'s","girlfriend","Sophia",".","with","much","ride","on","Bly",",","car","owner","Carl","Henry","bring","former","racing","star","Joe","Tanto","on","board","to","help","Bly",".","to","drive","Bly","back","to","the","top","of","the","ranking",",","Tanto","must","first","deal","with","the","emotional","scar","leave","over","from","a","tragic","racing","accident","which","nearly","take","he","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Talented rookie race-car","rookie race-car driver","race-car driver Jimmy","driver Jimmy Bly","Jimmy Bly has","Bly has started","has started losing","started losing his","losing his focus","his focus and","focus and begins","and begins to","begins to slip","to slip in","slip in the","in the race","the race rankings","It 's no","'s no wonder","no wonder ,","wonder , with",", with the","with the immense","the immense pressure","immense pressure being","pressure being shoveled","being shoveled on","shoveled on him","on him by","him by his","by his overly","his overly ambitious","overly ambitious promoter","ambitious promoter brother","promoter brother as","brother as well","as well as","well as Bly","as Bly 's","Bly 's romance","'s romance with","romance with his","with his arch","his arch rival","arch rival 's","rival 's girlfriend","'s girlfriend Sophia","With much riding","much riding on","riding on Bly","on Bly ,","Bly , car",", car owner","car owner Carl","owner Carl Henry","Carl Henry brings","Henry brings former","brings former racing","former racing star","racing star Joe","star Joe Tanto","Joe Tanto on","Tanto on board","on board to","board to help","to help Bly","To drive Bly","drive Bly back","Bly back to","back to the","to the top","the top of","top of the","of the rankings","the rankings ,","rankings , Tanto",", Tanto must","Tanto must first","must first deal","first deal with","deal with the","with the emotional","the emotional scars","emotional scars left","scars left over","left over from","over from a","from a tragic","a tragic racing","tragic racing accident","racing accident which","accident which nearly","which nearly took","nearly took his","took his life"],"2grams":["Talented rookie","rookie race-car","race-car driver","driver Jimmy","Jimmy Bly","Bly has","has started","started losing","losing his","his focus","focus and","and begins","begins to","to slip","slip in","in the","the race","race rankings","It 's","'s no","no wonder","wonder ,",", with","with the","the immense","immense pressure","pressure being","being shoveled","shoveled on","on him","him by","by his","his overly","overly ambitious","ambitious promoter","promoter brother","brother as","as well","well as","as Bly","Bly 's","'s romance","romance with","with his","his arch","arch rival","rival 's","'s girlfriend","girlfriend Sophia","With much","much riding","riding on","on Bly","Bly ,",", car","car owner","owner Carl","Carl Henry","Henry brings","brings former","former racing","racing star","star Joe","Joe Tanto","Tanto on","on board","board to","to help","help Bly","To drive","drive Bly","Bly back","back to","to the","the top","top of","of the","the rankings","rankings ,",", Tanto","Tanto must","must first","first deal","deal with","with the","the emotional","emotional scars","scars left","left over","over from","from a","a tragic","tragic racing","racing accident","accident which","which nearly","nearly took","took his","his life"]}

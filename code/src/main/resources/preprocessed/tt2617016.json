{"title":"Lighter Than Air","plot":"Kim Pettit, a 47-year-old woman struggles with Multiple Sclerosis. At this point in the disease, everyday tasks like walking are exhausting. Kim walks us through what it's like to feel trapped in her body. However, the contrast between the weakness in her legs and the spirit in her eyes is what makes Kim so unique. Although she cannot run or jump, she has dreamt for years of flying like the birds she watches. She envies them for their effortless ability to float through the air. Therefore we made it our mission to make Kim fly. On October 16, 2012, Kim Pettit went on a tandem hang gliding flight and for the first time in over 20 years, she felt completely free of her disease.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary","

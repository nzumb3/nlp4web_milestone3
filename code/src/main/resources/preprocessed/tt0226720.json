Juan embarks on a series of encounters with other women. He only allows himself to meet them by chance. Every afternoon at the same time, he sits on the same bench in a park, and then he also sits at the same table in the same bar. Shortly thereafter, using these methods, he meets both Alicia and Ana.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Juan","and","Teresa","have","been","lover","for","two","year",".","The","day","befor","she","leav","to","live","in","London",",","he","abandon","the","apart","they","were","share",".","Juan","embark","on","a","seri","of","encount","with","other","women",".","He","onli","allow","himself","to","meet","them","by","chanc",".","Everi","afternoon","at","the","same","time",",","he","sit","on","the","same","bench","in","a","park",",","and","then","he","also","sit","at","the","same","tabl","in","the","same","bar",".","Short","thereaft",",","use","these","method",",","he","meet","both","Alicia","and","Ana","."],"lemmas":["Juan","and","Teresa","have","be","lover","for","two","year",".","the","day","before","she","leave","to","live","in","London",",","he","abandon","the","apartment","they","be","share",".","Juan","embark","on","a","series","of","encounter","with","other","woman",".","he","only","allow","himself","to","meet","they","by","chance",".","every","afternoon","at","the","same","time",",","he","sit","on","the","same","bench","in","a","park",",","and","then","he","also","sit","at","the","same","table","in","the","same","bar",".","shortly","thereafter",",","use","these","method",",","he","meet","both","Alicia","and","Ana","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Juan and Teresa","and Teresa have","Teresa have been","have been lovers","been lovers for","lovers for two","for two years","The day before","day before she","before she leaves","she leaves to","leaves to live","to live in","live in London","in London ,","London , he",", he abandons","he abandons the","abandons the apartment","the apartment they","apartment they were","they were sharing","Juan embarks on","embarks on a","on a series","a series of","series of encounters","of encounters with","encounters with other","with other women","He only allows","only allows himself","allows himself to","himself to meet","to meet them","meet them by","them by chance","Every afternoon at","afternoon at the","at the same","the same time","same time ,","time , he",", he sits","he sits on","sits on the","on the same","the same bench","same bench in","bench in a","in a park","a park ,","park , and",", and then","and then he","then he also","he also sits","also sits at","sits at the","at the same","the same table","same table in","table in the","in the same","the same bar","Shortly thereafter ,","thereafter , using",", using these","using these methods","these methods ,","methods , he",", he meets","he meets both","meets both Alicia","both Alicia and","Alicia and Ana"],"2grams":["Juan and","and Teresa","Teresa have","have been","been lovers","lovers for","for two","two years","The day","day before","before she","she leaves","leaves to","to live","live in","in London","London ,",", he","he abandons","abandons the","the apartment","apartment they","they were","were sharing","Juan embarks","embarks on","on a","a series","series of","of encounters","encounters with","with other","other women","He only","only allows","allows himself","himself to","to meet","meet them","them by","by chance","Every afternoon","afternoon at","at the","the same","same time","time ,",", he","he sits","sits on","on the","the same","same bench","bench in","in a","a park","park ,",", and","and then","then he","he also","also sits","sits at","at the","the same","same table","table in","in the","the same","same bar","Shortly thereafter","thereafter ,",", using","using these","these methods","methods ,",", he","he meets","meets both","both Alicia","Alicia and","and Ana"]}

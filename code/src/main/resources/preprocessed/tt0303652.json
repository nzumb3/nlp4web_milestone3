{"title":"Andelská tvár","plot":"The story is set in 19th century France. A mysterious man saves Charlotta's (Michaela Kuklová) life when the convent in which she lives catches fire. Ten years later she marries Raoul de Mornay (Filip Blazek), a charming earl who lives in a mansion with his rather peculiar brother, Filip (Jirí Pomeje). Charlotta notices that strange things begin to happen around the castle, though the servants bite their tongues and Raoul manages to cover crimes Filip apparently commits. When the mansion is set on fire and a murder is committed, Charlotta assumes that Raoul is behind it all. She finds herself in mortal danger and it is Filip, whom she once feared, who comes to her rescue.","genres":["Drama","

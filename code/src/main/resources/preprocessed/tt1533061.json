{"title":"Katka","plot":"Helena Trestikova is the author of 10 episodes from the series Women on the Brink of the New Millennium, intimate portraits of both successful women and women on the social periphery. The tragic story of a girl named Katka who believes that joy and happiness can be applied through a hypodermic needle. All she is left with is despair. We first meet Katka at a rehab clinic in Nemcice, still full of optimism and faith in a drug-free future. The film tries to draw attention to the drug problem from a somewhat different point of view.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Helena","Trestikova","is","the","author","of","10","episod","from","the","seri","Women","on","the","Brink","of","the","New","Millennium",",","intim","portrait","of","both","success","women","and","women","on","the","social","peripheri",".","The","tragic","stori","of","a","girl","name","Katka","who","believ","that","joy","and","happi","can","be","appli","through","a","hypoderm","needl",".","All","she","is","left","with","is","despair",".","We","first","meet","Katka","at","a","rehab","clinic","in","Nemcic",",","still","full","of","optim","and","faith","in","a","drug-fre","futur",".","The","film","tri","to","draw","attent","to","the","drug","problem","from","a","somewhat","differ","point","of","view","."],"lemmas":["Helena","Trestikova","be","the","author","of","10","episode","from","the","series","Women","on","the","Brink","of","the","New","Millennium",",","intimate","portrait","of","both","successful","woman","and","woman","on","the","social","periphery",".","the","tragic","story","of","a","girl","name","Katka","who","believe","that","joy","and","happiness","can","be","apply","through","a","hypodermic","needle",".","all","she","be","leave","with","be","despair",".","we","first","meet","Katka","at","a","rehab","clinic","in","Nemcice",",","still","full","of","optimism","and","faith","in","a","drug-free","future",".","the","film","try","to","draw","attention","to","the","drug","problem","from","a","somewhat","different","point","of","view","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Helena Trestikova is","Trestikova is the","is the author","the author of","author of 10","of 10 episodes","10 episodes from","episodes from the","from the series","the series Women","series Women on","Women on the","on the Brink","the Brink of","Brink of the","of the New","the New Millennium","New Millennium ,","Millennium , intimate",", intimate portraits","intimate portraits of","portraits of both","of both successful","both successful women","successful women and","women and women","and women on","women on the","on the social","the social periphery","The tragic story","tragic story of","story of a","of a girl","a girl named","girl named Katka","named Katka who","Katka who believes","who believes that","believes that joy","that joy and","joy and happiness","and happiness can","happiness can be","can be applied","be applied through","applied through a","through a hypodermic","a hypodermic needle","All she is","she is left","is left with","left with is","with is despair","We first meet","first meet Katka","meet Katka at","Katka at a","at a rehab","a rehab clinic","rehab clinic in","clinic in Nemcice","in Nemcice ,","Nemcice , still",", still full","still full of","full of optimism","of optimism and","optimism and faith","and faith in","faith in a","in a drug-free","a drug-free future","The film tries","film tries to","tries to draw","to draw attention","draw attention to","attention to the","to the drug","the drug problem","drug problem from","problem from a","from a somewhat","a somewhat different","somewhat different point","different point of","point of view"],"2grams":["Helena Trestikova","Trestikova is","is the","the author","author of","of 10","10 episodes","episodes from","from the","the series","series Women","Women on","on the","the Brink","Brink of","of the","the New","New Millennium","Millennium ,",", intimate","intimate portraits","portraits of","of both","both successful","successful women","women and","and women","women on","on the","the social","social periphery","The tragic","tragic story","story of","of a","a girl","girl named","named Katka","Katka who","who believes","believes that","that joy","joy and","and happiness","happiness can","can be","be applied","applied through","through a","a hypodermic","hypodermic needle","All she","she is","is left","left with","with is","is despair","We first","first meet","meet Katka","Katka at","at a","a rehab","rehab clinic","clinic in","in Nemcice","Nemcice ,",", still","still full","full of","of optimism","optimism and","and faith","faith in","in a","a drug-free","drug-free future","The film","film tries","tries to","to draw","draw attention","attention to","to the","the drug","drug problem","problem from","from a","a somewhat","somewhat different","different point","point of","of view"]}

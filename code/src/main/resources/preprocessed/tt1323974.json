{"title":"The Viva Voce Virus","plot":"London actress Ronnie receives a plum role in a lesbian vampire B-movie. No one knows she also likes girls offset. But the assistant director's a jerk, Ronnie's girlfriend's fed up, and bits of a disturbing 1970s gay \"utopia\" parallel world are seeping into Ronnie's real life. Investigating, Ronnie encounters a disease from Hollywood's yesteryear that may explain why actors keep mum about their same-sex love affairs; an illness spread by frothy blue liqueurs and perfume atomizers: the Viva Voce Virus. Holding the key to the mystery is ex-starlet Gloria, inventor of a very special cocktail.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"],"stems":["London","actress","Ronni","receiv","a","plum","role","in","a","lesbian","vampir","B-movi",".","No","one","know","she","also","like","girl","offset",".","But","the","assist","director","'s","a","jerk",",","Ronni","'s","girlfriend","'s","fed","up",",","and","bit","of","a","disturb","1970s","gay","\"","utopia","\"","parallel","world","are","seep","into","Ronni","'s","real","life",".","Investig",",","Ronni","encount","a","diseas","from","Hollywood","'s","yesteryear","that","may","explain","whi","actor","keep","mum","about","their","same-sex","love","affair",";","an","ill","spread","by","frothi","blue","liqueur","and","perfum","atom",":","the","Viva","Voce","Virus",".","Hold","the","key","to","the","mysteri","is","ex-starlet","Gloria",",","inventor","of","a","veri","special","cocktail","."],"lemmas":["London","actress","Ronnie","receive","a","plum","role","in","a","lesbian","vampire","b-movie",".","no","one","know","she","also","like","girl","offset",".","but","the","assistant","director","be","a","jerk",",","Ronnie","'s","girlfriend","'s","fed","up",",","and","bit","of","a","disturbing","1970s","gay","``","utopia","''","parallel","world","be","seep","into","Ronnie","'s","real","life",".","investigate",",","Ronnie","encounter","a","disease","from","Hollywood","'s","yesteryear","that","may","explain","why","actor","keep","mum","about","they","same-sex","love","affair",";","a","illness","spread","by","frothy","blue","liqueur","and","perfume","atomizer",":","the","viva","voce","virus",".","hold","the","key","to","the","mystery","be","ex-starlet","Gloria",",","inventor","of","a","very","special","cocktail","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["London actress Ronnie","actress Ronnie receives","Ronnie receives a","receives a plum","a plum role","plum role in","role in a","in a lesbian","a lesbian vampire","lesbian vampire B-movie","No one knows","one knows she","knows she also","she also likes","also likes girls","likes girls offset","But the assistant","the assistant director","assistant director 's","director 's a","'s a jerk","a jerk ,","jerk , Ronnie",", Ronnie 's","Ronnie 's girlfriend","'s girlfriend 's","girlfriend 's fed","'s fed up","fed up ,","up , and",", and bits","and bits of","bits of a","of a disturbing","a disturbing 1970s","disturbing 1970s gay","1970s gay \"","gay \" utopia","\" utopia \"","utopia \" parallel","\" parallel world","parallel world are","world are seeping","are seeping into","seeping into Ronnie","into Ronnie 's","Ronnie 's real","'s real life","Investigating , Ronnie",", Ronnie encounters","Ronnie encounters a","encounters a disease","a disease from","disease from Hollywood","from Hollywood 's","Hollywood 's yesteryear","'s yesteryear that","yesteryear that may","that may explain","may explain why","explain why actors","why actors keep","actors keep mum","keep mum about","mum about their","about their same-sex","their same-sex love","same-sex love affairs","love affairs ;","affairs ;

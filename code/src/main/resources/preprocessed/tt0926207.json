{"title":"The Possible","plot":"In 1970, a rock band called \"The Possible\" has reached the top of the Thai music charts, and has created a sensation among the younger generation. One day, the band receives a microphone as the present from a mysterious fan. Miraculously, the microphone is a time-machine that accidentally transports them to the year 2006, where modern music rules and they're just an out-of-date item. The only way to bring them back to their glorious time is performing a concert that will fix the broken time-machine/microphone. But, before the concert could be set, there're still some problems in the new world that they have to deal with.","genres":["Comedy","

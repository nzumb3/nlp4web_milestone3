{"title":"Today's Special","plot":"Samir is a sous chef in Manhattan. He quits when he's not promoted - his boss says his cooking lacks soul. He decides to find an unpaid internship in Paris, but his father suffers a heart attack keeping him home for a few weeks. Samir must run the family's failing Indian restaurant in Queens. He can't cook Indian food, so things get dire when the chef quits: Samir tracks down Akbar, a cabbie who claims to have cooked for British royalty in Bombay. Akbar cooks with mind, heart, and gut - and offers philosophy as well. With the help of Carrie, whom he met at the Manhattan restaurant, Samir begins to enjoy the work. But will his father approve, and if not, what then?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Samir","is","a","sous","chef","in","Manhattan",".","He","quit","when","he","'s","not","promot","-","his","boss","say","his","cook","lack","soul",".","He","decid","to","find","an","unpaid","internship","in","Pari",",","but","his","father","suffer","a","heart","attack","keep","him","home","for","a","few","week",".","Samir","must","run","the","famili","'s","fail","Indian","restaur","in","Queen",".","He","ca","n't","cook","Indian","food",",","so","thing","get","dire","when","the","chef","quit",":","Samir","track","down","Akbar",",","a","cabbi","who","claim","to","have","cook","for","British","royalti","in","Bombay",".","Akbar","cook","with","mind",",","heart",",","and","gut","-","and","offer","philosophi","as","well",".","With","the","help","of","Carri",",","whom","he","met","at","the","Manhattan","restaur",",","Samir","begin","to","enjoy","the","work",".","But","will","his","father","approv",",","and","if","not",",","what","then","?"],"lemmas":["Samir","be","a","sous","chef","in","Manhattan",".","he","quit","when","he","be","not","promote","-","he","boss","say","he","cooking","lack","soul",".","he","decide","to","find","a","unpaid","internship","in","Paris",",","but","he","father","suffer","a","heart","attack","keep","he","home","for","a","few","week",".","Samir","must","run","the","family","'s","fail","indian","restaurant","in","Queens",".","he","can","not","cook","indian","food",",","so","thing","get","dire","when","the","chef","quit",":","samir","track","down","Akbar",",","a","cabbie","who","claim","to","have","cook","for","british","royalty","in","Bombay",".","Akbar","cook","with","mind",",","heart",",","and","gut","-","and","offer","philosophy","as","well",".","with","the","help","of","Carrie",",","whom","he","meet","at","the","Manhattan","restaurant",",","Samir","begin","to","enjoy","the","work",".","but","will","he","father","approve",",","and","if","not",",","what","then","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Samir is a","is a sous","a sous chef","sous chef in","chef in Manhattan","He quits when","quits when he","when he 's","he 's not","'s not promoted","not promoted -","promoted -

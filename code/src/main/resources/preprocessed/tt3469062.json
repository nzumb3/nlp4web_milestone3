{"title":"Sulfur","plot":"Tim Harper lives with his sister Misty, her 8-month-old baby and her second husband Ricky. Tim was raised on hard work and close family, but when those fundamentals are challenged, he and his family are forced to make tough decisions. When a big time real estate developer eyes a piece of land owned and cherished by Tim and Misty's grandparents, sacrifices must be made. Henry Vincent has a taste for the finer things in life and will do whatever it takes to support his lavish lifestyle, even if it means a little dishonesty. Tim has to make the toughest decision of his life, take his grandparents away from the only home they have ever known, or risk losing the roof over his own family's head. Taking a risk, Tim takes on an unlikely job that could save everything, but he knows it's beyond his means. If he can finish it then he will make enough money to pay off his trailer and not have to sell his grandparents property. When Tim gets injured on the job, there seems to be no other option but to take Henry's deal. When blame is tossed around Tim's home to name who's at fault, Ricky decides to take matters into his own hands. One night at the local dive bar Ricky stumbles on Henry who's been having an affair. Suddenly a glimmer of hope emerges. Tim, swallowing his pride and taking note of Henry's way of business uses the newfound information to blackmail Henry and set things straight.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Tim","Harper","live","with","his","sister","Misti",",","her","8-month-old","babi","and","her","second","husband","Ricki",".","Tim","was","rais","on","hard","work","and","close","famili",",","but","when","those","fundament","are","challeng",",","he","and","his","famili","are","forc","to","make","tough","decis",".","When","a","big","time","real","estat","develop","eye","a","piec","of","land","own","and","cherish","by","Tim","and","Misti","'s","grandpar",",","sacrific","must","be","made",".","Henri","Vincent","has","a","tast","for","the","finer","thing","in","life","and","will","do","whatev","it","take","to","support","his","lavish","lifestyl",",","even","if","it","mean","a","littl","dishonesti",".","Tim","has","to","make","the","toughest","decis","of","his","life",",","take","his","grandpar","away","from","the","onli","home","they","have","ever","known",",","or","risk","lose","the","roof","over","his","own","famili","'s","head",".","Take","a","risk",",","Tim","take","on","an","unlik","job","that","could","save","everyth",",","but","he","know","it","'s","beyond","his","mean",".","If","he","can","finish","it","then","he","will","make","enough","money","to","pay","off","his","trailer","and","not","have","to","sell","his","grandpar","properti",".","When","Tim","get","injur","on","the","job",",","there","seem","to","be","no","other","option","but","to","take","Henri","'s","deal",".","When","blame","is","toss","around","Tim","'s","home","to","name","who","'s","at","fault",",","Ricki","decid","to","take","matter","into","his","own","hand",".","One","night","at","the","local","dive","bar","Ricki","stumbl","on","Henri","who","'s","been","have","an","affair",".","Sudden","a","glimmer","of","hope","emerg",".","Tim",",","swallow","his","pride","and","take","note","of","Henri","'s","way","of","busi","use","the","newfound","inform","to","blackmail","Henri","and","set","thing","straight","."],"lemmas":["Tim","Harper","live","with","he","sister","Misty",",","she","8-month-old","baby","and","she","second","husband","Ricky",".","Tim","be","raise","on","hard","work","and","close","family",",","but","when","those","fundamental","be","challenge",",","he","and","he","family","be","force","to","make","tough","decision",".","when","a","big","time","real","estate","developer","eye","a","piece","of","land","own","and","cherish","by","Tim","and","Misty","'s","grandparent",",","sacrifice","must","be","make",".","Henry","Vincent","have","a","taste","for","the","finer","thing","in","life","and","will","do","whatever","it","take","to","support","he","lavish","lifestyle",",","even","if","it","mean","a","little","dishonesty",".","Tim","have","to","make","the","toughest","decision","of","he","life",",","take","he","grandparent","away","from","the","only","home","they","have","ever","know",",","or","risk","lose","the","roof","over","he","own","family","'s","head",".","take","a","risk",",","Tim","take","on","a","unlikely","job","that","could","save","everything",",","but","he","know","it","be","beyond","he","means",".","if","he","can","finish","it","then","he","will","make","enough","money","to","pay","off","he","trailer","and","not","have","to","sell","he","grandparent","property",".","when","Tim","get","injure","on","the","job",",","there","seem","to","be","no","other","option","but","to","take","Henry","'s","deal",".","when","blame","be","toss","around","Tim","'s","home","to","name","who","be","at","fault",",","Ricky","decide","to","take","matter","into","he","own","hand",".","one","night","at","the","local","dive","bar","Ricky","stumble","on","Henry","who","be","be","have","a","affair",".","suddenly","a","glimmer","of","hope","emerge",".","Tim",",","swallow","he","pride","and","take","note","of","Henry","'s","way","of","business","use","the","newfound","information","to","blackmail","Henry","and","set","thing","straight","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tim

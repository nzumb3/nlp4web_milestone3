{"title":"OMG: Oh My God!","plot":"Kanji Lalji Mehta, though an atheist, owns a small shop selling religious goods, concocting cock-and-bull stories to extract higher fees from his customers for his wares. When, in openly defying God, an earthquake destroys his (and only his) only source of income, with the insurance company refusing to pay up on the basis of it being an 'act of God', Kanjibhai takes God to the court. With many similarly unfortunate people pinning their hopes to him, Kanji's lack of courtroom experience may leave him unable to prove his point - that is, until approached by a man introducing himself as Krishna Vasudeva Yadav. Krishna helps Kanji win his case, his family and helps him find his faith in God, along the way showing how priests can turn religion into a business and that God can be found everywhere, particularly in a house of worship.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["Kanji","Lalji","Mehta",",","though","an","atheist",",","own","a","small","shop","sell","religi","good",",","concoct","cock-and-bul","stori","to","extract","higher","fee","from","his","custom","for","his","ware",".","When",",","in","open","defi","God",",","an","earthquak","destroy","his","(","and","onli","his",")","onli","sourc","of","incom",",","with","the","insur","compani","refus","to","pay","up","on","the","basi","of","it","be","an","'","act","of","God","'",",","Kanjibhai","take","God","to","the","court",".","With","mani","similar","unfortun","peopl","pin","their","hope","to","him",",","Kanji","'s","lack","of","courtroom","experi","may","leav","him","unabl","to","prove","his","point","-","that","is",",","until","approach","by","a","man","introduc","himself","as","Krishna","Vasudeva","Yadav",".","Krishna","help","Kanji","win","his","case",",","his","famili","and","help","him","find","his","faith","in","God",",","along","the","way","show","how","priest","can","turn","religion","into","a","busi","and","that","God","can","be","found","everywher",",","particular","in","a","hous","of","worship","."],"lemmas":["Kanji","Lalji","Mehta",",","though","a","atheist",",","own","a","small","shop","sell","religious","goods",",","concoct","cock-and-bull","story","to","extract","higher","fee","from","he","customer","for","he","wares",".","when",",","in","openly","defy","God",",","a","earthquake","destroy","he","-lrb-","and","only","he","-rrb-","only","source","of","income",",","with","the","insurance","company","refuse","to","pay","up","on","the","basis","of","it","be","a","'","act","of","God","'",",","Kanjibhai","take","God","to","the","court",".","with","many","similarly","unfortunate","people","pin","they","hope","to","he",",","Kanji","'s","lack","of","courtroom","experience","may","leave","he","unable","to","prove","he","point","-","that","be",",","until","approach","by","a","man","introduce","himself","as","Krishna","Vasudeva","Yadav",".","Krishna","help","Kanji","win","he","case",",","he","family","and","help","he","find","he","faith","in","God",",","along","the","way","show","how","priest","can","turn","religion","into","a","business","and","that","God","can","be","find","everywhere",",","particularly","in","a","house","of","worship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kanji Lalji Mehta","Lalji Mehta ,","Mehta , though",", though an","though an atheist","an atheist ,","atheist , owns",", owns a","owns a small","a small shop","small shop selling","shop selling religious","selling religious goods","religious goods ,","goods , concocting",", concocting cock-and-bull","concocting cock-and-bull stories","cock-and-bull stories to","stories to extract","to extract higher","extract higher fees","higher fees from","fees from his","from his customers","his customers for","customers for his","for his wares","When , in",", in openly","in openly defying","openly defying God","defying God ,","God , an",", an earthquake","an earthquake destroys","earthquake destroys his","destroys his (","his ( and","( and only","and only his","only his )","his ) only",") only source","only source of","source of income","of income ,","income , with",", with the","with the insurance","the insurance company","insurance company refusing","company refusing to","refusing to pay","to pay up","pay up on","up on the","on the basis","the basis of","basis of it","of it being","it being an","being an '","an ' act","' act of","act of God","of God '","God ' ,","' , Kanjibhai",", Kanjibhai takes","Kanjibhai takes God","takes God to","God to the","to the court","With many similarly","many similarly unfortunate","similarly unfortunate people","unfortunate people pinning","people pinning their","pinning their hopes","their hopes to","hopes to him","to him ,","him , Kanji",", Kanji 's","Kanji 's lack","'s lack of","lack of courtroom","of courtroom experience","courtroom experience may","experience may leave","may leave him","leave him unable","him unable to","unable to prove","to prove his","prove his point","his point -","point -

{"title":"I'm Crazy About Iris Blond","plot":"Romeo, a lovelorn Roman musician in his 40s with 20 years since his only hit, consults a fortuneteller who predicts he'll find love and money with a foreign singer named for a flower. In Brussels he meets Marguerite, an older chanteuse who interprets Jacques Brel and loves her yappy dog. Then, late one night, while binging on burgers, he meets Iris, 25, a waitress, free spirit, poet and singer who sleeps with a new man nearly every night. Romeo falls for her, and, better, he puts her poems to music. They form an act. He moves in with her and pays all the bills. She insists it's business, with no romance. What will happen when an important producer hears them perform?","genres":["Comedy","

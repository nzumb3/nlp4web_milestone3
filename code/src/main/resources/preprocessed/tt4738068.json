Most people have forgotten that night but something still lurks in the woods. Land owner, Tom Shelton, rents out his adjoining property to an Army buddy's son and his friends for a long weekend of fun and parties. But it becomes a far different three-day weekend for these young adults.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Thirti","year","ago","a","women","set","fire","to","her","own","hous","with","her","famili","still","insid",".","\"","The","Williamsburg","Murder",",","\"","as","they","have","come","to","be","known",",","are","part","of","the","town","'s","legend",",","folklor",",","and","horribl","past",".","Most","peopl","have","forgotten","that","night","but","someth","still","lurk","in","the","wood",".","Land","owner",",","Tom","Shelton",",","rent","out","his","adjoin","properti","to","an","Armi","buddi","'s","son","and","his","friend","for","a","long","weekend","of","fun","and","parti",".","But","it","becom","a","far","differ","three-day","weekend","for","these","young","adult","."],"lemmas":["thirty","year","ago","a","woman","set","fire","to","she","own","house","with","she","family","still","inside",".","``","the","Williamsburg","Murders",",","''","as","they","have","come","to","be","know",",","be","part","of","the","town","'s","legend",",","folklore",",","and","horrible","past",".","most","people","have","forget","that","night","but","something","still","lurk","in","the","wood",".","land","owner",",","Tom","Shelton",",","rent","out","he","adjoining","property","to","a","Army","buddy","'s","son","and","he","friend","for","a","long","weekend","of","fun","and","party",".","but","it","become","a","far","different","three-day","weekend","for","these","young","adult","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Thirty years ago","years ago a","ago a women","a women set","women set fire","set fire to","fire to her","to her own","her own house","own house with","house with her","with her family","her family still","family still inside","\" The Williamsburg","The Williamsburg Murders","Williamsburg Murders ,","Murders , \"",", \" as","\" as they","as they have","they have come","have come to","come to be","to be known","be known ,","known , are",", are part","are part of","part of the","of the town","the town 's","town 's legend","'s legend ,","legend , folklore",", folklore ,","folklore , and",", and horrible","and horrible past","Most people have","people have forgotten","have forgotten that","forgotten that night","that night but","night but something","but something still","something still lurks","still lurks in","lurks in the","in the woods","Land owner ,","owner , Tom",", Tom Shelton","Tom Shelton ,","Shelton , rents",", rents out","rents out his","out his adjoining","his adjoining property","adjoining property to","property to an","to an Army","an Army buddy","Army buddy 's","buddy 's son","'s son and","son and his","and his friends","his friends for","friends for a","for a long","a long weekend","long weekend of","weekend of fun","of fun and","fun and parties","But it becomes","it becomes a","becomes a far","a far different","far different three-day","different three-day weekend","three-day weekend for","weekend for these","for these young","these young adults"],"2grams":["Thirty years","years ago","ago a","a women","women set","set fire","fire to","to her","her own","own house","house with","with her","her family","family still","still inside","\" The","The Williamsburg","Williamsburg Murders","Murders ,",", \"","\" as","as they","they have","have come","come to","to be","be known","known ,",", are","are part","part of","of the","the town","town 's","'s legend","legend ,",", folklore","folklore ,",", and","and horrible","horrible past","Most people","people have","have forgotten","forgotten that","that night","night but","but something","something still","still lurks","lurks in","in the","the woods","Land owner","owner ,",", Tom","Tom Shelton","Shelton ,",", rents","rents out","out his","his adjoining","adjoining property","property to","to an","an Army","Army buddy","buddy 's","'s son","son and","and his","his friends","friends for","for a","a long","long weekend","weekend of","of fun","fun and","and parties","But it","it becomes","becomes a","a far","far different","different three-day","three-day weekend","weekend for","for these","these young","young adults"]}

{"title":"Killers","plot":"The James boys, two of America's most media-oriented killers, Odessa and Kyle have escaped from San Quentin's Death Row. In the midst of a fierce storm and pursued by law-enforcement officers, they find sanctuary by bursting in on and taking hostage the ideal American family, or so they think. After they discover that the daughters are two of their biggest fans, the mother isn't quite what she seems, and the father is perhaps more than their equal, the killers realize the cops are the least of their worries. And as the rain pours down and the dragnet moves closer, the question that emerges is, \"Will the killers ever see the light of day?\"","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["The","Jame","boy",",","two","of","America","'s","most","media-ori","killer",",","Odessa","and","Kyle","have","escap","from","San","Quentin","'s","Death","Row",".","In","the","midst","of","a","fierc","storm","and","pursu","by","law-enforc","offic",",","they","find","sanctuari","by","burst","in","on","and","take","hostag","the","ideal","American","famili",",","or","so","they","think",".","After","they","discov","that","the","daughter","are","two","of","their","biggest","fan",",","the","mother","is","n't","quit","what","she","seem",",","and","the","father","is","perhap","more","than","their","equal",",","the","killer","realiz","the","cop","are","the","least","of","their","worri",".","And","as","the","rain","pour","down","and","the","dragnet","move","closer",",","the","question","that","emerg","is",",","\"","Will","the","killer","ever","see","the","light","of","day","?","\""],"lemmas":["the","James","boy",",","two","of","America","'s","most","media-oriented","killer",",","Odessa","and","Kyle","have","escape","from","San","Quentin","'s","Death","Row",".","in","the","midst","of","a","fierce","storm","and","pursue","by","law-enforcement","officer",",","they","find","sanctuary","by","burst","in","on","and","take","hostage","the","ideal","american","family",",","or","so","they","think",".","after","they","discover","that","the","daughter","be","two","of","they","biggest","fan",",","the","mother","be","not","quite","what","she","seem",",","and","the","father","be","perhaps","more","than","they","equal",",","the","killer","realize","the","cop","be","the","least","of","they","worry",".","and","as","the","rain","pour","down","and","the","dragnet","move","closer",",","the","question","that","emerge","be",",","``","will","the","killer","ever","see","the","light","of","day","?","''"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The James boys","James boys ,","boys , two",", two of","two of America","of America 's","America 's most","'s most media-oriented","most media-oriented killers","media-oriented killers ,","killers , Odessa",", Odessa and","Odessa and Kyle","and Kyle have","Kyle have escaped","have escaped from","escaped from San","from San Quentin","San Quentin 's","Quentin 's Death","'s Death Row","In the midst","the midst of","midst of a","of a fierce","a fierce storm","fierce storm and","storm and pursued","and pursued by","pursued by law-enforcement","by law-enforcement officers","law-enforcement officers ,","officers , they",", they find","they find sanctuary","find sanctuary by","sanctuary by bursting","by bursting in","bursting in on","in on and","on and taking","and taking hostage","taking hostage the","hostage the ideal","the ideal American","ideal American family","American family ,","family , or",", or so","or so they","so they think","After they discover","they discover that","discover that the","that the daughters","the daughters are","daughters are two","are two of","two of their","of their biggest","their biggest fans","biggest fans ,","fans , the",", the mother","the mother is","mother is n't","is n't quite","n't quite what","quite what she","what she seems","she seems ,","seems , and",", and the","and the father","the father is","father is perhaps","is perhaps more","perhaps more than","more than their","than their equal","their equal ,","equal , the",", the killers","the killers realize","killers realize the","realize the cops","the cops are","cops are the","are the least","the least of","least of their","of their worries","And as the","as the rain","the rain pours","rain pours down","pours down and","down and the","and the dragnet","the dragnet moves","dragnet moves closer","moves closer ,","closer , the",", the question","the question that","question that emerges","that emerges is","emerges is ,","is , \"",", \" Will","\" Will the","Will the killers","the killers ever","killers ever see","ever see the","see the light","the light of","light of day","of day ?","day ?

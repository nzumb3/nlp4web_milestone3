{"title":"Slapdash","plot":"Slapdash is the story of a recalcitrant magic troupe that has more interest in their next drink than their next performance. While staying at a motel in Northern California, Mac, an impetuous clown, and Laslo, a talentless magician, meet Rebecca, a stranded cocktail waitress. Their gin soaked lives take an unexpected turn when Rebecca accidentally gives an elderly man a heart attack in the room next door. Panicking, Rebecca convinces Mac and Laslo to move the body. However, their good intentions are interrupted when a hockey bag full of marijuana is discovered in the room. After swapping the corpse for the weed, a comedy of errors ensues as the magic troupe heads to San Francisco and unwittingly tries to sell their acquisition back to the original owners.","genres":["Comedy","

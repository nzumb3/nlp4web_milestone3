{"title":"Intern Academy","plot":"The St. Albert's Teaching Hospital, considered the worst in the public health system and administrated by the corrupt Dr. Cyrill Kipp, receives a new group of interns: the clumsy Mike Bonnert, whose parents are prominent doctors and forced him to study in medical school; the wolf Dale Dodd, who has come to the hospital to meet women and falls in love for the nurse Cynthia Skyes; Marlon Thomas, who like to play pranks with his mates; Mira Towers, who aims to be a great surgeon; Christine Lee, a very efficient student and promising doctor; and Mitzi Cole, who works as stripper to pay for her medical school and becomes Mike's girlfriend. Leaded by Sarah Calder, the group spends the year learning how to become medical doctors in an environment of lots of confusion.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["The","St.","Albert","'s","Teach","Hospit",",","consid","the","worst","in","the","public","health","system","and","administr","by","the","corrupt","Dr.","Cyril","Kipp",",","receiv","a","new","group","of","intern",":","the","clumsi","Mike","Bonnert",",","whose","parent","are","promin","doctor","and","forc","him","to","studi","in","medic","school",";","the","wolf","Dale","Dodd",",","who","has","come","to","the","hospit","to","meet","women","and","fall","in","love","for","the","nurs","Cynthia","Skye",";","Marlon","Thoma",",","who","like","to","play","prank","with","his","mate",";","Mira","Tower",",","who","aim","to","be","a","great","surgeon",";","Christin","Lee",",","a","veri","effici","student","and","promis","doctor",";","and","Mitzi","Cole",",","who","work","as","stripper","to","pay","for","her","medic","school","and","becom","Mike","'s","girlfriend",".","Lead","by","Sarah","Calder",",","the","group","spend","the","year","learn","how","to","becom","medic","doctor","in","an","environ","of","lot","of","confus","."],"lemmas":["the","St.","Albert","'s","Teaching","Hospital",",","consider","the","worst","in","the","public","health","system","and","administrate","by","the","corrupt","Dr.","Cyrill","Kipp",",","receive","a","new","group","of","intern",":","the","clumsy","Mike","Bonnert",",","whose","parent","be","prominent","doctor","and","force","he","to","study","in","medical","school",";","the","wolf","Dale","Dodd",",","who","have","come","to","the","hospital","to","meet","woman","and","fall","in","love","for","the","nurse","Cynthia","Skyes",";","Marlon","Thomas",",","who","like","to","play","prank","with","he","mate",";","Mira","Towers",",","who","aim","to","be","a","great","surgeon",";","Christine","Lee",",","a","very","efficient","student","and","promising","doctor",";","and","Mitzi","Cole",",","who","work","as","stripper","to","pay","for","she","medical","school","and","become","Mike","'s","girlfriend",".","lead","by","Sarah","Calder",",","the","group","spend","the","year","learn","how","to","become","medical","doctor","in","a","environment","of","lot","of","confusion","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The St. Albert","St. Albert 's","Albert 's Teaching","'s Teaching Hospital","Teaching Hospital ,","Hospital , considered",", considered the","considered the worst","the worst in","worst in the","in the public","the public health","public health system","health system and","system and administrated","and administrated by","administrated by the","by the corrupt","the corrupt Dr.","corrupt Dr. Cyrill","Dr. Cyrill Kipp","Cyrill Kipp ,","Kipp , receives",", receives a","receives a new","a new group","new group of","group of interns","of interns :","interns : the",": the clumsy","the clumsy Mike","clumsy Mike Bonnert","Mike Bonnert ,","Bonnert , whose",", whose parents","whose parents are","parents are prominent","are prominent doctors","prominent doctors and","doctors and forced","and forced him","forced him to","him to study","to study in","study in medical","in medical school","medical school ;","school ;

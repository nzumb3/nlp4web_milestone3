{"title":"Citizen Mayor","plot":"Seven individuals from all walks of life have one thing in common, to be the next mayor of Seattle. Political experience is negligible or non-existent; financial resources are slim. Can passion and determination be enough to overcome the raw power of money and establishment? Out of a pack of underdog candidates, will one emerge against all odds as the next mayor of Seattle in 2009? Up close interviews reveal their naiveté, hopes and dreams, and fears and concerns as the race progresses. As the election draws near and the stakes rise, viewers will be captivated by the bike-riding idealist and environmentalist Mike McGinn, who is consistently out-funded and out-spent by heavy-weight contenders. Commentaries from political pundits weigh the struggles and consequences throughout.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["Seven","individu","from","all","walk","of","life","have","one","thing","in","common",",","to","be","the","next","mayor","of","Seattl",".","Polit","experi","is","neglig","or","non-exist",";","financi","resourc","are","slim",".","Can","passion","and","determin","be","enough","to","overcom","the","raw","power","of","money","and","establish","?","Out","of","a","pack","of","underdog","candid",",","will","one","emerg","against","all","odd","as","the","next","mayor","of","Seattl","in","2009","?","Up","close","interview","reveal","their","naiveté",",","hope","and","dream",",","and","fear","and","concern","as","the","race","progress",".","As","the","elect","draw","near","and","the","stake","rise",",","viewer","will","be","captiv","by","the","bike-rid","idealist","and","environmentalist","Mike","McGinn",",","who","is","consist","out-fund","and","out-spent","by","heavy-weight","contend",".","Commentari","from","polit","pundit","weigh","the","struggl","and","consequ","throughout","."],"lemmas":["seven","individual","from","all","walk","of","life","have","one","thing","in","common",",","to","be","the","next","mayor","of","Seattle",".","political","experience","be","negligible","or","non-existent",";","financial","resource","be","slim",".","can","passion","and","determination","be","enough","to","overcome","the","raw","power","of","money","and","establishment","?","out","of","a","pack","of","underdog","candidate",",","will","one","emerge","against","all","odds","as","the","next","mayor","of","Seattle","in","2009","?","up","close","interview","reveal","they","naiveté",",","hope","and","dream",",","and","fear","and","concern","as","the","race","progress",".","as","the","election","draw","near","and","the","stake","rise",",","viewer","will","be","captivate","by","the","bike-riding","idealist","and","environmentalist","Mike","McGinn",",","who","be","consistently","out-funded","and","out-spent","by","heavy-weight","contender",".","commentary","from","political","pundit","weigh","the","struggle","and","consequence","throughout","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Seven individuals from","individuals from all","from all walks","all walks of","walks of life","of life have","life have one","have one thing","one thing in","thing in common","in common ,","common , to",", to be","to be the","be the next","the next mayor","next mayor of","mayor of Seattle","Political experience is","experience is negligible","is negligible or","negligible or non-existent","or non-existent ;","non-existent ;

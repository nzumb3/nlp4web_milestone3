{"title":"Baseline","plot":"The Baseline is the centre of the East London grime club scene and the queue regularly stretches around the block. Danny works on the door - breaking up fights and managing drunk kids. However, when he rescues Terry, the club owner and local gang leader, from a hitman, Danny is suddenly plunged deep into an underworld he had tried so hard to avoid. Danny is promoted to manager, but only on the condition that he turns a blind eye to the shady goings on both on and off the dance-floor. Danny and his girlfriend Jessica dream of setting up their own club, but Danny is forced to make the ultimate sacrifice when he has to choose between loyalty, morality and his own dreams of escape.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["The","Baselin","is","the","centr","of","the","East","London","grime","club","scene","and","the","queue","regular","stretch","around","the","block",".","Danni","work","on","the","door","-","break","up","fight","and","manag","drunk","kid",".","Howev",",","when","he","rescu","Terri",",","the","club","owner","and","local","gang","leader",",","from","a","hitman",",","Danni","is","sudden","plung","deep","into","an","underworld","he","had","tri","so","hard","to","avoid",".","Danni","is","promot","to","manag",",","but","onli","on","the","condit","that","he","turn","a","blind","eye","to","the","shadi","go","on","both","on","and","off","the","dance-floor",".","Danni","and","his","girlfriend","Jessica","dream","of","set","up","their","own","club",",","but","Danni","is","forc","to","make","the","ultim","sacrific","when","he","has","to","choos","between","loyalti",",","moral","and","his","own","dream","of","escap","."],"lemmas":["the","Baseline","be","the","centre","of","the","East","London","grime","club","scene","and","the","queue","regularly","stretch","around","the","block",".","Danny","work","on","the","door","-","break","up","fight","and","manage","drunk","kid",".","however",",","when","he","rescue","Terry",",","the","club","owner","and","local","gang","leader",",","from","a","hitman",",","Danny","be","suddenly","plunge","deep","into","a","underworld","he","have","try","so","hard","to","avoid",".","Danny","be","promote","to","manager",",","but","only","on","the","condition","that","he","turn","a","blind","eye","to","the","shady","going","on","both","on","and","off","the","dance-floor",".","Danny","and","he","girlfriend","Jessica","dream","of","set","up","they","own","club",",","but","Danny","be","force","to","make","the","ultimate","sacrifice","when","he","have","to","choose","between","loyalty",",","morality","and","he","own","dream","of","escape","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Baseline is","Baseline is the","is the centre","the centre of","centre of the","of the East","the East London","East London grime","London grime club","grime club scene","club scene and","scene and the","and the queue","the queue regularly","queue regularly stretches","regularly stretches around","stretches around the","around the block","Danny works on","works on the","on the door","the door -","door -

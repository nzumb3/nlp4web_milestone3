{"title":"Grumpier Old Men","plot":"Things don't seem to change much in Wabasha County: Max and John are still fighting after 35 years, Grandpa still drinks, smokes, and chases women , and nobody's been able to catch the fabled \"Catfish Hunter\", a gigantic catfish that actually smiles at fishermen who try to snare it. Six months ago John married the new girl in town (Ariel), and people begin to suspect that Max might be missing something similar in his life. The only joy Max claims is left in his life is fishing, but that might change with the new owner of the bait shop.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Thing","do","n't","seem","to","chang","much","in","Wabasha","Counti",":","Max","and","John","are","still","fight","after","35","year",",","Grandpa","still","drink",",","smoke",",","and","chase","women",",","and","nobodi","'s","been","abl","to","catch","the","fabl","\"","Catfish","Hunter","\"",",","a","gigant","catfish","that","actual","smile","at","fishermen","who","tri","to","snare","it",".","Six","month","ago","John","marri","the","new","girl","in","town","(","Ariel",")",",","and","peopl","begin","to","suspect","that","Max","might","be","miss","someth","similar","in","his","life",".","The","onli","joy","Max","claim","is","left","in","his","life","is","fish",",","but","that","might","chang","with","the","new","owner","of","the","bait","shop","."],"lemmas":["thing","do","not","seem","to","change","much","in","Wabasha","County",":","Max","and","John","be","still","fight","after","35","year",",","Grandpa","still","drink",",","smoke",",","and","chase","woman",",","and","nobody","'s","be","able","to","catch","the","fabled","``","Catfish","Hunter","''",",","a","gigantic","catfish","that","actually","smile","at","fisherman","who","try","to","snare","it",".","six","month","ago","John","marry","the","new","girl","in","town","-lrb-","Ariel","-rrb-",",","and","people","begin","to","suspect","that","Max","might","be","miss","something","similar","in","he","life",".","the","only","joy","max","claim","be","leave","in","he","life","be","fishing",",","but","that","might","change","with","the","new","owner","of","the","bait","shop","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Things do n't","do n't seem","n't seem to","seem to change","to change much","change much in","much in Wabasha","in Wabasha County","Wabasha County :","County : Max",": Max and","Max and John","and John are","John are still","are still fighting","still fighting after","fighting after 35","after 35 years","35 years ,","years , Grandpa",", Grandpa still","Grandpa still drinks","still drinks ,","drinks , smokes",", smokes ,","smokes , and",", and chases","and chases women","chases women ,","women , and",", and nobody","and nobody 's","nobody 's been","'s been able","been able to","able to catch","to catch the","catch the fabled","the fabled \"","fabled \" Catfish","\" Catfish Hunter","Catfish Hunter \"","Hunter \" ,","\" , a",", a gigantic","a gigantic catfish","gigantic catfish that","catfish that actually","that actually smiles","actually smiles at","smiles at fishermen","at fishermen who","fishermen who try","who try to","try to snare","to snare it","Six months ago","months ago John","ago John married","John married the","married the new","the new girl","new girl in","girl in town","in town (","town ( Ariel","( Ariel )","Ariel ) ,",") , and",", and people","and people begin","people begin to","begin to suspect","to suspect that","suspect that Max","that Max might","Max might be","might be missing","be missing something","missing something similar","something similar in","similar in his","in his life","The only joy","only joy Max","joy Max claims","Max claims is","claims is left","is left in","left in his","in his life","his life is","life is fishing","is fishing ,","fishing , but",", but that","but that might","that might change","might change with","change with the","with the new","the new owner","new owner of","owner of the","of the bait","the bait shop"],"2grams":["Things do","do n't","n't seem","seem to","to change","change much","much in","in Wabasha","Wabasha County","County :",": Max","Max and","and John","John are","are still","still fighting","fighting after","after 35","35 years","years ,",", Grandpa","Grandpa still","still drinks","drinks ,",", smokes","smokes ,",", and","and chases","chases women","women ,",", and","and nobody","nobody 's","'s been","been able","able to","to catch","catch the","the fabled","fabled \"","\" Catfish","Catfish Hunter","Hunter \"","\" ,",", a","a gigantic","gigantic catfish","catfish that","that actually","actually smiles","smiles at","at fishermen","fishermen who","who try","try to","to snare","snare it","Six months","months ago","ago John","John married","married the","the new","new girl","girl in","in town","town (","( Ariel","Ariel )",") ,",", and","and people","people begin","begin to","to suspect","suspect that","that Max","Max might","might be","be missing","missing something","something similar","similar in","in his","his life","The only","only joy","joy Max","Max claims","claims is","is left","left in","in his","his life","life is","is fishing","fishing ,",", but","but that","that might","might change","change with","with the","the new","new owner","owner of","of the","the bait","bait shop"]}

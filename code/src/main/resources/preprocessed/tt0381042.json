{"title":"The Occupied","plot":"De besatte portrays a year in the life of five Palestinians. Woven into the tales of their background, the story is a documentary on the history of the Palestinian people since they lost their country in 1948 and had even more land occupied in 1967. De besatte is not only about the physical occupation. It is a film about the emotional occupation that kills all dreams, and about the demons that the occupation lets loose and which threatens to take away a person's humanity, where the executioner and the victim constantly take each other's role.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["De","besatt","portray","a","year","in","the","life","of","five","Palestinian",".","Woven","into","the","tale","of","their","background",",","the","stori","is","a","documentari","on","the","histori","of","the","Palestinian","peopl","sinc","they","lost","their","countri","in","1948","and","had","even","more","land","occupi","in","1967",".","De","besatt","is","not","onli","about","the","physic","occup",".","It","is","a","film","about","the","emot","occup","that","kill","all","dream",",","and","about","the","demon","that","the","occup","let","loos","and","which","threaten","to","take","away","a","person","'s","human",",","where","the","execution","and","the","victim","constant","take","each","other","'s","role","."],"lemmas":["De","besatte","portray","a","year","in","the","life","of","five","Palestinians",".","weave","into","the","tale","of","they","background",",","the","story","be","a","documentary","on","the","history","of","the","palestinian","people","since","they","lose","they","country","in","1948","and","have","even","more","land","occupy","in","1967",".","De","besatte","be","not","only","about","the","physical","occupation",".","it","be","a","film","about","the","emotional","occupation","that","kill","all","dream",",","and","about","the","demon","that","the","occupation","let","loose","and","which","threaten","to","take","away","a","person","'s","humanity",",","where","the","executioner","and","the","victim","constantly","take","each","other","'s","role","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["De besatte portrays","besatte portrays a","portrays a year","a year in","year in the","in the life","the life of","life of five","of five Palestinians","Woven into the","into the tales","the tales of","tales of their","of their background","their background ,","background , the",", the story","the story is","story is a","is a documentary","a documentary on","documentary on the","on the history","the history of","history of the","of the Palestinian","the Palestinian people","Palestinian people since","people since they","since they lost","they lost their","lost their country","their country in","country in 1948","in 1948 and","1948 and had","and had even","had even more","even more land","more land occupied","land occupied in","occupied in 1967","De besatte is","besatte is not","is not only","not only about","only about the","about the physical","the physical occupation","It is a","is a film","a film about","film about the","about the emotional","the emotional occupation","emotional occupation that","occupation that kills","that kills all","kills all dreams","all dreams ,","dreams , and",", and about","and about the","about the demons","the demons that","demons that the","that the occupation","the occupation lets","occupation lets loose","lets loose and","loose and which","and which threatens","which threatens to","threatens to take","to take away","take away a","away a person","a person 's","person 's humanity","'s humanity ,","humanity , where",", where the","where the executioner","the executioner and","executioner and the","and the victim","the victim constantly","victim constantly take","constantly take each","take each other","each other 's","other 's role"],"2grams":["De besatte","besatte portrays","portrays a","a year","year in","in the","the life","life of","of five","five Palestinians","Woven into","into the","the tales","tales of","of their","their background","background ,",", the","the story","story is","is a","a documentary","documentary on","on the","the history","history of","of the","the Palestinian","Palestinian people","people since","since they","they lost","lost their","their country","country in","in 1948","1948 and","and had","had even","even more","more land","land occupied","occupied in","in 1967","De besatte","besatte is","is not","not only","only about","about the","the physical","physical occupation","It is","is a","a film","film about","about the","the emotional","emotional occupation","occupation that","that kills","kills all","all dreams","dreams ,",", and","and about","about the","the demons","demons that","that the","the occupation","occupation lets","lets loose","loose and","and which","which threatens","threatens to","to take","take away","away a","a person","person 's","'s humanity","humanity ,",", where","where the","the executioner","executioner and","and the","the victim","victim constantly","constantly take","take each","each other","other 's","'s role"]}

{"title":"Get a Life","plot":"Two filmmakers discover an unknown, lethal disease, that hits children in the remote parts of Africa. In dusty villages in the outskirts of the Sahara desert, they find the victims of this horrible illness. The filmmakers now think that they will simply portray reality professionally, as they usually do. But instead, they are personally drawn to the struggle of saving the children. During the shooting they are forced to take a stand in crucial dilemmas: Third World poverty, exploitation of the weakest and most ill people in the developing countries, and the ultimate in life; Death. At the same time it is a film about the morale of filmmakers.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Two","filmmak","discov","an","unknown",",","lethal","diseas",",","that","hit","children","in","the","remot","part","of","Africa",".","In","dusti","villag","in","the","outskirt","of","the","Sahara","desert",",","they","find","the","victim","of","this","horribl","ill",".","The","filmmak","now","think","that","they","will","simpli","portray","realiti","profession",",","as","they","usual","do",".","But","instead",",","they","are","person","drawn","to","the","struggl","of","save","the","children",".","Dure","the","shoot","they","are","forc","to","take","a","stand","in","crucial","dilemma",":","Third","World","poverti",",","exploit","of","the","weakest","and","most","ill","peopl","in","the","develop","countri",",","and","the","ultim","in","life",";","Death",".","At","the","same","time","it","is","a","film","about","the","moral","of","filmmak","."],"lemmas":["two","filmmaker","discover","a","unknown",",","lethal","disease",",","that","hit","child","in","the","remote","part","of","Africa",".","in","dusty","village","in","the","outskirts","of","the","Sahara","desert",",","they","find","the","victim","of","this","horrible","illness",".","the","filmmaker","now","think","that","they","will","simply","portray","reality","professionally",",","as","they","usually","do",".","but","instead",",","they","be","personally","draw","to","the","struggle","of","save","the","child",".","during","the","shooting","they","be","force","to","take","a","stand","in","crucial","dilemma",":","Third","World","poverty",",","exploitation","of","the","weakest","and","most","ill","people","in","the","develop","country",",","and","the","ultimate","in","life",";","Death",".","at","the","same","time","it","be","a","film","about","the","morale","of","filmmaker","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Two filmmakers discover","filmmakers discover an","discover an unknown","an unknown ,","unknown , lethal",", lethal disease","lethal disease ,","disease , that",", that hits","that hits children","hits children in","children in the","in the remote","the remote parts","remote parts of","parts of Africa","In dusty villages","dusty villages in","villages in the","in the outskirts","the outskirts of","outskirts of the","of the Sahara","the Sahara desert","Sahara desert ,","desert , they",", they find","they find the","find the victims","the victims of","victims of this","of this horrible","this horrible illness","The filmmakers now","filmmakers now think","now think that","think that they","that they will","they will simply","will simply portray","simply portray reality","portray reality professionally","reality professionally ,","professionally , as",", as they","as they usually","they usually do","But instead ,","instead , they",", they are","they are personally","are personally drawn","personally drawn to","drawn to the","to the struggle","the struggle of","struggle of saving","of saving the","saving the children","During the shooting","the shooting they","shooting they are","they are forced","are forced to","forced to take","to take a","take a stand","a stand in","stand in crucial","in crucial dilemmas","crucial dilemmas :","dilemmas : Third",": Third World","Third World poverty","World poverty ,","poverty , exploitation",", exploitation of","exploitation of the","of the weakest","the weakest and","weakest and most","and most ill","most ill people","ill people in","people in the","in the developing","the developing countries","developing countries ,","countries , and",", and the","and the ultimate","the ultimate in","ultimate in life","in life ;","life ;

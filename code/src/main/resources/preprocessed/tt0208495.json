{"title":"Taken","plot":"Wealthy manufacturer Ethan Grover is being held for $2,000,000 ransom; his wife (who stands to inherit the company and collect on a huge life insurance policy) is reluctant to pay. Alan, the company's V.P. with whom she's been having an affair, urges her to get the money, but he may have ulterior motives. Along with Syd, the company's CFO, Alan's been investing company funds off the books to make a quick buck. Syd has his own problems, so he wouldn't mind seeing Ethan dead. Alarmed by his wife's indifference, Ethan has to figure out how to help the kidnaper get the ransom so he can get free. Can he pull it off while he's tied to a chair in an abandoned warehouse?","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Wealthi","manufactur","Ethan","Grover","is","be","held","for","$","2,000,000","ransom",";","his","wife","(","who","stand","to","inherit","the","compani","and","collect","on","a","huge","life","insur","polici",")","is","reluct","to","pay",".","Alan",",","the","compani","'s","V.P.","with","whom","she","'s","been","have","an","affair",",","urg","her","to","get","the","money",",","but","he","may","have","ulterior","motiv",".","Along","with","Syd",",","the","compani","'s","CFO",",","Alan","'s","been","invest","compani","fund","off","the","book","to","make","a","quick","buck",".","Syd","has","his","own","problem",",","so","he","would","n't","mind","see","Ethan","dead",".","Alarm","by","his","wife","'s","indiffer",",","Ethan","has","to","figur","out","how","to","help","the","kidnap","get","the","ransom","so","he","can","get","free",".","Can","he","pull","it","off","while","he","'s","tie","to","a","chair","in","an","abandon","warehous","?"],"lemmas":["wealthy","manufacturer","Ethan","Grover","be","be","hold","for","$","2,000,000","ransom",";","he","wife","-lrb-","who","stand","to","inherit","the","company","and","collect","on","a","huge","life","insurance","policy","-rrb-","be","reluctant","to","pay",".","Alan",",","the","company","'s","V.P.","with","whom","she","be","be","have","a","affair",",","urge","she","to","get","the","money",",","but","he","may","have","ulterior","motive",".","along","with","Syd",",","the","company","'s","CFO",",","Alan","'s","be","invest","company","fund","off","the","book","to","make","a","quick","buck",".","Syd","have","he","own","problem",",","so","he","would","not","mind","see","Ethan","dead",".","alarm","by","he","wife","'s","indifference",",","Ethan","have","to","figure","out","how","to","help","the","kidnaper","get","the","ransom","so","he","can","get","free",".","can","he","pull","it","off","while","he","be","tie","to","a","chair","in","a","abandoned","warehouse","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wealthy manufacturer Ethan","manufacturer Ethan Grover","Ethan Grover is","Grover is being","is being held","being held for","held for $","for $ 2,000,000","$ 2,000,000 ransom","2,000,000 ransom ;","ransom ;

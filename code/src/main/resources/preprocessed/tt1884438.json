{"title":"The British Guide to Showing Off","plot":"British artist and living legend Andrew Logan, loved the world over by celebrities and misfits alike, takes us under his glittering wing and inside his outrageous, anarchic and spectacular costume pageant: the Alternative Miss World Show. As the Shows master of ceremonies and ringmaster, Logan is the high priest of an esteemed congregation. He describes the Show as his most important artwork; a fabulous living sculpture that spans forty years of arts and culture. Using live observational camera, archive and exuberant animation, this documentary charts the mounting of the 2009 Show, interwoven with its history, the rise, fall and rediscovery, of both the event and the artist at its center.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["British","artist","and","live","legend","Andrew","Logan",",","love","the","world","over","by","celebr","and","misfit","alik",",","take","us","under","his","glitter","wing","and","insid","his","outrag",",","anarch","and","spectacular","costum","pageant",":","the","Alternat","Miss","World","Show",".","As","the","Show","master","of","ceremoni","and","ringmast",",","Logan","is","the","high","priest","of","an","esteem","congreg",".","He","describ","the","Show","as","his","most","import","artwork",";","a","fabul","live","sculptur","that","span","forti","year","of","art","and","cultur",".","Using","live","observ","camera",",","archiv","and","exuber","anim",",","this","documentari","chart","the","mount","of","the","2009","Show",",","interwoven","with","it","histori",",","the","rise",",","fall","and","rediscoveri",",","of","both","the","event","and","the","artist","at","it","center","."],"lemmas":["british","artist","and","living","legend","Andrew","Logan",",","love","the","world","over","by","celebrity","and","misfit","alike",",","take","we","under","he","glitter","wing","and","inside","he","outrageous",",","anarchic","and","spectacular","costume","pageant",":","the","Alternative","Miss","World","Show",".","as","the","show","master","of","ceremony","and","ringmaster",",","Logan","be","the","high","priest","of","a","esteemed","congregation",".","he","describe","the","Show","as","he","most","important","artwork",";","a","fabulous","living","sculpture","that","span","forty","year","of","art","and","culture",".","use","live","observational","camera",",","archive","and","exuberant","animation",",","this","documentary","chart","the","mount","of","the","2009","Show",",","interwoven","with","its","history",",","the","rise",",","fall","and","rediscovery",",","of","both","the","event","and","the","artist","at","its","center","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["British artist and","artist and living","and living legend","living legend Andrew","legend Andrew Logan","Andrew Logan ,","Logan , loved",", loved the","loved the world","the world over","world over by","over by celebrities","by celebrities and","celebrities and misfits","and misfits alike","misfits alike ,","alike , takes",", takes us","takes us under","us under his","under his glittering","his glittering wing","glittering wing and","wing and inside","and inside his","inside his outrageous","his outrageous ,","outrageous , anarchic",", anarchic and","anarchic and spectacular","and spectacular costume","spectacular costume pageant","costume pageant :","pageant : the",": the Alternative","the Alternative Miss","Alternative Miss World","Miss World Show","As the Shows","the Shows master","Shows master of","master of ceremonies","of ceremonies and","ceremonies and ringmaster","and ringmaster ,","ringmaster , Logan",", Logan is","Logan is the","is the high","the high priest","high priest of","priest of an","of an esteemed","an esteemed congregation","He describes the","describes the Show","the Show as","Show as his","as his most","his most important","most important artwork","important artwork ;","artwork ;

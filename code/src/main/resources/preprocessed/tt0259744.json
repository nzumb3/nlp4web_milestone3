{"title":"Fleeing by Night","plot":"Set in China in the 1930s, the film is about the unsettling relationship between three characters. Ing'er, the daughter of a theatre-owner, welcomes the return of Shao-dung, her fiancee and a fine cellist from America. Shao-dung soon finds himself captivated by the opera \"Fleeing By Night\" and its celebrated actor, Lin Chung, whose voice seems to articulate something within himself. While Shao-dung attempts to blend eastern and western music, Ing'er becomes torn between her affection for both men, and an awareness of the growing intimacy between them.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Set","in","China","in","the","1930s",",","the","film","is","about","the","unsettl","relationship","between","three","charact",".","Ing","'","er",",","the","daughter","of","a","theatre-own",",","welcom","the","return","of","Shao-dung",",","her","fiance","and","a","fine","cellist","from","America",".","Shao-dung","soon","find","himself","captiv","by","the","opera","\"","Flee","By","Night","\"","and","it","celebr","actor",",","Lin","Chung",",","whose","voic","seem","to","articul","someth","within","himself",".","While","Shao-dung","attempt","to","blend","eastern","and","western","music",",","Ing","'","er","becom","torn","between","her","affect","for","both","men",",","and","an","awar","of","the","grow","intimaci","between","them","."],"lemmas":["set","in","China","in","the","1930",",","the","film","be","about","the","unsettling","relationship","between","three","character",".","Ing","'","er",",","the","daughter","of","a","theatre-owner",",","welcome","the","return","of","shao-dung",",","she","fiancee","and","a","fine","cellist","from","America",".","shao-dung","soon","find","himself","captivate","by","the","opera","``","flee","by","night","''","and","its","celebrated","actor",",","Lin","Chung",",","whose","voice","seem","to","articulate","something","within","himself",".","while","shao-dung","attempt","to","blend","eastern","and","western","music",",","Ing","'","er","become","torn","between","she","affection","for","both","man",",","and","a","awareness","of","the","grow","intimacy","between","they","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Set in China","in China in","China in the","in the 1930s","the 1930s ,","1930s , the",", the film","the film is","film is about","is about the","about the unsettling","the unsettling relationship","unsettling relationship between","relationship between three","between three characters","Ing ' er","' er ,","er , the",", the daughter","the daughter of","daughter of a","of a theatre-owner","a theatre-owner ,","theatre-owner , welcomes",", welcomes the","welcomes the return","the return of","return of Shao-dung","of Shao-dung ,","Shao-dung , her",", her fiancee","her fiancee and","fiancee and a","and a fine","a fine cellist","fine cellist from","cellist from America","Shao-dung soon finds","soon finds himself","finds himself captivated","himself captivated by","captivated by the","by the opera","the opera \"","opera \" Fleeing","\" Fleeing By","Fleeing By Night","By Night \"","Night \" and","\" and its","and its celebrated","its celebrated actor","celebrated actor ,","actor , Lin",", Lin Chung","Lin Chung ,","Chung , whose",", whose voice","whose voice seems","voice seems to","seems to articulate","to articulate something","articulate something within","something within himself","While Shao-dung attempts","Shao-dung attempts to","attempts to blend","to blend eastern","blend eastern and","eastern and western","and western music","western music ,","music , Ing",", Ing '","Ing ' er","' er becomes","er becomes torn","becomes torn between","torn between her","between her affection","her affection for","affection for both","for both men","both men ,","men , and",", and an","and an awareness","an awareness of","awareness of the","of the growing","the growing intimacy","growing intimacy between","intimacy between them"],"2grams":["Set in","in China","China in","in the","the 1930s","1930s ,",", the","the film","film is","is about","about the","the unsettling","unsettling relationship","relationship between","between three","three characters","Ing '","' er","er ,",", the","the daughter","daughter of","of a","a theatre-owner","theatre-owner ,",", welcomes","welcomes the","the return","return of","of Shao-dung","Shao-dung ,",", her","her fiancee","fiancee and","and a","a fine","fine cellist","cellist from","from America","Shao-dung soon","soon finds","finds himself","himself captivated","captivated by","by the","the opera","opera \"","\" Fleeing","Fleeing By","By Night","Night \"","\" and","and its","its celebrated","celebrated actor","actor ,",", Lin","Lin Chung","Chung ,",", whose","whose voice","voice seems","seems to","to articulate","articulate something","something within","within himself","While Shao-dung","Shao-dung attempts","attempts to","to blend","blend eastern","eastern and","and western","western music","music ,",", Ing","Ing '","' er","er becomes","becomes torn","torn between","between her","her affection","affection for","for both","both men","men ,",", and","and an","an awareness","awareness of","of the","the growing","growing intimacy","intimacy between","between them"]}

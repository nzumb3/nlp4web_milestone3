{"title":"The Giraffe","plot":"Lena Katz, who is German, and David Fish, who is American, are Jews who live in New York. When Lena's mother, who arrives from Germany, meets her at a hotel, she finds an almost-dead woman lying on the hotel floor. She accompanies the injured woman to the hospital and meets David, who is the woman's son. After David's mother dies from the injuries, a question remains: was she murdered? The trail leads to Germany. Apparently, Lena's mother has some kind of relationship with David's mother that reaches back into the dark German history of the 1940s.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Lena","Katz",",","who","is","German",",","and","David","Fish",",","who","is","American",",","are","Jew","who","live","in","New","York",".","When","Lena","'s","mother",",","who","arriv","from","Germani",",","meet","her","at","a","hotel",",","she","find","an","almost-dead","woman","lie","on","the","hotel","floor",".","She","accompani","the","injur","woman","to","the","hospit","and","meet","David",",","who","is","the","woman","'s","son",".","After","David","'s","mother","die","from","the","injuri",",","a","question","remain",":","was","she","murder","?","The","trail","lead","to","Germani",".","Apparent",",","Lena","'s","mother","has","some","kind","of","relationship","with","David","'s","mother","that","reach","back","into","the","dark","German","histori","of","the","1940s","."],"lemmas":["Lena","Katz",",","who","be","German",",","and","David","fish",",","who","be","American",",","be","Jews","who","live","in","New","York",".","when","Lena","'s","mother",",","who","arrive","from","Germany",",","meet","she","at","a","hotel",",","she","find","a","almost-dead","woman","lie","on","the","hotel","floor",".","she","accompany","the","injured","woman","to","the","hospital","and","meet","David",",","who","be","the","woman","'s","son",".","after","David","'s","mother","die","from","the","injury",",","a","question","remain",":","be","she","murder","?","the","trail","lead","to","Germany",".","apparently",",","Lena","'s","mother","have","some","kind","of","relationship","with","David","'s","mother","that","reach","back","into","the","dark","german","history","of","the","1940","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lena Katz ,","Katz , who",", who is","who is German","is German ,","German , and",", and David","and David Fish","David Fish ,","Fish , who",", who is","who is American","is American ,","American , are",", are Jews","are Jews who","Jews who live","who live in","live in New","in New York","When Lena 's","Lena 's mother","'s mother ,","mother , who",", who arrives","who arrives from","arrives from Germany","from Germany ,","Germany , meets",", meets her","meets her at","her at a","at a hotel","a hotel ,","hotel , she",", she finds","she finds an","finds an almost-dead","an almost-dead woman","almost-dead woman lying","woman lying on","lying on the","on the hotel","the hotel floor","She accompanies the","accompanies the injured","the injured woman","injured woman to","woman to the","to the hospital","the hospital and","hospital and meets","and meets David","meets David ,","David , who",", who is","who is the","is the woman","the woman 's","woman 's son","After David 's","David 's mother","'s mother dies","mother dies from","dies from the","from the injuries","the injuries ,","injuries , a",", a question","a question remains","question remains :","remains : was",": was she","was she murdered","The trail leads","trail leads to","leads to Germany","Apparently , Lena",", Lena 's","Lena 's mother","'s mother has","mother has some","has some kind","some kind of","kind of relationship","of relationship with","relationship with David","with David 's","David 's mother","'s mother that","mother that reaches","that reaches back","reaches back into","back into the","into the dark","the dark German","dark German history","German history of","history of the","of the 1940s"],"2grams":["Lena Katz","Katz ,",", who","who is","is German","German ,",", and","and David","David Fish","Fish ,",", who","who is","is American","American ,",", are","are Jews","Jews who","who live","live in","in New","New York","When Lena","Lena 's","'s mother","mother ,",", who","who arrives","arrives from","from Germany","Germany ,",", meets","meets her","her at","at a","a hotel","hotel ,",", she","she finds","finds an","an almost-dead","almost-dead woman","woman lying","lying on","on the","the hotel","hotel floor","She accompanies","accompanies the","the injured","injured woman","woman to","to the","the hospital","hospital and","and meets","meets David","David ,",", who","who is","is the","the woman","woman 's","'s son","After David","David 's","'s mother","mother dies","dies from","from the","the injuries","injuries ,",", a","a question","question remains","remains :",": was","was she","she murdered","The trail","trail leads","leads to","to Germany","Apparently ,",", Lena","Lena 's","'s mother","mother has","has some","some kind","kind of","of relationship","relationship with","with David","David 's","'s mother","mother that","that reaches","reaches back","back into","into the","the dark","dark German","German history","history of","of the","the 1940s"]}

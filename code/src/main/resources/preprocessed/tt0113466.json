{"title":"The Interview","plot":"Michael is a U.S. journalist who works for a Brazilian newspaper. One day he is put in charge of interviewing Father Louis Stephen, a famed catholic missionary who helps the needy in the jungles of Brazil. Yet he has one problem: the Father has rarely ever given an interview. However, Michael decides that he will be the first to have interviewed the Father personally, and goes on a journey to the center of Brazil, in search of the priest. Michael will soon know how hard it can be to get an interview, and that the Father's apparent media-shyness has deeper implications than he thought..","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Michael","is","a","U.S.","journalist","who","work","for","a","Brazilian","newspap",".","One","day","he","is","put","in","charg","of","interview","Father","Loui","Stephen",",","a","fame","cathol","missionari","who","help","the","needi","in","the","jungl","of","Brazil",".","Yet","he","has","one","problem",":","the","Father","has","rare","ever","given","an","interview",".","Howev",",","Michael","decid","that","he","will","be","the","first","to","have","interview","the","Father","person",",","and","goe","on","a","journey","to","the","center","of","Brazil",",","in","search","of","the","priest",".","Michael","will","soon","know","how","hard","it","can","be","to","get","an","interview",",","and","that","the","Father","'s","appar","media-shy","has","deeper","implic","than","he","thought",".","."],"lemmas":["Michael","be","a","U.S.","journalist","who","work","for","a","brazilian","newspaper",".","one","day","he","be","put","in","charge","of","interview","Father","Louis","Stephen",",","a","famed","catholic","missionary","who","help","the","needy","in","the","jungle","of","Brazil",".","yet","he","have","one","problem",":","the","Father","have","rarely","ever","give","a","interview",".","however",",","Michael","decide","that","he","will","be","the","first","to","have","interview","the","Father","personally",",","and","go","on","a","journey","to","the","center","of","Brazil",",","in","search","of","the","priest",".","Michael","will","soon","know","how","hard","it","can","be","to","get","a","interview",",","and","that","the","Father","'s","apparent","media-shyness","have","deeper","implication","than","he","think",".","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Michael

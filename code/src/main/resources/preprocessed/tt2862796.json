{"title":"Gregory Frateur, Up Front","plot":"Gregory Frateur, Up Front is a portrait about the young Belgian pop and jazz singer Gregory Frateur, creating his first semi-classical project Saga. Gregory is a special guy, he's more an artist than a musician, he's a self-made man and very ambitious. Sometimes called a diva. The movie is like a painting, we followed him in silence and try to show a young and ambitious person without digging into his personal life.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Gregori","Frateur",",","Up","Front","is","a","portrait","about","the","young","Belgian","pop","and","jazz","singer","Gregori","Frateur",",","creat","his","first","semi-class","project","Saga",".","Gregori","is","a","special","guy",",","he","'s","more","an","artist","than","a","musician",",","he","'s","a","self-mad","man","and","veri","ambiti",".","Sometim","call","a","diva",".","The","movi","is","like","a","paint",",","we","follow","him","in","silenc","and","tri","to","show","a","young","and","ambiti","person","without","dig","into","his","person","life","."],"lemmas":["Gregory","Frateur",",","up","front","be","a","portrait","about","the","young","belgian","pop","and","jazz","singer","Gregory","Frateur",",","create","he","first","semi-classical","project","saga",".","Gregory","be","a","special","guy",",","he","be","more","a","artist","than","a","musician",",","he","be","a","self-made","man","and","very","ambitious",".","sometimes","call","a","diva",".","the","movie","be","like","a","painting",",","we","follow","he","in","silence","and","try","to","show","a","young","and","ambitious","person","without","digging","into","he","personal","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gregory Frateur ,","Frateur , Up",", Up Front","Up Front is","Front is a","is a portrait","a portrait about","portrait about the","about the young","the young Belgian","young Belgian pop","Belgian pop and","pop and jazz","and jazz singer","jazz singer Gregory","singer Gregory Frateur","Gregory Frateur ,","Frateur , creating",", creating his","creating his first","his first semi-classical","first semi-classical project","semi-classical project Saga","Gregory is a","is a special","a special guy","special guy ,","guy , he",", he 's","he 's more","'s more an","more an artist","an artist than","artist than a","than a musician","a musician ,","musician , he",", he 's","he 's a","'s a self-made","a self-made man","self-made man and","man and very","and very ambitious","Sometimes called a","called a diva","The movie is","movie is like","is like a","like a painting","a painting ,","painting , we",", we followed","we followed him","followed him in","him in silence","in silence and","silence and try","and try to","try to show","to show a","show a young","a young and","young and ambitious","and ambitious person","ambitious person without","person without digging","without digging into","digging into his","into his personal","his personal life"],"2grams":["Gregory Frateur","Frateur ,",", Up","Up Front","Front is","is a","a portrait","portrait about","about the","the young","young Belgian","Belgian pop","pop and","and jazz","jazz singer","singer Gregory","Gregory Frateur","Frateur ,",", creating","creating his","his first","first semi-classical","semi-classical project","project Saga","Gregory is","is a","a special","special guy","guy ,",", he","he 's","'s more","more an","an artist","artist than","than a","a musician","musician ,",", he","he 's","'s a","a self-made","self-made man","man and","and very","very ambitious","Sometimes called","called a","a diva","The movie","movie is","is like","like a","a painting","painting ,",", we","we followed","followed him","him in","in silence","silence and","and try","try to","to show","show a","a young","young and","and ambitious","ambitious person","person without","without digging","digging into","into his","his personal","personal life"]}

{"title":"Life Changes","plot":"Hidden in forgotten corners of Palm Beach County, Florida, an epidemic rages with young teens having babies. Almost all mothers are minorities. All are poor. Not one teen mother planned to get pregnant. Invariably, the baby was 'an accident,' or 'it just happened,' or 'it wasn't his/her fault.' The one constant is that none of these girls could survive on their own. 'Life changes' follows four girls from pregnancy to their child's third birthday. One girl got pregnant at 12, another at 13, and two at 16. The younger girls are Latina, and the older girls are African-American and Haitian.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Hidden","in","forgotten","corner","of","Palm","Beach","Counti",",","Florida",",","an","epidem","rage","with","young","teen","have","babi",".","Almost","all","mother","are","minor",".","All","are","poor",".","Not","one","teen","mother","plan","to","get","pregnant",".","Invariabl",",","the","babi","was","'","an","accid",",","'","or","'","it","just","happen",",","'","or","'","it","was","n't","his/her","fault",".","'","The","one","constant","is","that","none","of","these","girl","could","surviv","on","their","own",".","'","Life","chang","'","follow","four","girl","from","pregnanc","to","their","child","'s","third","birthday",".","One","girl","got","pregnant","at","12",",","anoth","at","13",",","and","two","at","16",".","The","younger","girl","are","Latina",",","and","the","older","girl","are","African-American","and","Haitian","."],"lemmas":["hide","in","forget","corner","of","Palm","Beach","County",",","Florida",",","a","epidemic","rage","with","young","teens","have","baby",".","almost","all","mother","be","minority",".","all","be","poor",".","not","one","teen","mother","plan","to","get","pregnant",".","invariably",",","the","baby","be","'","a","accident",",","'","or","'","it","just","happen",",","'","or","'","it","be","not","his/her","fault",".","'","the","one","constant","be","that","none","of","these","girl","could","survive","on","they","own",".","'","life","change","'","follow","four","girl","from","pregnancy","to","they","child","'s","third","birthday",".","one","girl","get","pregnant","at","12",",","another","at","13",",","and","two","at","16",".","the","younger","girl","be","Latina",",","and","the","older","girl","be","african-american","and","haitian","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hidden in forgotten","in forgotten corners","forgotten corners of","corners of Palm","of Palm Beach","Palm Beach County","Beach County ,","County , Florida",", Florida ,","Florida , an",", an epidemic","an epidemic rages","epidemic rages with","rages with young","with young teens","young teens having","teens having babies","Almost all mothers","all mothers are","mothers are minorities","All are poor","Not one teen","one teen mother","teen mother planned","mother planned to","planned to get","to get pregnant","Invariably , the",", the baby","the baby was","baby was '","was ' an","' an accident","an accident ,","accident , '",", ' or","' or '","or ' it","' it just","it just happened","just happened ,","happened , '",", ' or","' or '","or ' it","' it was","it was n't","was n't his/her","n't his/her fault","his/her fault .","fault .

{"title":"La fiancée de Dracula","plot":"A Van Helsing-like professor and his protegé are tracking Dracula's descendants through the world of \"parallels\", creatures who are human in form but live quite distinct psychic lives. A circus dwarf who is in love with one of these creatures leads them to a mansion filled with oddly behaving nuns, The Order of the White Virgins. The nuns are detaining a beautiful woman who is the betrothed of the still-extant Dracula. When she escapes, everyone follows her to Dracula's seaside castle, on the way dealing with a baby-eating ogress and a wolf-woman (Brigitte Lahaie in a cameo), witches and madwomen. The bizarre wedding ritual commences.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["A","Van","Helsing-lik","professor","and","his","protegé","are","track","Dracula","'s","descend","through","the","world","of","\"","parallel","\"",",","creatur","who","are","human","in","form","but","live","quit","distinct","psychic","live",".","A","circus","dwarf","who","is","in","love","with","one","of","these","creatur","lead","them","to","a","mansion","fill","with","odd","behav","nun",",","The","Order","of","the","White","Virgin",".","The","nun","are","detain","a","beauti","woman","who","is","the","betroth","of","the","still-ext","Dracula",".","When","she","escap",",","everyon","follow","her","to","Dracula","'s","seasid","castl",",","on","the","way","deal","with","a","baby-","ogress","and","a","wolf-woman","(","Brigitt","Lahai","in","a","cameo",")",",","witch","and","madwomen",".","The","bizarr","wed","ritual","commenc","."],"lemmas":["a","Van","helsing-like","professor","and","he","protegé","be","track","Dracula","'s","descendant","through","the","world","of","``","parallel","''",",","creature","who","be","human","in","form","but","live","quite","distinct","psychic","life",".","a","circus","dwarf","who","be","in","love","with","one","of","these","creature","lead","they","to","a","mansion","fill","with","oddly","behave","nun",",","the","order","of","the","White","Virgins",".","the","nun","be","detain","a","beautiful","woman","who","be","the","betrothed","of","the","still-extant","Dracula",".","when","she","escape",",","everyone","follow","she","to","Dracula","'s","seaside","castle",",","on","the","way","deal","with","a","baby-eating","ogress","and","a","wolf-woman","-lrb-","Brigitte","Lahaie","in","a","cameo","-rrb-",",","witch","and","madwoman",".","the","bizarre","wedding","ritual","commence","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

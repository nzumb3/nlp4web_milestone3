{"title":"Hackers Wanted","plot":"In 2003, a crew from Kevin Spacey's TriggerStreet production company appeared to interview Adrian Lamo. It was a brief talking-head piece on an unrelated documentary. No big deal. Or so everyone thought. The shoot went as those things tend to do, everyone shook hands, and one of the crew asked offhandedly \"So, what would you do if the feds came for you, Adrian?\" Adrian just laughed. 90 minutes later, he wasn't laughing - his voicemail informed him that he was a fugitive from the FBI. The resulting events were caught on film for days on end before becoming: \"Hackers Wanted\".","genres":["Crime"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","2003",",","a","crew","from","Kevin","Spacey","'s","TriggerStreet","product","compani","appear","to","interview","Adrian","Lamo",".","It","was","a","brief","talking-head","piec","on","an","unrel","documentari",".","No","big","deal",".","Or","so","everyon","thought",".","The","shoot","went","as","those","thing","tend","to","do",",","everyon","shook","hand",",","and","one","of","the","crew","ask","offhand","\"","So",",","what","would","you","do","if","the","fed","came","for","you",",","Adrian","?","\"","Adrian","just","laugh",".","90","minut","later",",","he","was","n't","laugh","-","his","voicemail","inform","him","that","he","was","a","fugit","from","the","FBI",".","The","result","event","were","caught","on","film","for","day","on","end","befor","becom",":","\"","Hacker","Want","\"","."],"lemmas":["in","2003",",","a","crew","from","Kevin","Spacey","'s","TriggerStreet","production","company","appear","to","interview","Adrian","Lamo",".","it","be","a","brief","talking-head","piece","on","a","unrelated","documentary",".","no","big","deal",".","or","so","everyone","think",".","the","shoot","go","as","those","thing","tend","to","do",",","everyone","shake","hand",",","and","one","of","the","crew","ask","offhandedly","``","so",",","what","would","you","do","if","the","fed","come","for","you",",","Adrian","?","''","Adrian","just","laugh",".","90","minute","later",",","he","be","not","laughing","-","he","voicemail","inform","he","that","he","be","a","fugitive","from","the","FBI",".","the","resulting","event","be","catch","on","film","for","day","on","end","before","become",":","``","hacker","want","''","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In 2003 ,","2003 , a",", a crew","a crew from","crew from Kevin","from Kevin Spacey","Kevin Spacey 's","Spacey 's TriggerStreet","'s TriggerStreet production","TriggerStreet production company","production company appeared","company appeared to","appeared to interview","to interview Adrian","interview Adrian Lamo","It was a","was a brief","a brief talking-head","brief talking-head piece","talking-head piece on","piece on an","on an unrelated","an unrelated documentary","No big deal","Or so everyone","so everyone thought","The shoot went","shoot went as","went as those","as those things","those things tend","things tend to","tend to do","to do ,","do , everyone",", everyone shook","everyone shook hands","shook hands ,","hands , and",", and one","and one of","one of the","of the crew","the crew asked","crew asked offhandedly","asked offhandedly \"","offhandedly \" So","\" So ,","So , what",", what would","what would you","would you do","you do if","do if the","if the feds","the feds came","feds came for","came for you","for you ,","you , Adrian",", Adrian ?","Adrian ? \"","Adrian just laughed","90 minutes later","minutes later ,","later , he",", he was","he was n't","was n't laughing","n't laughing -","laughing - his","- his voicemail","his voicemail informed","voicemail informed him","informed him that","him that he","that he was","he was a","was a fugitive","a fugitive from","fugitive from the","from the FBI","The resulting events","resulting events were","events were caught","were caught on","caught on film","on film for","film for days","for days on","days on end","on end before","end before becoming","before becoming :","becoming : \"",": \" Hackers","\" Hackers Wanted","Hackers Wanted \""],"2grams":["In 2003","2003 ,",", a","a crew","crew from","from Kevin","Kevin Spacey","Spacey 's","'s TriggerStreet","TriggerStreet production","production company","company appeared","appeared to","to interview","interview Adrian","Adrian Lamo","It was","was a","a brief","brief talking-head","talking-head piece","piece on","on an","an unrelated","unrelated documentary","No big","big deal","Or so","so everyone","everyone thought","The shoot","shoot went","went as","as those","those things","things tend","tend to","to do","do ,",", everyone","everyone shook","shook hands","hands ,",", and","and one","one of","of the","the crew","crew asked","asked offhandedly","offhandedly \"","\" So","So ,",", what","what would","would you","you do","do if","if the","the feds","feds came","came for","for you","you ,",", Adrian","Adrian ?","? \"","Adrian just","just laughed","90 minutes","minutes later","later ,",", he","he was","was n't","n't laughing","laughing -","- his","his voicemail","voicemail informed","informed him","him that","that he","he was","was a","a fugitive","fugitive from","from the","the FBI","The resulting","resulting events","events were","were caught","caught on","on film","film for","for days","days on","on end","end before","before becoming","becoming :",": \"","\" Hackers","Hackers Wanted","Wanted \""]}

{"title":"Komeda: A Soundtrack for a Life","plot":"Krzysztof Komeda was a jazz pianist and film composer. With compositions like the lullaby for Rosemary's Baby (1968) by Roman Polanski, Komeda succeeded in writing his own chapter in the history of soundtracks. This documentary follows the life story of the composer by the means of his melodic sounds. It is a reflection on his soundtracks, which changed the common film scores forever. It is a contemporary document about the attitude to life in a time of social, political and cultural change after war, about work and exodus of Polish artists in the 50s and 60s. A story about how film music is created and how it affects people. Directors who worked with Komeda and who are also friends talk about him: Roman Polanski, Jerzy Skolimowski, Henning Carlsen and Andrzej Wajda. His wife, Zofia Komeda, and his sister, Irena Orlowska, recollect him.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Krzysztof","Komeda","was","a","jazz","pianist","and","film","compos",".","With","composit","like","the","lullabi","for","Rosemari","'s","Babi","(","1968",")","by","Roman","Polanski",",","Komeda","succeed","in","write","his","own","chapter","in","the","histori","of","soundtrack",".","This","documentari","follow","the","life","stori","of","the","compos","by","the","mean","of","his","melod","sound",".","It","is","a","reflect","on","his","soundtrack",",","which","chang","the","common","film","score","forev",".","It","is","a","contemporari","document","about","the","attitud","to","life","in","a","time","of","social",",","polit","and","cultur","chang","after","war",",","about","work","and","exodus","of","Polish","artist","in","the","50s","and","60s",".","A","stori","about","how","film","music","is","creat","and","how","it","affect","peopl",".","Director","who","work","with","Komeda","and","who","are","also","friend","talk","about","him",":","Roman","Polanski",",","Jerzi","Skolimowski",",","Hen","Carlsen","and","Andrzej","Wajda",".","His","wife",",","Zofia","Komeda",",","and","his","sister",",","Irena","Orlowska",",","recollect","him","."],"lemmas":["Krzysztof","Komeda","be","a","jazz","pianist","and","film","composer",".","with","composition","like","the","lullaby","for","Rosemary","'s","Baby","-lrb-","1968","-rrb-","by","Roman","Polanski",",","Komeda","succeed","in","write","he","own","chapter","in","the","history","of","soundtrack",".","this","documentary","follow","the","life","story","of","the","composer","by","the","means","of","he","melodic","sound",".","it","be","a","reflection","on","he","soundtrack",",","which","change","the","common","film","score","forever",".","it","be","a","contemporary","document","about","the","attitude","to","life","in","a","time","of","social",",","political","and","cultural","change","after","war",",","about","work","and","exodus","of","polish","artist","in","the","50","and","60",".","a","story","about","how","film","music","be","create","and","how","it","affect","people",".","director","who","work","with","Komeda","and","who","be","also","friend","talk","about","he",":","Roman","Polanski",",","Jerzy","Skolimowski",",","Henning","Carlsen","and","Andrzej","Wajda",".","he","wife",",","Zofia","Komeda",",","and","he","sister",",","Irena","Orlowska",",","recollect","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Krzysztof

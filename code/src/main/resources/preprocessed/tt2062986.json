{"title":"One Voice Many Faces","plot":"I just want to be treated like a human being. We hear this statement over and over again as we talk to LGBTQ youth who are homeless or were homeless. The documentary, One Voice Many Faces explores the root causes leading to LGBTQ youth homelessness. We will give LGBTQ youth the opportunity to tell their stories. We will have conversations with individuals and organizations that advocate for our youth, giving voice to their struggles and celebrating their successes. We will learn by listening to those who have dealt, first hand, with the awful realities of bullying, abandonment and homelessness. Collectively, these many faces will give voice to the responsibility we all have to treat our LGBTQ youth with dignity and keep them safe.","genres":["Biography"," Drama","

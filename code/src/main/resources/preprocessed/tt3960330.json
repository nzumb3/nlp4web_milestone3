{"title":"Zindgani: A Story Untold","plot":"It is the story of a roadside vendor who sells dust cloths. Physically-challenged as a result of a childhood accident, vendor has only one arm. Yet , instead of being dependent on others to fetch him food, he does so on his own. An entrepreneur of sorts, he sells dust cloths to save enough, so that he can open a small shop. With whatever he earns he also takes care of his family-a wife and two sons. It took us two minutes and forty seconds to tell the story of this man.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["It","is","the","stori","of","a","roadsid","vendor","who","sell","dust","cloth",".","Physically-challeng","as","a","result","of","a","childhood","accid",",","vendor","has","onli","one","arm",".","Yet",",","instead","of","be","depend","on","other","to","fetch","him","food",",","he","doe","so","on","his","own",".","An","entrepreneur","of","sort",",","he","sell","dust","cloth","to","save","enough",",","so","that","he","can","open","a","small","shop",".","With","whatev","he","earn","he","also","take","care","of","his","family-a","wife","and","two","son",".","It","took","us","two","minut","and","forti","second","to","tell","the","stori","of","this","man","."],"lemmas":["it","be","the","story","of","a","roadside","vendor","who","sell","dust","cloth",".","physically-challenged","as","a","result","of","a","childhood","accident",",","vendor","have","only","one","arm",".","yet",",","instead","of","be","dependent","on","other","to","fetch","he","food",",","he","do","so","on","he","own",".","a","entrepreneur","of","sort",",","he","sell","dust","cloth","to","save","enough",",","so","that","he","can","open","a","small","shop",".","with","whatever","he","earn","he","also","take","care","of","he","family-a","wife","and","two","son",".","it","take","we","two","minute","and","forty","seconds","to","tell","the","story","of","this","man","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["It is the","is the story","the story of","story of a","of a roadside","a roadside vendor","roadside vendor who","vendor who sells","who sells dust","sells dust cloths","Physically-challenged as a","as a result","a result of","result of a","of a childhood","a childhood accident","childhood accident ,","accident , vendor",", vendor has","vendor has only","has only one","only one arm","Yet , instead",", instead of","instead of being","of being dependent","being dependent on","dependent on others","on others to","others to fetch","to fetch him","fetch him food","him food ,","food , he",", he does","he does so","does so on","so on his","on his own","An entrepreneur of","entrepreneur of sorts","of sorts ,","sorts , he",", he sells","he sells dust","sells dust cloths","dust cloths to","cloths to save","to save enough","save enough ,","enough , so",", so that","so that he","that he can","he can open","can open a","open a small","a small shop","With whatever he","whatever he earns","he earns he","earns he also","he also takes","also takes care","takes care of","care of his","of his family-a","his family-a wife","family-a wife and","wife and two","and two sons","It took us","took us two","us two minutes","two minutes and","minutes and forty","and forty seconds","forty seconds to","seconds to tell","to tell the","tell the story","the story of","story of this","of this man"],"2grams":["It is","is the","the story","story of","of a","a roadside","roadside vendor","vendor who","who sells","sells dust","dust cloths","Physically-challenged as","as a","a result","result of","of a","a childhood","childhood accident","accident ,",", vendor","vendor has","has only","only one","one arm","Yet ,",", instead","instead of","of being","being dependent","dependent on","on others","others to","to fetch","fetch him","him food","food ,",", he","he does","does so","so on","on his","his own","An entrepreneur","entrepreneur of","of sorts","sorts ,",", he","he sells","sells dust","dust cloths","cloths to","to save","save enough","enough ,",", so","so that","that he","he can","can open","open a","a small","small shop","With whatever","whatever he","he earns","earns he","he also","also takes","takes care","care of","of his","his family-a","family-a wife","wife and","and two","two sons","It took","took us","us two","two minutes","minutes and","and forty","forty seconds","seconds to","to tell","tell the","the story","story of","of this","this man"]}

{"title":"Kismat Konnection","plot":"Toronto-based social activist Priya meets out-of-work architect Raj Malhotra, and both end up in a series of hilarious misunderstandings. Priya finds out that Raj is attracted to her. She shows interest in him as well, though she is seeing Karan Bahl, to whom all of their friends expect she'll soon be married. What Priya does not know is Raj believes she is lucky for him and may be using her to obtain a contract that would involve tearing down her beloved community center to build a shopping mall in it's place.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Toronto-bas","social","activist","Priya","meet","out-of-work","architect","Raj","Malhotra",",","and","both","end","up","in","a","seri","of","hilari","misunderstand",".","Priya","find","out","that","Raj","is","attract","to","her",".","She","show","interest","in","him","as","well",",","though","she","is","see","Karan","Bahl",",","to","whom","all","of","their","friend","expect","she","ll","soon","be","marri",".","What","Priya","doe","not","know","is","Raj","believ","she","is","lucki","for","him","and","may","be","use","her","to","obtain","a","contract","that","would","involv","tear","down","her","belov","communiti","center","to","build","a","shop","mall","in","it","'s","place","."],"lemmas":["toronto-based","social","activist","Priya","meet","out-of-work","architect","Raj","Malhotra",",","and","both","end","up","in","a","series","of","hilarious","misunderstanding",".","Priya","find","out","that","raj","be","attract","to","she",".","she","show","interest","in","he","as","well",",","though","she","be","see","Karan","Bahl",",","to","whom","all","of","they","friend","expect","she","will","soon","be","marry",".","what","priya","do","not","know","be","Raj","believe","she","be","lucky","for","he","and","may","be","use","she","to","obtain","a","contract","that","would","involve","tear","down","she","beloved","community","center","to","build","a","shopping","mall","in","it","be","place","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Toronto-based social activist","social activist Priya","activist Priya meets","Priya meets out-of-work","meets out-of-work architect","out-of-work architect Raj","architect Raj Malhotra","Raj Malhotra ,","Malhotra , and",", and both","and both end","both end up","end up in","up in a","in a series","a series of","series of hilarious","of hilarious misunderstandings","Priya finds out","finds out that","out that Raj","that Raj is","Raj is attracted","is attracted to","attracted to her","She shows interest","shows interest in","interest in him","in him as","him as well","as well ,","well , though",", though she","though she is","she is seeing","is seeing Karan","seeing Karan Bahl","Karan Bahl ,","Bahl , to",", to whom","to whom all","whom all of","all of their","of their friends","their friends expect","friends expect she","expect she 'll","she 'll soon","'ll soon be","soon be married","What Priya does","Priya does not","does not know","not know is","know is Raj","is Raj believes","Raj believes she","believes she is","she is lucky","is lucky for","lucky for him","for him and","him and may","and may be","may be using","be using her","using her to","her to obtain","to obtain a","obtain a contract","a contract that","contract that would","that would involve","would involve tearing","involve tearing down","tearing down her","down her beloved","her beloved community","beloved community center","community center to","center to build","to build a","build a shopping","a shopping mall","shopping mall in","mall in it","in it 's","it 's place"],"2grams":["Toronto-based social","social activist","activist Priya","Priya meets","meets out-of-work","out-of-work architect","architect Raj","Raj Malhotra","Malhotra ,",", and","and both","both end","end up","up in","in a","a series","series of","of hilarious","hilarious misunderstandings","Priya finds","finds out","out that","that Raj","Raj is","is attracted","attracted to","to her","She shows","shows interest","interest in","in him","him as","as well","well ,",", though","though she","she is","is seeing","seeing Karan","Karan Bahl","Bahl ,",", to","to whom","whom all","all of","of their","their friends","friends expect","expect she","she 'll","'ll soon","soon be","be married","What Priya","Priya does","does not","not know","know is","is Raj","Raj believes","believes she","she is","is lucky","lucky for","for him","him and","and may","may be","be using","using her","her to","to obtain","obtain a","a contract","contract that","that would","would involve","involve tearing","tearing down","down her","her beloved","beloved community","community center","center to","to build","build a","a shopping","shopping mall","mall in","in it","it 's","'s place"]}

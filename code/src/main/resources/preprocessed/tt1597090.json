{"title":"Phil Rides Across America","plot":"Traveling around the world for 30 sleep deprived days would satisfy the appetite of most intrepid travelers, but not the host of The Amazing Race. Phil Keoghan decided he wanted an amazing race of his own. Last March Phil left his home in Los Angeles with his training partner, a cameraman, a former California Highway Patrolman, and his dad as the driver of the support vehicle. He set out to pedal 3500 miles in just 40 days.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["Travel","around","the","world","for","30","sleep","depriv","day","would","satisfi","the","appetit","of","most","intrepid","travel",",","but","not","the","host","of","The","Amaze","Race",".","Phil","Keoghan","decid","he","want","an","amaz","race","of","his","own",".","Last","March","Phil","left","his","home","in","Los","Angele","with","his","train","partner",",","a","cameraman",",","a","former","California","Highway","Patrolman",",","and","his","dad","as","the","driver","of","the","support","vehicl",".","He","set","out","to","pedal","3500","mile","in","just","40","day","."],"lemmas":["travel","around","the","world","for","30","sleep","deprive","day","would","satisfy","the","appetite","of","most","intrepid","traveler",",","but","not","the","host","of","the","amazing","race",".","Phil","Keoghan","decide","he","want","a","amazing","race","of","he","own",".","last","March","Phil","leave","he","home","in","Los","Angeles","with","he","training","partner",",","a","cameraman",",","a","former","California","Highway","Patrolman",",","and","he","dad","as","the","driver","of","the","support","vehicle",".","he","set","out","to","pedal","3500","mile","in","just","40","day","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Traveling around the","around the world","the world for","world for 30","for 30 sleep","30 sleep deprived","sleep deprived days","deprived days would","days would satisfy","would satisfy the","satisfy the appetite","the appetite of","appetite of most","of most intrepid","most intrepid travelers","intrepid travelers ,","travelers , but",", but not","but not the","not the host","the host of","host of The","of The Amazing","The Amazing Race","Phil Keoghan decided","Keoghan decided he","decided he wanted","he wanted an","wanted an amazing","an amazing race","amazing race of","race of his","of his own","Last March Phil","March Phil left","Phil left his","left his home","his home in","home in Los","in Los Angeles","Los Angeles with","Angeles with his","with his training","his training partner","training partner ,","partner , a",", a cameraman","a cameraman ,","cameraman , a",", a former","a former California","former California Highway","California Highway Patrolman","Highway Patrolman ,","Patrolman , and",", and his","and his dad","his dad as","dad as the","as the driver","the driver of","driver of the","of the support","the support vehicle","He set out","set out to","out to pedal","to pedal 3500","pedal 3500 miles","3500 miles in","miles in just","in just 40","just 40 days"],"2grams":["Traveling around","around the","the world","world for","for 30","30 sleep","sleep deprived","deprived days","days would","would satisfy","satisfy the","the appetite","appetite of","of most","most intrepid","intrepid travelers","travelers ,",", but","but not","not the","the host","host of","of The","The Amazing","Amazing Race","Phil Keoghan","Keoghan decided","decided he","he wanted","wanted an","an amazing","amazing race","race of","of his","his own","Last March","March Phil","Phil left","left his","his home","home in","in Los","Los Angeles","Angeles with","with his","his training","training partner","partner ,",", a","a cameraman","cameraman ,",", a","a former","former California","California Highway","Highway Patrolman","Patrolman ,",", and","and his","his dad","dad as","as the","the driver","driver of","of the","the support","support vehicle","He set","set out","out to","to pedal","pedal 3500","3500 miles","miles in","in just","just 40","40 days"]}

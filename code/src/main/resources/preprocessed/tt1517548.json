{"title":"A 15ª Pedra","plot":"'Duarte de Almeida', director of the Portuguese National Film Archives [deceased in 2009], interviews the dean of contemporaneous film directors [96-years-old then]. Two humanists of different philosophical backgrounds, both with their long, entire lives dedicated to culture in general (music, painting, literature) and to film in particular, discuss freely, sometimes haltingly, the director's power as a creator or a magician, the philosophy beyond particular scenes in classic movies, film technique, the importance of color, sound and music to films, art versus entertainment, and much more. Their talk takes place in a museum room, seating in front of \"The Annunciation\" (a 1510 oil painting by João Vaz, a Portuguese artist), which eventually leads to a discussion of 'Leonardo da Vinci', and the relationship between a trend-setter master and his disciples. In the end, the movie director decides to come the talk to an end, as it was «becoming endless, like the two of us», and without actually answering the interrogation that starts it: «How can one represent life itself?»","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Duart","de","Almeida","'",",","director","of","the","Portugues","Nation","Film","Archive","[","deceas","in","2009","]",",","interview","the","dean","of","contemporan","film","director","[","96-years-old","then","]",".","Two","humanist","of","differ","philosoph","background",",","both","with","their","long",",","entir","live","dedic","to","cultur","in","general","(","music",",","paint",",","literatur",")","and","to","film","in","particular",",","discuss","freeli",",","sometim","halt",",","the","director","'s","power","as","a","creator","or","a","magician",",","the","philosophi","beyond","particular","scene","in","classic","movi",",","film","techniqu",",","the","import","of","color",",","sound","and","music","to","film",",","art","versus","entertain",",","and","much","more",".","Their","talk","take","place","in","a","museum","room",",","seat","in","front","of","\"","The","Annunciat","\"","(","a","1510","oil","paint","by","João","Vaz",",","a","Portugues","artist",")",",","which","eventu","lead","to","a","discuss","of","'","Leonardo","da","Vinci","'",",","and","the","relationship","between","a","trend-sett","master","and","his","discipl",".","In","the","end",",","the","movi","director","decid","to","come","the","talk","to","an","end",",","as","it","was","«","becom","endless",",","like","the","two","of","us","»",",","and","without","actual","answer","the","interrog","that","start","it",":","«","How","can","one","repres","life","itself","?","»"],"lemmas":["'","Duarte","de","Almeida","'",",","director","of","the","Portuguese","National","Film","Archives","-lsb-","decease","in","2009","-rsb-",",","interview","the","dean","of","contemporaneous","film","director","-lsb-","96-years-old","then","-rsb-",".","two","humanist","of","different","philosophical","background",",","both","with","they","long",",","entire","life","dedicate","to","culture","in","general","-lrb-","music",",","painting",",","literature","-rrb-","and","to","film","in","particular",",","discuss","freely",",","sometimes","haltingly",",","the","director","'s","power","as","a","creator","or","a","magician",",","the","philosophy","beyond","particular","scene","in","classic","movie",",","film","technique",",","the","importance","of","color",",","sound","and","music","to","film",",","art","versus","entertainment",",","and","much","more",".","they","talk","take","place","in","a","museum","room",",","seat","in","front","of","``","the","annunciation","''","-lrb-","a","1510","oil","painting","by","João","Vaz",",","a","portuguese","artist","-rrb-",",","which","eventually","lead","to","a","discussion","of","'","Leonardo","da","Vinci","'",",","and","the","relationship","between","a","trend-setter","master","and","he","disciple",".","in","the","end",",","the","movie","director","decide","to","come","the","talk","to","a","end",",","as","it","be","«","become","endless",",","like","the","two","of","we","»",",","and","without","actually","answer","the","interrogation","that","start","it",":","«","how","can","one","represent","life","itself","?","»"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["'

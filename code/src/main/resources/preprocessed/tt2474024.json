{"title":"The Last Five Years","plot":"The Last 5 Years by Tony award winning composer and lyricist Jason Robert Brown is a musical deconstruction of a love affair and a marriage taking place over a five year period. Jamie Wellerstein is a young, talented up and coming Jewish novelist who falls in love with Cathy Hiatt, a Shiksa Goddess struggling actress. Their story is told almost entirely through songs using an intercutting time line device; all of Cathy's songs begin at the end of their marriage and move backwards in time to the beginning of their love affair while Jamie's songs start at the beginning of their affair and move forward to the end of their marriage. They meet in the center when Jamie proposes.","genres":["Comedy"," Musical"," Drama"],"stems":["The","Last","5","Year","by","Toni","award","win","compos","and","lyricist","Jason","Robert","Brown","is","a","music","deconstruct","of","a","love","affair","and","a","marriag","take","place","over","a","five","year","period",".","Jami","Wellerstein","is","a","young",",","talent","up","and","come","Jewish","novelist","who","fall","in","love","with","Cathi","Hiatt",",","a","Shiksa","Goddess","struggl","actress",".","Their","stori","is","told","almost","entir","through","song","use","an","intercut","time","line","devic",";","all","of","Cathi","'s","song","begin","at","the","end","of","their","marriag","and","move","backward","in","time","to","the","begin","of","their","love","affair","while","Jami","'s","song","start","at","the","begin","of","their","affair","and","move","forward","to","the","end","of","their","marriag",".","They","meet","in","the","center","when","Jami","propos","."],"lemmas":["the","last","5","year","by","Tony","award","win","composer","and","lyricist","Jason","Robert","Brown","be","a","musical","deconstruction","of","a","love","affair","and","a","marriage","take","place","over","a","five","year","period",".","Jamie","Wellerstein","be","a","young",",","talent","up","and","come","jewish","novelist","who","fall","in","love","with","Cathy","Hiatt",",","a","Shiksa","Goddess","struggle","actress",".","they","story","be","tell","almost","entirely","through","song","use","a","intercut","time","line","device",";","all","of","Cathy","'s","song","begin","at","the","end","of","they","marriage","and","move","backwards","in","time","to","the","beginning","of","they","love","affair","while","Jamie","'s","song","start","at","the","beginning","of","they","affair","and","move","forward","to","the","end","of","they","marriage",".","they","meet","in","the","center","when","Jamie","propose","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Last 5","Last 5 Years","5 Years by","Years by Tony","by Tony award","Tony award winning","award winning composer","winning composer and","composer and lyricist","and lyricist Jason","lyricist Jason Robert","Jason Robert Brown","Robert Brown is","Brown is a","is a musical","a musical deconstruction","musical deconstruction of","deconstruction of a","of a love","a love affair","love affair and","affair and a","and a marriage","a marriage taking","marriage taking place","taking place over","place over a","over a five","a five year","five year period","Jamie Wellerstein is","Wellerstein is a","is a young","a young ,","young , talented",", talented up","talented up and","up and coming","and coming Jewish","coming Jewish novelist","Jewish novelist who","novelist who falls","who falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with Cathy","with Cathy Hiatt","Cathy Hiatt ,","Hiatt , a",", a Shiksa","a Shiksa Goddess","Shiksa Goddess struggling","Goddess struggling actress","Their story is","story is told","is told almost","told almost entirely","almost entirely through","entirely through songs","through songs using","songs using an","using an intercutting","an intercutting time","intercutting time line","time line device","line device ;","device ;

{"title":"The Upside Down Book","plot":"Imagine a book that is so toxic that rigorous hand washing is required after coming into contact with it. This book is a 1938 edition of Mein Kampf, Adolf Hitler's political manifesto. Karen and Fred Mandell of Boston, filmmaker Hinda Mandell's parents, have displayed this book upside down on their bookshelf for decades. Fred Mandell's uncle, a Jewish-American soldier, brought home the book from Germany at the end of WWII. With only a bare bones inscription on the inside cover, the filmmakers investigate the power of family lore as they track down the original owners of the Mein Kampf. 'The Upside Down Book' seeks to build bridges between two different families nearly 70 years after the end of WWII.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["Imagin","a","book","that","is","so","toxic","that","rigor","hand","wash","is","requir","after","come","into","contact","with","it",".","This","book","is","a","1938","edit","of","Mein","Kampf",",","Adolf","Hitler","'s","polit","manifesto",".","Karen","and","Fred","Mandel","of","Boston",",","filmmak","Hinda","Mandel","'s","parent",",","have","display","this","book","upsid","down","on","their","bookshelf","for","decad",".","Fred","Mandel","'s","uncl",",","a","Jewish-American","soldier",",","brought","home","the","book","from","Germani","at","the","end","of","WWII",".","With","onli","a","bare","bone","inscript","on","the","insid","cover",",","the","filmmak","investig","the","power","of","famili","lore","as","they","track","down","the","origin","owner","of","the","Mein","Kampf",".","'","The","Upside","Down","Book","'","seek","to","build","bridg","between","two","differ","famili","near","70","year","after","the","end","of","WWII","."],"lemmas":["imagine","a","book","that","be","so","toxic","that","rigorous","hand","wash","be","require","after","come","into","contact","with","it",".","this","book","be","a","1938","edition","of","Mein","Kampf",",","Adolf","Hitler","'s","political","manifesto",".","Karen","and","Fred","Mandell","of","Boston",",","filmmaker","Hinda","Mandell","'s","parent",",","have","display","this","book","upside","down","on","they","bookshelf","for","decade",".","Fred","Mandell","'s","uncle",",","a","jewish-american","soldier",",","bring","home","the","book","from","Germany","at","the","end","of","WWII",".","with","only","a","bare","bone","inscription","on","the","inside","cover",",","the","filmmaker","investigate","the","power","of","family","lore","as","they","track","down","the","original","owner","of","the","Mein","Kampf",".","'","the","Upside","Down","Book","'","seek","to","build","bridge","between","two","different","family","nearly","70","year","after","the","end","of","WWII","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Imagine a book","a book that","book that is","that is so","is so toxic","so toxic that","toxic that rigorous","that rigorous hand","rigorous hand washing","hand washing is","washing is required","is required after","required after coming","after coming into","coming into contact","into contact with","contact with it","This book is","book is a","is a 1938","a 1938 edition","1938 edition of","edition of Mein","of Mein Kampf","Mein Kampf ,","Kampf , Adolf",", Adolf Hitler","Adolf Hitler 's","Hitler 's political","'s political manifesto","Karen and Fred","and Fred Mandell","Fred Mandell of","Mandell of Boston","of Boston ,","Boston , filmmaker",", filmmaker Hinda","filmmaker Hinda Mandell","Hinda Mandell 's","Mandell 's parents","'s parents ,","parents , have",", have displayed","have displayed this","displayed this book","this book upside","book upside down","upside down on","down on their","on their bookshelf","their bookshelf for","bookshelf for decades","Fred Mandell 's","Mandell 's uncle","'s uncle ,","uncle , a",", a Jewish-American","a Jewish-American soldier","Jewish-American soldier ,","soldier , brought",", brought home","brought home the","home the book","the book from","book from Germany","from Germany at","Germany at the","at the end","the end of","end of WWII","With only a","only a bare","a bare bones","bare bones inscription","bones inscription on","inscription on the","on the inside","the inside cover","inside cover ,","cover , the",", the filmmakers","the filmmakers investigate","filmmakers investigate the","investigate the power","the power of","power of family","of family lore","family lore as","lore as they","as they track","they track down","track down the","down the original","the original owners","original owners of","owners of the","of the Mein","the Mein Kampf","Mein Kampf .","Kampf .

{"title":"One Week","plot":"Out of the blue, Ben learns he has stage IV cancer; survival, with treatment, is 10 percent. So this risk-averse, slow-to-act, quiet man buys a used motorcycle, says goodbye to Samantha, his baffled fiancée, and heads west from Toronto. He imagines it's a quest for Grumps, a mythical figure from his childhood; he takes digital photos of various \"world's largest\" roadside attractions; he chats with strangers, including two women; his bike slips on a dead skunk on the highway. Calls to Samantha meet with pleading that he return for treatment and anger that he won't. He doesn't want to be a patient yet. But, will he make discoveries, and what about Grumps? What's important?","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"],"stems":["Out","of","the","blue",",","Ben","learn","he","has","stage","IV","cancer",";","surviv",",","with","treatment",",","is","10","percent",".","So","this","risk-avers",",","slow-to-act",",","quiet","man","buy","a","use","motorcycl",",","say","goodby","to","Samantha",",","his","baffl","fiancé",",","and","head","west","from","Toronto",".","He","imagin","it","'s","a","quest","for","Grump",",","a","mythic","figur","from","his","childhood",";","he","take","digit","photo","of","various","\"","world","'s","largest","\"","roadsid","attract",";","he","chat","with","stranger",",","includ","two","women",";","his","bike","slip","on","a","dead","skunk","on","the","highway",".","Call","to","Samantha","meet","with","plead","that","he","return","for","treatment","and","anger","that","he","wo","n't",".","He","doe","n't","want","to","be","a","patient","yet",".","But",",","will","he","make","discoveri",",","and","what","about","Grump","?","What","'s","import","?"],"lemmas":["out","of","the","blue",",","Ben","learn","he","have","stage","iv","cancer",";","survival",",","with","treatment",",","be","10","percent",".","so","this","risk-averse",",","slow-to-act",",","quiet","man","buy","a","used","motorcycle",",","say","goodbye","to","Samantha",",","he","baffled","fiancée",",","and","head","west","from","Toronto",".","he","imagine","it","be","a","quest","for","Grumps",",","a","mythical","figure","from","he","childhood",";","he","take","digital","photo","of","various","``","world","'s","largest","''","roadside","attraction",";","he","chat","with","stranger",",","include","two","woman",";","he","bike","slip","on","a","dead","skunk","on","the","highway",".","call","to","Samantha","meet","with","plead","that","he","return","for","treatment","and","anger","that","he","will","not",".","he","do","not","want","to","be","a","patient","yet",".","but",",","will","he","make","discovery",",","and","what","about","Grumps","?","what","be","important","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Out of the","of the blue","the blue ,","blue , Ben",", Ben learns","Ben learns he","learns he has","he has stage","has stage IV","stage IV cancer","IV cancer ;","cancer ;

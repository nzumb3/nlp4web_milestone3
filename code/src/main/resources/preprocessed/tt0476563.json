{"title":"Kumbh Mela: Songs of the River","plot":"The Kumbh Mela is the \"Festival of the Urn\" that pours out the nectar of immortality to Humanity. It is a great roving festival that has moved around India for more than four thousand years, erecting temporary cities along the Ganges River. Millions of Hindu faithful gather there to wash away their sins in the holy waters. The 2001 Kumbh Mela in Allahabad, India was the largest gathering of humanity in recorded history. It was not just the final Kumbh Mela in a 12-year cycle of festivals. It was the final festival of 12 cycles - the conclusion of a giant 144-year cycle, making it \"Maha\" Kumbh Mela, the Great Festival. This 144-year buildup of spiritual meaning made it a powerfully auspicious time for pilgrims to bathe in the Ganges. Even the planets and stars joined in, providing heavenly alignments not seen for 144 years. Here, East joined West at the opening of the 21st Century. Roughly 70 million people came from all over the globe to pray for peace and rebirth for self and the world, truly a meeting of ancient and future in a remarkable moment.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Kumbh","Mela","is","the","\"","Festiv","of","the","Urn","\"","that","pour","out","the","nectar","of","immort","to","Human",".","It","is","a","great","rove","festiv","that","has","move","around","India","for","more","than","four","thousand","year",",","erect","temporari","citi","along","the","Gang","River",".","Million","of","Hindu","faith","gather","there","to","wash","away","their","sin","in","the","holi","water",".","The","2001","Kumbh","Mela","in","Allahabad",",","India","was","the","largest","gather","of","human","in","record","histori",".","It","was","not","just","the","final","Kumbh","Mela","in","a","12-year","cycl","of","festiv",".","It","was","the","final","festiv","of","12","cycl","-","the","conclus","of","a","giant","144-year","cycl",",","make","it","\"","Maha","\"","Kumbh","Mela",",","the","Great","Festiv",".","This","144-year","buildup","of","spiritu","mean","made","it","a","power","auspici","time","for","pilgrim","to","bath","in","the","Gang",".","Even","the","planet","and","star","join","in",",","provid","heaven","align","not","seen","for","144","year",".","Here",",","East","join","West","at","the","open","of","the","21st","Centuri",".","Rough","70","million","peopl","came","from","all","over","the","globe","to","pray","for","peac","and","rebirth","for","self","and","the","world",",","truli","a","meet","of","ancient","and","futur","in","a","remark","moment","."],"lemmas":["the","Kumbh","Mela","be","the","``","Festival","of","the","urn","''","that","pour","out","the","nectar","of","immortality","to","Humanity",".","it","be","a","great","roving","festival","that","have","move","around","India","for","more","than","four","thousand","year",",","erect","temporary","city","along","the","Ganges","River",".","million","of","Hindu","faithful","gather","there","to","wash","away","they","sin","in","the","holy","water",".","the","2001","Kumbh","Mela","in","Allahabad",",","India","be","the","largest","gathering","of","humanity","in","recorded","history",".","it","be","not","just","the","final","Kumbh","Mela","in","a","12-year","cycle","of","festival",".","it","be","the","final","festival","of","12","cycle","-","the","conclusion","of","a","giant","144-year","cycle",",","make","it","``","Maha","''","Kumbh","Mela",",","the","Great","Festival",".","this","144-year","buildup","of","spiritual","meaning","make","it","a","powerfully","auspicious","time","for","pilgrim","to","bathe","in","the","Ganges",".","even","the","planet","and","star","join","in",",","provide","heavenly","alignment","not","see","for","144","year",".","here",",","East","join","West","at","the","opening","of","the","21st","Century",".","roughly","70","million","people","come","from","all","over","the","globe","to","pray","for","peace","and","rebirth","for","self","and","the","world",",","truly","a","meeting","of","ancient","and","future","in","a","remarkable","moment","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Kumbh Mela","Kumbh Mela is","Mela is the","is the \"","the \" Festival","\" Festival of","Festival of the","of the Urn","the Urn \"","Urn \" that","\" that pours","that pours out","pours out the","out the nectar","the nectar of","nectar of immortality","of immortality to","immortality to Humanity","It is a","is a great","a great roving","great roving festival","roving festival that","festival that has","that has moved","has moved around","moved around India","around India for","India for more","for more than","more than four","than four thousand","four thousand years","thousand years ,","years , erecting",", erecting temporary","erecting temporary cities","temporary cities along","cities along the","along the Ganges","the Ganges River","Millions of Hindu","of Hindu faithful","Hindu faithful gather","faithful gather there","gather there to","there to wash","to wash away","wash away their","away their sins","their sins in","sins in the","in the holy","the holy waters","The 2001 Kumbh","2001 Kumbh Mela","Kumbh Mela in","Mela in Allahabad","in Allahabad ,","Allahabad , India",", India was","India was the","was the largest","the largest gathering","largest gathering of","gathering of humanity","of humanity in","humanity in recorded","in recorded history","It was not","was not just","not just the","just the final","the final Kumbh","final Kumbh Mela","Kumbh Mela in","Mela in a","in a 12-year","a 12-year cycle","12-year cycle of","cycle of festivals","It was the","was the final","the final festival","final festival of","festival of 12","of 12 cycles","12 cycles -","cycles -

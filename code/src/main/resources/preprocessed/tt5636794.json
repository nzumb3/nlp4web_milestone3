{"title":"The Tortoise and the House","plot":"A fable about architecture When my grown daughter left the nest, I asked myself, as every parent does, should I stay or should I go? I decided to stay, but not without serious reflection on the transformative possibilities my house harboured, that from now on she would first and foremost be a nest whose lone inhabitant is a single, deserted mother. This short film charts a poetic journey through this architectural transformation, in a way that melds the past and the present, the house's animal and spiritual lives, as if she herself speaks of me, and I of her. And the turtle proves itself to be not just the cute little reptile we all know and love, but also a symbol of the divine. I would never have thought I'd film a turtle in my house. But the turtle's image imposed itself upon me: a human is an animal that needs shelter, but with family, under a common roof. And that solitary life I spoke of soon evolved into the life of a new grand-mother...","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","fabl","about","architectur","When","my","grown","daughter","left","the","nest",",","I","ask","myself",",","as","everi","parent","doe",",","should","I","stay","or","should","I","go","?","I","decid","to","stay",",","but","not","without","serious","reflect","on","the","transform","possibl","my","hous","harbour",",","that","from","now","on","she","would","first","and","foremost","be","a","nest","whose","lone","inhabit","is","a","singl",",","desert","mother",".","This","short","film","chart","a","poetic","journey","through","this","architectur","transform",",","in","a","way","that","meld","the","past","and","the","present",",","the","hous","'s","anim","and","spiritu","live",",","as","if","she","herself","speak","of","me",",","and","I","of","her",".","And","the","turtl","prove","itself","to","be","not","just","the","cute","littl","reptil","we","all","know","and","love",",","but","also","a","symbol","of","the","divin",".","I","would","never","have","thought","I","'d","film","a","turtl","in","my","hous",".","But","the","turtl","'s","imag","impos","itself","upon","me",":","a","human","is","an","anim","that","need","shelter",",","but","with","famili",",","under","a","common","roof",".","And","that","solitari","life","I","spoke","of","soon","evolv","into","the","life","of","a","new","grand-moth","..."],"lemmas":["a","fable","about","architecture","when","my","grown","daughter","leave","the","nest",",","I","ask","myself",",","as","every","parent","do",",","should","I","stay","or","should","I","go","?","I","decide","to","stay",",","but","not","without","serious","reflection","on","the","transformative","possibility","my","house","harbour",",","that","from","now","on","she","would","first","and","foremost","be","a","nest","whose","lone","inhabitant","be","a","single",",","desert","mother",".","this","short","film","chart","a","poetic","journey","through","this","architectural","transformation",",","in","a","way","that","meld","the","past","and","the","present",",","the","house","'s","animal","and","spiritual","life",",","as","if","she","herself","speak","of","I",",","and","i","of","she",".","and","the","turtle","prove","itself","to","be","not","just","the","cute","little","reptile","we","all","know","and","love",",","but","also","a","symbol","of","the","divine",".","I","would","never","have","think","I","have","film","a","turtle","in","my","house",".","but","the","turtle","'s","image","impose","itself","upon","I",":","a","human","be","a","animal","that","need","shelter",",","but","with","family",",","under","a","common","roof",".","and","that","solitary","life","I","speak","of","soon","evolve","into","the","life","of","a","new","grand-mother","..."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A

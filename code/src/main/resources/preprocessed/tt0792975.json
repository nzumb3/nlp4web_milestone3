{"title":"L'invit√©","plot":"Unemployed for three years, Gerard has landed a job in Indonesia. To start off on the right foot with his \"team leader\", Gerard invites him to dinner. Considering his wife's lack of culinary talent, that may not be the brightest idea he ever had. Their neighbor, Alexandre, a PR whiz, is willing to help, as long as Gerard and Colette are prepared to accept changes in their habits and surroundings. After many dramas, mishaps, misunderstandings and general bungling, with frazzled nerves, Gerard and Colette open the door to welcome... their dinner guest.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Unemploy","for","three","year",",","Gerard","has","land","a","job","in","Indonesia",".","To","start","off","on","the","right","foot","with","his","\"","team","leader","\"",",","Gerard","invit","him","to","dinner",".","Consid","his","wife","'s","lack","of","culinari","talent",",","that","may","not","be","the","brightest","idea","he","ever","had",".","Their","neighbor",",","Alexandr",",","a","PR","whiz",",","is","will","to","help",",","as","long","as","Gerard","and","Colett","are","prepar","to","accept","chang","in","their","habit","and","surround",".","After","mani","drama",",","mishap",",","misunderstand","and","general","bungl",",","with","frazzl","nerv",",","Gerard","and","Colett","open","the","door","to","welcom","...","their","dinner","guest","."],"lemmas":["Unemployed","for","three","year",",","Gerard","have","land","a","job","in","Indonesia",".","to","start","off","on","the","right","foot","with","he","``","team","leader","''",",","Gerard","invite","he","to","dinner",".","consider","he","wife","'s","lack","of","culinary","talent",",","that","may","not","be","the","brightest","idea","he","ever","have",".","they","neighbor",",","Alexandre",",","a","pr","whiz",",","be","willing","to","help",",","as","long","as","Gerard","and","Colette","be","prepare","to","accept","change","in","they","habit","and","surroundings",".","after","many","dramas",",","mishap",",","misunderstanding","and","general","bungling",",","with","frazzled","nerve",",","Gerard","and","Colette","open","the","door","to","welcome","...","they","dinner","guest","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Unemployed for three","for three years","three years ,","years , Gerard",", Gerard has","Gerard has landed","has landed a","landed a job","a job in","job in Indonesia","To start off","start off on","off on the","on the right","the right foot","right foot with","foot with his","with his \"","his \" team","\" team leader","team leader \"","leader \" ,","\" , Gerard",", Gerard invites","Gerard invites him","invites him to","him to dinner","Considering his wife","his wife 's","wife 's lack","'s lack of","lack of culinary","of culinary talent","culinary talent ,","talent , that",", that may","that may not","may not be","not be the","be the brightest","the brightest idea","brightest idea he","idea he ever","he ever had","Their neighbor ,","neighbor , Alexandre",", Alexandre ,","Alexandre , a",", a PR","a PR whiz","PR whiz ,","whiz , is",", is willing","is willing to","willing to help","to help ,","help , as",", as long","as long as","long as Gerard","as Gerard and","Gerard and Colette","and Colette are","Colette are prepared","are prepared to","prepared to accept","to accept changes","accept changes in","changes in their","in their habits","their habits and","habits and surroundings","After many dramas","many dramas ,","dramas , mishaps",", mishaps ,","mishaps , misunderstandings",", misunderstandings and","misunderstandings and general","and general bungling","general bungling ,","bungling , with",", with frazzled","with frazzled nerves","frazzled nerves ,","nerves , Gerard",", Gerard and","Gerard and Colette","and Colette open","Colette open the","open the door","the door to","door to welcome","to welcome ...","welcome ... their","... their dinner","their dinner guest"],"2grams":["Unemployed for","for three","three years","years ,",", Gerard","Gerard has","has landed","landed a","a job","job in","in Indonesia","To start","start off","off on","on the","the right","right foot","foot with","with his","his \"","\" team","team leader","leader \"","\" ,",", Gerard","Gerard invites","invites him","him to","to dinner","Considering his","his wife","wife 's","'s lack","lack of","of culinary","culinary talent","talent ,",", that","that may","may not","not be","be the","the brightest","brightest idea","idea he","he ever","ever had","Their neighbor","neighbor ,",", Alexandre","Alexandre ,",", a","a PR","PR whiz","whiz ,",", is","is willing","willing to","to help","help ,",", as","as long","long as","as Gerard","Gerard and","and Colette","Colette are","are prepared","prepared to","to accept","accept changes","changes in","in their","their habits","habits and","and surroundings","After many","many dramas","dramas ,",", mishaps","mishaps ,",", misunderstandings","misunderstandings and","and general","general bungling","bungling ,",", with","with frazzled","frazzled nerves","nerves ,",", Gerard","Gerard and","and Colette","Colette open","open the","the door","door to","to welcome","welcome ...","... their","their dinner","dinner guest"]}

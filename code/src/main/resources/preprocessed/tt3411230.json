{"title":"Adelante Petroleros! L'oro nero dell' Ecuador","plot":"Seven years ago, Ecuador decided to not to exploit the oilfields under the rainforest. In order to do so, it asked the international community to compensate it for the loss of profit by creating a fund that would collect almost half of the expected revenue over twelve years. Six years later, the initiative resulted in such a failure that on 15 August 2013, President Correo announced that they would start drilling for oil in the Yasuní National Park. \"The land grabbing issue can be easily explained: multinational corporations from the wealthiest nations are buying or leasing enormous pieces of land in developing countries in Latin America, Africa, and so on; their purpose is to exploit the soil for intensive farming or to extract precious materials like gold or oil. But this is actually happening in these lands is the destruction of local ecosystems and the extinction of indigenous nations for which the rainforest represents their ancestral home.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Seven","year","ago",",","Ecuador","decid","to","not","to","exploit","the","oilfield","under","the","rainforest",".","In","order","to","do","so",",","it","ask","the","intern","communiti","to","compens","it","for","the","loss","of","profit","by","creat","a","fund","that","would","collect","almost","half","of","the","expect","revenu","over","twelv","year",".","Six","year","later",",","the","initi","result","in","such","a","failur","that","on","15","August","2013",",","Presid","Correo","announc","that","they","would","start","drill","for","oil","in","the","Yasuní","Nation","Park",".","\"","The","land","grab","issu","can","be","easili","explain",":","multin","corpor","from","the","wealthiest","nation","are","buy","or","leas","enorm","piec","of","land","in","develop","countri","in","Latin","America",",","Africa",",","and","so","on",";","their","purpos","is","to","exploit","the","soil","for","intens","farm","or","to","extract","precious","materi","like","gold","or","oil",".","But","this","is","actual","happen","in","these","land","is","the","destruct","of","local","ecosystem","and","the","extinct","of","indigen","nation","for","which","the","rainforest","repres","their","ancestr","home",".","\""],"lemmas":["seven","year","ago",",","Ecuador","decide","to","not","to","exploit","the","oilfield","under","the","rainforest",".","in","order","to","do","so",",","it","ask","the","international","community","to","compensate","it","for","the","loss","of","profit","by","create","a","fund","that","would","collect","almost","half","of","the","expect","revenue","over","twelve","year",".","six","year","later",",","the","initiative","result","in","such","a","failure","that","on","15","August","2013",",","President","Correo","announce","that","they","would","start","drilling","for","oil","in","the","Yasuní","National","Park",".","``","the","land","grab","issue","can","be","easily","explain",":","multinational","corporation","from","the","wealthiest","nation","be","buy","or","lease","enormous","piece","of","land","in","develop","country","in","Latin","America",",","Africa",",","and","so","on",";","they","purpose","be","to","exploit","the","soil","for","intensive","farming","or","to","extract","precious","material","like","gold","or","oil",".","but","this","be","actually","happen","in","these","land","be","the","destruction","of","local","ecosystem","and","the","extinction","of","indigenous","nation","for","which","the","rainforest","represent","they","ancestral","home",".","''"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Seven years ago","years ago ,","ago , Ecuador",", Ecuador decided","Ecuador decided to","decided to not","to not to","not to exploit","to exploit the","exploit the oilfields","the oilfields under","oilfields under the","under the rainforest","In order to","order to do","to do so","do so ,","so , it",", it asked","it asked the","asked the international","the international community","international community to","community to compensate","to compensate it","compensate it for","it for the","for the loss","the loss of","loss of profit","of profit by","profit by creating","by creating a","creating a fund","a fund that","fund that would","that would collect","would collect almost","collect almost half","almost half of","half of the","of the expected","the expected revenue","expected revenue over","revenue over twelve","over twelve years","Six years later","years later ,","later , the",", the initiative","the initiative resulted","initiative resulted in","resulted in such","in such a","such a failure","a failure that","failure that on","that on 15","on 15 August","15 August 2013","August 2013 ,","2013 , President",", President Correo","President Correo announced","Correo announced that","announced that they","that they would","they would start","would start drilling","start drilling for","drilling for oil","for oil in","oil in the","in the Yasuní","the Yasuní National","Yasuní National Park","\" The land","The land grabbing","land grabbing issue","grabbing issue can","issue can be","can be easily","be easily explained","easily explained :","explained : multinational",": multinational corporations","multinational corporations from","corporations from the","from the wealthiest","the wealthiest nations","wealthiest nations are","nations are buying","are buying or","buying or leasing","or leasing enormous","leasing enormous pieces","enormous pieces of","pieces of land","of land in","land in developing","in developing countries","developing countries in","countries in Latin","in Latin America","Latin America ,","America , Africa",", Africa ,","Africa , and",", and so","and so on","so on ;","on ;

{"title":"Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy","plot":"In the early 1970s during the Cold War, the head of British Intelligence, Control, resigns after an operation in Budapest, Hungary goes badly wrong. It transpires that Control believed one of four senior figures in the service was in fact a Russian agent - a mole - and the Hungary operation was an attempt to identify which of them it was. Smiley had been forced into retirement by the departure of Control, but is asked by a senior government figure to investigate a story told to him by a rogue agent, Ricky Tarr, that there was a mole. Smiley considers that the failure of the Hungary operation and the continuing success of Operation Witchcraft (an apparent source of significant Soviet intelligence) confirms this, and takes up the task of finding him.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["In","the","earli","1970s","dure","the","Cold","War",",","the","head","of","British","Intellig",",","Control",",","resign","after","an","oper","in","Budapest",",","Hungari","goe","bad","wrong",".","It","transpir","that","Control","believ","one","of","four","senior","figur","in","the","servic","was","in","fact","a","Russian","agent","-","a","mole","-","and","the","Hungari","oper","was","an","attempt","to","identifi","which","of","them","it","was",".","Smiley","had","been","forc","into","retir","by","the","departur","of","Control",",","but","is","ask","by","a","senior","govern","figur","to","investig","a","stori","told","to","him","by","a","rogu","agent",",","Ricki","Tarr",",","that","there","was","a","mole",".","Smiley","consid","that","the","failur","of","the","Hungari","oper","and","the","continu","success","of","Operat","Witchcraft","(","an","appar","sourc","of","signific","Soviet","intellig",")","confirm","this",",","and","take","up","the","task","of","find","him","."],"lemmas":["in","the","early","1970","during","the","Cold","War",",","the","head","of","British","Intelligence",",","Control",",","resign","after","a","operation","in","Budapest",",","Hungary","go","badly","wrong",".","it","transpire","that","Control","believe","one","of","four","senior","figure","in","the","service","be","in","fact","a","russian","agent","-","a","mole","-","and","the","Hungary","operation","be","a","attempt","to","identify","which","of","they","it","be",".","Smiley","have","be","force","into","retirement","by","the","departure","of","Control",",","but","be","ask","by","a","senior","government","figure","to","investigate","a","story","tell","to","he","by","a","rogue","agent",",","Ricky","Tarr",",","that","there","be","a","mole",".","Smiley","consider","that","the","failure","of","the","Hungary","operation","and","the","continue","success","of","Operation","Witchcraft","-lrb-","a","apparent","source","of","significant","soviet","intelligence","-rrb-","confirm","this",",","and","take","up","the","task","of","find","he","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the early","the early 1970s","early 1970s during","1970s during the","during the Cold","the Cold War","Cold War ,","War , the",", the head","the head of","head of British","of British Intelligence","British Intelligence ,","Intelligence , Control",", Control ,","Control , resigns",", resigns after","resigns after an","after an operation","an operation in","operation in Budapest","in Budapest ,","Budapest , Hungary",", Hungary goes","Hungary goes badly","goes badly wrong","It transpires that","transpires that Control","that Control believed","Control believed one","believed one of","one of four","of four senior","four senior figures","senior figures in","figures in the","in the service","the service was","service was in","was in fact","in fact a","fact a Russian","a Russian agent","Russian agent -","agent -

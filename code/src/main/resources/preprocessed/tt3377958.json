{"title":"Chicano Batman en el Retrovisor","plot":"This documentary reflects the member of Chicano Batman in the driver's mirror - en el retrovisor- 'in the future now, get on the earth and hands on the branches' they climb. Or in another sense, the video shows the Chicano Batman driving from one county to another for practice, then driving to the east Los Angeles venues and bars for shows- on occasion looking back and deliberating the question, who are we? Traversing space and the musical influences (bossa-nova, soul,cumbia, and psychedelic rancheros) they grew up playing with their parents and tips, Bardo Martinez, Eduardo Arenas, Carlos Arevalo and Gabriel Villa share what it is like to be making music in Los Angeles today, as musicians bringing the overlooked to the forefront.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","reflect","the","member","of","Chicano","Batman","in","the","driver","'s","mirror","-","en","el","retrovisor","-","'","in","the","futur","now",",","get","on","the","earth","and","hand","on","the","branch","'","they","climb",".","Or","in","anoth","sens",",","the","video","show","the","Chicano","Batman","drive","from","one","counti","to","anoth","for","practic",",","then","drive","to","the","east","Los","Angele","venu","and","bar","for","show","-","on","occas","look","back","and","deliber","the","question",",","who","are","we","?","Travers","space","and","the","music","influenc","(","bossa-nova",",","soul",",","cumbia",",","and","psychedel","ranchero",")","they","grew","up","play","with","their","parent","and","tip",",","Bardo","Martinez",",","Eduardo","Arena",",","Carlo","Arevalo","and","Gabriel","Villa","share","what","it","is","like","to","be","make","music","in","Los","Angele","today",",","as","musician","bring","the","overlook","to","the","forefront","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","reflect","the","member","of","Chicano","Batman","in","the","driver","'s","mirror","-","en","el","retrovisor","-","'","in","the","future","now",",","get","on","the","earth","and","hand","on","the","branch","'","they","climb",".","or","in","another","sense",",","the","video","show","the","Chicano","Batman","drive","from","one","county","to","another","for","practice",",","then","drive","to","the","east","Los","Angeles","venue","and","bar","for","show","-","on","occasion","look","back","and","deliberate","the","question",",","who","be","we","?","traverse","space","and","the","musical","influence","-lrb-","bossa-nova",",","soul",",","cumbia",",","and","psychedelic","ranchero","-rrb-","they","grow","up","play","with","they","parent","and","tip",",","Bardo","Martinez",",","Eduardo","Arenas",",","Carlos","Arevalo","and","Gabriel","Villa","share","what","it","be","like","to","be","make","music","in","Los","Angeles","today",",","as","musician","bring","the","overlook","to","the","forefront","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary reflects","documentary reflects the","reflects the member","the member of","member of Chicano","of Chicano Batman","Chicano Batman in","Batman in the","in the driver","the driver 's","driver 's mirror","'s mirror -","mirror -

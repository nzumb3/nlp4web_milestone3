{"title":"The White Elephant","plot":"Somebody passed by one day: 'Mama, does the Post really work? If I leave this letter with you, will it ever arrive?' I told him: 'of course it will'. He started laughing. 'I know for sure it will never reach its destination.' WHITE ELEPHANT is a documentary about the Central Post-Office and its employees in Kinshasa, DR Congo. This grandiose relic of the colonial past has trapped its employees in a frozen timewarp from which they are planning their escape. From past to present, through the cracks in the walls, and leaks in the ceilings, we glimpse present-day Congo.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Somebodi","pass","by","one","day",":","'","Mama",",","doe","the","Post","realli","work","?","If","I","leav","this","letter","with","you",",","will","it","ever","arriv","?","'","I","told","him",":","'","of","cours","it","will","'",".","He","start","laugh",".","'","I","know","for","sure","it","will","never","reach","it","destin",".","'","WHITE","ELEPHANT","is","a","documentari","about","the","Central","Post-Offic","and","it","employe","in","Kinshasa",",","DR","Congo",".","This","grandios","relic","of","the","coloni","past","has","trap","it","employe","in","a","frozen","timewarp","from","which","they","are","plan","their","escap",".","From","past","to","present",",","through","the","crack","in","the","wall",",","and","leak","in","the","ceil",",","we","glimps","present-day","Congo","."],"lemmas":["somebody","pass","by","one","day",":","'","mama",",","do","the","Post","really","work","?","if","I","leave","this","letter","with","you",",","will","it","ever","arrive","?","'","I","tell","he",":","'","of","course","it","will","'",".","he","start","laugh",".","'","I","know","for","sure","it","will","never","reach","its","destination",".","'","white","elephant","be","a","documentary","about","the","Central","Post-Office","and","its","employee","in","Kinshasa",",","dr","Congo",".","this","grandiose","relic","of","the","colonial","past","have","trap","its","employee","in","a","frozen","timewarp","from","which","they","be","plan","they","escape",".","from","past","to","present",",","through","the","crack","in","the","wall",",","and","leak","in","the","ceiling",",","we","glimpse","present-day","Congo","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Somebody passed by","passed by one","by one day","one day :","day : '",": ' Mama","' Mama ,","Mama , does",", does the","does the Post","the Post really","Post really work","If I leave","I leave this","leave this letter","this letter with","letter with you","with you ,","you , will",", will it","will it ever","it ever arrive","ever arrive ?","arrive ?

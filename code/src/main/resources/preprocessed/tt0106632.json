{"title":"Cuisine et d√©pendances","plot":"Martine and Jacques knew their friend before he became an important television personality, but have not seen him for over ten years. They are hospitable people - witness the fact that they have been putting up with having writer Georges be their informal roommate, as he sleeps on their living-room sofa off and on over the years whenever he is between jobs. They have invited their friend and his wife Charlotte over for dinner, and are on pins and needles, as they want everything to go just right. Instead, George allows his bitterness that Charlotte, his ex-girlfriend, married a success to overwhelm him, and Martine and Jacques are apalled when their brother, who hasn't a penny and is deeply in debt, persuades their guest of honor to join him in a high-stakes poker game.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Martin","and","Jacqu","knew","their","friend","befor","he","becam","an","import","televis","person",",","but","have","not","seen","him","for","over","ten","year",".","They","are","hospit","peopl","-","wit","the","fact","that","they","have","been","put","up","with","have","writer","Georg","be","their","inform","roommat",",","as","he","sleep","on","their","living-room","sofa","off","and","on","over","the","year","whenev","he","is","between","job",".","They","have","invit","their","friend","and","his","wife","Charlott","over","for","dinner",",","and","are","on","pin","and","needl",",","as","they","want","everyth","to","go","just","right",".","Instead",",","Georg","allow","his","bitter","that","Charlott",",","his","ex-girlfriend",",","marri","a","success","to","overwhelm","him",",","and","Martin","and","Jacqu","are","apal","when","their","brother",",","who","has","n't","a","penni","and","is","deepli","in","debt",",","persuad","their","guest","of","honor","to","join","him","in","a","high-stak","poker","game","."],"lemmas":["Martine","and","Jacques","know","they","friend","before","he","become","a","important","television","personality",",","but","have","not","see","he","for","over","ten","year",".","they","be","hospitable","people","-","witness","the","fact","that","they","have","be","put","up","with","have","writer","george","be","they","informal","roommate",",","as","he","sleep","on","they","living-room","sofa","off","and","on","over","the","year","whenever","he","be","between","job",".","they","have","invite","they","friend","and","he","wife","Charlotte","over","for","dinner",",","and","be","on","pin","and","needle",",","as","they","want","everything","to","go","just","right",".","instead",",","George","allow","he","bitterness","that","Charlotte",",","he","ex-girlfriend",",","marry","a","success","to","overwhelm","he",",","and","Martine","and","Jacques","be","apall","when","they","brother",",","who","have","not","a","penny","and","be","deeply","in","debt",",","persuade","they","guest","of","honor","to","join","he","in","a","high-stakes","poker","game","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Martine and Jacques","and Jacques knew","Jacques knew their","knew their friend","their friend before","friend before he","before he became","he became an","became an important","an important television","important television personality","television personality ,","personality , but",", but have","but have not","have not seen","not seen him","seen him for","him for over","for over ten","over ten years","They are hospitable","are hospitable people","hospitable people -","people -

{"title":"All She Wrote Anthology","plot":"All She Wrote is a story of a group of talented, passionate and brave women who stand up for what they believe in and make their voices heard though the art of graffiti. Thriving in what's long been a male-dominated subculture of the art world, these exceptional women are strong, spirited and proud, and they refuse to be silent. Contrasting the stark differences between life in western and eastern societies, the director follows these women in their native environment as they continue to make their mark - on walls, in alleyways, on trains, and wherever their message can be seen. Whether political or social, all of them contribute to the ongoing fight for women's rights, while trying to affect change in their communities through a shared passion and medium: graffiti.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["All","She","Wrote","is","a","stori","of","a","group","of","talent",",","passion","and","brave","women","who","stand","up","for","what","they","believ","in","and","make","their","voic","heard","though","the","art","of","graffiti",".","Thrive","in","what","'s","long","been","a","male-domin","subcultur","of","the","art","world",",","these","except","women","are","strong",",","spirit","and","proud",",","and","they","refus","to","be","silent",".","Contrast","the","stark","differ","between","life","in","western","and","eastern","societi",",","the","director","follow","these","women","in","their","nativ","environ","as","they","continu","to","make","their","mark","-","on","wall",",","in","alleyway",",","on","train",",","and","wherev","their","messag","can","be","seen",".","Whether","polit","or","social",",","all","of","them","contribut","to","the","ongo","fight","for","women","'s","right",",","while","tri","to","affect","chang","in","their","communiti","through","a","share","passion","and","medium",":","graffiti","."],"lemmas":["all","she","write","be","a","story","of","a","group","of","talented",",","passionate","and","brave","woman","who","stand","up","for","what","they","believe","in","and","make","they","voice","hear","though","the","art","of","graffiti",".","thrive","in","what","be","long","be","a","male-dominated","subculture","of","the","art","world",",","these","exceptional","woman","be","strong",",","spirited","and","proud",",","and","they","refuse","to","be","silent",".","contrast","the","stark","difference","between","life","in","western","and","eastern","society",",","the","director","follow","these","woman","in","they","native","environment","as","they","continue","to","make","they","mark","-","on","wall",",","in","alleyway",",","on","train",",","and","wherever","they","message","can","be","see",".","whether","political","or","social",",","all","of","they","contribute","to","the","ongoing","fight","for","woman","'s","rights",",","while","try","to","affect","change","in","they","community","through","a","shared","passion","and","medium",":","graffiti","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["All She Wrote","She Wrote is","Wrote is a","is a story","a story of","story of a","of a group","a group of","group of talented","of talented ,","talented , passionate",", passionate and","passionate and brave","and brave women","brave women who","women who stand","who stand up","stand up for","up for what","for what they","what they believe","they believe in","believe in and","in and make","and make their","make their voices","their voices heard","voices heard though","heard though the","though the art","the art of","art of graffiti","Thriving in what","in what 's","what 's long","'s long been","long been a","been a male-dominated","a male-dominated subculture","male-dominated subculture of","subculture of the","of the art","the art world","art world ,","world , these",", these exceptional","these exceptional women","exceptional women are","women are strong","are strong ,","strong , spirited",", spirited and","spirited and proud","and proud ,","proud , and",", and they","and they refuse","they refuse to","refuse to be","to be silent","Contrasting the stark","the stark differences","stark differences between","differences between life","between life in","life in western","in western and","western and eastern","and eastern societies","eastern societies ,","societies , the",", the director","the director follows","director follows these","follows these women","these women in","women in their","in their native","their native environment","native environment as","environment as they","as they continue","they continue to","continue to make","to make their","make their mark","their mark -","mark -

{"title":"Wrong","plot":"Dolph Springer wakes up one morning to realize he has lost the love of his life, his dog, Paul. During his quest to get Paul (and his life) back, Dolph radically changes the lives of others: a pizza-delivering nymphomaniac, a jogging-addict neighbor in search of completeness, an opportunistic French-Mexican gardener, and an off-kilter pet detective. In his journey to find Paul, Dolph may lose something even more vital: his mind.","genres":["Comedy"," Mystery"],"stems":["Dolph","Springer","wake","up","one","morn","to","realiz","he","has","lost","the","love","of","his","life",",","his","dog",",","Paul",".","Dure","his","quest","to","get","Paul","(","and","his","life",")","back",",","Dolph","radic","chang","the","live","of","other",":","a","pizza-deliv","nymphomaniac",",","a","jogging-addict","neighbor","in","search","of","complet",",","an","opportunist","French-Mexican","garden",",","and","an","off-kilt","pet","detect",".","In","his","journey","to","find","Paul",",","Dolph","may","lose","someth","even","more","vital",":","his","mind","."],"lemmas":["Dolph","Springer","wake","up","one","morning","to","realize","he","have","lose","the","love","of","he","life",",","he","dog",",","Paul",".","during","he","quest","to","get","Paul","-lrb-","and","he","life","-rrb-","back",",","Dolph","radically","change","the","life","of","other",":","a","pizza-delivering","nymphomaniac",",","a","jogging-addict","neighbor","in","search","of","completeness",",","a","opportunistic","french-mexican","gardener",",","and","a","off-kilter","pet","detective",".","in","he","journey","to","find","Paul",",","Dolph","may","lose","something","even","more","vital",":","he","mind","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Dolph Springer wakes","Springer wakes up","wakes up one","up one morning","one morning to","morning to realize","to realize he","realize he has","he has lost","has lost the","lost the love","the love of","love of his","of his life","his life ,","life , his",", his dog","his dog ,","dog , Paul","During his quest","his quest to","quest to get","to get Paul","get Paul (","Paul ( and","( and his","and his life","his life )","life ) back",") back ,","back , Dolph",", Dolph radically","Dolph radically changes","radically changes the","changes the lives","the lives of","lives of others","of others :","others : a",": a pizza-delivering","a pizza-delivering nymphomaniac","pizza-delivering nymphomaniac ,","nymphomaniac , a",", a jogging-addict","a jogging-addict neighbor","jogging-addict neighbor in","neighbor in search","in search of","search of completeness","of completeness ,","completeness , an",", an opportunistic","an opportunistic French-Mexican","opportunistic French-Mexican gardener","French-Mexican gardener ,","gardener , and",", and an","and an off-kilter","an off-kilter pet","off-kilter pet detective","In his journey","his journey to","journey to find","to find Paul","find Paul ,","Paul , Dolph",", Dolph may","Dolph may lose","may lose something","lose something even","something even more","even more vital","more vital :","vital : his",": his mind"],"2grams":["Dolph Springer","Springer wakes","wakes up","up one","one morning","morning to","to realize","realize he","he has","has lost","lost the","the love","love of","of his","his life","life ,",", his","his dog","dog ,",", Paul","During his","his quest","quest to","to get","get Paul","Paul (","( and","and his","his life","life )",") back","back ,",", Dolph","Dolph radically","radically changes","changes the","the lives","lives of","of others","others :",": a","a pizza-delivering","pizza-delivering nymphomaniac","nymphomaniac ,",", a","a jogging-addict","jogging-addict neighbor","neighbor in","in search","search of","of completeness","completeness ,",", an","an opportunistic","opportunistic French-Mexican","French-Mexican gardener","gardener ,",", and","and an","an off-kilter","off-kilter pet","pet detective","In his","his journey","journey to","to find","find Paul","Paul ,",", Dolph","Dolph may","may lose","lose something","something even","even more","more vital","vital :",": his","his mind"]}

{"title":"Tweets from Tahrir","plot":"Young, urbane and highly-motivated, Cairo's 'twitterati' revealed the truth of the scale of the uprising which Egypt's state media sought to hide, and gave a street-level, minute-by-minute account both of how the persistence and bravery of the Egyptian people brought down a dictator but also how the naiveté and complacency which followed failed to bring about a revolution. The book 'Tweets From Tahrir' by OR Books was the inspiration for this film.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Young",",","urban","and","highly-motiv",",","Cairo","'s","'","twitterati","'","reveal","the","truth","of","the","scale","of","the","upris","which","Egypt","'s","state","media","sought","to","hide",",","and","gave","a","street-level",",","minute-by-minut","account","both","of","how","the","persist","and","braveri","of","the","Egyptian","peopl","brought","down","a","dictat","but","also","how","the","naiveté","and","complac","which","follow","fail","to","bring","about","a","revolut",".","The","book","'","Tweet","From","Tahrir","'","by","OR","Book","was","the","inspir","for","this","film","."],"lemmas":["young",",","urbane","and","highly-motivated",",","Cairo","'s","'","twitteratus","'","reveal","the","truth","of","the","scale","of","the","uprising","which","Egypt","'s","state","media","seek","to","hide",",","and","give","a","street-level",",","minute-by-minute","account","both","of","how","the","persistence","and","bravery","of","the","egyptian","people","bring","down","a","dictator","but","also","how","the","naiveté","and","complacency","which","follow","fail","to","bring","about","a","revolution",".","the","book","'","tweet","from","tahrir","'","by","or","book","be","the","inspiration","for","this","film","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Young , urbane",", urbane and","urbane and highly-motivated","and highly-motivated ,","highly-motivated , Cairo",", Cairo 's","Cairo 's '","'s ' twitterati","' twitterati '","twitterati ' revealed","' revealed the","revealed the truth","the truth of","truth of the","of the scale","the scale of","scale of the","of the uprising","the uprising which","uprising which Egypt","which Egypt 's","Egypt 's state","'s state media","state media sought","media sought to","sought to hide","to hide ,","hide , and",", and gave","and gave a","gave a street-level","a street-level ,","street-level , minute-by-minute",", minute-by-minute account","minute-by-minute account both","account both of","both of how","of how the","how the persistence","the persistence and","persistence and bravery","and bravery of","bravery of the","of the Egyptian","the Egyptian people","Egyptian people brought","people brought down","brought down a","down a dictator","a dictator but","dictator but also","but also how","also how the","how the naiveté","the naiveté and","naiveté and complacency","and complacency which","complacency which followed","which followed failed","followed failed to","failed to bring","to bring about","bring about a","about a revolution","The book '","book ' Tweets","' Tweets From","Tweets From Tahrir","From Tahrir '","Tahrir ' by","' by OR","by OR Books","OR Books was","Books was the","was the inspiration","the inspiration for","inspiration for this","for this film"],"2grams":["Young ,",", urbane","urbane and","and highly-motivated","highly-motivated ,",", Cairo","Cairo 's","'s '","' twitterati","twitterati '","' revealed","revealed the","the truth","truth of","of the","the scale","scale of","of the","the uprising","uprising which","which Egypt","Egypt 's","'s state","state media","media sought","sought to","to hide","hide ,",", and","and gave","gave a","a street-level","street-level ,",", minute-by-minute","minute-by-minute account","account both","both of","of how","how the","the persistence","persistence and","and bravery","bravery of","of the","the Egyptian","Egyptian people","people brought","brought down","down a","a dictator","dictator but","but also","also how","how the","the naiveté","naiveté and","and complacency","complacency which","which followed","followed failed","failed to","to bring","bring about","about a","a revolution","The book","book '","' Tweets","Tweets From","From Tahrir","Tahrir '","' by","by OR","OR Books","Books was","was the","the inspiration","inspiration for","for this","this film"]}

{"title":"Boujad: A Nest in the Heat","plot":"Boujad: A Nest In the Heat is a personal and anguishing look at issues of separation, independence and return. As director Hakim Belabbes chronicles his journey from his home in Chicago to visit his family in his hometown of Boujad in Morocco, his exploration of family relationships is self-conscious and at times painfully honest. We witness his most private moments with his family. Belabbes' film intimately explores the domestic spaces and religious rituals of intra-family relationships, especially when compounded by one member's break with traditional values.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Boujad",":","A","Nest","In","the","Heat","is","a","person","and","anguish","look","at","issu","of","separ",",","independ","and","return",".","As","director","Hakim","Belabb","chronicl","his","journey","from","his","home","in","Chicago","to","visit","his","famili","in","his","hometown","of","Boujad","in","Morocco",",","his","explor","of","famili","relationship","is","self-consci","and","at","time","pain","honest",".","We","wit","his","most","privat","moment","with","his","famili",".","Belabb","'","film","intim","explor","the","domest","space","and","religi","ritual","of","intra-famili","relationship",",","especi","when","compound","by","one","member","'s","break","with","tradit","valu","."],"lemmas":["Boujad",":","a","nest","in","the","Heat","be","a","personal","and","anguishing","look","at","issue","of","separation",",","independence","and","return",".","as","director","Hakim","Belabbes","chronicle","he","journey","from","he","home","in","Chicago","to","visit","he","family","in","he","hometown","of","Boujad","in","Morocco",",","he","exploration","of","family","relationship","be","self-conscious","and","at","time","painfully","honest",".","we","witness","he","most","private","moment","with","he","family",".","belabbe","'","film","intimately","explore","the","domestic","space","and","religious","ritual","of","intra-family","relationship",",","especially","when","compound","by","one","member","'s","break","with","traditional","value","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Boujad : A",": A Nest","A Nest In","Nest In the","In the Heat","the Heat is","Heat is a","is a personal","a personal and","personal and anguishing","and anguishing look","anguishing look at","look at issues","at issues of","issues of separation","of separation ,","separation , independence",", independence and","independence and return","As director Hakim","director Hakim Belabbes","Hakim Belabbes chronicles","Belabbes chronicles his","chronicles his journey","his journey from","journey from his","from his home","his home in","home in Chicago","in Chicago to","Chicago to visit","to visit his","visit his family","his family in","family in his","in his hometown","his hometown of","hometown of Boujad","of Boujad in","Boujad in Morocco","in Morocco ,","Morocco , his",", his exploration","his exploration of","exploration of family","of family relationships","family relationships is","relationships is self-conscious","is self-conscious and","self-conscious and at","and at times","at times painfully","times painfully honest","We witness his","witness his most","his most private","most private moments","private moments with","moments with his","with his family","Belabbes ' film","' film intimately","film intimately explores","intimately explores the","explores the domestic","the domestic spaces","domestic spaces and","spaces and religious","and religious rituals","religious rituals of","rituals of intra-family","of intra-family relationships","intra-family relationships ,","relationships , especially",", especially when","especially when compounded","when compounded by","compounded by one","by one member","one member 's","member 's break","'s break with","break with traditional","with traditional values"],"2grams":["Boujad :",": A","A Nest","Nest In","In the","the Heat","Heat is","is a","a personal","personal and","and anguishing","anguishing look","look at","at issues","issues of","of separation","separation ,",", independence","independence and","and return","As director","director Hakim","Hakim Belabbes","Belabbes chronicles","chronicles his","his journey","journey from","from his","his home","home in","in Chicago","Chicago to","to visit","visit his","his family","family in","in his","his hometown","hometown of","of Boujad","Boujad in","in Morocco","Morocco ,",", his","his exploration","exploration of","of family","family relationships","relationships is","is self-conscious","self-conscious and","and at","at times","times painfully","painfully honest","We witness","witness his","his most","most private","private moments","moments with","with his","his family","Belabbes '","' film","film intimately","intimately explores","explores the","the domestic","domestic spaces","spaces and","and religious","religious rituals","rituals of","of intra-family","intra-family relationships","relationships ,",", especially","especially when","when compounded","compounded by","by one","one member","member 's","'s break","break with","with traditional","traditional values"]}

{"title":"Singletrack High","plot":"At the age of 16, many American kids trade in two wheels for four. Trusty steeds that once gave them freedom to explore on weekends now collect dust in the garage. For a growing number of high school students in Northern California, however, two wheels don't get dusty, they get dirty. Their lives continue to revolve around weekend rides, but now those rides have a finish line. These are the student athletes of the NorCal High School Cycling League. This is Singletrack High.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["At","the","age","of","16",",","mani","American","kid","trade","in","two","wheel","for","four",".","Trusti","steed","that","onc","gave","them","freedom","to","explor","on","weekend","now","collect","dust","in","the","garag",".","For","a","grow","number","of","high","school","student","in","Northern","California",",","howev",",","two","wheel","do","n't","get","dusti",",","they","get","dirti",".","Their","live","continu","to","revolv","around","weekend","ride",",","but","now","those","ride","have","a","finish","line",".","These","are","the","student","athlet","of","the","NorCal","High","School","Cycl","Leagu",".","This","is","Singletrack","High","."],"lemmas":["at","the","age","of","16",",","many","american","kid","trade","in","two","wheel","for","four",".","trusty","steed","that","once","give","they","freedom","to","explore","on","weekend","now","collect","dust","in","the","garage",".","for","a","grow","number","of","high","school","student","in","Northern","California",",","however",",","two","wheel","do","not","get","dusty",",","they","get","dirty",".","they","life","continue","to","revolve","around","weekend","ride",",","but","now","those","ride","have","a","finish","line",".","these","be","the","student","athlete","of","the","NorCal","High","School","Cycling","League",".","this","be","Singletrack","High","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["At the age","the age of","age of 16","of 16 ,","16 , many",", many American","many American kids","American kids trade","kids trade in","trade in two","in two wheels","two wheels for","wheels for four","Trusty steeds that","steeds that once","that once gave","once gave them","gave them freedom","them freedom to","freedom to explore","to explore on","explore on weekends","on weekends now","weekends now collect","now collect dust","collect dust in","dust in the","in the garage","For a growing","a growing number","growing number of","number of high","of high school","high school students","school students in","students in Northern","in Northern California","Northern California ,","California , however",", however ,","however , two",", two wheels","two wheels do","wheels do n't","do n't get","n't get dusty","get dusty ,","dusty , they",", they get","they get dirty","Their lives continue","lives continue to","continue to revolve","to revolve around","revolve around weekend","around weekend rides","weekend rides ,","rides , but",", but now","but now those","now those rides","those rides have","rides have a","have a finish","a finish line","These are the","are the student","the student athletes","student athletes of","athletes of the","of the NorCal","the NorCal High","NorCal High School","High School Cycling","School Cycling League","This is Singletrack","is Singletrack High"],"2grams":["At the","the age","age of","of 16","16 ,",", many","many American","American kids","kids trade","trade in","in two","two wheels","wheels for","for four","Trusty steeds","steeds that","that once","once gave","gave them","them freedom","freedom to","to explore","explore on","on weekends","weekends now","now collect","collect dust","dust in","in the","the garage","For a","a growing","growing number","number of","of high","high school","school students","students in","in Northern","Northern California","California ,",", however","however ,",", two","two wheels","wheels do","do n't","n't get","get dusty","dusty ,",", they","they get","get dirty","Their lives","lives continue","continue to","to revolve","revolve around","around weekend","weekend rides","rides ,",", but","but now","now those","those rides","rides have","have a","a finish","finish line","These are","are the","the student","student athletes","athletes of","of the","the NorCal","NorCal High","High School","School Cycling","Cycling League","This is","is Singletrack","Singletrack High"]}

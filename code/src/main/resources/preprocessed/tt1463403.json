{"title":"Case Unknown","plot":"An arrogant medical man discovers there's more to his new patient than he imagined in this drama from Polish filmmaker Feliks Falk. Dr. Konstanty Grot (Borys Szyc) is an ambitious young doctor who is determined to make a name for himself, to the point that his wife often accuses him of being more interested in his career than in her. Grot believes that he can earn the respect of his peers by successfully treating a supposedly incurable patient, and he believes he may have found a likely candidate in Pawel Plocki (Grzegorz Wolf), a mental patient who can barely function. Grot signs Plocki out of the mental hospital where he's been treated for years and moves him into his own home; in time, Plocki shows genuine improvement, and Grot thinks he?s beaten the state medical establishment at their own game. But that?s before Grot learns some secrets about his patient that cast his condition in a new and disturbing light.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["An","arrog","medic","man","discov","there","'s","more","to","his","new","patient","than","he","imagin","in","this","drama","from","Polish","filmmak","Felik","Falk",".","Dr.","Konstanti","Grot","(","Bori","Szyc",")","is","an","ambiti","young","doctor","who","is","determin","to","make","a","name","for","himself",",","to","the","point","that","his","wife","often","accus","him","of","be","more","interest","in","his","career","than","in","her",".","Grot","believ","that","he","can","earn","the","respect","of","his","peer","by","success","treat","a","suppos","incur","patient",",","and","he","believ","he","may","have","found","a","like","candid","in","Pawel","Plocki","(","Grzegorz","Wolf",")",",","a","mental","patient","who","can","bare","function",".","Grot","sign","Plocki","out","of","the","mental","hospit","where","he","'s","been","treat","for","year","and","move","him","into","his","own","home",";","in","time",",","Plocki","show","genuin","improv",",","and","Grot","think","he?","beaten","the","state","medic","establish","at","their","own","game",".","But","that?","befor","Grot","learn","some","secret","about","his","patient","that","cast","his","condit","in","a","new","and","disturb","light","."],"lemmas":["a","arrogant","medical","man","discover","there","be","more","to","he","new","patient","than","he","imagine","in","this","drama","from","polish","filmmaker","Feliks","Falk",".","Dr.","Konstanty","Grot","-lrb-","Borys","Szyc","-rrb-","be","a","ambitious","young","doctor","who","be","determine","to","make","a","name","for","himself",",","to","the","point","that","he","wife","often","accuse","he","of","be","more","interested","in","he","career","than","in","she",".","Grot","believe","that","he","can","earn","the","respect","of","he","peer","by","successfully","treat","a","supposedly","incurable","patient",",","and","he","believe","he","may","have","find","a","likely","candidate","in","Pawel","Plocki","-lrb-","Grzegorz","Wolf","-rrb-",",","a","mental","patient","who","can","barely","function",".","grot","sign","Plocki","out","of","the","mental","hospital","where","he","be","be","treat","for","year","and","move","he","into","he","own","home",";","in","time",",","Plocki","show","genuine","improvement",",","and","Grot","think","he?s","beat","the","state","medical","establishment","at","they","own","game",".","but","that?s","before","Grot","learn","some","secret","about","he","patient","that","cast","he","condition","in","a","new","and","disturbing","light","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An arrogant medical","arrogant medical man","medical man discovers","man discovers there","discovers there 's","there 's more","'s more to","more to his","to his new","his new patient","new patient than","patient than he","than he imagined","he imagined in","imagined in this","in this drama","this drama from","drama from Polish","from Polish filmmaker","Polish filmmaker Feliks","filmmaker Feliks Falk","Dr. Konstanty Grot","Konstanty Grot (","Grot ( Borys","( Borys Szyc","Borys Szyc )","Szyc ) is",") is an","is an ambitious","an ambitious young","ambitious young doctor","young doctor who","doctor who is","who is determined","is determined to","determined to make","to make a","make a name","a name for","name for himself","for himself ,","himself , to",", to the","to the point","the point that","point that his","that his wife","his wife often","wife often accuses","often accuses him","accuses him of","him of being","of being more","being more interested","more interested in","interested in his","in his career","his career than","career than in","than in her","Grot believes that","believes that he","that he can","he can earn","can earn the","earn the respect","the respect of","respect of his","of his peers","his peers by","peers by successfully","by successfully treating","successfully treating a","treating a supposedly","a supposedly incurable","supposedly incurable patient","incurable patient ,","patient , and",", and he","and he believes","he believes he","believes he may","he may have","may have found","have found a","found a likely","a likely candidate","likely candidate in","candidate in Pawel","in Pawel Plocki","Pawel Plocki (","Plocki ( Grzegorz","( Grzegorz Wolf","Grzegorz Wolf )","Wolf ) ,",") , a",", a mental","a mental patient","mental patient who","patient who can","who can barely","can barely function","Grot signs Plocki","signs Plocki out","Plocki out of","out of the","of the mental","the mental hospital","mental hospital where","hospital where he","where he 's","he 's been","'s been treated","been treated for","treated for years","for years and","years and moves","and moves him","moves him into","him into his","into his own","his own home","own home ;","home ;

{"title":"Shady Lady","plot":"This is the epic story of a B-24 'Liberator' bomber aircraft called 'Shady Lady', that took off from Darwin, Australia, on Friday, 13th August 1943, on what was at that time, the world's longest ever attempted bombing mission. Under the command of 'Doug' Craig, 'Shady Lady' set off with 10 other aircraft to attack the oil refineries at Balikpapan, Borneo. With the target hundreds of miles behind enemy lines, this was an audacious attempt to strike back at the Imperial Japanese Army. 'Shady Lady' survived intense tropical thunderstorms, serious turbulence, heavy enemy antiaircraft fire and was chased by Japanese Zero fighters - but never made it back to base. 'Shady Lady,' after 16 hours and 35 minutes in the air, ran out of fuel and was crash-landed in a salt-pan, in the remotest part of Northern Australia. Local support from the Aborigines and a massive rescue mission amazingly saw 'Shady Lady' - fly again.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["This","is","the","epic","stori","of","a","B-24","'","Liber","'","bomber","aircraft","call","'","Shadi","Ladi","'",",","that","took","off","from","Darwin",",","Australia",",","on","Friday",",","13th","August","1943",",","on","what","was","at","that","time",",","the","world","'s","longest","ever","attempt","bomb","mission",".","Under","the","command","of","'","Doug","'","Craig",",","'","Shadi","Ladi","'","set","off","with","10","other","aircraft","to","attack","the","oil","refineri","at","Balikpapan",",","Borneo",".","With","the","target","hundr","of","mile","behind","enemi","line",",","this","was","an","audaci","attempt","to","strike","back","at","the","Imperial","Japanes","Armi",".","'","Shadi","Ladi","'","surviv","intens","tropic","thunderstorm",",","serious","turbul",",","heavi","enemi","antiaircraft","fire","and","was","chase","by","Japanes","Zero","fighter","-","but","never","made","it","back","to","base",".","'","Shadi","Ladi",",","'","after","16","hour","and","35","minut","in","the","air",",","ran","out","of","fuel","and","was","crash-land","in","a","salt-pan",",","in","the","remotest","part","of","Northern","Australia",".","Local","support","from","the","Aborigin","and","a","massiv","rescu","mission","amaz","saw","'","Shadi","Ladi","'","-","fli","again","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","epic","story","of","a","b-24","'","Liberator","'","bomber","aircraft","call","'","Shady","Lady","'",",","that","take","off","from","Darwin",",","Australia",",","on","Friday",",","13th","August","1943",",","on","what","be","at","that","time",",","the","world","'s","longest","ever","attempt","bombing","mission",".","under","the","command","of","'","Doug","'","Craig",",","'","Shady","Lady","'","set","off","with","10","other","aircraft","to","attack","the","oil","refinery","at","Balikpapan",",","Borneo",".","with","the","target","hundred","of","mile","behind","enemy","line",",","this","be","a","audacious","attempt","to","strike","back","at","the","Imperial","Japanese","Army",".","'","Shady","Lady","'","survive","intense","tropical","thunderstorm",",","serious","turbulence",",","heavy","enemy","antiaircraft","fire","and","be","chase","by","Japanese","Zero","fighter","-","but","never","make","it","back","to","base",".","'","Shady","Lady",",","'","after","16","hour","and","35","minute","in","the","air",",","run","out","of","fuel","and","be","crash-landed","in","a","salt-pan",",","in","the","remotest","part","of","Northern","Australia",".","local","support","from","the","Aborigines","and","a","massive","rescue","mission","amazingly","see","'","Shady","Lady","'","-","fly","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is the","is the epic","the epic story","epic story of","story of a","of a B-24","a B-24 '","B-24 ' Liberator","' Liberator '","Liberator ' bomber","' bomber aircraft","bomber aircraft called","aircraft called '","called ' Shady","' Shady Lady","Shady Lady '","Lady ' ,","' , that",", that took","that took off","took off from","off from Darwin","from Darwin ,","Darwin , Australia",", Australia ,","Australia , on",", on Friday","on Friday ,","Friday , 13th",", 13th August","13th August 1943","August 1943 ,","1943 , on",", on what","on what was","what was at","was at that","at that time","that time ,","time , the",", the world","the world 's","world 's longest","'s longest ever","longest ever attempted","ever attempted bombing","attempted bombing mission","Under the command","the command of","command of '","of ' Doug","' Doug '","Doug ' Craig","' Craig ,","Craig , '",", ' Shady","' Shady Lady","Shady Lady '","Lady ' set","' set off","set off with","off with 10","with 10 other","10 other aircraft","other aircraft to","aircraft to attack","to attack the","attack the oil","the oil refineries","oil refineries at","refineries at Balikpapan","at Balikpapan ,","Balikpapan , Borneo","With the target","the target hundreds","target hundreds of","hundreds of miles","of miles behind","miles behind enemy","behind enemy lines","enemy lines ,","lines , this",", this was","this was an","was an audacious","an audacious attempt","audacious attempt to","attempt to strike","to strike back","strike back at","back at the","at the Imperial","the Imperial Japanese","Imperial Japanese Army","Japanese Army .","Army .

{"title":"Lace Bite","plot":"To make good on a promise to a dying friend, Val Skelly convinced 39 women to put their lives on hold for 10 days to break the world record for the longest ice hockey game ever played. Little did they know what 243 hours in skates would feel like or how battered their bodies and minds would be. 'Lace Bite' chronicles the journey of this remarkable group of women in a fascinating and inspirational behind-the-scenes look at the game. At the 11th hour, when players broke down and lost their way, they were held up by the same cystic fibrosis community they inspired. A heart-warming story of community, a love of hockey, and the passion to make a difference. And a great Canadian music soundtrack.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["To","make","good","on","a","promis","to","a","die","friend",",","Val","Skelli","convinc","39","women","to","put","their","live","on","hold","for","10","day","to","break","the","world","record","for","the","longest","ice","hockey","game","ever","play",".","Littl","did","they","know","what","243","hour","in","skate","would","feel","like","or","how","batter","their","bodi","and","mind","would","be",".","'","Lace","Bite","'","chronicl","the","journey","of","this","remark","group","of","women","in","a","fascin","and","inspir","behind-the-scen","look","at","the","game",".","At","the","11th","hour",",","when","player","broke","down","and","lost","their","way",",","they","were","held","up","by","the","same","cystic","fibrosi","communiti","they","inspir",".","A","heart-warm","stori","of","communiti",",","a","love","of","hockey",",","and","the","passion","to","make","a","differ",".","And","a","great","Canadian","music","soundtrack","."],"lemmas":["to","make","good","on","a","promise","to","a","die","friend",",","val","Skelly","convince","39","woman","to","put","they","life","on","hold","for","10","day","to","break","the","world","record","for","the","longest","ice","hockey","game","ever","play",".","Little","do","they","know","what","243","hour","in","skate","would","feel","like","or","how","battered","they","body","and","mind","would","be",".","'","Lace","Bite","'","chronicle","the","journey","of","this","remarkable","group","of","woman","in","a","fascinating","and","inspirational","behind-the-scenes","look","at","the","game",".","at","the","11th","hour",",","when","player","break","down","and","lose","they","way",",","they","be","hold","up","by","the","same","cystic","fibrosis","community","they","inspire",".","a","heart-warming","story","of","community",",","a","love","of","hockey",",","and","the","passion","to","make","a","difference",".","and","a","great","canadian","music","soundtrack","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["To make good","make good on","good on a","on a promise","a promise to","promise to a","to a dying","a dying friend","dying friend ,","friend , Val",", Val Skelly","Val Skelly convinced","Skelly convinced 39","convinced 39 women","39 women to","women to put","to put their","put their lives","their lives on","lives on hold","on hold for","hold for 10","for 10 days","10 days to","days to break","to break the","break the world","the world record","world record for","record for the","for the longest","the longest ice","longest ice hockey","ice hockey game","hockey game ever","game ever played","Little did they","did they know","they know what","know what 243","what 243 hours","243 hours in","hours in skates","in skates would","skates would feel","would feel like","feel like or","like or how","or how battered","how battered their","battered their bodies","their bodies and","bodies and minds","and minds would","minds would be","would be .","be .

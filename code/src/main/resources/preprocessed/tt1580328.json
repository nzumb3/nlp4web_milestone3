{"title":"Overdue","plot":"'Overdue' is feature length dramatic comedy that uses humor to explore the impact your friends can have on your romantic relationships, both positively and negatively. Shot on a budget of next to nothing, the charm of the film is in it's well crafted dialog and focus on good story telling. It's not your typical low budget feature, it prides itself on entertaining the audience rather than trying to make a film shot for a couple of thousand dollars look like a million dollar movie. The humor is honest and sometimes crude, but beneath it all is a moral center and a story about learning how to accept the people you love for who they are, not what they've done. The story centers around an overweight male in his mid twenties who has to struggle with his own insecurities in order to win over the girl of his dreams. After winning the girl over he discovers something about her past that could ruin both his relationship with her and the relationship of him and his best friend.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

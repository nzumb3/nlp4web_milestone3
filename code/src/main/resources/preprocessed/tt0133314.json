Magazine editors go with the photos even though the dominant figure in them is a chubby football fan. \"So let him sue.\" When the magazine appears, the fan, Franck Bordoni, is fired since he was supposed to be at work. Bordoni comes to the magazine where, by coincidence, he meets Verdier. Verdier says he knows how to make some money. They go to a restaurant where Johnny Hallyday is leaving.

{"title":"The Confessions of Roee Rosen","plot":"At the beginning of Confessions Roee Rosen declares that now that he is about to die, he disavows a career replete with lies, scandals, and fake identities. and joins the confessional tradition that leads from St. Augustine to American TV. These confessions, however, are delivered by female surrogates - Roee Rosen 1, 2 and 3 - three illegal foreign workers residing in Israel. They deliver the monologues in Hebrew, a language they do not speak, by reading a transliteration of the text to Latin letters from a teleprompter. Marks on the teleprompter scroll indicated to the performers to occasionally mimic the body movements and facial expressions of the real Roee Rosen, at the other side of the camera. The text is built as a hybrid: on the one hand, it offers a rather dubious account of my own \"crimes,\" but on the other hand, it is partially plausible as a monologue of a foreign worker.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["At","the","begin","of","Confess","Roee","Rosen","declar","that","now","that","he","is","about","to","die",",","he","disavow","a","career","replet","with","lie",",","scandal",",","and","fake","ident",".","and","join","the","confession","tradit","that","lead","from","St.","Augustin","to","American","TV",".","These","confess",",","howev",",","are","deliv","by","femal","surrog","-","Roee","Rosen","1",",","2","and","3","-","three","illeg","foreign","worker","resid","in","Israel",".","They","deliv","the","monologu","in","Hebrew",",","a","languag","they","do","not","speak",",","by","read","a","transliter","of","the","text","to","Latin","letter","from","a","teleprompt",".","Mark","on","the","teleprompt","scroll","indic","to","the","perform","to","occasion","mimic","the","bodi","movement","and","facial","express","of","the","real","Roee","Rosen",",","at","the","other","side","of","the","camera",".","The","text","is","built","as","a","hybrid",":","on","the","one","hand",",","it","offer","a","rather","dubious","account","of","my","own","\"","crime",",","\"","but","on","the","other","hand",",","it","is","partial","plausibl","as","a","monologu","of","a","foreign","worker","."],"lemmas":["at","the","beginning","of","Confessions","Roee","Rosen","declare","that","now","that","he","be","about","to","die",",","he","disavow","a","career","replete","with","lie",",","scandal",",","and","fake","identity",".","and","join","the","confessional","tradition","that","lead","from","St.","Augustine","to","american","tv",".","these","confession",",","however",",","be","deliver","by","female","surrogate","-","Roee","Rosen","1",",","2","and","3","-","three","illegal","foreign","worker","reside","in","Israel",".","they","deliver","the","monologue","in","Hebrew",",","a","language","they","do","not","speak",",","by","read","a","transliteration","of","the","text","to","latin","letter","from","a","teleprompter",".","mark","on","the","teleprompter","scroll","indicate","to","the","performer","to","occasionally","mimic","the","body","movement","and","facial","expression","of","the","real","Roee","Rosen",",","at","the","other","side","of","the","camera",".","the","text","be","build","as","a","hybrid",":","on","the","one","hand",",","it","offer","a","rather","dubious","account","of","my","own","``","crime",",","''","but","on","the","other","hand",",","it","be","partially","plausible","as","a","monologue","of","a","foreign","worker","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["At the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of Confessions","of Confessions Roee","Confessions Roee Rosen","Roee Rosen declares","Rosen declares that","declares that now","that now that","now that he","that he is","he is about","is about to","about to die","to die ,","die , he",", he disavows","he disavows a","disavows a career","a career replete","career replete with","replete with lies","with lies ,","lies , scandals",", scandals ,","scandals , and",", and fake","and fake identities","and joins the","joins the confessional","the confessional tradition","confessional tradition that","tradition that leads","that leads from","leads from St.","from St. Augustine","St. Augustine to","Augustine to American","to American TV","These confessions ,","confessions , however",", however ,","however , are",", are delivered","are delivered by","delivered by female","by female surrogates","female surrogates -","surrogates -

{"title":"Nancy, Please","plot":"NANCY, PLEASE tells the story of Paul Brawley, a gifted PhD candidate at Yale University. Paul has just moved into an apartment with his pragmatic girlfriend, Jen, and is struggling to complete his dissertation before embarking on a career in academia. There's just one snag: as Paul is unpacking his belongings, he discovers that something has been left behind. A seemingly inconsequential object, but one Paul feels is of great importance to his dissertation and, therefore, to his future: a battered, personally annotated hardcover copy of 'Little Dorrit' by Charles Dickens. He will have to retrieve it from his former roommate - the obstinate Nancy. As he becomes increasingly consumed with the retrieval of 'Little Dorrit', Paul's relationship and career unravel.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["NANCi",",","PLEASE","tell","the","stori","of","Paul","Brawley",",","a","gift","PhD","candid","at","Yale","Univers",".","Paul","has","just","move","into","an","apart","with","his","pragmat","girlfriend",",","Jen",",","and","is","struggl","to","complet","his","dissert","befor","embark","on","a","career","in","academia",".","There","'s","just","one","snag",":","as","Paul","is","unpack","his","belong",",","he","discov","that","someth","has","been","left","behind",".","A","seem","inconsequenti","object",",","but","one","Paul","feel","is","of","great","import","to","his","dissert","and",",","therefor",",","to","his","futur",":","a","batter",",","person","annot","hardcov","copi","of","'","Littl","Dorrit","'","by","Charl","Dicken",".","He","will","have","to","retriev","it","from","his","former","roommat","-","the","obstin","Nanci",".","As","he","becom","increas","consum","with","the","retriev","of","'","Littl","Dorrit","'",",","Paul","'s","relationship","and","career","unravel","."],"lemmas":["NANCY",",","PLEASE","tell","the","story","of","Paul","Brawley",",","a","gifted","phd","candidate","at","Yale","University",".","Paul","have","just","move","into","a","apartment","with","he","pragmatic","girlfriend",",","jen",",","and","be","struggle","to","complete","he","dissertation","before","embark","on","a","career","in","academia",".","there","be","just","one","snag",":","as","Paul","be","unpack","he","belongings",",","he","discover","that","something","have","be","leave","behind",".","a","seemingly","inconsequential","object",",","but","one","Paul","feel","be","of","great","importance","to","he","dissertation","and",",","therefore",",","to","he","future",":","a","battered",",","personally","annotated","hardcover","copy","of","'","little","dorrit","'","by","Charles","Dickens",".","he","will","have","to","retrieve","it","from","he","former","roommate","-","the","obstinate","Nancy",".","as","he","become","increasingly","consume","with","the","retrieval","of","'","Little","Dorrit","'",",","Paul","'s","relationship","and","career","unravel","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["NANCY , PLEASE",", PLEASE tells","PLEASE tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of Paul","of Paul Brawley","Paul Brawley ,","Brawley , a",", a gifted","a gifted PhD","gifted PhD candidate","PhD candidate at","candidate at Yale","at Yale University","Paul has just","has just moved","just moved into","moved into an","into an apartment","an apartment with","apartment with his","with his pragmatic","his pragmatic girlfriend","pragmatic girlfriend ,","girlfriend , Jen",", Jen ,","Jen , and",", and is","and is struggling","is struggling to","struggling to complete","to complete his","complete his dissertation","his dissertation before","dissertation before embarking","before embarking on","embarking on a","on a career","a career in","career in academia","There 's just","'s just one","just one snag","one snag :","snag : as",": as Paul","as Paul is","Paul is unpacking","is unpacking his","unpacking his belongings","his belongings ,","belongings , he",", he discovers","he discovers that","discovers that something","that something has","something has been","has been left","been left behind","A seemingly inconsequential","seemingly inconsequential object","inconsequential object ,","object , but",", but one","but one Paul","one Paul feels","Paul feels is","feels is of","is of great","of great importance","great importance to","importance to his","to his dissertation","his dissertation and","dissertation and ,","and , therefore",", therefore ,","therefore , to",", to his","to his future","his future :","future : a",": a battered","a battered ,","battered , personally",", personally annotated","personally annotated hardcover","annotated hardcover copy","hardcover copy of","copy of '","of ' Little","' Little Dorrit","Little Dorrit '","Dorrit ' by","' by Charles","by Charles Dickens","He will have","will have to","have to retrieve","to retrieve it","retrieve it from","it from his","from his former","his former roommate","former roommate -","roommate -

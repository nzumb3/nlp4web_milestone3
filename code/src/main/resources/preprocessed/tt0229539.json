{"title":"Heart of China","plot":"The film tells the story of a grounded American pilot during the Second World War who learns about the noble spirit of the Chinese poeple when he is rescued by the communist-led Chinese army after an emergency landing near the Great Wall. On the way to the Communist base, the pilot falls in love with a girl soldier whose lingering memory of being raped by the Japanese makes her a determined fighter. Half a century later, the American pilot returns to the Yellow River to pay his respects to the native people who rescued him.","genres":["Drama"," War"],"stems":["The","film","tell","the","stori","of","a","ground","American","pilot","dure","the","Second","World","War","who","learn","about","the","nobl","spirit","of","the","Chines","poepl","when","he","is","rescu","by","the","communist-l","Chines","armi","after","an","emerg","land","near","the","Great","Wall",".","On","the","way","to","the","Communist","base",",","the","pilot","fall","in","love","with","a","girl","soldier","whose","linger","memori","of","be","rape","by","the","Japanes","make","her","a","determin","fighter",".","Half","a","centuri","later",",","the","American","pilot","return","to","the","Yellow","River","to","pay","his","respect","to","the","nativ","peopl","who","rescu","him","."],"lemmas":["the","film","tell","the","story","of","a","ground","american","pilot","during","the","Second","World","War","who","learn","about","the","noble","spirit","of","the","chinese","poeple","when","he","be","rescue","by","the","communist-led","chinese","army","after","a","emergency","landing","near","the","Great","Wall",".","on","the","way","to","the","communist","base",",","the","pilot","fall","in","love","with","a","girl","soldier","whose","linger","memory","of","be","rape","by","the","Japanese","make","she","a","determine","fighter",".","half","a","century","later",",","the","american","pilot","return","to","the","Yellow","River","to","pay","he","respects","to","the","native","people","who","rescue","he","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film tells","film tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of a","of a grounded","a grounded American","grounded American pilot","American pilot during","pilot during the","during the Second","the Second World","Second World War","World War who","War who learns","who learns about","learns about the","about the noble","the noble spirit","noble spirit of","spirit of the","of the Chinese","the Chinese poeple","Chinese poeple when","poeple when he","when he is","he is rescued","is rescued by","rescued by the","by the communist-led","the communist-led Chinese","communist-led Chinese army","Chinese army after","army after an","after an emergency","an emergency landing","emergency landing near","landing near the","near the Great","the Great Wall","On the way","the way to","way to the","to the Communist","the Communist base","Communist base ,","base , the",", the pilot","the pilot falls","pilot falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with a","with a girl","a girl soldier","girl soldier whose","soldier whose lingering","whose lingering memory","lingering memory of","memory of being","of being raped","being raped by","raped by the","by the Japanese","the Japanese makes","Japanese makes her","makes her a","her a determined","a determined fighter","Half a century","a century later","century later ,","later , the",", the American","the American pilot","American pilot returns","pilot returns to","returns to the","to the Yellow","the Yellow River","Yellow River to","River to pay","to pay his","pay his respects","his respects to","respects to the","to the native","the native people","native people who","people who rescued","who rescued him"],"2grams":["The film","film tells","tells the","the story","story of","of a","a grounded","grounded American","American pilot","pilot during","during the","the Second","Second World","World War","War who","who learns","learns about","about the","the noble","noble spirit","spirit of","of the","the Chinese","Chinese poeple","poeple when","when he","he is","is rescued","rescued by","by the","the communist-led","communist-led Chinese","Chinese army","army after","after an","an emergency","emergency landing","landing near","near the","the Great","Great Wall","On the","the way","way to","to the","the Communist","Communist base","base ,",", the","the pilot","pilot falls","falls in","in love","love with","with a","a girl","girl soldier","soldier whose","whose lingering","lingering memory","memory of","of being","being raped","raped by","by the","the Japanese","Japanese makes","makes her","her a","a determined","determined fighter","Half a","a century","century later","later ,",", the","the American","American pilot","pilot returns","returns to","to the","the Yellow","Yellow River","River to","to pay","pay his","his respects","respects to","to the","the native","native people","people who","who rescued","rescued him"]}

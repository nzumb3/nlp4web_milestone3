{"title":"Berlusconi's Mousetrap","plot":"The Protests against the G8 in July 2001 in Genoa Italy were the biggest and most significant protests in Western Europe since the Poll Tax riots in the UK. Italian Prime Minister Sylvio Berlusconi, wanting to impress his new best mate George W. Bush, orchestrated a brutal Media/Police preemptive strike on the Anti-Capitalist Movements' biggest First World mobilisation to date. When the weekend of protests ended Carlo Guiliani was dead and a school full of sleeping activists had been attacked in what is popularly referred to as the 'Chilean Night'. The film traces the events of the three days of protests in detail and poses the question - Was it all a setup? If Seattle was 'Star Wars' then this was 'The Empire Strikes Back'. It was made from a combination of footage of the Genoa protests against the G8 shot by 10 members of IMC Ireland, material from the Italy IMC Archives and material from various other sources. This footage combined with on the spot interviews and reenacted voiceover commentary and analysis from various websites which were active during the protests provides a in-depth blow by blow retelling of the story of the three days of the Genoa protests against the G8.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Protest","against","the","G8","in","Juli","2001","in","Genoa","Itali","were","the","biggest","and","most","signific","protest","in","Western","Europ","sinc","the","Poll","Tax","riot","in","the","UK",".","Italian","Prime","Minist","Sylvio","Berlusconi",",","want","to","impress","his","new","best","mate","Georg","W.","Bush",",","orchestr","a","brutal","Media/Polic","preemptiv","strike","on","the","Anti-Capitalist","Movement","'","biggest","First","World","mobilis","to","date",".","When","the","weekend","of","protest","end","Carlo","Guiliani","was","dead","and","a","school","full","of","sleep","activist","had","been","attack","in","what","is","popular","refer","to","as","the","'","Chilean","Night","'",".","The","film","trace","the","event","of","the","three","day","of","protest","in","detail","and","pose","the","question","-","Was","it","all","a","setup","?","If","Seattl","was","'","Star","War","'","then","this","was","'","The","Empire","Strike","Back","'",".","It","was","made","from","a","combin","of","footag","of","the","Genoa","protest","against","the","G8","shot","by","10","member","of","IMC","Ireland",",","materi","from","the","Itali","IMC","Archive","and","materi","from","various","other","sourc",".","This","footag","combin","with","on","the","spot","interview","and","reenact","voiceov","commentari","and","analysi","from","various","websit","which","were","activ","dure","the","protest","provid","a","in-depth","blow","by","blow","retel","of","the","stori","of","the","three","day","of","the","Genoa","protest","against","the","G8","."],"lemmas":["the","Protests","against","the","g8","in","July","2001","in","Genoa","Italy","be","the","biggest","and","most","significant","protest","in","Western","Europe","since","the","Poll","tax","riot","in","the","UK",".","Italian","Prime","Minister","Sylvio","Berlusconi",",","want","to","impress","he","new","best","mate","George","W.","Bush",",","orchestrate","a","brutal","media/police","preemptive","strike","on","the","anti-capitalist","movement","'","biggest","First","World","mobilisation","to","date",".","when","the","weekend","of","protest","end","Carlo","Guiliani","be","dead","and","a","school","full","of","sleep","activist","have","be","attack","in","what","be","popularly","refer","to","as","the","'","chilean","night","'",".","the","film","trace","the","event","of","the","three","day","of","protest","in","detail","and","pose","the","question","-","be","it","all","a","setup","?","if","Seattle","be","'","Star","Wars","'","then","this","be","'","the","Empire","strike","back","'",".","it","be","make","from","a","combination","of","footage","of","the","Genoa","protest","against","the","g8","shoot","by","10","member","of","IMC","Ireland",",","material","from","the","Italy","IMC","Archives","and","material","from","various","other","source",".","this","footage","combine","with","on","the","spot","interview","and","reenact","voiceover","commentary","and","analysis","from","various","website","which","be","active","during","the","protest","provide","a","in-depth","blow","by","blow","retelling","of","the","story","of","the","three","day","of","the","Genoa","protest","against","the","g8","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Protests against","Protests against the","against the G8","the G8 in","G8 in July","in July 2001","July 2001 in","2001 in Genoa","in Genoa Italy","Genoa Italy were","Italy were the","were the biggest","the biggest and","biggest and most","and most significant","most significant protests","significant protests in","protests in Western","in Western Europe","Western Europe since","Europe since the","since the Poll","the Poll Tax","Poll Tax riots","Tax riots in","riots in the","in the UK","Italian Prime Minister","Prime Minister Sylvio","Minister Sylvio Berlusconi","Sylvio Berlusconi ,","Berlusconi , wanting",", wanting to","wanting to impress","to impress his","impress his new","his new best","new best mate","best mate George","mate George W.","George W.

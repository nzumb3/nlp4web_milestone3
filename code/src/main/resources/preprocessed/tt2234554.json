{"title":"King George VI: The Man Behind the King's Speech","plot":"King's Speech is the definitive story of the man who overcame his own failings for the sake of his nation. When his older brother, Edward VIII abdicates the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, nervous-mannered successor George \"Bertie\" VI is plagued with shyness and a speech impediment when speaking to his subjects. It is the true story of an introvert and humble man whom events and circumstances made him become an inspiration for the British nation during their war with Hitler's Germany.","genres":["Biography"," History"],"stems":["King","'s","Speech","is","the","definit","stori","of","the","man","who","overcam","his","own","fail","for","the","sake","of","his","nation",".","When","his","older","brother",",","Edward","VIII","abdic","the","throne","to","marri","Walli","Simpson",",","nervous-mann","successor","Georg","\"","Berti","\"","VI","is","plagu","with","shyness","and","a","speech","impedi","when","speak","to","his","subject",".","It","is","the","true","stori","of","an","introvert","and","humbl","man","whom","event","and","circumst","made","him","becom","an","inspir","for","the","British","nation","dure","their","war","with","Hitler","'s","Germani","."],"lemmas":["King","'s","speech","be","the","definitive","story","of","the","man","who","overcome","he","own","failing","for","the","sake","of","he","nation",".","when","he","older","brother",",","Edward","VIII","abdicate","the","throne","to","marry","Wallis","Simpson",",","nervous-mannered","successor","George","``","Bertie","''","VI","be","plague","with","shyness","and","a","speech","impediment","when","speak","to","he","subject",".","it","be","the","true","story","of","a","introvert","and","humble","man","whom","event","and","circumstance","make","he","become","a","inspiration","for","the","british","nation","during","they","war","with","Hitler","'s","Germany","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["King 's Speech","'s Speech is","Speech is the","is the definitive","the definitive story","definitive story of","story of the","of the man","the man who","man who overcame","who overcame his","overcame his own","his own failings","own failings for","failings for the","for the sake","the sake of","sake of his","of his nation","When his older","his older brother","older brother ,","brother , Edward",", Edward VIII","Edward VIII abdicates","VIII abdicates the","abdicates the throne","the throne to","throne to marry","to marry Wallis","marry Wallis Simpson","Wallis Simpson ,","Simpson , nervous-mannered",", nervous-mannered successor","nervous-mannered successor George","successor George \"","George \" Bertie","\" Bertie \"","Bertie \" VI","\" VI is","VI is plagued","is plagued with","plagued with shyness","with shyness and","shyness and a","and a speech","a speech impediment","speech impediment when","impediment when speaking","when speaking to","speaking to his","to his subjects","It is the","is the true","the true story","true story of","story of an","of an introvert","an introvert and","introvert and humble","and humble man","humble man whom","man whom events","whom events and","events and circumstances","and circumstances made","circumstances made him","made him become","him become an","become an inspiration","an inspiration for","inspiration for the","for the British","the British nation","British nation during","nation during their","during their war","their war with","war with Hitler","with Hitler 's","Hitler 's Germany"],"2grams":["King 's","'s Speech","Speech is","is the","the definitive","definitive story","story of","of the","the man","man who","who overcame","overcame his","his own","own failings","failings for","for the","the sake","sake of","of his","his nation","When his","his older","older brother","brother ,",", Edward","Edward VIII","VIII abdicates","abdicates the","the throne","throne to","to marry","marry Wallis","Wallis Simpson","Simpson ,",", nervous-mannered","nervous-mannered successor","successor George","George \"","\" Bertie","Bertie \"","\" VI","VI is","is plagued","plagued with","with shyness","shyness and","and a","a speech","speech impediment","impediment when","when speaking","speaking to","to his","his subjects","It is","is the","the true","true story","story of","of an","an introvert","introvert and","and humble","humble man","man whom","whom events","events and","and circumstances","circumstances made","made him","him become","become an","an inspiration","inspiration for","for the","the British","British nation","nation during","during their","their war","war with","with Hitler","Hitler 's","'s Germany"]}

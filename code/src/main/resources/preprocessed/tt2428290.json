{"title":"Spitfire: Back to Zero","plot":"The incredible story of one of the best heavy metal bands in the country. Spitfire had everything going for them until one day, lead singer Dinos Costakis was involved in a tragic accident that forced him to retire from the stage after sustaining a serious injury. Over the course of one night, his marvelous voice became metal history before he even reached his peak. Despite adversity, Spitfire found the strength to go on. This documentary features previously unreleased tracks with the legendary \"First Attack\" line-up. Manager Yanis Koutouvos and founder-lead guitarist Elias Loginidis take a walk down memory lane. \"Spitfire: Back to Zero\" documents a long overdue reunion after a fifteen year hiatus, giving rise to memories, disagreements and conflict. But what is it all about? Art? Glory? Money? The only one who can provide the answers is Dinos Costakis, the voice that forever ceased... Because life surpasses art and it always will.","genres":["Documentary","

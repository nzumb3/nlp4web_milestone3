{"title":"You Don't Know Dick: Courageous Hearts of Transsexual Men","plot":"Lyle, Max, Michael, Steven, Ted, and James: a photographer who lifts weights, a cop, a mechanic, writers, an artist; one is gay, at least three are in serious relationships with women; one was in the seminary; one has three children from a previous marriage. All six were born female, and all are female-to-male (\"FTM\") transsexuals. They talk about childhood, deciding to make the change, telling parents and friends and co-workers, testosterone therapy, surgeries, organs, embracing their histories, and how their lives are now. Friends, a parent, lovers, and two children also talk. All six men express joy at their new-found and more complete identities.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Lyle",",","Max",",","Michael",",","Steven",",","Ted",",","and","Jame",":","a","photograph","who","lift","weight",",","a","cop",",","a","mechan",",","writer",",","an","artist",";","one","is","gay",",","at","least","three","are","in","serious","relationship","with","women",";","one","was","in","the","seminari",";","one","has","three","children","from","a","previous","marriag",".","All","six","were","born","femal",",","and","all","are","female-to-mal","(","\"","FTM","\"",")","transsexu",".","They","talk","about","childhood",",","decid","to","make","the","chang",",","tell","parent","and","friend","and","co-work",",","testosteron","therapi",",","surgeri",",","organ",",","embrac","their","histori",",","and","how","their","live","are","now",".","Friend",",","a","parent",",","lover",",","and","two","children","also","talk",".","All","six","men","express","joy","at","their","new-found","and","more","complet","ident","."],"lemmas":["Lyle",",","Max",",","Michael",",","Steven",",","Ted",",","and","James",":","a","photographer","who","lift","weight",",","a","cop",",","a","mechanic",",","writer",",","a","artist",";","one","be","gay",",","at","least","three","be","in","serious","relationship","with","woman",";","one","be","in","the","seminary",";","one","have","three","child","from","a","previous","marriage",".","all","six","be","bear","female",",","and","all","be","female-to-male","-lrb-","``","FTM","''","-rrb-","transsexual",".","they","talk","about","childhood",",","decide","to","make","the","change",",","tell","parent","and","friend","and","co-worker",",","testosterone","therapy",",","surgery",",","organ",",","embrace","they","history",",","and","how","they","life","be","now",".","friend",",","a","parent",",","lover",",","and","two","child","also","talk",".","all","six","man","express","joy","at","they","new-found","and","more","complete","identity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lyle , Max",", Max ,","Max , Michael",", Michael ,","Michael , Steven",", Steven ,","Steven , Ted",", Ted ,","Ted , and",", and James","and James :","James : a",": a photographer","a photographer who","photographer who lifts","who lifts weights","lifts weights ,","weights , a",", a cop","a cop ,","cop , a",", a mechanic","a mechanic ,","mechanic , writers",", writers ,","writers , an",", an artist","an artist ;","artist ;

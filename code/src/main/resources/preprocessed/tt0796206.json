{"title":"The Black Pimpernel","plot":"The story about Swedish ambassador in Chile - Harald Edelstam - and his heroic actions to protect the innocent people from the execution during and after the military coup on September 11th 1973. We travel with Edelstam during the terrible moments just after the coup and follows his never-ending fight for human rights, law and order. What drove him? And what price did he end up paying for his total commitment? Haunted by his own demons the we experiences on close hand how a womanizer desperately searches to find love again, a task only doable, if he can fight his own past and redeem himself. After saving hundreds - maybe even thousands - he is challenged once more, this time to save his newfound love from the death penalty issued by the regime. Another impossible task and a desperate chase against time. Based on a true story about a man, that did, what all of us only dreams of.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," History"],"stems":["The","stori","about","Swedish","ambassador","in","Chile","-","Harald","Edelstam","-","and","his","heroic","action","to","protect","the","innoc","peopl","from","the","execut","dure","and","after","the","militari","coup","on","Septemb","11th","1973",".","We","travel","with","Edelstam","dure","the","terribl","moment","just","after","the","coup","and","follow","his","never-end","fight","for","human","right",",","law","and","order",".","What","drove","him","?","And","what","price","did","he","end","up","pay","for","his","total","commit","?","Haunt","by","his","own","demon","the","we","experi","on","close","hand","how","a","woman","desper","search","to","find","love","again",",","a","task","onli","doabl",",","if","he","can","fight","his","own","past","and","redeem","himself",".","After","save","hundr","-","mayb","even","thousand","-","he","is","challeng","onc","more",",","this","time","to","save","his","newfound","love","from","the","death","penalti","issu","by","the","regim",".","Another","imposs","task","and","a","desper","chase","against","time",".","Base","on","a","true","stori","about","a","man",",","that","did",",","what","all","of","us","onli","dream","of","."],"lemmas":["the","story","about","swedish","ambassador","in","Chile","-","Harald","Edelstam","-","and","he","heroic","action","to","protect","the","innocent","people","from","the","execution","during","and","after","the","military","coup","on","September","11th","1973",".","we","travel","with","edelstam","during","the","terrible","moment","just","after","the","coup","and","follow","he","never-ending","fight","for","human","rights",",","law","and","order",".","what","drive","he","?","and","what","price","do","he","end","up","pay","for","he","total","commitment","?","haunt","by","he","own","demon","the","we","experience","on","close","hand","how","a","womanizer","desperately","search","to","find","love","again",",","a","task","only","doable",",","if","he","can","fight","he","own","past","and","redeem","himself",".","after","save","hundred","-","maybe","even","thousand","-","he","be","challenge","once","more",",","this","time","to","save","he","newfound","love","from","the","death","penalty","issue","by","the","regime",".","another","impossible","task","and","a","desperate","chase","against","time",".","base","on","a","true","story","about","a","man",",","that","do",",","what","all","of","we","only","dream","of","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The story about","story about Swedish","about Swedish ambassador","Swedish ambassador in","ambassador in Chile","in Chile -","Chile -

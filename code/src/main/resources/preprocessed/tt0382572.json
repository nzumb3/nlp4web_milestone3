{"title":"The Wedding Party","plot":"In rural Westphalia, Franz Berger struggles to keep his inn open. On this day, a bluff, overbearing bully, Hermann Walzer, has booked the dining room for a wedding banquet for his son Mark. There's bad blood between Berger and Walzer, so when the first course, shrimp cocktail, is off, Hermann storms out with the wedding party vowing not to pay. Franz locks the loo door, taking prisoners of the bride and Hermann's wife while he also locks the estate's outer gates, leaving Hermann and the rest outside. Walzer, a pheasant hunter, lays siege; shotguns, rifles, grenades, a shovel, and other weapons leave no one safe. Will it take death to bring these men to their senses?","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["In","rural","Westphalia",",","Franz","Berger","struggl","to","keep","his","inn","open",".","On","this","day",",","a","bluff",",","overbear","bulli",",","Hermann","Walzer",",","has","book","the","dine","room","for","a","wed","banquet","for","his","son","Mark",".","There","'s","bad","blood","between","Berger","and","Walzer",",","so","when","the","first","cours",",","shrimp","cocktail",",","is","off",",","Hermann","storm","out","with","the","wed","parti","vow","not","to","pay",".","Franz","lock","the","loo","door",",","take","prison","of","the","bride","and","Hermann","'s","wife","while","he","also","lock","the","estat","'s","outer","gate",",","leav","Hermann","and","the","rest","outsid",".","Walzer",",","a","pheasant","hunter",",","lay","sieg",";","shotgun",",","rifl",",","grenad",",","a","shovel",",","and","other","weapon","leav","no","one","safe",".","Will","it","take","death","to","bring","these","men","to","their","sens","?"],"lemmas":["in","rural","Westphalia",",","Franz","Berger","struggle","to","keep","he","inn","open",".","on","this","day",",","a","bluff",",","overbearing","bully",",","Hermann","Walzer",",","have","book","the","dining","room","for","a","wedding","banquet","for","he","son","Mark",".","there","'s","bad","blood","between","Berger","and","Walzer",",","so","when","the","first","course",",","shrimp","cocktail",",","be","off",",","Hermann","storm","out","with","the","wedding","party","vow","not","to","pay",".","Franz","lock","the","loo","door",",","take","prisoner","of","the","bride","and","Hermann","'s","wife","while","he","also","lock","the","estate","'s","outer","gate",",","leave","Hermann","and","the","rest","outside",".","Walzer",",","a","pheasant","hunter",",","lay","siege",";","shotgun",",","rifle",",","grenade",",","a","shovel",",","and","other","weapon","leave","no","one","safe",".","will","it","take","death","to","bring","these","man","to","they","sens","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In rural Westphalia","rural Westphalia ,","Westphalia , Franz",", Franz Berger","Franz Berger struggles","Berger struggles to","struggles to keep","to keep his","keep his inn","his inn open","On this day","this day ,","day , a",", a bluff","a bluff ,","bluff , overbearing",", overbearing bully","overbearing bully ,","bully , Hermann",", Hermann Walzer","Hermann Walzer ,","Walzer , has",", has booked","has booked the","booked the dining","the dining room","dining room for","room for a","for a wedding","a wedding banquet","wedding banquet for","banquet for his","for his son","his son Mark","There 's bad","'s bad blood","bad blood between","blood between Berger","between Berger and","Berger and Walzer","and Walzer ,","Walzer , so",", so when","so when the","when the first","the first course","first course ,","course , shrimp",", shrimp cocktail","shrimp cocktail ,","cocktail , is",", is off","is off ,","off , Hermann",", Hermann storms","Hermann storms out","storms out with","out with the","with the wedding","the wedding party","wedding party vowing","party vowing not","vowing not to","not to pay","Franz locks the","locks the loo","the loo door","loo door ,","door , taking",", taking prisoners","taking prisoners of","prisoners of the","of the bride","the bride and","bride and Hermann","and Hermann 's","Hermann 's wife","'s wife while","wife while he","while he also","he also locks","also locks the","locks the estate","the estate 's","estate 's outer","'s outer gates","outer gates ,","gates , leaving",", leaving Hermann","leaving Hermann and","Hermann and the","and the rest","the rest outside","Walzer , a",", a pheasant","a pheasant hunter","pheasant hunter ,","hunter , lays",", lays siege","lays siege ;","siege ;

{"title":"Basic Human Needs","plot":"Miles and Audrey are two post-adolescents whose wit and charm can't make up for a debilitating lack of ambition. Although they claim to have the wanderlust of moving from Saskatchewan to the big city, they do nothing proactive to get there. Instead, they remain in their aimless routine, merely fantasizing of an ideal grown up life; that is, until adulthood is abruptly thrust upon them in the form of a missing condom, a pregnancy test, and a few invaluable life lessons they're likely to forget.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Mile","and","Audrey","are","two","post-adolesc","whose","wit","and","charm","ca","n't","make","up","for","a","debilit","lack","of","ambit",".","Although","they","claim","to","have","the","wanderlust","of","move","from","Saskatchewan","to","the","big","citi",",","they","do","noth","proactiv","to","get","there",".","Instead",",","they","remain","in","their","aimless","routin",",","mere","fantas","of","an","ideal","grown","up","life",";","that","is",",","until","adulthood","is","abrupt","thrust","upon","them","in","the","form","of","a","miss","condom",",","a","pregnanc","test",",","and","a","few","invalu","life","lesson","they","re","like","to","forget","."],"lemmas":["Miles","and","Audrey","be","two","post-adolescent","whose","wit","and","charm","can","not","make","up","for","a","debilitating","lack","of","ambition",".","although","they","claim","to","have","the","wanderlust","of","move","from","Saskatchewan","to","the","big","city",",","they","do","nothing","proactive","to","get","there",".","instead",",","they","remain","in","they","aimless","routine",",","merely","fantasize","of","a","ideal","grow","up","life",";","that","be",",","until","adulthood","be","abruptly","thrust","upon","they","in","the","form","of","a","miss","condom",",","a","pregnancy","test",",","and","a","few","invaluable","life","lesson","they","be","likely","to","forget","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Miles and Audrey","and Audrey are","Audrey are two","are two post-adolescents","two post-adolescents whose","post-adolescents whose wit","whose wit and","wit and charm","and charm ca","charm ca n't","ca n't make","n't make up","make up for","up for a","for a debilitating","a debilitating lack","debilitating lack of","lack of ambition","Although they claim","they claim to","claim to have","to have the","have the wanderlust","the wanderlust of","wanderlust of moving","of moving from","moving from Saskatchewan","from Saskatchewan to","Saskatchewan to the","to the big","the big city","big city ,","city , they",", they do","they do nothing","do nothing proactive","nothing proactive to","proactive to get","to get there","Instead , they",", they remain","they remain in","remain in their","in their aimless","their aimless routine","aimless routine ,","routine , merely",", merely fantasizing","merely fantasizing of","fantasizing of an","of an ideal","an ideal grown","ideal grown up","grown up life","up life ;","life ; that","; that is","that is ,","is , until",", until adulthood","until adulthood is","adulthood is abruptly","is abruptly thrust","abruptly thrust upon","thrust upon them","upon them in","them in the","in the form","the form of","form of a","of a missing","a missing condom","missing condom ,","condom , a",", a pregnancy","a pregnancy test","pregnancy test ,","test , and",", and a","and a few","a few invaluable","few invaluable life","invaluable life lessons","life lessons they","lessons they 're","they 're likely","'re likely to","likely to forget"],"2grams":["Miles and","and Audrey","Audrey are","are two","two post-adolescents","post-adolescents whose","whose wit","wit and","and charm","charm ca","ca n't","n't make","make up","up for","for a","a debilitating","debilitating lack","lack of","of ambition","Although they","they claim","claim to","to have","have the","the wanderlust","wanderlust of","of moving","moving from","from Saskatchewan","Saskatchewan to","to the","the big","big city","city ,",", they","they do","do nothing","nothing proactive","proactive to","to get","get there","Instead ,",", they","they remain","remain in","in their","their aimless","aimless routine","routine ,",", merely","merely fantasizing","fantasizing of","of an","an ideal","ideal grown","grown up","up life","life ;","; that","that is","is ,",", until","until adulthood","adulthood is","is abruptly","abruptly thrust","thrust upon","upon them","them in","in the","the form","form of","of a","a missing","missing condom","condom ,",", a","a pregnancy","pregnancy test","test ,",", and","and a","a few","few invaluable","invaluable life","life lessons","lessons they","they 're","'re likely","likely to","to forget"]}

{"title":"Un passo indietro","plot":"Paolo is an unlicensed taxi driver with financial problems due to debts and lives with his mother. Saverio is a young man with a criminal record who wants to leave behind his previous lifestyle in the hope of winning back Maria's trust. Stefano is a small time businessman involved in illegal dealings. The three characters meet in the course of a suspicious assignment, which turns out to be a trap. When they return, everything has changed. Stefano's wife has disappeared. Paolo decides to take justice into his own hands. Maria has also left without a trace other than a crumpled slip of paper that a friend has fished out of the trash. When Paolo reads the paper to Saverio, it is already too late.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Paolo","is","an","unlicens","taxi","driver","with","financi","problem","due","to","debt","and","live","with","his","mother",".","Saverio","is","a","young","man","with","a","crimin","record","who","want","to","leav","behind","his","previous","lifestyl","in","the","hope","of","win","back","Maria","'s","trust",".","Stefano","is","a","small","time","businessman","involv","in","illeg","deal",".","The","three","charact","meet","in","the","cours","of","a","suspici","assign",",","which","turn","out","to","be","a","trap",".","When","they","return",",","everyth","has","chang",".","Stefano","'s","wife","has","disappear",".","Paolo","decid","to","take","justic","into","his","own","hand",".","Maria","has","also","left","without","a","trace","other","than","a","crumpl","slip","of","paper","that","a","friend","has","fish","out","of","the","trash",".","When","Paolo","read","the","paper","to","Saverio",",","it","is","alreadi","too","late","."],"lemmas":["Paolo","be","a","unlicensed","taxi","driver","with","financial","problem","due","to","debt","and","life","with","he","mother",".","Saverio","be","a","young","man","with","a","criminal","record","who","want","to","leave","behind","he","previous","lifestyle","in","the","hope","of","win","back","Maria","'s","trust",".","Stefano","be","a","small","time","businessman","involve","in","illegal","dealings",".","the","three","character","meet","in","the","course","of","a","suspicious","assignment",",","which","turn","out","to","be","a","trap",".","when","they","return",",","everything","have","change",".","Stefano","'s","wife","have","disappear",".","Paolo","decide","to","take","justice","into","he","own","hand",".","Maria","have","also","leave","without","a","trace","other","than","a","crumpled","slip","of","paper","that","a","friend","have","fish","out","of","the","trash",".","when","Paolo","read","the","paper","to","Saverio",",","it","be","already","too","late","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Paolo

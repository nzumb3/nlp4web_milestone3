{"title":"Johnson Family Vacation","plot":"AAA can't help the roadside emergency that is the JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION. Even the on-board navigation system has a meltdown on Nate Johnson and his family's cross-country trek to their annual family reunion/grudge match. Reluctantly along for the ride are Nate's wife, who's only in it for the kids; their rapper-wannabe son; their teenage daughter who's fashioned herself as the next Lolita; and their youngest, whose imaginary dog Nate just can't seem to keep track of. Can the Johnsons survive each other and all the obstacles the road throws at them to make it to Caruthersville, Missouri? Can they find Missouri?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["AAA","ca","n't","help","the","roadsid","emerg","that","is","the","JOHNSON","FAMILi","VACATION",".","Even","the","on-board","navig","system","has","a","meltdown","on","Nate","Johnson","and","his","famili","'s","cross-countri","trek","to","their","annual","famili","reunion/grudg","match",".","Reluct","along","for","the","ride","are","Nate","'s","wife",",","who","'s","onli","in","it","for","the","kid",";","their","rapper-wannab","son",";","their","teenag","daughter","who","'s","fashion","herself","as","the","next","Lolita",";","and","their","youngest",",","whose","imaginari","dog","Nate","just","ca","n't","seem","to","keep","track","of",".","Can","the","Johnson","surviv","each","other","and","all","the","obstacl","the","road","throw","at","them","to","make","it","to","Caruthersvill",",","Missouri","?","Can","they","find","Missouri","?"],"lemmas":["AAA","can","not","help","the","roadside","emergency","that","be","the","JOHNSON","family","vacation",".","even","the","on-board","navigation","system","have","a","meltdown","on","Nate","Johnson","and","he","family","'s","cross-country","trek","to","they","annual","family","reunion/grudge","match",".","reluctantly","along","for","the","ride","be","Nate","'s","wife",",","who","be","only","in","it","for","the","kid",";","they","rapper-wannabe","son",";","they","teenage","daughter","who","be","fashion","herself","as","the","next","Lolita",";","and","they","youngest",",","whose","imaginary","dog","Nate","just","can","not","seem","to","keep","track","of",".","can","the","Johnsons","survive","each","other","and","all","the","obstacle","the","road","throw","at","they","to","make","it","to","Caruthersville",",","Missouri","?","can","they","find","Missouri","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["AAA ca n't","ca n't help","n't help the","help the roadside","the roadside emergency","roadside emergency that","emergency that is","that is the","is the JOHNSON","the JOHNSON FAMILY","JOHNSON FAMILY VACATION","Even the on-board","the on-board navigation","on-board navigation system","navigation system has","system has a","has a meltdown","a meltdown on","meltdown on Nate","on Nate Johnson","Nate Johnson and","Johnson and his","and his family","his family 's","family 's cross-country","'s cross-country trek","cross-country trek to","trek to their","to their annual","their annual family","annual family reunion/grudge","family reunion/grudge match","Reluctantly along for","along for the","for the ride","the ride are","ride are Nate","are Nate 's","Nate 's wife","'s wife ,","wife , who",", who 's","who 's only","'s only in","only in it","in it for","it for the","for the kids","the kids ;","kids ;

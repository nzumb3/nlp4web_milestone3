{"title":"Empire of the Apes","plot":"In a distant galaxy three escaped female convicts crash land on a primitive world inhabited by a race of warlike apes. They fight for survival as the humanoid apes fight for their possession, body and soul. A daring escape is their only way out. Hot on their heels are the blood lusting gorillas and a prison warden bent on their return to the prison ship they escaped from. Treachery, alliances and battle await the fighting factions. Who will survive on a planet where apes rule and humans are only breeding stock.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Adventure"],"stems":["In","a","distant","galaxi","three","escap","femal","convict","crash","land","on","a","primit","world","inhabit","by","a","race","of","warlik","ape",".","They","fight","for","surviv","as","the","humanoid","ape","fight","for","their","possess",",","bodi","and","soul",".","A","dare","escap","is","their","onli","way","out",".","Hot","on","their","heel","are","the","blood","lust","gorilla","and","a","prison","warden","bent","on","their","return","to","the","prison","ship","they","escap","from",".","Treacheri",",","allianc","and","battl","await","the","fight","faction",".","Who","will","surviv","on","a","planet","where","ape","rule","and","human","are","onli","breed","stock","."],"lemmas":["in","a","distant","galaxy","three","escape","female","convict","crash","land","on","a","primitive","world","inhabit","by","a","race","of","warlike","ape",".","they","fight","for","survival","as","the","humanoid","ape","fight","for","they","possession",",","body","and","soul",".","a","daring","escape","be","they","only","way","out",".","hot","on","they","heel","be","the","blood","lust","gorilla","and","a","prison","warden","bent","on","they","return","to","the","prison","ship","they","escape","from",".","treachery",",","alliance","and","battle","await","the","fighting","faction",".","who","will","survive","on","a","planet","where","ape","rule","and","human","be","only","breed","stock","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["In a distant","a distant galaxy","distant galaxy three","galaxy three escaped","three escaped female","escaped female convicts","female convicts crash","convicts crash land","crash land on","land on a","on a primitive","a primitive world","primitive world inhabited","world inhabited by","inhabited by a","by a race","a race of","race of warlike","of warlike apes","They fight for","fight for survival","for survival as","survival as the","as the humanoid","the humanoid apes","humanoid apes fight","apes fight for","fight for their","for their possession","their possession ,","possession , body",", body and","body and soul","A daring escape","daring escape is","escape is their","is their only","their only way","only way out","Hot on their","on their heels","their heels are","heels are the","are the blood","the blood lusting","blood lusting gorillas","lusting gorillas and","gorillas and a","and a prison","a prison warden","prison warden bent","warden bent on","bent on their","on their return","their return to","return to the","to the prison","the prison ship","prison ship they","ship they escaped","they escaped from","Treachery , alliances",", alliances and","alliances and battle","and battle await","battle await the","await the fighting","the fighting factions","Who will survive","will survive on","survive on a","on a planet","a planet where","planet where apes","where apes rule","apes rule and","rule and humans","and humans are","humans are only","are only breeding","only breeding stock"],"2grams":["In a","a distant","distant galaxy","galaxy three","three escaped","escaped female","female convicts","convicts crash","crash land","land on","on a","a primitive","primitive world","world inhabited","inhabited by","by a","a race","race of","of warlike","warlike apes","They fight","fight for","for survival","survival as","as the","the humanoid","humanoid apes","apes fight","fight for","for their","their possession","possession ,",", body","body and","and soul","A daring","daring escape","escape is","is their","their only","only way","way out","Hot on","on their","their heels","heels are","are the","the blood","blood lusting","lusting gorillas","gorillas and","and a","a prison","prison warden","warden bent","bent on","on their","their return","return to","to the","the prison","prison ship","ship they","they escaped","escaped from","Treachery ,",", alliances","alliances and","and battle","battle await","await the","the fighting","fighting factions","Who will","will survive","survive on","on a","a planet","planet where","where apes","apes rule","rule and","and humans","humans are","are only","only breeding","breeding stock"]}

{"title":"Longing","plot":"The film generally deals with a fundamental feature in the Bahraini society, the (coexistence). For ages Bahrain has been known as a distinctive model for coexistence where its people live peaceful coexistence, despite their ethnic and creed differences. The film focuses on the emergence of the term sectarianism among Bahrainis from different creeds. Many sources point out that sectarianism had never been known to the people of Bahrain, it is a loanword never known in our society before. The film emphasizes the importance of dismissing sectarianism through recalling a number of incidents which have shaken the world and their impact on Bahrain such as the Iraq Iran war, and the war waged by the former Soviet Union on Afghanistan, as well as those wars effect on everything. The story of the film began with coexistence of two Suni and Shiite families, where these two families represent an life sample of the feature of a Bahraini family in the 1980s; the two families grow and the children grow in them until sectarian quarrel begins among the new generations.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","film","general","deal","with","a","fundament","featur","in","the","Bahraini","societi",",","the","(","coexist",")",".","For","age","Bahrain","has","been","known","as","a","distinct","model","for","coexist","where","it","peopl","live","peac","coexist",",","despit","their","ethnic","and","creed","differ",".","The","film","focus","on","the","emerg","of","the","term","sectarian","among","Bahraini","from","differ","creed",".","Mani","sourc","point","out","that","sectarian","had","never","been","known","to","the","peopl","of","Bahrain",",","it","is","a","loanword","never","known","in","our","societi","befor",".","The","film","emphas","the","import","of","dismiss","sectarian","through","recal","a","number","of","incid","which","have","shaken","the","world","and","their","impact","on","Bahrain","such","as","the","Iraq","Iran","war",",","and","the","war","wage","by","the","former","Soviet","Union","on","Afghanistan",",","as","well","as","those","war","effect","on","everyth",".","The","stori","of","the","film","began","with","coexist","of","two","Suni","and","Shiit","famili",",","where","these","two","famili","repres","an","life","sampl","of","the","featur","of","a","Bahraini","famili","in","the","1980s",";","the","two","famili","grow","and","the","children","grow","in","them","until","sectarian","quarrel","begin","among","the","new","generat","."],"lemmas":["the","film","generally","deal","with","a","fundamental","feature","in","the","Bahraini","society",",","the","-lrb-","coexistence","-rrb-",".","for","age","Bahrain","have","be","know","as","a","distinctive","model","for","coexistence","where","its","people","live","peaceful","coexistence",",","despite","they","ethnic","and","creed","difference",".","the","film","focus","on","the","emergence","of","the","term","sectarianism","among","Bahrainis","from","different","creed",".","many","source","point","out","that","sectarianism","have","never","be","know","to","the","people","of","Bahrain",",","it","be","a","loanword","never","know","in","we","society","before",".","the","film","emphasize","the","importance","of","dismiss","sectarianism","through","recall","a","number","of","incident","which","have","shake","the","world","and","they","impact","on","Bahrain","such","as","the","Iraq","Iran","war",",","and","the","war","wage","by","the","former","Soviet","Union","on","Afghanistan",",","as","well","as","those","war","effect","on","everything",".","the","story","of","the","film","begin","with","coexistence","of","two","Suni","and","Shiite","family",",","where","these","two","family","represent","a","life","sample","of","the","feature","of","a","Bahraini","family","in","the","1980s",";","the","two","family","grow","and","the","child","grow","in","they","until","sectarian","quarrel","begin","among","the","new","generation","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

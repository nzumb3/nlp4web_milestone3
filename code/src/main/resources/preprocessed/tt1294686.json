{"title":"Love 3000","plot":"Sam is a 23 year Old economy student, who one day decides to leave school and move back to his hometown in the north of Sweden. His best friends, Alex and Krister, tries to stop him, but Sam is unstoppable, since he is on a mission to find the meaning of life - which is something he and his friends contemplates a lot. After buying a ticket home Sam meets a man in his 70's that affects him in a way that makes him want to live life to the fullest. He runs in to a girl, Hanna, on a bus, but on the contrary of what he would usually do in a situation like that, he says hello. She of course thinks he's nuts, but he manages to convince her to have a cup of coffee with him. They end up having a fabulous time. So the next day Sam and his friends look her up, go to her home and without meeting her find out she is deceased. As he, still without her knowing it, meets with her parents, he finds out she is dying. Sam decides not to give up and goes to visit her and manages to create a dream world where their possible, yet impossible, future is pictured.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["Sam","is","a","23","year","Old","economi","student",",","who","one","day","decid","to","leav","school","and","move","back","to","his","hometown","in","the","north","of","Sweden",".","His","best","friend",",","Alex","and","Krister",",","tri","to","stop","him",",","but","Sam","is","unstopp",",","sinc","he","is","on","a","mission","to","find","the","mean","of","life","-","which","is","someth","he","and","his","friend","contempl","a","lot",".","After","buy","a","ticket","home","Sam","meet","a","man","in","his","70","'s","that","affect","him","in","a","way","that","make","him","want","to","live","life","to","the","fullest",".","He","run","in","to","a","girl",",","Hanna",",","on","a","bus",",","but","on","the","contrari","of","what","he","would","usual","do","in","a","situat","like","that",",","he","say","hello",".","She","of","cours","think","he","'s","nut",",","but","he","manag","to","convinc","her","to","have","a","cup","of","coffe","with","him",".","They","end","up","have","a","fabul","time",".","So","the","next","day","Sam","and","his","friend","look","her","up",",","go","to","her","home","and","without","meet","her","find","out","she","is","deceas",".","As","he",",","still","without","her","know","it",",","meet","with","her","parent",",","he","find","out","she","is","die",".","Sam","decid","not","to","give","up","and","goe","to","visit","her","and","manag","to","creat","a","dream","world","where","their","possibl",",","yet","imposs",",","futur","is","pictur","."],"lemmas":["Sam","be","a","23","year","old","economy","student",",","who","one","day","decide","to","leave","school","and","move","back","to","he","hometown","in","the","north","of","Sweden",".","he","best","friend",",","Alex","and","Krister",",","try","to","stop","he",",","but","Sam","be","unstoppable",",","since","he","be","on","a","mission","to","find","the","meaning","of","life","-","which","be","something","he","and","he","friend","contemplate","a","lot",".","after","buy","a","ticket","home","Sam","meet","a","man","in","he","70","'s","that","affect","he","in","a","way","that","make","he","want","to","live","life","to","the","fullest",".","he","run","in","to","a","girl",",","Hanna",",","on","a","bus",",","but","on","the","contrary","of","what","he","would","usually","do","in","a","situation","like","that",",","he","say","hello",".","she","of","course","think","he","be","nut",",","but","he","manage","to","convince","she","to","have","a","cup","of","coffee","with","he",".","they","end","up","have","a","fabulous","time",".","so","the","next","day","Sam","and","he","friend","look","she","up",",","go","to","she","home","and","without","meet","she","find","out","she","be","decease",".","as","he",",","still","without","she","know","it",",","meet","with","she","parent",",","he","find","out","she","be","die",".","Sam","decide","not","to","give","up","and","go","to","visit","she","and","manage","to","create","a","dream","world","where","they","possible",",","yet","impossible",",","future","be","picture","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sam is a","is a 23","a 23 year","23 year Old","year Old economy","Old economy student","economy student ,","student , who",", who one","who one day","one day decides","day decides to","decides to leave","to leave school","leave school and","school and move","and move back","move back to","back to his","to his hometown","his hometown in","hometown in the","in the north","the north of","north of Sweden","His best friends","best friends ,","friends , Alex",", Alex and","Alex and Krister","and Krister ,","Krister , tries",", tries to","tries to stop","to stop him","stop him ,","him , but",", but Sam","but Sam is","Sam is unstoppable","is unstoppable ,","unstoppable , since",", since he","since he is","he is on","is on a","on a mission","a mission to","mission to find","to find the","find the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of life","of life -","life -

{"title":"Herr Schultz sets Sail","plot":"House or boat? With this question Kurt Schultz confronts his family of six in 1957. After their lucky escape from the GDR they live in a flat of 590 sq ft in a temporary home among allotment gardens at Billerhuder Insel, Hamburg. Kurt Schultz is having it his way. Despite the cramped conditions they decide on building a boat - they go for making a dream come true rather than playing it safe. The 33 foot steel yacht materialises over years of hard and improvised work right next to the family's temporary home. But not everybody is happy about it.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Hous","or","boat","?","With","this","question","Kurt","Schultz","confront","his","famili","of","six","in","1957",".","After","their","lucki","escap","from","the","GDR","they","live","in","a","flat","of","590","sq","ft","in","a","temporari","home","among","allot","garden","at","Billerhud","Insel",",","Hamburg",".","Kurt","Schultz","is","have","it","his","way",".","Despit","the","cramp","condit","they","decid","on","build","a","boat","-","they","go","for","make","a","dream","come","true","rather","than","play","it","safe",".","The","33","foot","steel","yacht","materialis","over","year","of","hard","and","improvis","work","right","next","to","the","famili","'s","temporari","home",".","But","not","everybodi","is","happi","about","it","."],"lemmas":["house","or","boat","?","with","this","question","Kurt","Schultz","confront","he","family","of","six","in","1957",".","after","they","lucky","escape","from","the","GDR","they","live","in","a","flat","of","590","sq","ft","in","a","temporary","home","among","allotment","garden","at","Billerhuder","Insel",",","Hamburg",".","Kurt","Schultz","be","have","it","he","way",".","despite","the","cramped","condition","they","decide","on","build","a","boat","-","they","go","for","make","a","dream","come","true","rather","than","play","it","safe",".","the","33","foot","steel","yacht","materialise","over","year","of","hard","and","improvise","work","right","next","to","the","family","'s","temporary","home",".","but","not","everybody","be","happy","about","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["House or boat","With this question","this question Kurt","question Kurt Schultz","Kurt Schultz confronts","Schultz confronts his","confronts his family","his family of","family of six","of six in","six in 1957","After their lucky","their lucky escape","lucky escape from","escape from the","from the GDR","the GDR they","GDR they live","they live in","live in a","in a flat","a flat of","flat of 590","of 590 sq","590 sq ft","sq ft in","ft in a","in a temporary","a temporary home","temporary home among","home among allotment","among allotment gardens","allotment gardens at","gardens at Billerhuder","at Billerhuder Insel","Billerhuder Insel ,","Insel , Hamburg","Kurt Schultz is","Schultz is having","is having it","having it his","it his way","Despite the cramped","the cramped conditions","cramped conditions they","conditions they decide","they decide on","decide on building","on building a","building a boat","a boat -","boat - they","- they go","they go for","go for making","for making a","making a dream","a dream come","dream come true","come true rather","true rather than","rather than playing","than playing it","playing it safe","The 33 foot","33 foot steel","foot steel yacht","steel yacht materialises","yacht materialises over","materialises over years","over years of","years of hard","of hard and","hard and improvised","and improvised work","improvised work right","work right next","right next to","next to the","to the family","the family 's","family 's temporary","'s temporary home","But not everybody","not everybody is","everybody is happy","is happy about","happy about it"],"2grams":["House or","or boat","With this","this question","question Kurt","Kurt Schultz","Schultz confronts","confronts his","his family","family of","of six","six in","in 1957","After their","their lucky","lucky escape","escape from","from the","the GDR","GDR they","they live","live in","in a","a flat","flat of","of 590","590 sq","sq ft","ft in","in a","a temporary","temporary home","home among","among allotment","allotment gardens","gardens at","at Billerhuder","Billerhuder Insel","Insel ,",", Hamburg","Kurt Schultz","Schultz is","is having","having it","it his","his way","Despite the","the cramped","cramped conditions","conditions they","they decide","decide on","on building","building a","a boat","boat -","- they","they go","go for","for making","making a","a dream","dream come","come true","true rather","rather than","than playing","playing it","it safe","The 33","33 foot","foot steel","steel yacht","yacht materialises","materialises over","over years","years of","of hard","hard and","and improvised","improvised work","work right","right next","next to","to the","the family","family 's","'s temporary","temporary home","But not","not everybody","everybody is","is happy","happy about","about it"]}

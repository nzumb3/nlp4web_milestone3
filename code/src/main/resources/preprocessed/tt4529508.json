{"title":"Dream, Girl","plot":"After quitting her 9 to 5 to make a movie and launch her own company, Erin Bagwell discovers what it really takes to be a successful founder. The film focuses on five entrepreneurs Mariama Camara, Komal Minhas, Annie Wang, Joanne Wilson and Clara Villarosa. We hear their experiences as female entrepreneurs, from being underestimated by their male counterparts, to getting the courage to take the leap and quit their nine-to-fives, to finding funding and financing for their start-ups, and taking a break from their careers to focus on their families. Each woman has an authentic story unique to her individual experience, yet we learn our stories are interconnected in ways that uplift us all, in business and in life.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["After","quit","her","9","to","5","to","make","a","movi","and","launch","her","own","compani",",","Erin","Bagwel","discov","what","it","realli","take","to","be","a","success","founder",".","The","film","focus","on","five","entrepreneur","Mariama","Camara",",","Komal","Minha",",","Annie","Wang",",","Joann","Wilson","and","Clara","Villarosa",".","We","hear","their","experi","as","femal","entrepreneur",",","from","be","underestim","by","their","male","counterpart",",","to","get","the","courag","to","take","the","leap","and","quit","their","nine-to-f",",","to","find","fund","and","financ","for","their","start-up",",","and","take","a","break","from","their","career","to","focus","on","their","famili",".","Each","woman","has","an","authent","stori","uniqu","to","her","individu","experi",",","yet","we","learn","our","stori","are","interconnect","in","way","that","uplift","us","all",",","in","busi","and","in","life","."],"lemmas":["after","quit","she","9","to","5","to","make","a","movie","and","launch","she","own","company",",","Erin","Bagwell","discover","what","it","really","take","to","be","a","successful","founder",".","the","film","focus","on","five","entrepreneur","Mariama","Camara",",","Komal","Minhas",",","Annie","Wang",",","Joanne","Wilson","and","Clara","Villarosa",".","we","hear","they","experience","as","female","entrepreneur",",","from","be","underestimate","by","they","male","counterpart",",","to","get","the","courage","to","take","the","leap","and","quit","they","nine-to-fives",",","to","find","funding","and","financing","for","they","start-up",",","and","take","a","break","from","they","career","to","focus","on","they","family",".","each","woman","have","a","authentic","story","unique","to","she","individual","experience",",","yet","we","learn","we","story","be","interconnect","in","way","that","uplift","we","all",",","in","business","and","in","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After

{"title":"Thirteen Percent","plot":"Thirteen Percent takes a probing look at how and why 13 percent of the population (African-Americans) now accounts for 50 percent of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses. It tells the stories of individuals representing the hardest-hit segments - men who have sex with men, women aged 25-44 and youth - and shares the perspective of the experts on the driving factors behind the epidemic. Sharing their hard-won lessons are politicians, physicians, academicians, clergy, journalists and, of course, individuals living with the infection. In the spotlight is a continuing culture of stigma and silence - exacerbated by a new complacency as AIDS becomes a chronic disease instead of a death sentence. It concludes with thoughts about how to change the trajectory of this disease, starting with each individual.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Thirteen","Percent","take","a","probe","look","at","how","and","whi","13","percent","of","the","popul","(","African-American",")","now","account","for","50","percent","of","new","HIV/AIDS","diagnos",".","It","tell","the","stori","of","individu","repres","the","hardest-hit","segment","-","men","who","have","sex","with","men",",","women","age","25-44","and","youth","-","and","share","the","perspect","of","the","expert","on","the","drive","factor","behind","the","epidem",".","Share","their","hard-won","lesson","are","politician",",","physician",",","academician",",","clergi",",","journalist","and",",","of","cours",",","individu","live","with","the","infect",".","In","the","spotlight","is","a","continu","cultur","of","stigma","and","silenc","-","exacerb","by","a","new","complac","as","AIDS","becom","a","chronic","diseas","instead","of","a","death","sentenc",".","It","conclud","with","thought","about","how","to","chang","the","trajectori","of","this","diseas",",","start","with","each","individu","."],"lemmas":["thirteen","percent","take","a","probe","look","at","how","and","why","13","percent","of","the","population","-lrb-","African-Americans","-rrb-","now","account","for","50","percent","of","new","hiv/aids","diagnosis",".","it","tell","the","story","of","individual","represent","the","hardest-hit","segment","-","man","who","have","sex","with","man",",","woman","aged","25-44","and","youth","-","and","share","the","perspective","of","the","expert","on","the","driving","factor","behind","the","epidemic",".","share","they","hard-won","lesson","be","politician",",","physician",",","academician",",","clergy",",","journalist","and",",","of","course",",","individual","live","with","the","infection",".","in","the","spotlight","be","a","continue","culture","of","stigma","and","silence","-","exacerbate","by","a","new","complacency","as","AIDS","become","a","chronic","disease","instead","of","a","death","sentence",".","it","conclude","with","thought","about","how","to","change","the","trajectory","of","this","disease",",","start","with","each","individual","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Thirteen Percent takes","Percent takes a","takes a probing","a probing look","probing look at","look at how","at how and","how and why","and why 13","why 13 percent","13 percent of","percent of the","of the population","the population (","population ( African-Americans","( African-Americans )","African-Americans ) now",") now accounts","now accounts for","accounts for 50","for 50 percent","50 percent of","percent of new","of new HIV/AIDS","new HIV/AIDS diagnoses","It tells the","tells the stories","the stories of","stories of individuals","of individuals representing","individuals representing the","representing the hardest-hit","the hardest-hit segments","hardest-hit segments -","segments -

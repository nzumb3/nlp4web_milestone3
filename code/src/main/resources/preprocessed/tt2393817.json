{"title":"Hard Shoulder","plot":"Carl Foster takes off on a well-deserved weekend break with his family knowing only too well that focus on work has impacted his relationship with his wife, young son, and teenage step-daughter. But after a short but restful break in the journey Carl awakens to find himself tied and bound in an old roadside diner, his family trussed and gagged next to him, and a disparate group of dirty, dishevelled, vagrant-like undesirables keeping them captive. Only time will reveal who they are and what they want, but things are not everything they might seem.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Carl","Foster","take","off","on","a","well-deserv","weekend","break","with","his","famili","know","onli","too","well","that","focus","on","work","has","impact","his","relationship","with","his","wife",",","young","son",",","and","teenag","step-daught",".","But","after","a","short","but","rest","break","in","the","journey","Carl","awaken","to","find","himself","tie","and","bound","in","an","old","roadsid","diner",",","his","famili","truss","and","gag","next","to","him",",","and","a","dispar","group","of","dirti",",","dishevel",",","vagrant-lik","undesir","keep","them","captiv",".","Onli","time","will","reveal","who","they","are","and","what","they","want",",","but","thing","are","not","everyth","they","might","seem","."],"lemmas":["Carl","Foster","take","off","on","a","well-deserved","weekend","break","with","he","family","know","only","too","well","that","focus","on","work","have","impact","he","relationship","with","he","wife",",","young","son",",","and","teenage","step-daughter",".","but","after","a","short","but","restful","break","in","the","journey","Carl","awaken","to","find","himself","tie","and","bind","in","a","old","roadside","diner",",","he","family","truss","and","gag","next","to","he",",","and","a","disparate","group","of","dirty",",","dishevelled",",","vagrant-like","undesirable","keep","they","captive",".","only","time","will","reveal","who","they","be","and","what","they","want",",","but","thing","be","not","everything","they","might","seem","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Carl Foster takes","Foster takes off","takes off on","off on a","on a well-deserved","a well-deserved weekend","well-deserved weekend break","weekend break with","break with his","with his family","his family knowing","family knowing only","knowing only too","only too well","too well that","well that focus","that focus on","focus on work","on work has","work has impacted","has impacted his","impacted his relationship","his relationship with","relationship with his","with his wife","his wife ,","wife , young",", young son","young son ,","son , and",", and teenage","and teenage step-daughter","But after a","after a short","a short but","short but restful","but restful break","restful break in","break in the","in the journey","the journey Carl","journey Carl awakens","Carl awakens to","awakens to find","to find himself","find himself tied","himself tied and","tied and bound","and bound in","bound in an","in an old","an old roadside","old roadside diner","roadside diner ,","diner , his",", his family","his family trussed","family trussed and","trussed and gagged","and gagged next","gagged next to","next to him","to him ,","him , and",", and a","and a disparate","a disparate group","disparate group of","group of dirty","of dirty ,","dirty , dishevelled",", dishevelled ,","dishevelled , vagrant-like",", vagrant-like undesirables","vagrant-like undesirables keeping","undesirables keeping them","keeping them captive","Only time will","time will reveal","will reveal who","reveal who they","who they are","they are and","are and what","and what they","what they want","they want ,","want , but",", but things","but things are","things are not","are not everything","not everything they","everything they might","they might seem"],"2grams":["Carl Foster","Foster takes","takes off","off on","on a","a well-deserved","well-deserved weekend","weekend break","break with","with his","his family","family knowing","knowing only","only too","too well","well that","that focus","focus on","on work","work has","has impacted","impacted his","his relationship","relationship with","with his","his wife","wife ,",", young","young son","son ,",", and","and teenage","teenage step-daughter","But after","after a","a short","short but","but restful","restful break","break in","in the","the journey","journey Carl","Carl awakens","awakens to","to find","find himself","himself tied","tied and","and bound","bound in","in an","an old","old roadside","roadside diner","diner ,",", his","his family","family trussed","trussed and","and gagged","gagged next","next to","to him","him ,",", and","and a","a disparate","disparate group","group of","of dirty","dirty ,",", dishevelled","dishevelled ,",", vagrant-like","vagrant-like undesirables","undesirables keeping","keeping them","them captive","Only time","time will","will reveal","reveal who","who they","they are","are and","and what","what they","they want","want ,",", but","but things","things are","are not","not everything","everything they","they might","might seem"]}

{"title":"GalileoMobile: In the Land of Beauty","plot":"GalileoMobile is a purely non-profit initiative run by astronomers, educators, and science communicators. It is a traveling science education program that brings astronomy closer to young people around the world, and mainly across regions that have little or no access to outreach actions. By organizing astronomy-related activities in schools and villages, they aim at fostering a will of learning through the exciting wonders of our Universe. On September 2013, GalileoMobile went in Uganda. An international team, formed of four GalileoMobile members (from Italy, Portugal, Switzerland, Brazil), two film producers (from Italy), a local collaborator and a driver (from Uganda), shared a van that departed every day from Kampala to visit schools. 'GalileoMobile in the Land of Beauty' is the story of that amazing adventure.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["GalileoMobil","is","a","pure","non-profit","initi","run","by","astronom",",","educ",",","and","scienc","communic",".","It","is","a","travel","scienc","educ","program","that","bring","astronomi","closer","to","young","peopl","around","the","world",",","and","main","across","region","that","have","littl","or","no","access","to","outreach","action",".","By","organ","astronomy-rel","activ","in","school","and","villag",",","they","aim","at","foster","a","will","of","learn","through","the","excit","wonder","of","our","Univers",".","On","Septemb","2013",",","GalileoMobil","went","in","Uganda",".","An","intern","team",",","form","of","four","GalileoMobil","member","(","from","Itali",",","Portug",",","Switzerland",",","Brazil",")",",","two","film","produc","(","from","Itali",")",",","a","local","collabor","and","a","driver","(","from","Uganda",")",",","share","a","van","that","depart","everi","day","from","Kampala","to","visit","school",".","'","GalileoMobil","in","the","Land","of","Beauti","'","is","the","stori","of","that","amaz","adventur","."],"lemmas":["GalileoMobile","be","a","purely","non-profit","initiative","run","by","astronomer",",","educator",",","and","science","communicator",".","it","be","a","travel","science","education","program","that","bring","astronomy","closer","to","young","people","around","the","world",",","and","mainly","across","region","that","have","little","or","no","access","to","outreach","action",".","by","organize","astronomy-related","activity","in","school","and","village",",","they","aim","at","foster","a","will","of","learn","through","the","exciting","wonder","of","we","universe",".","on","September","2013",",","GalileoMobile","go","in","Uganda",".","a","international","team",",","form","of","four","GalileoMobile","member","-lrb-","from","Italy",",","Portugal",",","Switzerland",",","Brazil","-rrb-",",","two","film","producer","-lrb-","from","Italy","-rrb-",",","a","local","collaborator","and","a","driver","-lrb-","from","Uganda","-rrb-",",","share","a","van","that","depart","every","day","from","Kampala","to","visit","school",".","'","galileomobile","in","the","land","of","beauty","'","be","the","story","of","that","amazing","adventure","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["GalileoMobile is a","is a purely","a purely non-profit","purely non-profit initiative","non-profit initiative run","initiative run by","run by astronomers","by astronomers ,","astronomers , educators",", educators ,","educators , and",", and science","and science communicators","It is a","is a traveling","a traveling science","traveling science education","science education program","education program that","program that brings","that brings astronomy","brings astronomy closer","astronomy closer to","closer to young","to young people","young people around","people around the","around the world","the world ,","world , and",", and mainly","and mainly across","mainly across regions","across regions that","regions that have","that have little","have little or","little or no","or no access","no access to","access to outreach","to outreach actions","By organizing astronomy-related","organizing astronomy-related activities","astronomy-related activities in","activities in schools","in schools and","schools and villages","and villages ,","villages , they",", they aim","they aim at","aim at fostering","at fostering a","fostering a will","a will of","will of learning","of learning through","learning through the","through the exciting","the exciting wonders","exciting wonders of","wonders of our","of our Universe","On September 2013","September 2013 ,","2013 , GalileoMobile",", GalileoMobile went","GalileoMobile went in","went in Uganda","An international team","international team ,","team , formed",", formed of","formed of four","of four GalileoMobile","four GalileoMobile members","GalileoMobile members (","members ( from","( from Italy","from Italy ,","Italy , Portugal",", Portugal ,","Portugal , Switzerland",", Switzerland ,","Switzerland , Brazil",", Brazil )","Brazil ) ,",") , two",", two film","two film producers","film producers (","producers ( from","( from Italy","from Italy )","Italy ) ,",") , a",", a local","a local collaborator","local collaborator and","collaborator and a","and a driver","a driver (","driver ( from","( from Uganda","from Uganda )","Uganda ) ,",") , shared",", shared a","shared a van","a van that","van that departed","that departed every","departed every day","every day from","day from Kampala","from Kampala to","Kampala to visit","to visit schools","visit schools .","schools .

{"title":"Citizen Marc","plot":"Biopic about famed Canadian pot activist Marc Emery, who is currently serving 5 years in a US penitentiary for selling marijuana seeds to Americans over the Internet. Unlike virtually all materials on Emery, which see him as a martyr and champion of Canadian sovereignty, CITIZEN MARC looks at Emery as a deluded narcissist who has engaged in 'Tea Party' style pro-capitalist, anti-government fights of often silly proportions. The film questions whether Emery, in his headlong quest for fame and jail and his fight against government, generated some kind of meaningful and progressive political energy in the process.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary","

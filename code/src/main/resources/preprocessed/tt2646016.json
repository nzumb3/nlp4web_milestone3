{"title":"Youths of Shasha","plot":"The documentary talks about the situation of the music-talented youth in Shashamane, Ethiopia. This is a piece of land that Haile Selassie gave to all Rastafarian people who decided to come back to Africa. They haven't a studio or some distribution that can support them. Because they love and need to express themselves by music, they keep doing it, facing obstacles. This documentary is a part of a larger project: to establish the first music school and recording studio in Shashamane.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," History"],"stems":["The","documentari","talk","about","the","situat","of","the","music-tal","youth","in","Shashaman",",","Ethiopia",".","This","is","a","piec","of","land","that","Hail","Selassi","gave","to","all","Rastafarian","peopl","who","decid","to","come","back","to","Africa",".","They","have","n't","a","studio","or","some","distribut","that","can","support","them",".","Becaus","they","love","and","need","to","express","themselv","by","music",",","they","keep","do","it",",","face","obstacl",".","This","documentari","is","a","part","of","a","larger","project",":","to","establish","the","first","music","school","and","record","studio","in","Shashaman","."],"lemmas":["the","documentary","talk","about","the","situation","of","the","music-talented","youth","in","Shashamane",",","Ethiopia",".","this","be","a","piece","of","land","that","Haile","Selassie","give","to","all","rastafarian","people","who","decide","to","come","back","to","Africa",".","they","have","not","a","studio","or","some","distribution","that","can","support","they",".","because","they","love","and","need","to","express","themselves","by","music",",","they","keep","do","it",",","face","obstacle",".","this","documentary","be","a","part","of","a","larger","project",":","to","establish","the","first","music","school","and","recording","studio","in","Shashamane","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The documentary talks","documentary talks about","talks about the","about the situation","the situation of","situation of the","of the music-talented","the music-talented youth","music-talented youth in","youth in Shashamane","in Shashamane ,","Shashamane , Ethiopia","This is a","is a piece","a piece of","piece of land","of land that","land that Haile","that Haile Selassie","Haile Selassie gave","Selassie gave to","gave to all","to all Rastafarian","all Rastafarian people","Rastafarian people who","people who decided","who decided to","decided to come","to come back","come back to","back to Africa","They have n't","have n't a","n't a studio","a studio or","studio or some","or some distribution","some distribution that","distribution that can","that can support","can support them","Because they love","they love and","love and need","and need to","need to express","to express themselves","express themselves by","themselves by music","by music ,","music , they",", they keep","they keep doing","keep doing it","doing it ,","it , facing",", facing obstacles","This documentary is","documentary is a","is a part","a part of","part of a","of a larger","a larger project","larger project :","project : to",": to establish","to establish the","establish the first","the first music","first music school","music school and","school and recording","and recording studio","recording studio in","studio in Shashamane"],"2grams":["The documentary","documentary talks","talks about","about the","the situation","situation of","of the","the music-talented","music-talented youth","youth in","in Shashamane","Shashamane ,",", Ethiopia","This is","is a","a piece","piece of","of land","land that","that Haile","Haile Selassie","Selassie gave","gave to","to all","all Rastafarian","Rastafarian people","people who","who decided","decided to","to come","come back","back to","to Africa","They have","have n't","n't a","a studio","studio or","or some","some distribution","distribution that","that can","can support","support them","Because they","they love","love and","and need","need to","to express","express themselves","themselves by","by music","music ,",", they","they keep","keep doing","doing it","it ,",", facing","facing obstacles","This documentary","documentary is","is a","a part","part of","of a","a larger","larger project","project :",": to","to establish","establish the","the first","first music","music school","school and","and recording","recording studio","studio in","in Shashamane"]}

{"title":"The Icebreaker","plot":"Towards the icebreaker \"Mikhail Gromov\" is moving a huge iceberg. Leaving from collision, the ship falls into the ice trap and is forced to drift near the coast of Antarctica. Around it only an ominous silence and a bitter cold. Fuel is running out - Nerves on edge - And even if it would be possible to go, nowhere to go anyway. The crew of the icebreaker is no margin for error. One wrong decision and heavy ice crushed the ship.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Adventure"],"stems":["Toward","the","icebreak","\"","Mikhail","Gromov","\"","is","move","a","huge","iceberg",".","Leav","from","collis",",","the","ship","fall","into","the","ice","trap","and","is","forc","to","drift","near","the","coast","of","Antarctica",".","Around","it","onli","an","omin","silenc","and","a","bitter","cold",".","Fuel","is","run","out","-","Nerv","on","edg","-","And","even","if","it","would","be","possibl","to","go",",","nowher","to","go","anyway",".","The","crew","of","the","icebreak","is","no","margin","for","error",".","One","wrong","decis","and","heavi","ice","crush","the","ship","."],"lemmas":["towards","the","icebreaker","``","Mikhail","Gromov","''","be","move","a","huge","iceberg",".","leave","from","collision",",","the","ship","fall","into","the","ice","trap","and","be","force","to","drift","near","the","coast","of","Antarctica",".","around","it","only","a","ominous","silence","and","a","bitter","cold",".","fuel","be","run","out","-","nerve","on","edge","-","and","even","if","it","would","be","possible","to","go",",","nowhere","to","go","anyway",".","the","crew","of","the","icebreaker","be","no","margin","for","error",".","one","wrong","decision","and","heavy","ice","crush","the","ship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Towards the icebreaker","the icebreaker \"","icebreaker \" Mikhail","\" Mikhail Gromov","Mikhail Gromov \"","Gromov \" is","\" is moving","is moving a","moving a huge","a huge iceberg","Leaving from collision","from collision ,","collision , the",", the ship","the ship falls","ship falls into","falls into the","into the ice","the ice trap","ice trap and","trap and is","and is forced","is forced to","forced to drift","to drift near","drift near the","near the coast","the coast of","coast of Antarctica","Around it only","it only an","only an ominous","an ominous silence","ominous silence and","silence and a","and a bitter","a bitter cold","Fuel is running","is running out","running out -","out - Nerves","- Nerves on","Nerves on edge","on edge -","edge - And","- And even","And even if","even if it","if it would","it would be","would be possible","be possible to","possible to go","to go ,","go , nowhere",", nowhere to","nowhere to go","to go anyway","The crew of","crew of the","of the icebreaker","the icebreaker is","icebreaker is no","is no margin","no margin for","margin for error","One wrong decision","wrong decision and","decision and heavy","and heavy ice","heavy ice crushed","ice crushed the","crushed the ship"],"2grams":["Towards the","the icebreaker","icebreaker \"","\" Mikhail","Mikhail Gromov","Gromov \"","\" is","is moving","moving a","a huge","huge iceberg","Leaving from","from collision","collision ,",", the","the ship","ship falls","falls into","into the","the ice","ice trap","trap and","and is","is forced","forced to","to drift","drift near","near the","the coast","coast of","of Antarctica","Around it","it only","only an","an ominous","ominous silence","silence and","and a","a bitter","bitter cold","Fuel is","is running","running out","out -","- Nerves","Nerves on","on edge","edge -","- And","And even","even if","if it","it would","would be","be possible","possible to","to go","go ,",", nowhere","nowhere to","to go","go anyway","The crew","crew of","of the","the icebreaker","icebreaker is","is no","no margin","margin for","for error","One wrong","wrong decision","decision and","and heavy","heavy ice","ice crushed","crushed the","the ship"]}

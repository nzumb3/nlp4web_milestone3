{"title":"Tempting Fate","plot":"Two brothers, one of deep faith and the other buried in a life of crime have their worlds torn apart when the wrong one goes to jail and the other commits an unforgivable act. Synopsis: Tempting Fate is the story of two very different brothers. First there is Edu Okoye, a talented singer and a man of deep faith, Edu's spirituality is helping him combat cancer, that and the love of his wonderful girlfriend Tracey. Edu's older brother Ugo, is almost the polar opposite of Edu. Edu is calm, reflective and peaceful whereas Ugo is hotheaded, impulsive and at times menacing. Ugo has also chosen a very different path than Edu, a life of robbery and crime and though Ugo knows he is on a path of destruction, the life he has chosen is not an easy one to leave and according to his gang leader Scorpion, a life he won't be allowed to leave easily. Another issue is Edu's cancer is worsening and Ugo needs to stay in his life of crime to pay for surgery his brother desperately needs. A violent crime leads to Ugo stashing a large amount of cocaine at the house he shares with Edu. He plans on selling this to cover the surgery Edu needs but what Ugo doesn't realize is he has been monitored by the police. As they break down the door, they apprehend the totally shocked Edu just as Ugo escapes. Caught 'red-handed', Edu takes the blame for his brother, partially because he doesn't believe his brother is capable of such a crime and partially because he loves his brother too much to 'rat' on him. For his silence he is given three years in prison. Shortly into his sentence Tracey simply disappears. Edu is released, feeling empty but determined to get his life back on track. Ugo however continues to embark in a life of crime and it only becomes a matter of time before their two worlds smash together.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

{"title":"Every Dog Has Its Day","plot":"One day and night in the life of Jack Smith. Jack is a painter. No, not a house painter, not a sign painter, Jack is an artist. This is a story about one day out of his existence. One day in which he happens to lose his girlfriend, his job, his vision and possibly his dog. Then comes the night and Jack decides to \"hit the road.\" A simple road trip accompanied by his dog and a myriad of memories, which come to life haunting and harassing Jack from the backseat of his '61 Plymouth Fury. All this is punctuated by a ranting Sign Painter, a beautiful Red Head, and several other characters dotting the line of this particular road to nowhere. These strange absurdities reek havoc on Jack's journey through a bizarre storm-fillmed night that will either make or break an already shattered man.","genres":["Comedy","

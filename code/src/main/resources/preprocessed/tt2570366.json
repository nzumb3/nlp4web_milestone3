{"title":"The Vessel","plot":"17 year old Lisa Prescott has been running from something since she was six years old and saw her father blow his brains out in their living room, one year to the day after her mother died from a heroin overdose. Given one last chance to redeem herself before hitting the adult court system, Lisa is placed in the custody of her estranged twenty eight year old sister Susan, an ambitious and cutthroat real estate developer. Lisa has no idea how much she's going to need her wits and running skills when Susan takes Lisa to the remote New England town of Mount Eustis, the home of a devil worshipping cult that's been looking for a suitable human vessel in which to reincarnate their dead leader, a witch named Martha.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["17","year","old","Lisa","Prescott","has","been","run","from","someth","sinc","she","was","six","year","old","and","saw","her","father","blow","his","brain","out","in","their","live","room",",","one","year","to","the","day","after","her","mother","die","from","a","heroin","overdos",".","Given","one","last","chanc","to","redeem","herself","befor","hit","the","adult","court","system",",","Lisa","is","place","in","the","custodi","of","her","estrang","twenti","eight","year","old","sister","Susan",",","an","ambiti","and","cutthroat","real","estat","develop",".","Lisa","has","no","idea","how","much","she","'s","go","to","need","her","wit","and","run","skill","when","Susan","take","Lisa","to","the","remot","New","England","town","of","Mount","Eusti",",","the","home","of","a","devil","worship","cult","that","'s","been","look","for","a","suitabl","human","vessel","in","which","to","reincarn","their","dead","leader",",","a","witch","name","Martha","."],"lemmas":["17","year","old","Lisa","Prescott","have","be","run","from","something","since","she","be","six","year","old","and","see","she","father","blow","he","brain","out","in","they","living","room",",","one","year","to","the","day","after","she","mother","die","from","a","heroin","overdose",".","give","one","last","chance","to","redeem","herself","before","hit","the","adult","court","system",",","Lisa","be","place","in","the","custody","of","she","estrange","twenty","eight","year","old","sister","Susan",",","a","ambitious","and","cutthroat","real","estate","developer",".","Lisa","have","no","idea","how","much","she","be","go","to","need","she","wit","and","run","skill","when","Susan","take","Lisa","to","the","remote","New","England","town","of","Mount","Eustis",",","the","home","of","a","devil","worship","cult","that","be","be","look","for","a","suitable","human","vessel","in","which","to","reincarnate","they","dead","leader",",","a","witch","name","Martha","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["17

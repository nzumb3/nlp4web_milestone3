{"title":"The Clone Returns Home","plot":"The Clone Returns Home is a compelling meditation on the paradox of life and death, and the meaning of love and family. Set in an imaginary - yet utterly imaginable - future, this quietly provocative film skillfully transposes complex emotional drama into the realm of science fiction by exploring the influence of technology on human memory and experience. Filled with stunning imagery and haunting stillness, The Clone Returns Home deftly combines subtly nuanced sci-fi with a uniquely Japanese perspective on the universal themes of family, life, love, and death.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Fantasy"],"stems":["The","Clone","Return","Home","is","a","compel","medit","on","the","paradox","of","life","and","death",",","and","the","mean","of","love","and","famili",".","Set","in","an","imaginari","-","yet","utter","imagin","-","futur",",","this","quiet","provoc","film","skill","transpos","complex","emot","drama","into","the","realm","of","scienc","fiction","by","explor","the","influenc","of","technolog","on","human","memori","and","experi",".","Fill","with","stun","imageri","and","haunt","still",",","The","Clone","Return","Home","deft","combin","subt","nuanc","sci-fi","with","a","uniqu","Japanes","perspect","on","the","univers","theme","of","famili",",","life",",","love",",","and","death","."],"lemmas":["the","clone","return","Home","be","a","compelling","meditation","on","the","paradox","of","life","and","death",",","and","the","meaning","of","love","and","family",".","set","in","a","imaginary","-","yet","utterly","imaginable","-","future",",","this","quietly","provocative","film","skillfully","transpose","complex","emotional","drama","into","the","realm","of","science","fiction","by","explore","the","influence","of","technology","on","human","memory","and","experience",".","fill","with","stunning","imagery","and","haunting","stillness",",","the","clone","return","Home","deftly","combine","subtly","nuanced","sci-fi","with","a","uniquely","japanese","perspective","on","the","universal","theme","of","family",",","life",",","love",",","and","death","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The Clone Returns","Clone Returns Home","Returns Home is","Home is a","is a compelling","a compelling meditation","compelling meditation on","meditation on the","on the paradox","the paradox of","paradox of life","of life and","life and death","and death ,","death , and",", and the","and the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of love","of love and","love and family","Set in an","in an imaginary","an imaginary -","imaginary - yet","- yet utterly","yet utterly imaginable","utterly imaginable -","imaginable - future","- future ,","future , this",", this quietly","this quietly provocative","quietly provocative film","provocative film skillfully","film skillfully transposes","skillfully transposes complex","transposes complex emotional","complex emotional drama","emotional drama into","drama into the","into the realm","the realm of","realm of science","of science fiction","science fiction by","fiction by exploring","by exploring the","exploring the influence","the influence of","influence of technology","of technology on","technology on human","on human memory","human memory and","memory and experience","Filled with stunning","with stunning imagery","stunning imagery and","imagery and haunting","and haunting stillness","haunting stillness ,","stillness , The",", The Clone","The Clone Returns","Clone Returns Home","Returns Home deftly","Home deftly combines","deftly combines subtly","combines subtly nuanced","subtly nuanced sci-fi","nuanced sci-fi with","sci-fi with a","with a uniquely","a uniquely Japanese","uniquely Japanese perspective","Japanese perspective on","perspective on the","on the universal","the universal themes","universal themes of","themes of family","of family ,","family , life",", life ,","life , love",", love ,","love , and",", and death"],"2grams":["The Clone","Clone Returns","Returns Home","Home is","is a","a compelling","compelling meditation","meditation on","on the","the paradox","paradox of","of life","life and","and death","death ,",", and","and the","the meaning","meaning of","of love","love and","and family","Set in","in an","an imaginary","imaginary -","- yet","yet utterly","utterly imaginable","imaginable -","- future","future ,",", this","this quietly","quietly provocative","provocative film","film skillfully","skillfully transposes","transposes complex","complex emotional","emotional drama","drama into","into the","the realm","realm of","of science","science fiction","fiction by","by exploring","exploring the","the influence","influence of","of technology","technology on","on human","human memory","memory and","and experience","Filled with","with stunning","stunning imagery","imagery and","and haunting","haunting stillness","stillness ,",", The","The Clone","Clone Returns","Returns Home","Home deftly","deftly combines","combines subtly","subtly nuanced","nuanced sci-fi","sci-fi with","with a","a uniquely","uniquely Japanese","Japanese perspective","perspective on","on the","the universal","universal themes","themes of","of family","family ,",", life","life ,",", love","love ,",", and","and death"]}

{"title":"Tremendous","plot":"Organized around the principle of a tidal wave, the content of the video was shot with the participation of more than 170 visitors during a three-month residency at Recess Activities, Inc., a unique artist program/ gallery space in Manhattan. I built seven minimalist gray-scale sets inside the storefront space and invited visitors into conversation with the use of an intake form. The resulting video is a complex but cohesive experimental narrative about the experience of being overwhelmed. It is made up of interviews, reenactments, and performances conceived of in collaboration with visitors.","genres":["Comedy"," Musical"," Drama"],"stems":["Organiz","around","the","principl","of","a","tidal","wave",",","the","content","of","the","video","was","shot","with","the","particip","of","more","than","170","visitor","dure","a","three-month","resid","at","Recess","Activiti",",","Inc.",",","a","uniqu","artist","program","/","galleri","space","in","Manhattan",".","I","built","seven","minimalist","gray-scal","set","insid","the","storefront","space","and","invit","visitor","into","convers","with","the","use","of","an","intak","form",".","The","result","video","is","a","complex","but","cohes","experiment","narrat","about","the","experi","of","be","overwhelm",".","It","is","made","up","of","interview",",","reenact",",","and","perform","conceiv","of","in","collabor","with","visitor","."],"lemmas":["Organized","around","the","principle","of","a","tidal","wave",",","the","content","of","the","video","be","shoot","with","the","participation","of","more","than","170","visitor","during","a","three-month","residency","at","recess","activity",",","Inc.",",","a","unique","artist","program","/","gallery","space","in","Manhattan",".","I","build","seven","minimalist","gray-scale","set","inside","the","storefront","space","and","invite","visitor","into","conversation","with","the","use","of","a","intake","form",".","the","result","video","be","a","complex","but","cohesive","experimental","narrative","about","the","experience","of","be","overwhelm",".","it","be","make","up","of","interview",",","reenactment",",","and","performance","conceive","of","in","collaboration","with","visitor","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Organized around the","around the principle","the principle of","principle of a","of a tidal","a tidal wave","tidal wave ,","wave , the",", the content","the content of","content of the","of the video","the video was","video was shot","was shot with","shot with the","with the participation","the participation of","participation of more","of more than","more than 170","than 170 visitors","170 visitors during","visitors during a","during a three-month","a three-month residency","three-month residency at","residency at Recess","at Recess Activities","Recess Activities ,","Activities , Inc.",", Inc. ,","Inc. , a",", a unique","a unique artist","unique artist program","artist program /","program / gallery","/ gallery space","gallery space in","space in Manhattan","I built seven","built seven minimalist","seven minimalist gray-scale","minimalist gray-scale sets","gray-scale sets inside","sets inside the","inside the storefront","the storefront space","storefront space and","space and invited","and invited visitors","invited visitors into","visitors into conversation","into conversation with","conversation with the","with the use","the use of","use of an","of an intake","an intake form","The resulting video","resulting video is","video is a","is a complex","a complex but","complex but cohesive","but cohesive experimental","cohesive experimental narrative","experimental narrative about","narrative about the","about the experience","the experience of","experience of being","of being overwhelmed","It is made","is made up","made up of","up of interviews","of interviews ,","interviews , reenactments",", reenactments ,","reenactments , and",", and performances","and performances conceived","performances conceived of","conceived of in","of in collaboration","in collaboration with","collaboration with visitors"],"2grams":["Organized around","around the","the principle","principle of","of a","a tidal","tidal wave","wave ,",", the","the content","content of","of the","the video","video was","was shot","shot with","with the","the participation","participation of","of more","more than","than 170","170 visitors","visitors during","during a","a three-month","three-month residency","residency at","at Recess","Recess Activities","Activities ,",", Inc.","Inc. ,",", a","a unique","unique artist","artist program","program /","/ gallery","gallery space","space in","in Manhattan","I built","built seven","seven minimalist","minimalist gray-scale","gray-scale sets","sets inside","inside the","the storefront","storefront space","space and","and invited","invited visitors","visitors into","into conversation","conversation with","with the","the use","use of","of an","an intake","intake form","The resulting","resulting video","video is","is a","a complex","complex but","but cohesive","cohesive experimental","experimental narrative","narrative about","about the","the experience","experience of","of being","being overwhelmed","It is","is made","made up","up of","of interviews","interviews ,",", reenactments","reenactments ,",", and","and performances","performances conceived","conceived of","of in","in collaboration","collaboration with","with visitors"]}

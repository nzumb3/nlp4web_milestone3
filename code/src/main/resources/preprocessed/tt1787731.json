{"title":"Jess + Moss","plot":"Jess (18) and Moss (12) are second cousins who have spent their summers together since either of them can remember. Without immediate families that they can relate to, and lacking friends their own age, all they have is each other. Through a series of memories and vignettes, 'Jess + Moss' recounts the events of the last summer they shared together. Shot entirely on location with a variety of expired and often degraded film stocks, 'Jess + Moss' captures the evocative and haunting character of the dark fire tobacco fields of rural Western Kentucky.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Jess","(","18",")","and","Moss","(","12",")","are","second","cousin","who","have","spent","their","summer","togeth","sinc","either","of","them","can","rememb",".","Without","immedi","famili","that","they","can","relat","to",",","and","lack","friend","their","own","age",",","all","they","have","is","each","other",".","Through","a","seri","of","memori","and","vignett",",","'","Jess","+","Moss","'","recount","the","event","of","the","last","summer","they","share","togeth",".","Shot","entir","on","locat","with","a","varieti","of","expir","and","often","degrad","film","stock",",","'","Jess","+","Moss","'","captur","the","evoc","and","haunt","charact","of","the","dark","fire","tobacco","field","of","rural","Western","Kentucki","."],"lemmas":["jess","-lrb-","18","-rrb-","and","Moss","-lrb-","12","-rrb-","be","second","cousin","who","have","spend","they","summer","together","since","either","of","they","can","remember",".","without","immediate","family","that","they","can","relate","to",",","and","lack","friend","they","own","age",",","all","they","have","be","each","other",".","through","a","series","of","memory","and","vignette",",","'","Jess","+","Moss","'","recount","the","event","of","the","last","summer","they","share","together",".","shoot","entirely","on","location","with","a","variety","of","expire","and","often","degraded","film","stock",",","'","Jess","+","Moss","'","capture","the","evocative","and","haunt","character","of","the","dark","fire","tobacco","field","of","rural","Western","Kentucky","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Jess ( 18","( 18 )","18 ) and",") and Moss","and Moss (","Moss ( 12","( 12 )","12 ) are",") are second","are second cousins","second cousins who","cousins who have","who have spent","have spent their","spent their summers","their summers together","summers together since","together since either","since either of","either of them","of them can","them can remember","Without immediate families","immediate families that","families that they","that they can","they can relate","can relate to","relate to ,","to , and",", and lacking","and lacking friends","lacking friends their","friends their own","their own age","own age ,","age , all",", all they","all they have","they have is","have is each","is each other","Through a series","a series of","series of memories","of memories and","memories and vignettes","and vignettes ,","vignettes , '",", ' Jess","' Jess +","Jess + Moss","+ Moss '","Moss ' recounts","' recounts the","recounts the events","the events of","events of the","of the last","the last summer","last summer they","summer they shared","they shared together","Shot entirely on","entirely on location","on location with","location with a","with a variety","a variety of","variety of expired","of expired and","expired and often","and often degraded","often degraded film","degraded film stocks","film stocks ,","stocks , '",", ' Jess","' Jess +","Jess + Moss","+ Moss '","Moss ' captures","' captures the","captures the evocative","the evocative and","evocative and haunting","and haunting character","haunting character of","character of the","of the dark","the dark fire","dark fire tobacco","fire tobacco fields","tobacco fields of","fields of rural","of rural Western","rural Western Kentucky"],"2grams":["Jess (","( 18","18 )",") and","and Moss","Moss (","( 12","12 )",") are","are second","second cousins","cousins who","who have","have spent","spent their","their summers","summers together","together since","since either","either of","of them","them can","can remember","Without immediate","immediate families","families that","that they","they can","can relate","relate to","to ,",", and","and lacking","lacking friends","friends their","their own","own age","age ,",", all","all they","they have","have is","is each","each other","Through a","a series","series of","of memories","memories and","and vignettes","vignettes ,",", '","' Jess","Jess +","+ Moss","Moss '","' recounts","recounts the","the events","events of","of the","the last","last summer","summer they","they shared","shared together","Shot entirely","entirely on","on location","location with","with a","a variety","variety of","of expired","expired and","and often","often degraded","degraded film","film stocks","stocks ,",", '","' Jess","Jess +","+ Moss","Moss '","' captures","captures the","the evocative","evocative and","and haunting","haunting character","character of","of the","the dark","dark fire","fire tobacco","tobacco fields","fields of","of rural","rural Western","Western Kentucky"]}

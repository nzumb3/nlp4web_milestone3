{"title":"American Icon","plot":"The film chronicles the Naked Cowboy's attempts at stardom through interviews, lifestyle footage, television appearances and public performances. His journey starts in a small suburb outside Cincinnati, Ohio where he builds not only a unique icon persona, but also a philosophy of personal empowerment that he strives to pass on to anyone who will listen. Through song and public performances, the Naked Cowboy has built a cult-like status leading him to several appearances on national television programs such as MTV, CNN and The Howard Stern Show to name a few. With over a hundred performances on New York?s Times Square alone, there seems to be nothing that will deter John Robert Burke from becoming the next American Icon.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","film","chronicl","the","Nake","Cowboy","'s","attempt","at","stardom","through","interview",",","lifestyl","footag",",","televis","appear","and","public","perform",".","His","journey","start","in","a","small","suburb","outsid","Cincinnati",",","Ohio","where","he","build","not","onli","a","uniqu","icon","persona",",","but","also","a","philosophi","of","person","empower","that","he","strive","to","pass","on","to","anyon","who","will","listen",".","Through","song","and","public","perform",",","the","Nake","Cowboy","has","built","a","cult-lik","status","lead","him","to","sever","appear","on","nation","televis","program","such","as","MTV",",","CNN","and","The","Howard","Stern","Show","to","name","a","few",".","With","over","a","hundr","perform","on","New","York?","Time","Squar","alon",",","there","seem","to","be","noth","that","will","deter","John","Robert","Burk","from","becom","the","next","American","Icon","."],"lemmas":["the","film","chronicle","the","Naked","Cowboy","'s","attempt","at","stardom","through","interview",",","lifestyle","footage",",","television","appearance","and","public","performance",".","he","journey","start","in","a","small","suburb","outside","Cincinnati",",","Ohio","where","he","build","not","only","a","unique","icon","persona",",","but","also","a","philosophy","of","personal","empowerment","that","he","strive","to","pass","on","to","anyone","who","will","listen",".","through","song","and","public","performance",",","the","Naked","Cowboy","have","build","a","cult-like","status","lead","he","to","several","appearance","on","national","television","program","such","as","MTV",",","CNN","and","The","Howard","Stern","Show","to","name","a","few",".","with","over","a","hundred","performance","on","New","York?s","Times","Square","alone",",","there","seem","to","be","nothing","that","will","deter","John","Robert","Burke","from","become","the","next","American","Icon","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

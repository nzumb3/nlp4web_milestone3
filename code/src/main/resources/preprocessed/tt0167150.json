{"title":"Restraining Order","plot":"Robert Woodfield is a criminal defense attorney, and he has defended a lot of criminals, many of whom are guilty, but has maintained that everyone deserves a competent defense, which he provides whether they are guilty or not. Currently he is defending Martin Ritter, a killer, whom he gets off. Later he has dinner with a friend, and his friend tells him that he needs to talk to him about something important. He is about to leave when some masked men go to his friend and kill him, when one of the men takes off his mask; it's Martin Ritter. Now being his lawyer, Robert can't say anything about what he saw. But that doesn't stop him from investigating what his dead friend was so worried about. It seems that he has stumbled onto something big, and instead of killing him they frame his wife for murder to get him to back off. But he doesn't and both his wife and him are now in danger. And still has no idea what's going on. Will he find out before they get to him?","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["Robert","Woodfield","is","a","crimin","defens","attorney",",","and","he","has","defend","a","lot","of","crimin",",","mani","of","whom","are","guilti",",","but","has","maintain","that","everyon","deserv","a","compet","defens",",","which","he","provid","whether","they","are","guilti","or","not",".","Current","he","is","defend","Martin","Ritter",",","a","killer",",","whom","he","get","off",".","Later","he","has","dinner","with","a","friend",",","and","his","friend","tell","him","that","he","need","to","talk","to","him","about","someth","import",".","He","is","about","to","leav","when","some","mask","men","go","to","his","friend","and","kill","him",",","when","one","of","the","men","take","off","his","mask",";","it","'s","Martin","Ritter",".","Now","be","his","lawyer",",","Robert","ca","n't","say","anyth","about","what","he","saw",".","But","that","doe","n't","stop","him","from","investig","what","his","dead","friend","was","so","worri","about",".","It","seem","that","he","has","stumbl","onto","someth","big",",","and","instead","of","kill","him","they","frame","his","wife","for","murder","to","get","him","to","back","off",".","But","he","doe","n't","and","both","his","wife","and","him","are","now","in","danger",".","And","still","has","no","idea","what","'s","go","on",".","Will","he","find","out","befor","they","get","to","him","?"],"lemmas":["Robert","Woodfield","be","a","criminal","defense","attorney",",","and","he","have","defend","a","lot","of","criminal",",","many","of","whom","be","guilty",",","but","have","maintain","that","everyone","deserve","a","competent","defense",",","which","he","provide","whether","they","be","guilty","or","not",".","currently","he","be","defend","Martin","Ritter",",","a","killer",",","whom","he","get","off",".","later","he","have","dinner","with","a","friend",",","and","he","friend","tell","he","that","he","need","to","talk","to","he","about","something","important",".","he","be","about","to","leave","when","some","mask","man","go","to","he","friend","and","kill","he",",","when","one","of","the","man","take","off","he","mask",";","it","be","Martin","Ritter",".","now","be","he","lawyer",",","Robert","can","not","say","anything","about","what","he","see",".","but","that","do","not","stop","he","from","investigate","what","he","dead","friend","be","so","worry","about",".","it","seem","that","he","have","stumble","onto","something","big",",","and","instead","of","kill","he","they","frame","he","wife","for","murder","to","get","he","to","back","off",".","but","he","do","not","and","both","he","wife","and","he","be","now","in","danger",".","and","still","have","no","idea","what","be","go","on",".","will","he","find","out","before","they","get","to","he","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Robert Woodfield is","Woodfield is a","is a criminal","a criminal defense","criminal defense attorney","defense attorney ,","attorney , and",", and he","and he has","he has defended","has defended a","defended a lot","a lot of","lot of criminals","of criminals ,","criminals , many",", many of","many of whom","of whom are","whom are guilty","are guilty ,","guilty , but",", but has","but has maintained","has maintained that","maintained that everyone","that everyone deserves","everyone deserves a","deserves a competent","a competent defense","competent defense ,","defense , which",", which he","which he provides","he provides whether","provides whether they","whether they are","they are guilty","are guilty or","guilty or not","Currently he is","he is defending","is defending Martin","defending Martin Ritter","Martin Ritter ,","Ritter , a",", a killer","a killer ,","killer , whom",", whom he","whom he gets","he gets off","Later he has","he has dinner","has dinner with","dinner with a","with a friend","a friend ,","friend , and",", and his","and his friend","his friend tells","friend tells him","tells him that","him that he","that he needs","he needs to","needs to talk","to talk to","talk to him","to him about","him about something","about something important","He is about","is about to","about to leave","to leave when","leave when some","when some masked","some masked men","masked men go","men go to","go to his","to his friend","his friend and","friend and kill","and kill him","kill him ,","him , when",", when one","when one of","one of the","of the men","the men takes","men takes off","takes off his","off his mask","his mask ;","mask ;

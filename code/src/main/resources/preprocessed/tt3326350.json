{"title":"The Strike","plot":"When a trio of struggling and increasingly desperate thirty-something actors -- Alberto, Molly and Richard -- discover that A-list talent agent Carlo Lombardi is taking classes at the yoga studio where Molly teaches, they concoct the perfect scheme to convince him of their talent: Lay siege to the yoga studio, tie Carlo up -- and with a gun to his head -- give the performance of their lives! A perfect plan! Now what could go wrong? 'The Strike': Just cause they have a plan, doesn't mean they've got a clue!","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["When","a","trio","of","struggl","and","increas","desper","thirty-someth","actor","--","Alberto",",","Molli","and","Richard","--","discov","that","A-list","talent","agent","Carlo","Lombardi","is","take","class","at","the","yoga","studio","where","Molli","teach",",","they","concoct","the","perfect","scheme","to","convinc","him","of","their","talent",":","Lay","sieg","to","the","yoga","studio",",","tie","Carlo","up","--","and","with","a","gun","to","his","head","--","give","the","perform","of","their","live","!","A","perfect","plan","!","Now","what","could","go","wrong","?","'","The","Strike","'",":","Just","caus","they","have","a","plan",",","doe","n't","mean","they","ve","got","a","clue","!"],"lemmas":["when","a","trio","of","struggle","and","increasingly","desperate","thirty-something","actor","--","Alberto",",","Molly","and","Richard","--","discover","that","a-list","talent","agent","Carlo","Lombardi","be","take","class","at","the","yoga","studio","where","Molly","teach",",","they","concoct","the","perfect","scheme","to","convince","he","of","they","talent",":","lay","siege","to","the","yoga","studio",",","tie","Carlo","up","--","and","with","a","gun","to","he","head","--","give","the","performance","of","they","life","!","a","perfect","plan","!","now","what","could","go","wrong","?","'","the","strike","'",":","just","cause","they","have","a","plan",",","do","not","mean","they","have","get","a","clue","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When a trio","a trio of","trio of struggling","of struggling and","struggling and increasingly","and increasingly desperate","increasingly desperate thirty-something","desperate thirty-something actors","thirty-something actors --","actors -- Alberto","-- Alberto ,","Alberto , Molly",", Molly and","Molly and Richard","and Richard --","Richard -- discover","-- discover that","discover that A-list","that A-list talent","A-list talent agent","talent agent Carlo","agent Carlo Lombardi","Carlo Lombardi is","Lombardi is taking","is taking classes","taking classes at","classes at the","at the yoga","the yoga studio","yoga studio where","studio where Molly","where Molly teaches","Molly teaches ,","teaches , they",", they concoct","they concoct the","concoct the perfect","the perfect scheme","perfect scheme to","scheme to convince","to convince him","convince him of","him of their","of their talent","their talent :","talent : Lay",": Lay siege","Lay siege to","siege to the","to the yoga","the yoga studio","yoga studio ,","studio , tie",", tie Carlo","tie Carlo up","Carlo up --","up -- and","-- and with","and with a","with a gun","a gun to","gun to his","to his head","his head --","head -- give","-- give the","give the performance","the performance of","performance of their","of their lives","A perfect plan","Now what could","what could go","could go wrong","go wrong ?","wrong ?

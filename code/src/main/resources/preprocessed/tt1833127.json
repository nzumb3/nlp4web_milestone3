{"title":"Vampire Warriors","plot":"Vampire Warriors follows the uneasy friendship between vampire hunter Ar (Jiang Lu-Xia) and a family of \"vegetarian\" vampires, including Max (Chrissie Chau) and her womanizing father Lung (Chin Siu-Ho). Ar spends her days walking around hunting down bad vampires, while Max and her good vampire friends hang around town aimlessly, complaining about how bored they are. That all changes with the arrival of Mung (Yuen Wah), a vampire kills other vampires to make himself more powerful (aren't they always?). When Ar realizes that Mung's dragging her sister (Law regular Pinky Cheung) with him, she joins forces with the vegetarian vampires to fight their common enemy.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["Vampir","Warrior","follow","the","uneasi","friendship","between","vampir","hunter","Ar","(","Jiang","Lu-Xia",")","and","a","famili","of","\"","vegetarian","\"","vampir",",","includ","Max","(","Chrissi","Chau",")","and","her","woman","father","Lung","(","Chin","Siu-Ho",")",".","Ar","spend","her","day","walk","around","hunt","down","bad","vampir",",","while","Max","and","her","good","vampir","friend","hang","around","town","aimless",",","complain","about","how","bore","they","are",".","That","all","chang","with","the","arriv","of","Mung","(","Yuen","Wah",")",",","a","vampir","kill","other","vampir","to","make","himself","more","power","(","are","n't","they","alway","?",")",".","When","Ar","realiz","that","Mung","'s","drag","her","sister","(","Law","regular","Pinki","Cheung",")","with","him",",","she","join","forc","with","the","vegetarian","vampir","to","fight","their","common","enemi","."],"lemmas":["Vampire","Warriors","follow","the","uneasy","friendship","between","vampire","hunter","ar","-lrb-","Jiang","lu-xia","-rrb-","and","a","family","of","``","vegetarian","''","vampire",",","include","Max","-lrb-","Chrissie","Chau","-rrb-","and","she","womanize","father","lung","-lrb-","Chin","Siu-Ho","-rrb-",".","ar","spend","she","day","walk","around","hunting","down","bad","vampire",",","while","Max","and","she","good","vampire","friend","hang","around","town","aimlessly",",","complain","about","how","bored","they","be",".","that","all","change","with","the","arrival","of","Mung","-lrb-","Yuen","Wah","-rrb-",",","a","vampire","kill","other","vampire","to","make","himself","more","powerful","-lrb-","be","not","they","always","?","-rrb-",".","when","ar","realize","that","Mung","'s","drag","she","sister","-lrb-","law","regular","Pinky","Cheung","-rrb-","with","he",",","she","join","force","with","the","vegetarian","vampire","to","fight","they","common","enemy","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Vampire Warriors follows","Warriors follows the","follows the uneasy","the uneasy friendship","uneasy friendship between","friendship between vampire","between vampire hunter","vampire hunter Ar","hunter Ar (","Ar ( Jiang","( Jiang Lu-Xia","Jiang Lu-Xia )","Lu-Xia ) and",") and a","and a family","a family of","family of \"","of \" vegetarian","\" vegetarian \"","vegetarian \" vampires","\" vampires ,","vampires , including",", including Max","including Max (","Max ( Chrissie","( Chrissie Chau","Chrissie Chau )","Chau ) and",") and her","and her womanizing","her womanizing father","womanizing father Lung","father Lung (","Lung ( Chin","( Chin Siu-Ho","Chin Siu-Ho )","Ar spends her","spends her days","her days walking","days walking around","walking around hunting","around hunting down","hunting down bad","down bad vampires","bad vampires ,","vampires , while",", while Max","while Max and","Max and her","and her good","her good vampire","good vampire friends","vampire friends hang","friends hang around","hang around town","around town aimlessly","town aimlessly ,","aimlessly , complaining",", complaining about","complaining about how","about how bored","how bored they","bored they are","That all changes","all changes with","changes with the","with the arrival","the arrival of","arrival of Mung","of Mung (","Mung ( Yuen","( Yuen Wah","Yuen Wah )","Wah ) ,",") , a",", a vampire","a vampire kills","vampire kills other","kills other vampires","other vampires to","vampires to make","to make himself","make himself more","himself more powerful","more powerful (","powerful ( are","( are n't","are n't they","n't they always","they always ?","always ?

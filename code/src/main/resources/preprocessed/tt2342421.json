{"title":"Wakey Wakey","plot":"Josie is a teenage girl on the cusp of her sexual awakening. Her confusion is heightened by her extreme sleep condition, which blurs her dreams into waking life. Forbidden from leaving the house, she's long remained alone but for the supervision of her sister Samantha, for whom she yearns. But Samantha has a macabre fetish and a dark web of secrets. While Josie sleeps, Samantha manipulates her, making her the unwitting subject of her artistic obsessions of power, sex and death. Josie is the plaything in her ever-broadening cavalcade of sadistic fantasies that spiral towards destruction. To maintain her secret, Samantha uses Josie's condition against her while she's awake, further undermining her perception of reality. Josie must learn to trust her own perceptions or risk losing total control.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

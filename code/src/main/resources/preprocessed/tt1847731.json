{"title":"Tomboy","plot":"A family moves into a new neighborhood, and a 10-year-old named Laure deliberately presents as a boy named Mikhael to the neighborhood children. It is heavily implied that Mikhael is a closeted transgender boy. This film follows his experiences with his newfound friends, his potential love interest, Lisa, his younger sister and his parents. It focuses in on the significance of gender identity in social interaction from an early age, the difficulties of being transgender and young, and how Mikhael navigates these in the background of childhood play and love.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","famili","move","into","a","new","neighborhood",",","and","a","10-year-old","name","Laur","deliber","present","as","a","boy","name","Mikhael","to","the","neighborhood","children",".","It","is","heavili","impli","that","Mikhael","is","a","closet","transgend","boy",".","This","film","follow","his","experi","with","his","newfound","friend",",","his","potenti","love","interest",",","Lisa",",","his","younger","sister","and","his","parent",".","It","focus","in","on","the","signific","of","gender","ident","in","social","interact","from","an","earli","age",",","the","difficulti","of","be","transgend","and","young",",","and","how","Mikhael","navig","these","in","the","background","of","childhood","play","and","love","."],"lemmas":["a","family","move","into","a","new","neighborhood",",","and","a","10-year-old","name","Laure","deliberately","present","as","a","boy","name","Mikhael","to","the","neighborhood","child",".","it","be","heavily","implied","that","Mikhael","be","a","closeted","transgender","boy",".","this","film","follow","he","experience","with","he","newfound","friend",",","he","potential","love","interest",",","Lisa",",","he","younger","sister","and","he","parent",".","it","focus","in","on","the","significance","of","gender","identity","in","social","interaction","from","a","early","age",",","the","difficulty","of","be","transgender","and","young",",","and","how","Mikhael","navigate","these","in","the","background","of","childhood","play","and","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A family moves","family moves into","moves into a","into a new","a new neighborhood","new neighborhood ,","neighborhood , and",", and a","and a 10-year-old","a 10-year-old named","10-year-old named Laure","named Laure deliberately","Laure deliberately presents","deliberately presents as","presents as a","as a boy","a boy named","boy named Mikhael","named Mikhael to","Mikhael to the","to the neighborhood","the neighborhood children","It is heavily","is heavily implied","heavily implied that","implied that Mikhael","that Mikhael is","Mikhael is a","is a closeted","a closeted transgender","closeted transgender boy","This film follows","film follows his","follows his experiences","his experiences with","experiences with his","with his newfound","his newfound friends","newfound friends ,","friends , his",", his potential","his potential love","potential love interest","love interest ,","interest , Lisa",", Lisa ,","Lisa , his",", his younger","his younger sister","younger sister and","sister and his","and his parents","It focuses in","focuses in on","in on the","on the significance","the significance of","significance of gender","of gender identity","gender identity in","identity in social","in social interaction","social interaction from","interaction from an","from an early","an early age","early age ,","age , the",", the difficulties","the difficulties of","difficulties of being","of being transgender","being transgender and","transgender and young","and young ,","young , and",", and how","and how Mikhael","how Mikhael navigates","Mikhael navigates these","navigates these in","these in the","in the background","the background of","background of childhood","of childhood play","childhood play and","play and love"],"2grams":["A family","family moves","moves into","into a","a new","new neighborhood","neighborhood ,",", and","and a","a 10-year-old","10-year-old named","named Laure","Laure deliberately","deliberately presents","presents as","as a","a boy","boy named","named Mikhael","Mikhael to","to the","the neighborhood","neighborhood children","It is","is heavily","heavily implied","implied that","that Mikhael","Mikhael is","is a","a closeted","closeted transgender","transgender boy","This film","film follows","follows his","his experiences","experiences with","with his","his newfound","newfound friends","friends ,",", his","his potential","potential love","love interest","interest ,",", Lisa","Lisa ,",", his","his younger","younger sister","sister and","and his","his parents","It focuses","focuses in","in on","on the","the significance","significance of","of gender","gender identity","identity in","in social","social interaction","interaction from","from an","an early","early age","age ,",", the","the difficulties","difficulties of","of being","being transgender","transgender and","and young","young ,",", and","and how","how Mikhael","Mikhael navigates","navigates these","these in","in the","the background","background of","of childhood","childhood play","play and","and love"]}

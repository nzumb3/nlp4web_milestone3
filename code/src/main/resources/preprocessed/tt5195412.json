{"title":"Wakefield","plot":"Howard has a loving wife (Garner), two daughters, a prestigious job as a Manhattan lawyer, and a comfortable home in the suburbs. But inwardly he's suffocating, and eventually he snaps and goes into hiding in his garage attic leaving his family to wonder what happened to him. He observes them from his window - an outsider spying in on his own life - as the days of exile stretch into months. Is it possible to go back to the way things were?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Howard","has","a","love","wife","(","Garner",")",",","two","daughter",",","a","prestigi","job","as","a","Manhattan","lawyer",",","and","a","comfort","home","in","the","suburb",".","But","inward","he","'s","suffoc",",","and","eventu","he","snap","and","goe","into","hide","in","his","garag","attic","leav","his","famili","to","wonder","what","happen","to","him",".","He","observ","them","from","his","window","-","an","outsid","spi","in","on","his","own","life","-","as","the","day","of","exil","stretch","into","month",".","Is","it","possibl","to","go","back","to","the","way","thing","were","?"],"lemmas":["Howard","have","a","loving","wife","-lrb-","garner","-rrb-",",","two","daughter",",","a","prestigious","job","as","a","Manhattan","lawyer",",","and","a","comfortable","home","in","the","suburb",".","but","inwardly","he","be","suffocating",",","and","eventually","he","snap","and","go","into","hiding","in","he","garage","attic","leave","he","family","to","wonder","what","happen","to","he",".","he","observe","they","from","he","window","-","a","outsider","spy","in","on","he","own","life","-","as","the","day","of","exile","stretch","into","month",".","be","it","possible","to","go","back","to","the","way","thing","be","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Howard has a","has a loving","a loving wife","loving wife (","wife ( Garner","( Garner )","Garner ) ,",") , two",", two daughters","two daughters ,","daughters , a",", a prestigious","a prestigious job","prestigious job as","job as a","as a Manhattan","a Manhattan lawyer","Manhattan lawyer ,","lawyer , and",", and a","and a comfortable","a comfortable home","comfortable home in","home in the","in the suburbs","But inwardly he","inwardly he 's","he 's suffocating","'s suffocating ,","suffocating , and",", and eventually","and eventually he","eventually he snaps","he snaps and","snaps and goes","and goes into","goes into hiding","into hiding in","hiding in his","in his garage","his garage attic","garage attic leaving","attic leaving his","leaving his family","his family to","family to wonder","to wonder what","wonder what happened","what happened to","happened to him","He observes them","observes them from","them from his","from his window","his window -","window - an","- an outsider","an outsider spying","outsider spying in","spying in on","in on his","on his own","his own life","own life -","life - as","- as the","as the days","the days of","days of exile","of exile stretch","exile stretch into","stretch into months","Is it possible","it possible to","possible to go","to go back","go back to","back to the","to the way","the way things","way things were"],"2grams":["Howard has","has a","a loving","loving wife","wife (","( Garner","Garner )",") ,",", two","two daughters","daughters ,",", a","a prestigious","prestigious job","job as","as a","a Manhattan","Manhattan lawyer","lawyer ,",", and","and a","a comfortable","comfortable home","home in","in the","the suburbs","But inwardly","inwardly he","he 's","'s suffocating","suffocating ,",", and","and eventually","eventually he","he snaps","snaps and","and goes","goes into","into hiding","hiding in","in his","his garage","garage attic","attic leaving","leaving his","his family","family to","to wonder","wonder what","what happened","happened to","to him","He observes","observes them","them from","from his","his window","window -","- an","an outsider","outsider spying","spying in","in on","on his","his own","own life","life -","- as","as the","the days","days of","of exile","exile stretch","stretch into","into months","Is it","it possible","possible to","to go","go back","back to","to the","the way","way things","things were"]}

{"title":"Annie","plot":"Following daily routines of a mid-Michigan family, everything appears to be normal on the surface; Spring brings cleaning, Summer is filled with campfires and friends, Fall kicks into gear with family-time at the cider mill and the Winter features family gatherings to share holiday stories. Todd and Evelyn work hard to keep their family happy. They have three children; two boys and a little girl, named Annie. From pajama parties to a Girl Scouts' gathering. From assorted dolls to brightly colored dresses. Annie is your typical preteen princess. The only difference to this story is... Annie was born a boy.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Follow","daili","routin","of","a","mid-Michigan","famili",",","everyth","appear","to","be","normal","on","the","surfac",";","Spring","bring","clean",",","Summer","is","fill","with","campfir","and","friend",",","Fall","kick","into","gear","with","family-tim","at","the","cider","mill","and","the","Winter","featur","famili","gather","to","share","holiday","stori",".","Todd","and","Evelyn","work","hard","to","keep","their","famili","happi",".","They","have","three","children",";","two","boy","and","a","littl","girl",",","name","Annie",".","From","pajama","parti","to","a","Girl","Scout","'","gather",".","From","assort","doll","to","bright","color","dress",".","Annie","is","your","typic","preteen","princess",".","The","onli","differ","to","this","stori","is","...","Annie","was","born","a","boy","."],"lemmas":["follow","daily","routine","of","a","mid-michigan","family",",","everything","appear","to","be","normal","on","the","surface",";","spring","bring","cleaning",",","Summer","be","fill","with","campfire","and","friend",",","fall","kick","into","gear","with","family-time","at","the","cider","mill","and","the","Winter","feature","family","gathering","to","share","holiday","story",".","Todd","and","Evelyn","work","hard","to","keep","they","family","happy",".","they","have","three","child",";","two","boy","and","a","little","girl",",","name","Annie",".","from","pajama","party","to","a","Girl","scout","'","gathering",".","from","assorted","doll","to","brightly","colored","dress",".","Annie","be","you","typical","preteen","princess",".","the","only","difference","to","this","story","be","...","Annie","be","bear","a","boy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Following daily routines","daily routines of","routines of a","of a mid-Michigan","a mid-Michigan family","mid-Michigan family ,","family , everything",", everything appears","everything appears to","appears to be","to be normal","be normal on","normal on the","on the surface","the surface ;","surface ; Spring","; Spring brings","Spring brings cleaning","brings cleaning ,","cleaning , Summer",", Summer is","Summer is filled","is filled with","filled with campfires","with campfires and","campfires and friends","and friends ,","friends , Fall",", Fall kicks","Fall kicks into","kicks into gear","into gear with","gear with family-time","with family-time at","family-time at the","at the cider","the cider mill","cider mill and","mill and the","and the Winter","the Winter features","Winter features family","features family gatherings","family gatherings to","gatherings to share","to share holiday","share holiday stories","Todd and Evelyn","and Evelyn work","Evelyn work hard","work hard to","hard to keep","to keep their","keep their family","their family happy","They have three","have three children","three children ;","children ; two","; two boys","two boys and","boys and a","and a little","a little girl","little girl ,","girl , named",", named Annie","From pajama parties","pajama parties to","parties to a","to a Girl","a Girl Scouts","Girl Scouts '","Scouts ' gathering","From assorted dolls","assorted dolls to","dolls to brightly","to brightly colored","brightly colored dresses","Annie is your","is your typical","your typical preteen","typical preteen princess","The only difference","only difference to","difference to this","to this story","this story is","story is ...","is ...

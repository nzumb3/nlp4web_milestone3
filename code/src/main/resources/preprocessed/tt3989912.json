{"title":"Narodni heroj Ljiljan Vidic","plot":"This comedy of the absurd is set in the Nazi puppet Independent State of Croatia (NDH) during World War II. The hero, Ljiljan is a young peasant poet who joins the Partisan movement just before it falls apart, abandoned by its leader Tito. The last remaining hope for resisting Nazism is to assassinate Hitler. Ljiljan's task is to write a song that will allow his Partisan band to infiltrate the inner sanctum of the SS - by entering an SS talent show. If they win the competition, they will be invited to perform before Hitler and the NDH's high command. This is a satirical coming-of-age tale with a difference, capturing the craziness, comedy and horror of war in the Balkans.","genres":["Comedy"," War"],"stems":["This","comedi","of","the","absurd","is","set","in","the","Nazi","puppet","Independ","State","of","Croatia","(","NDH",")","dure","World","War","II",".","The","hero",",","Ljiljan","is","a","young","peasant","poet","who","join","the","Partisan","movement","just","befor","it","fall","apart",",","abandon","by","it","leader","Tito",".","The","last","remain","hope","for","resist","Nazism","is","to","assassin","Hitler",".","Ljiljan","'s","task","is","to","write","a","song","that","will","allow","his","Partisan","band","to","infiltr","the","inner","sanctum","of","the","SS","-","by","enter","an","SS","talent","show",".","If","they","win","the","competit",",","they","will","be","invit","to","perform","befor","Hitler","and","the","NDH","'s","high","command",".","This","is","a","satir","coming-of-ag","tale","with","a","differ",",","captur","the","crazi",",","comedi","and","horror","of","war","in","the","Balkan","."],"lemmas":["this","comedy","of","the","absurd","be","set","in","the","Nazi","puppet","Independent","State","of","Croatia","-lrb-","NDH","-rrb-","during","World","War","II",".","the","hero",",","Ljiljan","be","a","young","peasant","poet","who","join","the","partisan","movement","just","before","it","fall","apart",",","abandon","by","its","leader","Tito",".","the","last","remaining","hope","for","resist","Nazism","be","to","assassinate","Hitler",".","Ljiljan","'s","task","be","to","write","a","song","that","will","allow","he","partisan","band","to","infiltrate","the","inner","sanctum","of","the","ss","-","by","enter","a","ss","talent","show",".","if","they","win","the","competition",",","they","will","be","invite","to","perform","before","Hitler","and","the","NDH","'s","high","command",".","this","be","a","satirical","coming-of-age","tale","with","a","difference",",","capture","the","craziness",",","comedy","and","horror","of","war","in","the","Balkans","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This comedy of","comedy of the","of the absurd","the absurd is","absurd is set","is set in","set in the","in the Nazi","the Nazi puppet","Nazi puppet Independent","puppet Independent State","Independent State of","State of Croatia","of Croatia (","Croatia ( NDH","( NDH )","NDH ) during",") during World","during World War","World War II","The hero ,","hero , Ljiljan",", Ljiljan is","Ljiljan is a","is a young","a young peasant","young peasant poet","peasant poet who","poet who joins","who joins the","joins the Partisan","the Partisan movement","Partisan movement just","movement just before","just before it","before it falls","it falls apart","falls apart ,","apart , abandoned",", abandoned by","abandoned by its","by its leader","its leader Tito","The last remaining","last remaining hope","remaining hope for","hope for resisting","for resisting Nazism","resisting Nazism is","Nazism is to","is to assassinate","to assassinate Hitler","Ljiljan 's task","'s task is","task is to","is to write","to write a","write a song","a song that","song that will","that will allow","will allow his","allow his Partisan","his Partisan band","Partisan band to","band to infiltrate","to infiltrate the","infiltrate the inner","the inner sanctum","inner sanctum of","sanctum of the","of the SS","the SS -","SS -

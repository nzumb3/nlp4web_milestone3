{"title":"Roadside Massacre","plot":"Five college friends take a detour while traveling to their spring break destination. They end up in the remote mountain town of Blueridge, where Karen (Marina Resa) believes her older sister went missing 2 years before. After a few odd encounters with the locals, Karen and her friends decide to continue their journey until an unexpected auto malfunction leaves them stranded. The group takes refuge in a local motel and soon learns that in Blueridge, \"missing persons\" is just a way of life. One-by-one they begin disappearing until the grizzly discovery is made that the local BBQ Rib Restaurant might be serving up more than anyone had bargained.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Five","colleg","friend","take","a","detour","while","travel","to","their","spring","break","destin",".","They","end","up","in","the","remot","mountain","town","of","Blueridg",",","where","Karen","(","Marina","Resa",")","believ","her","older","sister","went","miss","2","year","befor",".","After","a","few","odd","encount","with","the","local",",","Karen","and","her","friend","decid","to","continu","their","journey","until","an","unexpect","auto","malfunct","leav","them","strand",".","The","group","take","refug","in","a","local","motel","and","soon","learn","that","in","Blueridg",",","\"","miss","person","\"","is","just","a","way","of","life",".","One-by-on","they","begin","disappear","until","the","grizzli","discoveri","is","made","that","the","local","BBQ","Rib","Restaur","might","be","serv","up","more","than","anyon","had","bargain","."],"lemmas":["five","college","friend","take","a","detour","while","travel","to","they","spring","break","destination",".","they","end","up","in","the","remote","mountain","town","of","Blueridge",",","where","Karen","-lrb-","Marina","Resa","-rrb-","believe","she","older","sister","go","miss","2","year","before",".","after","a","few","odd","encounter","with","the","local",",","Karen","and","she","friend","decide","to","continue","they","journey","until","a","unexpected","auto","malfunction","leave","they","strand",".","the","group","take","refuge","in","a","local","motel","and","soon","learn","that","in","Blueridge",",","``","miss","person","''","be","just","a","way","of","life",".","one-by-one","they","begin","disappear","until","the","grizzly","discovery","be","make","that","the","local","BBQ","Rib","Restaurant","might","be","serve","up","more","than","anyone","have","bargain","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Five

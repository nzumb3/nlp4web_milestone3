{"title":"Sleepy Heads","plot":"Penniless Japanese immigrants in New York. Hiro arrives seeking his fortune as a singer-songwriter. He moves into a cramped flat on the Lower East Side with Akira, a high-school friend, and with Ken, a stick-wielding tough guy who dreams of running a dojo. Ken gets Hiro a job delivering fast food to pay the rent. Hiro's path crosses that of the lovely Akiko, and Ken rescues a young woman in a neighboring flat when a gang boss sends punks to beat her up. These currents cross during a long night when Hiro is to take Akiko to a musical and Akira overdoses on drugs. What to do with the body? Steve McQueen has the answer.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Penniless","Japanes","immigr","in","New","York",".","Hiro","arriv","seek","his","fortun","as","a","singer-songwrit",".","He","move","into","a","cramp","flat","on","the","Lower","East","Side","with","Akira",",","a","high-school","friend",",","and","with","Ken",",","a","stick-wield","tough","guy","who","dream","of","run","a","dojo",".","Ken","get","Hiro","a","job","deliv","fast","food","to","pay","the","rent",".","Hiro","'s","path","cross","that","of","the","love","Akiko",",","and","Ken","rescu","a","young","woman","in","a","neighbor","flat","when","a","gang","boss","send","punk","to","beat","her","up",".","These","current","cross","dure","a","long","night","when","Hiro","is","to","take","Akiko","to","a","music","and","Akira","overdos","on","drug",".","What","to","do","with","the","bodi","?","Steve","McQueen","has","the","answer","."],"lemmas":["penniless","japanese","immigrant","in","New","York",".","Hiro","arrive","seek","he","fortune","as","a","singer-songwriter",".","he","move","into","a","cramped","flat","on","the","Lower","East","Side","with","Akira",",","a","high-school","friend",",","and","with","Ken",",","a","stick-wielding","tough","guy","who","dream","of","run","a","dojo",".","Ken","get","Hiro","a","job","deliver","fast","food","to","pay","the","rent",".","Hiro","'s","path","cross","that","of","the","lovely","Akiko",",","and","Ken","rescue","a","young","woman","in","a","neighboring","flat","when","a","gang","boss","send","punk","to","beat","she","up",".","these","current","cross","during","a","long","night","when","Hiro","be","to","take","Akiko","to","a","musical","and","Akira","overdose","on","drug",".","what","to","do","with","the","body","?","Steve","McQueen","have","the","answer","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Penniless

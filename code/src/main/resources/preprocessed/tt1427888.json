{"title":"Inertia","plot":"In the midst of our capitalist-driven culture, with many dirty hands filthy with corruption and war, an age of enlightenment is upon us. With common blood ties in Nicaragua, Seven American People's lives are about to unfold in what appears to be coincidence, but is much more... Two sisters, saved from the turmoils of American corruption in Nicaragua years ago, now lead very different paths from one-another: one upholds the law, the other breaks it. Their savior, a broken Priest who lost his faith those bloodied years past, now wanders the streets of New York, helping who he can in a much different way than he used to: through visions... shards of peoples misguided futures. An ego-driven actor, rising to the top of success? or a pitfall? A high-octane Spin-doctor, going against his own morals to fulfill a career in whitewashing... will our fallen servant's \"visions\" lead him down a new path? One that will tear apart a capitalist vision of the White-picket-fence? And a fellow Nicaraguan, who served as a US Senator's henchman, will realize that this politician's actions years ago are leading to the inevitable: destruction of everything held sacred.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","the","midst","of","our","capitalist-driven","cultur",",","with","mani","dirti","hand","filthi","with","corrupt","and","war",",","an","age","of","enlighten","is","upon","us",".","With","common","blood","tie","in","Nicaragua",",","Seven","American","Peopl","'s","live","are","about","to","unfold","in","what","appear","to","be","coincid",",","but","is","much","more","...","Two","sister",",","save","from","the","turmoil","of","American","corrupt","in","Nicaragua","year","ago",",","now","lead","veri","differ","path","from","one-anoth",":","one","uphold","the","law",",","the","other","break","it",".","Their","savior",",","a","broken","Priest","who","lost","his","faith","those","bloodi","year","past",",","now","wander","the","street","of","New","York",",","help","who","he","can","in","a","much","differ","way","than","he","use","to",":","through","vision","...","shard","of","peopl","misguid","futur",".","An","ego-driven","actor",",","rise","to","the","top","of","success","?","or","a","pitfal","?","A","high-octan","Spin-doctor",",","go","against","his","own","moral","to","fulfil","a","career","in","whitewash","...","will","our","fallen","servant","'s","\"","vision","\"","lead","him","down","a","new","path","?","One","that","will","tear","apart","a","capitalist","vision","of","the","White-picket-f","?","And","a","fellow","Nicaraguan",",","who","serv","as","a","US","Senat","'s","henchman",",","will","realiz","that","this","politician","'s","action","year","ago","are","lead","to","the","inevit",":","destruct","of","everyth","held","sacr","."],"lemmas":["in","the","midst","of","we","capitalist-driven","culture",",","with","many","dirty","hand","filthy","with","corruption","and","war",",","a","age","of","enlightenment","be","upon","we",".","with","common","blood","tie","in","Nicaragua",",","Seven","American","People","'s","life","be","about","to","unfold","in","what","appear","to","be","coincidence",",","but","be","much","more","...","two","sister",",","save","from","the","turmoil","of","american","corruption","in","Nicaragua","year","ago",",","now","lead","very","different","path","from","one-another",":","one","uphold","the","law",",","the","other","break","it",".","they","savior",",","a","broken","priest","who","lose","he","faith","those","bloody","year","past",",","now","wander","the","street","of","New","York",",","help","who","he","can","in","a","much","different","way","than","he","use","to",":","through","vision","...","shard","of","people","misguided","future",".","a","ego-driven","actor",",","rise","to","the","top","of","success","?","or","a","pitfall","?","a","high-octane","spin-doctor",",","go","against","he","own","moral","to","fulfill","a","career","in","whitewash","...","will","we","fallen","servant","'s","``","vision","''","lead","he","down","a","new","path","?","one","that","will","tear","apart","a","capitalist","vision","of","the","white-picket-fence","?","and","a","fellow","Nicaraguan",",","who","serve","as","a","US","Senator","'s","henchman",",","will","realize","that","this","politician","'s","action","year","ago","be","lead","to","the","inevitable",":","destruction","of","everything","hold","sacred","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the midst","the midst of","midst of our","of our capitalist-driven","our capitalist-driven culture","capitalist-driven culture ,","culture , with",", with many","with many dirty","many dirty hands","dirty hands filthy","hands filthy with","filthy with corruption","with corruption and","corruption and war","and war ,","war , an",", an age","an age of","age of enlightenment","of enlightenment is","enlightenment is upon","is upon us","With common blood","common blood ties","blood ties in","ties in Nicaragua","in Nicaragua ,","Nicaragua , Seven",", Seven American","Seven American People","American People 's","People 's lives","'s lives are","lives are about","are about to","about to unfold","to unfold in","unfold in what","in what appears","what appears to","appears to be","to be coincidence","be coincidence ,","coincidence , but",", but is","but is much","is much more","much more ...","more ...

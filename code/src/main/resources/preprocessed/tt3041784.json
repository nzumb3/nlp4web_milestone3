{"title":"Nepravdepodobná romance","plot":"Luisa and Erika are prototypes of young women who plunge into relationships with the \"wrong\" men. Luisa (Berenika Kohoutová) wants to become an actress, which upsets her husband Igor to no end. Erika (Alzbeta Pazoutová) is trying to work as much as possible so that she can afford to study and thereby achieve a better outlook on life, but she unfortunately runs up against a boss who doesn't have the best intentions with her. Ultimately Luisa's husband demonstratively commits suicide. Erika accidentally kills her boss in self-defense... The women blame themselves for all these failures, and that has got to change. Both have to grow up and start living again. Perhaps even together.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Luisa","and","Erika","are","prototyp","of","young","women","who","plung","into","relationship","with","the","\"","wrong","\"","men",".","Luisa","(","Berenika","Kohoutová",")","want","to","becom","an","actress",",","which","upset","her","husband","Igor","to","no","end",".","Erika","(","Alzbeta","Pazoutová",")","is","tri","to","work","as","much","as","possibl","so","that","she","can","afford","to","studi","and","therebi","achiev","a","better","outlook","on","life",",","but","she","unfortun","run","up","against","a","boss","who","doe","n't","have","the","best","intent","with","her",".","Ultimat","Luisa","'s","husband","demonstr","commit","suicid",".","Erika","accident","kill","her","boss","in","self-defens","...","The","women","blame","themselv","for","all","these","failur",",","and","that","has","got","to","chang",".","Both","have","to","grow","up","and","start","live","again",".","Perhap","even","togeth","."],"lemmas":["Luisa","and","Erika","be","prototype","of","young","woman","who","plunge","into","relationship","with","the","``","wrong","''","man",".","Luisa","-lrb-","Berenika","Kohoutová","-rrb-","want","to","become","a","actress",",","which","upset","she","husband","Igor","to","no","end",".","Erika","-lrb-","Alzbeta","Pazoutová","-rrb-","be","try","to","work","as","much","as","possible","so","that","she","can","afford","to","study","and","thereby","achieve","a","better","outlook","on","life",",","but","she","unfortunately","run","up","against","a","boss","who","do","not","have","the","best","intention","with","she",".","ultimately","Luisa","'s","husband","demonstratively","commit","suicide",".","Erika","accidentally","kill","she","boss","in","self-defense","...","the","woman","blame","themselves","for","all","these","failure",",","and","that","have","get","to","change",".","both","have","to","grow","up","and","start","live","again",".","perhaps","even","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Luisa and Erika","and Erika are","Erika are prototypes","are prototypes of","prototypes of young","of young women","young women who","women who plunge","who plunge into","plunge into relationships","into relationships with","relationships with the","with the \"","the \" wrong","\" wrong \"","wrong \" men","Luisa ( Berenika","( Berenika Kohoutová","Berenika Kohoutová )","Kohoutová ) wants",") wants to","wants to become","to become an","become an actress","an actress ,","actress , which",", which upsets","which upsets her","upsets her husband","her husband Igor","husband Igor to","Igor to no","to no end","Erika ( Alzbeta","( Alzbeta Pazoutová","Alzbeta Pazoutová )","Pazoutová ) is",") is trying","is trying to","trying to work","to work as","work as much","as much as","much as possible","as possible so","possible so that","so that she","that she can","she can afford","can afford to","afford to study","to study and","study and thereby","and thereby achieve","thereby achieve a","achieve a better","a better outlook","better outlook on","outlook on life","on life ,","life , but",", but she","but she unfortunately","she unfortunately runs","unfortunately runs up","runs up against","up against a","against a boss","a boss who","boss who does","who does n't","does n't have","n't have the","have the best","the best intentions","best intentions with","intentions with her","Ultimately Luisa 's","Luisa 's husband","'s husband demonstratively","husband demonstratively commits","demonstratively commits suicide","Erika accidentally kills","accidentally kills her","kills her boss","her boss in","boss in self-defense","in self-defense ...","self-defense ...

{"title":"Public Enemies","plot":"This is the story of the last few years of the notorious bank robber John Dillinger. He loved what he did and could imagine little else that would make him happier. Living openly in 1930s Chicago, he had the run of the city with little fear of reprisals from the authorities. It's there that he meets Billie Frechette with whom he falls deeply in love. In parallel we meet Melvin Purvis, the FBI agent who would eventually track Dillinger down. The FBI was is in its early days and Director J. Edgar Hoover was keen to promote the clean cut image that so dominated the organization through his lifetime. Purvis realizes that if he is going to get Dillinger, he will have to use street tactics and imports appropriate men with police training. Dillinger is eventually betrayed by an acquaintance who tells the authorities just where to find him on a given night.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["This","is","the","stori","of","the","last","few","year","of","the","notori","bank","robber","John","Dilling",".","He","love","what","he","did","and","could","imagin","littl","els","that","would","make","him","happier",".","Live","open","in","1930s","Chicago",",","he","had","the","run","of","the","citi","with","littl","fear","of","repris","from","the","author",".","It","'s","there","that","he","meet","Billi","Frechett","with","whom","he","fall","deepli","in","love",".","In","parallel","we","meet","Melvin","Purvi",",","the","FBI","agent","who","would","eventu","track","Dilling","down",".","The","FBI","was","is","in","it","earli","day","and","Director","J.","Edgar","Hoover","was","keen","to","promot","the","clean","cut","imag","that","so","domin","the","organ","through","his","lifetim",".","Purvi","realiz","that","if","he","is","go","to","get","Dilling",",","he","will","have","to","use","street","tactic","and","import","appropri","men","with","polic","train",".","Dilling","is","eventu","betray","by","an","acquaint","who","tell","the","author","just","where","to","find","him","on","a","given","night","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","story","of","the","last","few","year","of","the","notorious","bank","robber","John","Dillinger",".","he","love","what","he","do","and","could","imagine","little","else","that","would","make","he","happier",".","live","openly","in","1930s","Chicago",",","he","have","the","run","of","the","city","with","little","fear","of","reprisal","from","the","authority",".","it","be","there","that","he","meet","Billie","Frechette","with","whom","he","fall","deeply","in","love",".","in","parallel","we","meet","Melvin","Purvis",",","the","FBI","agent","who","would","eventually","track","Dillinger","down",".","the","FBI","be","be","in","its","early","day","and","Director","J.","Edgar","Hoover","be","keen","to","promote","the","clean","cut","image","that","so","dominate","the","organization","through","he","lifetime",".","Purvis","realize","that","if","he","be","go","to","get","Dillinger",",","he","will","have","to","use","street","tactic","and","import","appropriate","man","with","police","training",".","Dillinger","be","eventually","betray","by","a","acquaintance","who","tell","the","authority","just","where","to","find","he","on","a","give","night","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is the","is the story","the story of","story of the","of the last","the last few","last few years","few years of","years of the","of the notorious","the notorious bank","notorious bank robber","bank robber John","robber John Dillinger","He loved what","loved what he","what he did","he did and","did and could","and could imagine","could imagine little","imagine little else","little else that","else that would","that would make","would make him","make him happier","Living openly in","openly in 1930s","in 1930s Chicago","1930s Chicago ,","Chicago , he",", he had","he had the","had the run","the run of","run of the","of the city","the city with","city with little","with little fear","little fear of","fear of reprisals","of reprisals from","reprisals from the","from the authorities","It 's there","'s there that","there that he","that he meets","he meets Billie","meets Billie Frechette","Billie Frechette with","Frechette with whom","with whom he","whom he falls","he falls deeply","falls deeply in","deeply in love","In parallel we","parallel we meet","we meet Melvin","meet Melvin Purvis","Melvin Purvis ,","Purvis , the",", the FBI","the FBI agent","FBI agent who","agent who would","who would eventually","would eventually track","eventually track Dillinger","track Dillinger down","The FBI was","FBI was is","was is in","is in its","in its early","its early days","early days and","days and Director","and Director J.","Director J.

{"title":"Voices of the Homeless","plot":"Voices of the Homeless is a documentary about a unique performance piece that was presented to the public in August of 2010 in Ventura, California. It brought together the stories of the homeless, told in their own words, with Jazz Improvisers who provided music intuited by the stories being told. This documentary gets up close and personal to four of the 'storytellers,' currently or previously homeless, the four musicians who played that day, and four of the audience members who experienced the show. It is filled with original, improvised music by world class jazz artists with heart and the stories of four courageous, homeless storytellers.","genres":["Documentary"," Music","

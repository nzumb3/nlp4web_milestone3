{"title":"Die Salzm√§nner von Tibet","plot":"In Tibet's Changtang region, nomads harvest salt to buy barley. A clan prepares four of its men for an annual trek to Lake Tsento, where they rake salt from shoals into piles, then into bags, and onto their yaks to return, 90-days in all. After picking an auspicious day to depart, they feast, sing, tell stories, and race horses. Women are forbidden on this sacred trip. All is ritualized: Margen cooks, Pargen prepares burnt offerings and distributes meat, Zopon cares for the caravan of 160 yaks, Bopsa bends his strong back to arduous work. To each other they speak the secret language of saltmen; they pray and observe exemplary behavior. The goddess of the lake smiles upon them.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Tibet","'s","Changtang","region",",","nomad","harvest","salt","to","buy","barley",".","A","clan","prepar","four","of","it","men","for","an","annual","trek","to","Lake","Tsento",",","where","they","rake","salt","from","shoal","into","pile",",","then","into","bag",",","and","onto","their","yak","to","return",",","90-day","in","all",".","After","pick","an","auspici","day","to","depart",",","they","feast",",","sing",",","tell","stori",",","and","race","hors",".","Women","are","forbidden","on","this","sacr","trip",".","All","is","ritual",":","Margen","cook",",","Pargen","prepar","burnt","offer","and","distribut","meat",",","Zopon","care","for","the","caravan","of","160","yak",",","Bopsa","bend","his","strong","back","to","arduous","work",".","To","each","other","they","speak","the","secret","languag","of","saltmen",";","they","pray","and","observ","exemplari","behavior",".","The","goddess","of","the","lake","smile","upon","them","."],"lemmas":["in","Tibet","'s","Changtang","region",",","nomad","harvest","salt","to","buy","barley",".","a","clan","prepare","four","of","its","man","for","a","annual","trek","to","Lake","Tsento",",","where","they","rake","salt","from","shoal","into","pile",",","then","into","bags",",","and","onto","they","yak","to","return",",","90-days","in","all",".","after","pick","a","auspicious","day","to","depart",",","they","feast",",","sing",",","tell","story",",","and","race","horse",".","woman","be","forbid","on","this","sacred","trip",".","all","be","ritualized",":","Margen","cook",",","Pargen","prepare","burnt","offering","and","distribute","meat",",","Zopon","care","for","the","caravan","of","160","yak",",","Bopsa","bend","he","strong","back","to","arduous","work",".","to","each","other","they","speak","the","secret","language","of","saltmen",";","they","pray","and","observe","exemplary","behavior",".","the","goddess","of","the","lake","smile","upon","they","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Tibet 's","Tibet 's Changtang","'s Changtang region","Changtang region ,","region , nomads",", nomads harvest","nomads harvest salt","harvest salt to","salt to buy","to buy barley","A clan prepares","clan prepares four","prepares four of","four of its","of its men","its men for","men for an","for an annual","an annual trek","annual trek to","trek to Lake","to Lake Tsento","Lake Tsento ,","Tsento , where",", where they","where they rake","they rake salt","rake salt from","salt from shoals","from shoals into","shoals into piles","into piles ,","piles , then",", then into","then into bags","into bags ,","bags , and",", and onto","and onto their","onto their yaks","their yaks to","yaks to return","to return ,","return , 90-days",", 90-days in","90-days in all","After picking an","picking an auspicious","an auspicious day","auspicious day to","day to depart","to depart ,","depart , they",", they feast","they feast ,","feast , sing",", sing ,","sing , tell",", tell stories","tell stories ,","stories , and",", and race","and race horses","Women are forbidden","are forbidden on","forbidden on this","on this sacred","this sacred trip","All is ritualized","is ritualized :","ritualized : Margen",": Margen cooks","Margen cooks ,","cooks , Pargen",", Pargen prepares","Pargen prepares burnt","prepares burnt offerings","burnt offerings and","offerings and distributes","and distributes meat","distributes meat ,","meat , Zopon",", Zopon cares","Zopon cares for","cares for the","for the caravan","the caravan of","caravan of 160","of 160 yaks","160 yaks ,","yaks , Bopsa",", Bopsa bends","Bopsa bends his","bends his strong","his strong back","strong back to","back to arduous","to arduous work","To each other","each other they","other they speak","they speak the","speak the secret","the secret language","secret language of","language of saltmen","of saltmen ;","saltmen ;

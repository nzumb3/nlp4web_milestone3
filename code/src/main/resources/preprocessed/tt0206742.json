{"title":"Fast Food Fast Women","plot":"How important is the truth when falling in love? Bella is a Manhattan café waitress, about to turn 35, stuck in a long-term affair going nowhere. Paul is a widower, facing old age alone. Bella's mother sets her up with Bruno, a novelist/cabbie who likes to bed-hop and whose ex-wife expects their two children to stay with him for awhile. While Bruno learns some maturity from his young daughter, Paul answers a personals ad placed by a \"widow, 60.\" The two couples - along with one of Paul's older pals and a Jungian stripper - sort out how to initiate a relationship these days, what to do when someone you like disappoints you, and when to tell the truth.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["How","import","is","the","truth","when","fall","in","love","?","Bella","is","a","Manhattan","café","waitress",",","about","to","turn","35",",","stuck","in","a","long-term","affair","go","nowher",".","Paul","is","a","widow",",","face","old","age","alon",".","Bella","'s","mother","set","her","up","with","Bruno",",","a","novelist/cabbi","who","like","to","bed-hop","and","whose","ex-wif","expect","their","two","children","to","stay","with","him","for","awhil",".","While","Bruno","learn","some","matur","from","his","young","daughter",",","Paul","answer","a","person","ad","place","by","a","\"","widow",",","60",".","\"","The","two","coupl","-","along","with","one","of","Paul","'s","older","pal","and","a","Jungian","stripper","-","sort","out","how","to","initi","a","relationship","these","day",",","what","to","do","when","someon","you","like","disappoint","you",",","and","when","to","tell","the","truth","."],"lemmas":["how","important","be","the","truth","when","fall","in","love","?","Bella","be","a","Manhattan","café","waitress",",","about","to","turn","35",",","stick","in","a","long-term","affair","go","nowhere",".","Paul","be","a","widower",",","face","old","age","alone",".","Bella","'s","mother","set","she","up","with","Bruno",",","a","novelist/cabbie","who","like","to","bed-hop","and","whose","ex-wife","expect","they","two","child","to","stay","with","he","for","awhile",".","while","Bruno","learn","some","maturity","from","he","young","daughter",",","Paul","answer","a","personal","ad","place","by","a","``","widow",",","60",".","''","the","two","couple","-","along","with","one","of","Paul","'s","older","pal","and","a","jungian","stripper","-","sort","out","how","to","initiate","a","relationship","these","day",",","what","to","do","when","someone","you","like","disappoint","you",",","and","when","to","tell","the","truth","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["How important is","important is the","is the truth","the truth when","truth when falling","when falling in","falling in love","Bella is a","is a Manhattan","a Manhattan café","Manhattan café waitress","café waitress ,","waitress , about",", about to","about to turn","to turn 35","turn 35 ,","35 , stuck",", stuck in","stuck in a","in a long-term","a long-term affair","long-term affair going","affair going nowhere","Paul is a","is a widower","a widower ,","widower , facing",", facing old","facing old age","old age alone","Bella 's mother","'s mother sets","mother sets her","sets her up","her up with","up with Bruno","with Bruno ,","Bruno , a",", a novelist/cabbie","a novelist/cabbie who","novelist/cabbie who likes","who likes to","likes to bed-hop","to bed-hop and","bed-hop and whose","and whose ex-wife","whose ex-wife expects","ex-wife expects their","expects their two","their two children","two children to","children to stay","to stay with","stay with him","with him for","him for awhile","While Bruno learns","Bruno learns some","learns some maturity","some maturity from","maturity from his","from his young","his young daughter","young daughter ,","daughter , Paul",", Paul answers","Paul answers a","answers a personals","a personals ad","personals ad placed","ad placed by","placed by a","by a \"","a \" widow","\" widow ,","widow , 60",", 60 .","60 . \"","The two couples","two couples -","couples -

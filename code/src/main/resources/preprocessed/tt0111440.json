{"title":"Heaven's a Drag","plot":"Simon and Mark live together in London. When Mark dies of AIDS, Simon gets on with his life rather quickly - too quickly to suit Mark, whose ghost reappears to disrupt Simon's cruising, moving back into their flat to prompt Simon to experience and express feelings. Simon is adamant that feelings, especially love, are not for him. Subplots develop as Mark and Simon observe their neighbor Siobhan's love life and as Simon spends his days as a satellite-TV installer partnered with Dogger, a homophobe ignorant that Simon is gay. Is there any key that can unlock Simon's feelings and allow Mark to rest in peace?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Simon","and","Mark","live","togeth","in","London",".","When","Mark","die","of","AIDS",",","Simon","get","on","with","his","life","rather","quick","-","too","quick","to","suit","Mark",",","whose","ghost","reappear","to","disrupt","Simon","'s","cruis",",","move","back","into","their","flat","to","prompt","Simon","to","experi","and","express","feel",".","Simon","is","adam","that","feel",",","especi","love",",","are","not","for","him",".","Subplot","develop","as","Mark","and","Simon","observ","their","neighbor","Siobhan","'s","love","life","and","as","Simon","spend","his","day","as","a","satellite-TV","instal","partner","with","Dogger",",","a","homophob","ignor","that","Simon","is","gay",".","Is","there","ani","key","that","can","unlock","Simon","'s","feel","and","allow","Mark","to","rest","in","peac","?"],"lemmas":["Simon","and","Mark","live","together","in","London",".","when","Mark","die","of","AIDS",",","Simon","get","on","with","he","life","rather","quickly","-","too","quickly","to","suit","Mark",",","whose","ghost","reappear","to","disrupt","Simon","'s","cruise",",","move","back","into","they","flat","to","prompt","Simon","to","experience","and","express","feeling",".","Simon","be","adamant","that","feeling",",","especially","love",",","be","not","for","he",".","subplot","develop","as","Mark","and","Simon","observe","they","neighbor","Siobhan","'s","love","life","and","as","Simon","spend","he","day","as","a","satellite-tv","installer","partner","with","Dogger",",","a","homophobe","ignorant","that","Simon","be","gay",".","be","there","any","key","that","can","unlock","Simon","'s","feeling","and","allow","Mark","to","rest","in","peace","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Simon and Mark","and Mark live","Mark live together","live together in","together in London","When Mark dies","Mark dies of","dies of AIDS","of AIDS ,","AIDS , Simon",", Simon gets","Simon gets on","gets on with","on with his","with his life","his life rather","life rather quickly","rather quickly -","quickly -

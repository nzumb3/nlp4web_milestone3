The school takes in troubled people and teaches them basic manners. A 12-year-old Song-Yi is a teacher at the school, known for her strictness. One day, Doo-Yul appears at the school. His life turned upside when he fell into a coma. During the time he was comatose, Doo-Yul learned that his wife died while giving birth to a girl whom he believed was adopted and sent overseas. In reality, Song-Yi, the 12-year-old instructor at the school is his daughter. Song-Yi learns that Doo-Yul is her father, but Doo-Yul still doesn't know.

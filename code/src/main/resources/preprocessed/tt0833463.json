Years later, Gauri has blossomed into a beautiful young woman, and has fallen in love with wealthy Anand Deshmukh. Sushila finds out, disapproves at first, but relents when Gauri threatens to elope, and visits the Deshmukhs to fix this alliance. Things do not go as planned as the later refuse to give their permission as there is no male parent involved. Sushila's attempts, with Anand and Gauri's help, to locate the biological father results in nothing but hilarious chaos - with no guarantee that they will ever be able to locate him.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Reject","and","shun","by","35","prospect","groom","as","well","as","her","veri","own","famili","respect",",","overweight","Mumbai-bas","Sushila","Sawant","move","out",",","find","a","job","with","Hindustan","Bank","and","start","to","live","independ",".","When","loneli","overtak","her",",","she","visit","Dr.","Patki","'s","dispensari",",","and","through","an","unknown","sperm","donor",",","becom","pregnant",";","subsequ","give","birth","to","a","babi","girl",",","Gauri","and","ensur","she","get","a","good","educ",".","Year","later",",","Gauri","has","blossom","into","a","beauti","young","woman",",","and","has","fallen","in","love","with","wealthi","Anand","Deshmukh",".","Sushila","find","out",",","disapprov","at","first",",","but","relent","when","Gauri","threaten","to","elop",",","and","visit","the","Deshmukh","to","fix","this","allianc",".","Thing","do","not","go","as","plan","as","the","later","refus","to","give","their","permiss","as","there","is","no","male","parent","involv",".","Sushila","'s","attempt",",","with","Anand","and","Gauri","'s","help",",","to","locat","the","biolog","father","result","in","noth","but","hilari","chao","-","with","no","guarante","that","they","will","ever","be","abl","to","locat","him","."],"lemmas":["reject","and","shun","by","35","prospective","groom","as","well","as","she","very","own","family","respectively",",","overweight","mumbai-based","Sushila","Sawant","move","out",",","find","a","job","with","Hindustan","Bank","and","start","to","live","independently",".","when","loneliness","overtake","she",",","she","visit","Dr.","Patki","'s","dispensary",",","and","through","a","unknown","sperm","donor",",","become","pregnant",";","subsequently","give","birth","to","a","baby","girl",",","Gauri","and","ensure","she","get","a","good","education",".","year","later",",","Gauri","have","blossom","into","a","beautiful","young","woman",",","and","have","fall","in","love","with","wealthy","Anand","Deshmukh",".","Sushila","find","out",",","disapprove","at","first",",","but","relent","when","Gauri","threaten","to","elope",",","and","visit","the","Deshmukhs","to","fix","this","alliance",".","thing","do","not","go","as","plan","as","the","later","refuse","to","give","they","permission","as","there","be","no","male","parent","involve",".","Sushila","'s","attempt",",","with","Anand","and","Gauri","'s","help",",","to","locate","the","biological","father","result","in","nothing","but","hilarious","chaos","-","with","no","guarantee","that","they","will","ever","be","able","to","locate","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Rejected and shunned","and shunned by","shunned by 35","by 35 prospective","35 prospective grooms","prospective grooms as","grooms as well","as well as","well as her","as her very","her very own","very own family","own family respectively","family respectively ,","respectively , overweight",", overweight Mumbai-based","overweight Mumbai-based Sushila","Mumbai-based Sushila Sawant","Sushila Sawant moves","Sawant moves out","moves out ,","out , finds",", finds a","finds a job","a job with","job with Hindustan","with Hindustan Bank","Hindustan Bank and","Bank and starts","and starts to","starts to live","to live independently","When loneliness overtakes","loneliness overtakes her","overtakes her ,","her , she",", she visits","she visits Dr.","visits Dr. Patki","Dr. Patki 's","Patki 's dispensary","'s dispensary ,","dispensary , and",", and through","and through an","through an unknown","an unknown sperm","unknown sperm donor","sperm donor ,","donor , becomes",", becomes pregnant","becomes pregnant ;","pregnant ;

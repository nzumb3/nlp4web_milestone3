{"title":"A Place in Heaven","plot":"A young officer returns to his base after a daring mission. The cook's assistant, a religious Holocaust survivor, is envious of him. He believes that there is a place in heaven reserved for the brave officer who endangers his life for the sake of his Jewish brethren. The officer, in the spirit of the Zionist ethos, is secular and a non-believer. At the moment, he is so hungry that, for a plate of shaksuka, he is prepared to sign a contract transferring his secured place in heaven to the cook. Some forty years later, the present time of the movie, the tables have turned - the officer, now a retired general, is on his death bed in the hospital. His son who, to his father's horror, has found religion, is in a race against time. Before his father dies, he has to find that cook's assistant who, forty years earlier, bought his place in heaven. If and when he finds him, the son has to nullify the contract. If he doesn't, his father will go to hell.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","young","offic","return","to","his","base","after","a","dare","mission",".","The","cook","'s","assist",",","a","religi","Holocaust","survivor",",","is","envious","of","him",".","He","believ","that","there","is","a","place","in","heaven","reserv","for","the","brave","offic","who","endang","his","life","for","the","sake","of","his","Jewish","brethren",".","The","offic",",","in","the","spirit","of","the","Zionist","etho",",","is","secular","and","a","non-believ",".","At","the","moment",",","he","is","so","hungri","that",",","for","a","plate","of","shaksuka",",","he","is","prepar","to","sign","a","contract","transfer","his","secur","place","in","heaven","to","the","cook",".","Some","forti","year","later",",","the","present","time","of","the","movi",",","the","tabl","have","turn","-","the","offic",",","now","a","retir","general",",","is","on","his","death","bed","in","the","hospit",".","His","son","who",",","to","his","father","'s","horror",",","has","found","religion",",","is","in","a","race","against","time",".","Befor","his","father","die",",","he","has","to","find","that","cook","'s","assist","who",",","forti","year","earlier",",","bought","his","place","in","heaven",".","If","and","when","he","find","him",",","the","son","has","to","nullifi","the","contract",".","If","he","doe","n't",",","his","father","will","go","to","hell","."],"lemmas":["a","young","officer","return","to","he","base","after","a","daring","mission",".","the","cook","'s","assistant",",","a","religious","Holocaust","survivor",",","be","envious","of","he",".","he","believe","that","there","be","a","place","in","heaven","reserve","for","the","brave","officer","who","endanger","he","life","for","the","sake","of","he","jewish","brethren",".","the","officer",",","in","the","spirit","of","the","Zionist","ethos",",","be","secular","and","a","non-believer",".","at","the","moment",",","he","be","so","hungry","that",",","for","a","plate","of","shaksuka",",","he","be","prepare","to","sign","a","contract","transfer","he","secured","place","in","heaven","to","the","cook",".","some","forty","year","later",",","the","present","time","of","the","movie",",","the","table","have","turn","-","the","officer",",","now","a","retired","general",",","be","on","he","death","bed","in","the","hospital",".","he","son","who",",","to","he","father","'s","horror",",","have","find","religion",",","be","in","a","race","against","time",".","before","he","father","die",",","he","have","to","find","that","cook","'s","assistant","who",",","forty","year","earlier",",","buy","he","place","in","heaven",".","if","and","when","he","find","he",",","the","son","have","to","nullify","the","contract",".","if","he","do","not",",","he","father","will","go","to","hell","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A young officer","young officer returns","officer returns to","returns to his","to his base","his base after","base after a","after a daring","a daring mission","The cook 's","cook 's assistant","'s assistant ,","assistant , a",", a religious","a religious Holocaust","religious Holocaust survivor","Holocaust survivor ,","survivor , is",", is envious","is envious of","envious of him","He believes that","believes that there","that there is","there is a","is a place","a place in","place in heaven","in heaven reserved","heaven reserved for","reserved for the","for the brave","the brave officer","brave officer who","officer who endangers","who endangers his","endangers his life","his life for","life for the","for the sake","the sake of","sake of his","of his Jewish","his Jewish brethren","The officer ,","officer , in",", in the","in the spirit","the spirit of","spirit of the","of the Zionist","the Zionist ethos","Zionist ethos ,","ethos , is",", is secular","is secular and","secular and a","and a non-believer","At the moment","the moment ,","moment , he",", he is","he is so","is so hungry","so hungry that","hungry that ,","that , for",", for a","for a plate","a plate of","plate of shaksuka","of shaksuka ,","shaksuka , he",", he is","he is prepared","is prepared to","prepared to sign","to sign a","sign a contract","a contract transferring","contract transferring his","transferring his secured","his secured place","secured place in","place in heaven","in heaven to","heaven to the","to the cook","Some forty years","forty years later","years later ,","later , the",", the present","the present time","present time of","time of the","of the movie","the movie ,","movie , the",", the tables","the tables have","tables have turned","have turned -","turned -

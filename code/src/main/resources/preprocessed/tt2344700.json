{"title":"The Epic Adventures of Lakegirl","plot":"Two orphaned children with out-of-this-world abilities are left to grow up in Gimli, Manitoba to protect Lake Winnipeg from an intergalactic heist. However, one of them is not told of her abilities, leading university student Carlina Hanley to receive them without knowing even how to use them. The other one, Tyson Johnson has been pressured since he was a child to learn how to use them properly to defend Carlina, leading him down a dark path of substance abuse. This makes waging their defense a challenge.","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","orphan","children","with","out-of-this-world","abil","are","left","to","grow","up","in","Gim",",","Manitoba","to","protect","Lake","Winnipeg","from","an","intergalact","heist",".","Howev",",","one","of","them","is","not","told","of","her","abil",",","lead","univers","student","Carlina","Hanley","to","receiv","them","without","know","even","how","to","use","them",".","The","other","one",",","Tyson","Johnson","has","been","pressur","sinc","he","was","a","child","to","learn","how","to","use","them","proper","to","defend","Carlina",",","lead","him","down","a","dark","path","of","substanc","abus",".","This","make","wage","their","defens","a","challeng","."],"lemmas":["two","orphan","child","with","out-of-this-world","ability","be","leave","to","grow","up","in","Gimli",",","Manitoba","to","protect","Lake","Winnipeg","from","a","intergalactic","heist",".","however",",","one","of","they","be","not","tell","of","she","ability",",","lead","university","student","Carlina","Hanley","to","receive","they","without","know","even","how","to","use","they",".","the","other","one",",","Tyson","Johnson","have","be","pressure","since","he","be","a","child","to","learn","how","to","use","they","properly","to","defend","Carlina",",","lead","he","down","a","dark","path","of","substance","abuse",".","this","make","wage","they","defense","a","challenge","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Two orphaned children","orphaned children with","children with out-of-this-world","with out-of-this-world abilities","out-of-this-world abilities are","abilities are left","are left to","left to grow","to grow up","grow up in","up in Gimli","in Gimli ,","Gimli , Manitoba",", Manitoba to","Manitoba to protect","to protect Lake","protect Lake Winnipeg","Lake Winnipeg from","Winnipeg from an","from an intergalactic","an intergalactic heist","However , one",", one of","one of them","of them is","them is not","is not told","not told of","told of her","of her abilities","her abilities ,","abilities , leading",", leading university","leading university student","university student Carlina","student Carlina Hanley","Carlina Hanley to","Hanley to receive","to receive them","receive them without","them without knowing","without knowing even","knowing even how","even how to","how to use","to use them","The other one","other one ,","one , Tyson",", Tyson Johnson","Tyson Johnson has","Johnson has been","has been pressured","been pressured since","pressured since he","since he was","he was a","was a child","a child to","child to learn","to learn how","learn how to","how to use","to use them","use them properly","them properly to","properly to defend","to defend Carlina","defend Carlina ,","Carlina , leading",", leading him","leading him down","him down a","down a dark","a dark path","dark path of","path of substance","of substance abuse","This makes waging","makes waging their","waging their defense","their defense a","defense a challenge"],"2grams":["Two orphaned","orphaned children","children with","with out-of-this-world","out-of-this-world abilities","abilities are","are left","left to","to grow","grow up","up in","in Gimli","Gimli ,",", Manitoba","Manitoba to","to protect","protect Lake","Lake Winnipeg","Winnipeg from","from an","an intergalactic","intergalactic heist","However ,",", one","one of","of them","them is","is not","not told","told of","of her","her abilities","abilities ,",", leading","leading university","university student","student Carlina","Carlina Hanley","Hanley to","to receive","receive them","them without","without knowing","knowing even","even how","how to","to use","use them","The other","other one","one ,",", Tyson","Tyson Johnson","Johnson has","has been","been pressured","pressured since","since he","he was","was a","a child","child to","to learn","learn how","how to","to use","use them","them properly","properly to","to defend","defend Carlina","Carlina ,",", leading","leading him","him down","down a","a dark","dark path","path of","of substance","substance abuse","This makes","makes waging","waging their","their defense","defense a","a challenge"]}

{"title":"Black Wings","plot":"For early aviators, conquering the forces of gravity was a daunting challenge. But black aviators had an additional challenge - to conquer the forces of racism. Meet the men and women of color who took to the skies throughout the 20th Century and helped prove to a segregated nation that skin color didn't determine skill level. From biplanes to commercial jets and from barnstormers to war fighters, meet the path-breaking pilots who opened the skies for all.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["For","earli","aviat",",","conquer","the","forc","of","graviti","was","a","daunt","challeng",".","But","black","aviat","had","an","addit","challeng","-","to","conquer","the","forc","of","racism",".","Meet","the","men","and","women","of","color","who","took","to","the","sky","throughout","the","20th","Centuri","and","help","prove","to","a","segreg","nation","that","skin","color","did","n't","determin","skill","level",".","From","biplan","to","commerci","jet","and","from","barnstorm","to","war","fighter",",","meet","the","path-break","pilot","who","open","the","sky","for","all","."],"lemmas":["for","early","aviator",",","conquer","the","force","of","gravity","be","a","daunting","challenge",".","but","black","aviator","have","a","additional","challenge","-","to","conquer","the","force","of","racism",".","meet","the","man","and","woman","of","color","who","take","to","the","sky","throughout","the","20th","Century","and","help","prove","to","a","segregate","nation","that","skin","color","do","not","determine","skill","level",".","from","biplane","to","commercial","jet","and","from","barnstormer","to","war","fighter",",","meet","the","path-breaking","pilot","who","open","the","sky","for","all","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["For early aviators","early aviators ,","aviators , conquering",", conquering the","conquering the forces","the forces of","forces of gravity","of gravity was","gravity was a","was a daunting","a daunting challenge","But black aviators","black aviators had","aviators had an","had an additional","an additional challenge","additional challenge -","challenge - to","- to conquer","to conquer the","conquer the forces","the forces of","forces of racism","Meet the men","the men and","men and women","and women of","women of color","of color who","color who took","who took to","took to the","to the skies","the skies throughout","skies throughout the","throughout the 20th","the 20th Century","20th Century and","Century and helped","and helped prove","helped prove to","prove to a","to a segregated","a segregated nation","segregated nation that","nation that skin","that skin color","skin color did","color did n't","did n't determine","n't determine skill","determine skill level","From biplanes to","biplanes to commercial","to commercial jets","commercial jets and","jets and from","and from barnstormers","from barnstormers to","barnstormers to war","to war fighters","war fighters ,","fighters , meet",", meet the","meet the path-breaking","the path-breaking pilots","path-breaking pilots who","pilots who opened","who opened the","opened the skies","the skies for","skies for all"],"2grams":["For early","early aviators","aviators ,",", conquering","conquering the","the forces","forces of","of gravity","gravity was","was a","a daunting","daunting challenge","But black","black aviators","aviators had","had an","an additional","additional challenge","challenge -","- to","to conquer","conquer the","the forces","forces of","of racism","Meet the","the men","men and","and women","women of","of color","color who","who took","took to","to the","the skies","skies throughout","throughout the","the 20th","20th Century","Century and","and helped","helped prove","prove to","to a","a segregated","segregated nation","nation that","that skin","skin color","color did","did n't","n't determine","determine skill","skill level","From biplanes","biplanes to","to commercial","commercial jets","jets and","and from","from barnstormers","barnstormers to","to war","war fighters","fighters ,",", meet","meet the","the path-breaking","path-breaking pilots","pilots who","who opened","opened the","the skies","skies for","for all"]}

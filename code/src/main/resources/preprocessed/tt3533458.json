{"title":"Lion Guardians","plot":"Made for the Lion Guardians program this film is to help stop the rapid decline of lions. Just over 60 years ago there were estimated to be more than half a million lions in Africa. Today, fewer than 30,000 remain. Lion Guardians is a unique approach that relies on and preserves the cultural traditions of pastoralist communities in Africa, while at the same time actively engaging young warriors in protecting lions rather than killing them. This film is shown to communities that live with lions to introduce them to the Lion Guardians program, explain how it works, and to encourage them to participate and save their lion populations.","genres":["Adventure","

{"title":"Far Away Is Home","plot":"Clely Quaiat leaves Trieste in the 1950s. She is a little girl, and with her family she embarks to Australia. She lives in Adelaide, but she is a lively, restless and curious girl, so, very soon, she decides to go, and look for those fantasies she had been dreaming of for years. She finds them in a very remote place, a place where it is prohibited to enter: the Northern Territories, aboriginal land... She decides to live there, with her two children. One day she meets Terry Yumbulul the chief's son of that aboriginal land, and for Clely a new life begins. She has been living in the island of Wigram for many years. No fresh water, nor electricity, in a house that Terry and herself built on a white sandy beach, with snakes and crocodiles always in ambush. That island becomes her real home, but at the same time Trieste is always in her heart. A Triestine woman in an aboriginal land, this is the story of Clely.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Cleli","Quaiat","leav","Triest","in","the","1950s",".","She","is","a","littl","girl",",","and","with","her","famili","she","embark","to","Australia",".","She","live","in","Adelaid",",","but","she","is","a","live",",","restless","and","curious","girl",",","so",",","veri","soon",",","she","decid","to","go",",","and","look","for","those","fantasi","she","had","been","dream","of","for","year",".","She","find","them","in","a","veri","remot","place",",","a","place","where","it","is","prohibit","to","enter",":","the","Northern","Territori",",","aborigin","land","...","She","decid","to","live","there",",","with","her","two","children",".","One","day","she","meet","Terri","Yumbulul","the","chief","'s","son","of","that","aborigin","land",",","and","for","Cleli","a","new","life","begin",".","She","has","been","live","in","the","island","of","Wigram","for","mani","year",".","No","fresh","water",",","nor","electr",",","in","a","hous","that","Terri","and","herself","built","on","a","white","sandi","beach",",","with","snake","and","crocodil","alway","in","ambush",".","That","island","becom","her","real","home",",","but","at","the","same","time","Triest","is","alway","in","her","heart",".","A","Triestin","woman","in","an","aborigin","land",",","this","is","the","stori","of","Cleli","."],"lemmas":["Clely","Quaiat","leave","Trieste","in","the","1950s",".","she","be","a","little","girl",",","and","with","she","family","she","embark","to","Australia",".","she","live","in","Adelaide",",","but","she","be","a","lively",",","restless","and","curious","girl",",","so",",","very","soon",",","she","decide","to","go",",","and","look","for","those","fantasy","she","have","be","dream","of","for","year",".","she","find","they","in","a","very","remote","place",",","a","place","where","it","be","prohibit","to","enter",":","the","Northern","Territories",",","aboriginal","land","...","she","decide","to","live","there",",","with","she","two","child",".","one","day","she","meet","Terry","Yumbulul","the","chief","'s","son","of","that","aboriginal","land",",","and","for","Clely","a","new","life","begin",".","she","have","be","live","in","the","island","of","Wigram","for","many","year",".","no","fresh","water",",","nor","electricity",",","in","a","house","that","Terry","and","herself","build","on","a","white","sandy","beach",",","with","snake","and","crocodile","always","in","ambush",".","that","island","become","she","real","home",",","but","at","the","same","time","Trieste","be","always","in","she","heart",".","a","triestine","woman","in","a","aboriginal","land",",","this","be","the","story","of","Clely","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Clely Quaiat leaves","Quaiat leaves Trieste","leaves Trieste in","Trieste in the","in the 1950s","She is a","is a little","a little girl","little girl ,","girl , and",", and with","and with her","with her family","her family she","family she embarks","she embarks to","embarks to Australia","She lives in","lives in Adelaide","in Adelaide ,","Adelaide , but",", but she","but she is","she is a","is a lively","a lively ,","lively , restless",", restless and","restless and curious","and curious girl","curious girl ,","girl , so",", so ,","so , very",", very soon","very soon ,","soon , she",", she decides","she decides to","decides to go","to go ,","go , and",", and look","and look for","look for those","for those fantasies","those fantasies she","fantasies she had","she had been","had been dreaming","been dreaming of","dreaming of for","of for years","She finds them","finds them in","them in a","in a very","a very remote","very remote place","remote place ,","place , a",", a place","a place where","place where it","where it is","it is prohibited","is prohibited to","prohibited to enter","to enter :","enter : the",": the Northern","the Northern Territories","Northern Territories ,","Territories , aboriginal",", aboriginal land","aboriginal land ...","land ...

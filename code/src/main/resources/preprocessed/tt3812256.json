{"title":"The Road to Little Rock","plot":"This is the courageous story of one judge and nine teenagers who demonstrated enduring positive human qualities of courage, honor, determination, and responsibility. In 1957, nine African-American teenagers sought enrollment at an all-white high school in Little Rock, Arkansas. This untold story features never-before-seen interviews with three members of the Little Rock Nine and Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer. It blends current interviews with archival footage to tell the story of the integration of Central High School. Federal Judge Ronald Davies, from Fargo, North Dakota, followed the law, ignored political pressure and required the school district in Little Rock to integrate. His ruling provided great urgency for the desegregation of public schools and the course of the civil rights movement in America.","genres":["Documentary","

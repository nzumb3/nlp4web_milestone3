{"title":"First Knight","plot":"Lancelot lives by the sword. In fact, they're next door neighbours, so teaming up to fight for money comes pretty naturally. Lady Guinevere, on her way to marry King Arthur is ambushed by the evil Sir Malagant. Fortunately Lancelot is lurking nearby and he rescues his future queen. They fall in love, but Guinevere still fancies the idea of wearing a crown, so she honours her promise to Arthur. Can Lady Guinevere remain faithful, or will this Pretty Woman become a lady of the knight?","genres":["Action"," Romance"," Adventure"],"stems":["Lancelot","live","by","the","sword",".","In","fact",",","they","re","next","door","neighbour",",","so","team","up","to","fight","for","money","come","pretti","natur",".","Ladi","Guinever",",","on","her","way","to","marri","King","Arthur","is","ambush","by","the","evil","Sir","Malag",".","Fortun","Lancelot","is","lurk","nearbi","and","he","rescu","his","futur","queen",".","They","fall","in","love",",","but","Guinever","still","fanci","the","idea","of","wear","a","crown",",","so","she","honour","her","promis","to","Arthur",".","Can","Ladi","Guinever","remain","faith",",","or","will","this","Pretti","Woman","becom","a","ladi","of","the","knight","?"],"lemmas":["Lancelot","live","by","the","sword",".","in","fact",",","they","be","next","door","neighbour",",","so","team","up","to","fight","for","money","come","pretty","naturally",".","Lady","Guinevere",",","on","she","way","to","marry","King","Arthur","be","ambush","by","the","evil","Sir","Malagant",".","fortunately","Lancelot","be","lurk","nearby","and","he","rescue","he","future","queen",".","they","fall","in","love",",","but","Guinevere","still","fancy","the","idea","of","wear","a","crown",",","so","she","honour","she","promise","to","Arthur",".","can","Lady","Guinevere","remain","faithful",",","or","will","this","Pretty","Woman","become","a","lady","of","the","knight","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lancelot lives by","lives by the","by the sword","In fact ,","fact , they",", they 're","they 're next","'re next door","next door neighbours","door neighbours ,","neighbours , so",", so teaming","so teaming up","teaming up to","up to fight","to fight for","fight for money","for money comes","money comes pretty","comes pretty naturally","Lady Guinevere ,","Guinevere , on",", on her","on her way","her way to","way to marry","to marry King","marry King Arthur","King Arthur is","Arthur is ambushed","is ambushed by","ambushed by the","by the evil","the evil Sir","evil Sir Malagant","Fortunately Lancelot is","Lancelot is lurking","is lurking nearby","lurking nearby and","nearby and he","and he rescues","he rescues his","rescues his future","his future queen","They fall in","fall in love","in love ,","love , but",", but Guinevere","but Guinevere still","Guinevere still fancies","still fancies the","fancies the idea","the idea of","idea of wearing","of wearing a","wearing a crown","a crown ,","crown , so",", so she","so she honours","she honours her","honours her promise","her promise to","promise to Arthur","Can Lady Guinevere","Lady Guinevere remain","Guinevere remain faithful","remain faithful ,","faithful , or",", or will","or will this","will this Pretty","this Pretty Woman","Pretty Woman become","Woman become a","become a lady","a lady of","lady of the","of the knight"],"2grams":["Lancelot lives","lives by","by the","the sword","In fact","fact ,",", they","they 're","'re next","next door","door neighbours","neighbours ,",", so","so teaming","teaming up","up to","to fight","fight for","for money","money comes","comes pretty","pretty naturally","Lady Guinevere","Guinevere ,",", on","on her","her way","way to","to marry","marry King","King Arthur","Arthur is","is ambushed","ambushed by","by the","the evil","evil Sir","Sir Malagant","Fortunately Lancelot","Lancelot is","is lurking","lurking nearby","nearby and","and he","he rescues","rescues his","his future","future queen","They fall","fall in","in love","love ,",", but","but Guinevere","Guinevere still","still fancies","fancies the","the idea","idea of","of wearing","wearing a","a crown","crown ,",", so","so she","she honours","honours her","her promise","promise to","to Arthur","Can Lady","Lady Guinevere","Guinevere remain","remain faithful","faithful ,",", or","or will","will this","this Pretty","Pretty Woman","Woman become","become a","a lady","lady of","of the","the knight"]}

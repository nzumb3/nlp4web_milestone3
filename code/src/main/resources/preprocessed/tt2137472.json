{"title":"We Will Be Free","plot":"The documentary explains the Canadian history of colonization through the eyes of the colonized and not the colonizers. The film expresses and shows the outcome of a history of oppression by a dominant society over a minority. Although a lot seems to be destroyed or lost the film shows too how strong individuals and groups are taking on leadership and stand up to help their people to find their own way again. This rebirth of culture is happening in a society controlled and shaped by a westernized capitalistic system, a system so foreign to the old ways which are based on the idea of sharing and having respect for mother earth, the foundation of life to all human beings.","genres":["Biography"," History","

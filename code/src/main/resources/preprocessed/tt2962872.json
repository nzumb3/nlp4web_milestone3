{"title":"Break Loose","plot":"A shared army past and a shared ideal of serving their country bring four friends together. They go on to serve in the OMON, the Russian Special Police Squad, leading honest lives in the turbulent present, and dreaming of a better future. The young tend to be idealistic. The protagonist (Alexey Mantsigyn) thinks: \"I am the sovereign's watchdog, I will tear anyone to pieces with my teeth, there is power and fury in me, honesty in my eyes, and my friends are by my side.\" He walks up to the mirror but instead of his eyes he sees empty sockets, deadly anguish instead of love, and his own betrayal multiplied by four instead of his friends. Fate comes in the shape of a femme fatale (Vilma Kutavichute), leaving them no chance. Or almost none. In a small two-door car, wounded, with broken joints, barely alive, the four friends make their way around their town or their own dream. With nothing but a prayer to keep them going. Amid the white Russian snow.","genres":["Action"," Drama","

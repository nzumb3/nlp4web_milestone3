{"title":"Bannister: Everest on the Track","plot":"Our film is as much an historical study of Britain's psychological, if not almost physical, need for something - anything - to erase the woes of World War II as it is a fresh look at the quest for the first sub-4:00 mile, the heretofore deemed physically impossible. Before the war, Britain had bloomed best in its Sporting Tradition, but the amateur accolades leading to Olympic accomplishments were blown off the podiums in the 1952 Helsinki Games. Roger Bannister was the epitome of that disappearing scholar-athlete ideal. Can the lunchtime-trained runner immersed in his medical school studies inject the booster shot into Britain's flagging but still flickering morale?","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"," History"],"stems":["Our","film","is","as","much","an","histor","studi","of","Britain","'s","psycholog",",","if","not","almost","physic",",","need","for","someth","-","anyth","-","to","eras","the","woe","of","World","War","II","as","it","is","a","fresh","look","at","the","quest","for","the","first","sub-4",":00","mile",",","the","heretofor","deem","physic","imposs",".","Befor","the","war",",","Britain","had","bloom","best","in","it","Sport","Tradit",",","but","the","amateur","accolad","lead","to","Olympic","accomplish","were","blown","off","the","podium","in","the","1952","Helsinki","Game",".","Roger","Bannist","was","the","epitom","of","that","disappear","scholar-athlet","ideal",".","Can","the","lunchtime-train","runner","immers","in","his","medic","school","studi","inject","the","booster","shot","into","Britain","'s","flag","but","still","flicker","moral","?"],"lemmas":["we","film","be","as","much","a","historical","study","of","Britain","'s","psychological",",","if","not","almost","physical",",","need","for","something","-","anything","-","to","erase","the","woe","of","World","War","II","as","it","be","a","fresh","look","at","the","quest","for","the","first","sub-4",":00","mile",",","the","heretofore","deem","physically","impossible",".","before","the","war",",","Britain","have","bloom","best","in","its","Sporting","tradition",",","but","the","amateur","accolade","lead","to","Olympic","accomplishment","be","blow","off","the","podium","in","the","1952","Helsinki","Games",".","Roger","Bannister","be","the","epitome","of","that","disappear","scholar-athlete","ideal",".","can","the","lunchtime-trained","runner","immerse","in","he","medical","school","study","inject","the","booster","shot","into","Britain","'s","flagging","but","still","flicker","morale","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Our film is","film is as","is as much","as much an","much an historical","an historical study","historical study of","study of Britain","of Britain 's","Britain 's psychological","'s psychological ,","psychological , if",", if not","if not almost","not almost physical","almost physical ,","physical , need",", need for","need for something","for something -","something -

As told by the soldiers on the ground, Sententia: Inside Afghanistan gives candid insight to the event that shaped their deployment and themselves in Australia's longest and most recent conflict.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["Afghanistan",",","2011",".","With","the","war","in","it","tenth","year",",","cavalri","troop","V75","was","deploy","to","Uruzgan","Provinc","as","part","of","Mentor","Task","Forc","3",".","Initial",",","their","job","was","to","escort","resuppli","convoy","to","isol","patrol","base",".","Howev",",","they","soon","found","themselv","conduct","counter","insurg","oper","against","an","elus","enemi",".","As","told","by","the","soldier","on","the","ground",",","Sententia",":","Inside","Afghanistan","give","candid","insight","to","the","event","that","shape","their","deploy","and","themselv","in","Australia","'s","longest","and","most","recent","conflict","."],"lemmas":["Afghanistan",",","2011",".","with","the","war","in","its","tenth","year",",","cavalry","troop","v75","be","deploy","to","Uruzgan","Province","as","part","of","Mentoring","Task","Force","3",".","initially",",","they","job","be","to","escort","resupply","convoy","to","isolate","patrol","basis",".","however",",","they","soon","find","themselves","conduct","counter","insurgency","operation","against","a","elusive","enemy",".","as","tell","by","the","soldier","on","the","ground",",","Sententia",":","Inside","Afghanistan","give","candid","insight","to","the","event","that","shape","they","deployment","and","themselves","in","Australia","'s","longest","and","most","recent","conflict","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Afghanistan , 2011","With the war","the war in","war in its","in its tenth","its tenth year","tenth year ,","year , cavalry",", cavalry troop","cavalry troop V75","troop V75 was","V75 was deployed","was deployed to","deployed to Uruzgan","to Uruzgan Province","Uruzgan Province as","Province as part","as part of","part of Mentoring","of Mentoring Task","Mentoring Task Force","Task Force 3","Initially , their",", their job","their job was","job was to","was to escort","to escort resupply","escort resupply convoys","resupply convoys to","convoys to isolated","to isolated patrol","isolated patrol bases","However , they",", they soon","they soon found","soon found themselves","found themselves conducting","themselves conducting counter","conducting counter insurgency","counter insurgency operations","insurgency operations against","operations against an","against an elusive","an elusive enemy","As told by","told by the","by the soldiers","the soldiers on","soldiers on the","on the ground","the ground ,","ground , Sententia",", Sententia :","Sententia : Inside",": Inside Afghanistan","Inside Afghanistan gives","Afghanistan gives candid","gives candid insight","candid insight to","insight to the","to the event","the event that","event that shaped","that shaped their","shaped their deployment","their deployment and","deployment and themselves","and themselves in","themselves in Australia","in Australia 's","Australia 's longest","'s longest and","longest and most","and most recent","most recent conflict"],"2grams":["Afghanistan ,",", 2011","With the","the war","war in","in its","its tenth","tenth year","year ,",", cavalry","cavalry troop","troop V75","V75 was","was deployed","deployed to","to Uruzgan","Uruzgan Province","Province as","as part","part of","of Mentoring","Mentoring Task","Task Force","Force 3","Initially ,",", their","their job","job was","was to","to escort","escort resupply","resupply convoys","convoys to","to isolated","isolated patrol","patrol bases","However ,",", they","they soon","soon found","found themselves","themselves conducting","conducting counter","counter insurgency","insurgency operations","operations against","against an","an elusive","elusive enemy","As told","told by","by the","the soldiers","soldiers on","on the","the ground","ground ,",", Sententia","Sententia :",": Inside","Inside Afghanistan","Afghanistan gives","gives candid","candid insight","insight to","to the","the event","event that","that shaped","shaped their","their deployment","deployment and","and themselves","themselves in","in Australia","Australia 's","'s longest","longest and","and most","most recent","recent conflict"]}

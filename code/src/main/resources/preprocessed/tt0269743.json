{"title":"Barking Dogs Never Bite","plot":"The disconnections of urban life. Yun-ju is diffident, almost without affect; his wife is pregnant, and he's wonders if he should bribe the dean to secure a professorship. He's also bothered by a yapping dog that disturbs him in the large block of flats where he lives. Hyeon-nam is equally disengaged; she's a bookkeeper at same block of flats, animated only when she learns of a lost dog. Over the course of a few weeks, three dogs in the building go missing - Yun-ju and Hyeon-nam have a connection to each. So might a janitor. Is it a man-eat-dog world? Is there any cure for this ennui? Can anyone connect?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["The","disconnect","of","urban","life",".","Yun-ju","is","diffid",",","almost","without","affect",";","his","wife","is","pregnant",",","and","he","'s","wonder","if","he","should","bribe","the","dean","to","secur","a","professorship",".","He","'s","also","bother","by","a","yap","dog","that","disturb","him","in","the","larg","block","of","flat","where","he","live",".","Hyeon-nam","is","equal","disengag",";","she","'s","a","bookkeep","at","same","block","of","flat",",","anim","onli","when","she","learn","of","a","lost","dog",".","Over","the","cours","of","a","few","week",",","three","dog","in","the","build","go","miss","-","Yun-ju","and","Hyeon-nam","have","a","connect","to","each",".","So","might","a","janitor",".","Is","it","a","man-eat-dog","world","?","Is","there","ani","cure","for","this","ennui","?","Can","anyon","connect","?"],"lemmas":["the","disconnection","of","urban","life",".","yun-ju","be","diffident",",","almost","without","affect",";","he","wife","be","pregnant",",","and","he","be","wonder","if","he","should","bribe","the","dean","to","secure","a","professorship",".","he","be","also","bother","by","a","yap","dog","that","disturb","he","in","the","large","block","of","flat","where","he","live",".","hyeon-nam","be","equally","disengage",";","she","be","a","bookkeeper","at","same","block","of","flat",",","animated","only","when","she","learn","of","a","lost","dog",".","over","the","course","of","a","few","week",",","three","dog","in","the","building","go","miss","-","yun-ju","and","hyeon-nam","have","a","connection","to","each",".","so","might","a","janitor",".","be","it","a","man-eat-dog","world","?","be","there","any","cure","for","this","ennui","?","can","anyone","connect","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The disconnections of","disconnections of urban","of urban life","Yun-ju is diffident","is diffident ,","diffident , almost",", almost without","almost without affect","without affect ;","affect ; his","; his wife","his wife is","wife is pregnant","is pregnant ,","pregnant , and",", and he","and he 's","he 's wonders","'s wonders if","wonders if he","if he should","he should bribe","should bribe the","bribe the dean","the dean to","dean to secure","to secure a","secure a professorship","He 's also","'s also bothered","also bothered by","bothered by a","by a yapping","a yapping dog","yapping dog that","dog that disturbs","that disturbs him","disturbs him in","him in the","in the large","the large block","large block of","block of flats","of flats where","flats where he","where he lives","Hyeon-nam is equally","is equally disengaged","equally disengaged ;","disengaged ; she","; she 's","she 's a","'s a bookkeeper","a bookkeeper at","bookkeeper at same","at same block","same block of","block of flats","of flats ,","flats , animated",", animated only","animated only when","only when she","when she learns","she learns of","learns of a","of a lost","a lost dog","Over the course","the course of","course of a","of a few","a few weeks","few weeks ,","weeks , three",", three dogs","three dogs in","dogs in the","in the building","the building go","building go missing","go missing -","missing - Yun-ju","- Yun-ju and","Yun-ju and Hyeon-nam","and Hyeon-nam have","Hyeon-nam have a","have a connection","a connection to","connection to each","So might a","might a janitor","Is it a","it a man-eat-dog","a man-eat-dog world","Is there any","there any cure","any cure for","cure for this","for this ennui","Can anyone connect"],"2grams":["The disconnections","disconnections of","of urban","urban life","Yun-ju is","is diffident","diffident ,",", almost","almost without","without affect","affect ;","; his","his wife","wife is","is pregnant","pregnant ,",", and","and he","he 's","'s wonders","wonders if","if he","he should","should bribe","bribe the","the dean","dean to","to secure","secure a","a professorship","He 's","'s also","also bothered","bothered by","by a","a yapping","yapping dog","dog that","that disturbs","disturbs him","him in","in the","the large","large block","block of","of flats","flats where","where he","he lives","Hyeon-nam is","is equally","equally disengaged","disengaged ;","; she","she 's","'s a","a bookkeeper","bookkeeper at","at same","same block","block of","of flats","flats ,",", animated","animated only","only when","when she","she learns","learns of","of a","a lost","lost dog","Over the","the course","course of","of a","a few","few weeks","weeks ,",", three","three dogs","dogs in","in the","the building","building go","go missing","missing -","- Yun-ju","Yun-ju and","and Hyeon-nam","Hyeon-nam have","have a","a connection","connection to","to each","So might","might a","a janitor","Is it","it a","a man-eat-dog","man-eat-dog world","Is there","there any","any cure","cure for","for this","this ennui","Can anyone","anyone connect"]}

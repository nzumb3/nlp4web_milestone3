{"title":"Evan Almighty","plot":"Buffalo newsman Evan Baxter is elected to Congress with the slogan, \"Change the world.\" He lucks into a huge house in a new Virginia suburb. His Capitol office is also fantastic, but there's a catch: he's tapped by the powerful Congressman Long to co-sponsor a bill to allow development in national parks. In steps God, who appears to a disbelieving Evan and gently commands him to build an ark. Tools and wood arrive in Evan's yard, animal pairs follow, his beard and hair grow wildly, nomad's clothes and a staff appear. Long grows impatient, Evan starts building, his family leaves him, reporters gather, and drought grips D.C. Still, Evan believes. But will he change the world?","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"," Family"],"stems":["Buffalo","newsman","Evan","Baxter","is","elect","to","Congress","with","the","slogan",",","\"","Chang","the","world",".","\"","He","luck","into","a","huge","hous","in","a","new","Virginia","suburb",".","His","Capitol","offic","is","also","fantast",",","but","there","'s","a","catch",":","he","'s","tap","by","the","power","Congressman","Long","to","co-sponsor","a","bill","to","allow","develop","in","nation","park",".","In","step","God",",","who","appear","to","a","disbeliev","Evan","and","gentl","command","him","to","build","an","ark",".","Tool","and","wood","arriv","in","Evan","'s","yard",",","anim","pair","follow",",","his","beard","and","hair","grow","wild",",","nomad","'s","cloth","and","a","staff","appear",".","Long","grow","impati",",","Evan","start","build",",","his","famili","leav","him",",","report","gather",",","and","drought","grip","D.C.","Still",",","Evan","believ",".","But","will","he","chang","the","world","?"],"lemmas":["Buffalo","newsman","Evan","Baxter","be","elect","to","Congress","with","the","slogan",",","``","Change","the","world",".","''","he","luck","into","a","huge","house","in","a","new","Virginia","suburb",".","he","Capitol","office","be","also","fantastic",",","but","there","be","a","catch",":","he","be","tap","by","the","powerful","Congressman","Long","to","co-sponsor","a","bill","to","allow","development","in","national","park",".","in","step","God",",","who","appear","to","a","disbelieve","Evan","and","gently","command","he","to","build","a","ark",".","tool","and","wood","arrive","in","Evan","'s","yard",",","animal","pair","follow",",","he","beard","and","hair","grow","wildly",",","nomad","'s","clothes","and","a","staff","appear",".","Long","grow","impatient",",","Evan","start","build",",","he","family","leave","he",",","reporter","gather",",","and","drought","grip","D.C.","still",",","Evan","believe",".","but","will","he","change","the","world","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Buffalo newsman Evan","newsman Evan Baxter","Evan Baxter is","Baxter is elected","is elected to","elected to Congress","to Congress with","Congress with the","with the slogan","the slogan ,","slogan , \"",", \" Change","\" Change the","Change the world","the world .","world . \"","He lucks into","lucks into a","into a huge","a huge house","huge house in","house in a","in a new","a new Virginia","new Virginia suburb","His Capitol office","Capitol office is","office is also","is also fantastic","also fantastic ,","fantastic , but",", but there","but there 's","there 's a","'s a catch","a catch :","catch : he",": he 's","he 's tapped","'s tapped by","tapped by the","by the powerful","the powerful Congressman","powerful Congressman Long","Congressman Long to","Long to co-sponsor","to co-sponsor a","co-sponsor a bill","a bill to","bill to allow","to allow development","allow development in","development in national","in national parks","In steps God","steps God ,","God , who",", who appears","who appears to","appears to a","to a disbelieving","a disbelieving Evan","disbelieving Evan and","Evan and gently","and gently commands","gently commands him","commands him to","him to build","to build an","build an ark","Tools and wood","and wood arrive","wood arrive in","arrive in Evan","in Evan 's","Evan 's yard","'s yard ,","yard , animal",", animal pairs","animal pairs follow","pairs follow ,","follow , his",", his beard","his beard and","beard and hair","and hair grow","hair grow wildly","grow wildly ,","wildly , nomad",", nomad 's","nomad 's clothes","'s clothes and","clothes and a","and a staff","a staff appear","Long grows impatient","grows impatient ,","impatient , Evan",", Evan starts","Evan starts building","starts building ,","building , his",", his family","his family leaves","family leaves him","leaves him ,","him , reporters",", reporters gather","reporters gather ,","gather , and",", and drought","and drought grips","drought grips D.C.","grips D.C.

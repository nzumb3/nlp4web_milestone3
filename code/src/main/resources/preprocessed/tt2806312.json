{"title":"A cicatriz branca","plot":"Throughout the first half of the 20Th century, thousands of women left Galicia alone to go to America. Many of them were illegal, carrying on documents that forged their age and even their identity. Stories as Merce's, set aside for going into service, and from night to morning, dismissed. With nowhere to go or no one to ask for help, Merce spends three days and nights at Constitution Station, where her life is linked to other emigrants' lives. On a par with a job at the factory Mil8, Merce gets married, attends financial classes in the Galician Societies when finally comes a day that the rule is shattered by something as simple as being captivated by a situation which is hard for her to name.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Throughout","the","first","half","of","the","20Th","centuri",",","thousand","of","women","left","Galicia","alon","to","go","to","America",".","Mani","of","them","were","illeg",",","carri","on","document","that","forg","their","age","and","even","their","ident",".","Stori","as","Merc","'s",",","set","asid","for","go","into","servic",",","and","from","night","to","morn",",","dismiss",".","With","nowher","to","go","or","no","one","to","ask","for","help",",","Merc","spend","three","day","and","night","at","Constitut","Station",",","where","her","life","is","link","to","other","emigr","'","live",".","On","a","par","with","a","job","at","the","factori","Mil8",",","Merc","get","marri",",","attend","financi","class","in","the","Galician","Societi","when","final","come","a","day","that","the","rule","is","shatter","by","someth","as","simpl","as","be","captiv","by","a","situat","which","is","hard","for","her","to","name","."],"lemmas":["throughout","the","first","half","of","the","20th","century",",","thousand","of","woman","leave","Galicia","alone","to","go","to","America",".","many","of","they","be","illegal",",","carry","on","document","that","forge","they","age","and","even","they","identity",".","Stories","as","Merce","'s",",","set","aside","for","go","into","service",",","and","from","night","to","morning",",","dismiss",".","with","nowhere","to","go","or","no","one","to","ask","for","help",",","Merce","spend","three","day","and","night","at","Constitution","Station",",","where","she","life","be","link","to","other","emigrant","'","life",".","on","a","par","with","a","job","at","the","factory","mil8",",","Merce","get","marry",",","attend","financial","class","in","the","galician","society","when","finally","come","a","day","that","the","rule","be","shatter","by","something","as","simple","as","be","captivate","by","a","situation","which","be","hard","for","she","to","name","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Throughout

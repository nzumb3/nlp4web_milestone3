{"title":"Father Spirit","plot":"An unblinking look into the story of a son's hopeful effort to connect with his terminally ill father on one last epic journey. As Jonathan and his father Peter take this uncertain but bold step into an ambitious four month journey through India, Peter contends with the late stages of the brutal, degenerate Huntington's disease. Navigating cold, mountainous terrain and cities thousands of years old, Jonathan is on his own spiritual journey to come to terms with his father's accelerating decline and possibly his own fate. As Huntington's widens the gulf between them, 'Father Spirit' invites viewers to rethink conventional notions about the terminally ill and what it means to love someone unconditionally.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama","

{"title":"ChickLit","plot":"ChickLit is a comedy drama about four guys trying to save their local pub from closing down. They group write a chick lit, or more specifically a 'mummy porn' novel in the style of 'Fifty Shades of Grey' and it gets snapped up. The only snag is that the publisher insists that the young woman 'author' does press and publicity. The guys have to keep their involvement a secret and so engage an out of work actress to 'role play' the part of the author. This leads to her becoming the star in the film of the book, the tables are turned on the guys and she is in control - leaving them with the awful prospect of having to secretly churn out sex novels for the foreseeable future.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["ChickLit","is","a","comedi","drama","about","four","guy","tri","to","save","their","local","pub","from","close","down",".","They","group","write","a","chick","lit",",","or","more","specif","a","'","mummi","porn","'","novel","in","the","style","of","'","Fifti","Shade","of","Grey","'","and","it","get","snap","up",".","The","onli","snag","is","that","the","publish","insist","that","the","young","woman","'","author","'","doe","press","and","public",".","The","guy","have","to","keep","their","involv","a","secret","and","so","engag","an","out","of","work","actress","to","'","role","play","'","the","part","of","the","author",".","This","lead","to","her","becom","the","star","in","the","film","of","the","book",",","the","tabl","are","turn","on","the","guy","and","she","is","in","control","-","leav","them","with","the","aw","prospect","of","have","to","secret","churn","out","sex","novel","for","the","forese","futur","."],"lemmas":["ChickLit","be","a","comedy","drama","about","four","guy","try","to","save","they","local","pub","from","close","down",".","they","group","write","a","chick","light",",","or","more","specifically","a","'","mummy","porn","'","novel","in","the","style","of","'","fifty","shades","of","Grey","'","and","it","get","snap","up",".","the","only","snag","be","that","the","publisher","insist","that","the","young","woman","'","author","'","do","press","and","publicity",".","the","guy","have","to","keep","they","involvement","a","secret","and","so","engage","a","out","of","work","actress","to","'","role","play","'","the","part","of","the","author",".","this","lead","to","she","become","the","star","in","the","film","of","the","book",",","the","table","be","turn","on","the","guy","and","she","be","in","control","-","leave","they","with","the","awful","prospect","of","have","to","secretly","churn","out","sex","novel","for","the","foreseeable","future","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["ChickLit is a","is a comedy","a comedy drama","comedy drama about","drama about four","about four guys","four guys trying","guys trying to","trying to save","to save their","save their local","their local pub","local pub from","pub from closing","from closing down","They group write","group write a","write a chick","a chick lit","chick lit ,","lit , or",", or more","or more specifically","more specifically a","specifically a '","a ' mummy","' mummy porn","mummy porn '","porn ' novel","' novel in","novel in the","in the style","the style of","style of '","of ' Fifty","' Fifty Shades","Fifty Shades of","Shades of Grey","of Grey '","Grey ' and","' and it","and it gets","it gets snapped","gets snapped up","The only snag","only snag is","snag is that","is that the","that the publisher","the publisher insists","publisher insists that","insists that the","that the young","the young woman","young woman '","woman ' author","' author '","author ' does","' does press","does press and","press and publicity","The guys have","guys have to","have to keep","to keep their","keep their involvement","their involvement a","involvement a secret","a secret and","secret and so","and so engage","so engage an","engage an out","an out of","out of work","of work actress","work actress to","actress to '","to ' role","' role play","role play '","play ' the","' the part","the part of","part of the","of the author","This leads to","leads to her","to her becoming","her becoming the","becoming the star","the star in","star in the","in the film","the film of","film of the","of the book","the book ,","book , the",", the tables","the tables are","tables are turned","are turned on","turned on the","on the guys","the guys and","guys and she","and she is","she is in","is in control","in control -","control -

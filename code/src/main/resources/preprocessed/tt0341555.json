{"title":"Sex Is Zero","plot":"At Sunjong University, a few students are serious, including Eun-hyo, who works hard at aerobics in hopes of doing well in a national competition. Most students goof off: drinking, partying, and focusing on sex. Eun-shik, a law student who's been in the military, is older but socially inept. He likes Eun-hyo; even though his earnest and simple side appeals to her, his juvenile excesses make him irrelevant when Sung-ok, a good-looking rich kid, charms Eun-hyo. They begin an affair, leaving Eun-shik on the sidelines. The national competition approaches and complications arise.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["At","Sunjong","Univers",",","a","few","student","are","serious",",","includ","Eun-hyo",",","who","work","hard","at","aerob","in","hope","of","do","well","in","a","nation","competit",".","Most","student","goof","off",":","drink",",","parti",",","and","focus","on","sex",".","Eun-shik",",","a","law","student","who","'s","been","in","the","militari",",","is","older","but","social","inept",".","He","like","Eun-hyo",";","even","though","his","earnest","and","simpl","side","appeal","to","her",",","his","juvenil","excess","make","him","irrelev","when","Sung-ok",",","a","good-look","rich","kid",",","charm","Eun-hyo",".","They","begin","an","affair",",","leav","Eun-shik","on","the","sidelin",".","The","nation","competit","approach","and","complic","aris","."],"lemmas":["at","Sunjong","University",",","a","few","student","be","serious",",","include","eun-hyo",",","who","work","hard","at","aerobic","in","hope","of","do","well","in","a","national","competition",".","most","student","goof","off",":","drinking",",","partying",",","and","focus","on","sex",".","eun-shik",",","a","law","student","who","be","be","in","the","military",",","be","older","but","socially","inept",".","he","like","eun-hyo",";","even","though","he","earnest","and","simple","side","appeal","to","she",",","he","juvenile","excess","make","he","irrelevant","when","sung-ok",",","a","good-looking","rich","kid",",","charms","eun-hyo",".","they","begin","a","affair",",","leave","eun-shik","on","the","sideline",".","the","national","competition","approach","and","complication","arise","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["At Sunjong University","Sunjong University ,","University , a",", a few","a few students","few students are","students are serious","are serious ,","serious , including",", including Eun-hyo","including Eun-hyo ,","Eun-hyo , who",", who works","who works hard","works hard at","hard at aerobics","at aerobics in","aerobics in hopes","in hopes of","hopes of doing","of doing well","doing well in","well in a","in a national","a national competition","Most students goof","students goof off","goof off :","off : drinking",": drinking ,","drinking , partying",", partying ,","partying , and",", and focusing","and focusing on","focusing on sex","Eun-shik , a",", a law","a law student","law student who","student who 's","who 's been","'s been in","been in the","in the military","the military ,","military , is",", is older","is older but","older but socially","but socially inept","He likes Eun-hyo","likes Eun-hyo ;","Eun-hyo ; even","; even though","even though his","though his earnest","his earnest and","earnest and simple","and simple side","simple side appeals","side appeals to","appeals to her","to her ,","her , his",", his juvenile","his juvenile excesses","juvenile excesses make","excesses make him","make him irrelevant","him irrelevant when","irrelevant when Sung-ok","when Sung-ok ,","Sung-ok , a",", a good-looking","a good-looking rich","good-looking rich kid","rich kid ,","kid , charms",", charms Eun-hyo","They begin an","begin an affair","an affair ,","affair , leaving",", leaving Eun-shik","leaving Eun-shik on","Eun-shik on the","on the sidelines","The national competition","national competition approaches","competition approaches and","approaches and complications","and complications arise"],"2grams":["At Sunjong","Sunjong University","University ,",", a","a few","few students","students are","are serious","serious ,",", including","including Eun-hyo","Eun-hyo ,",", who","who works","works hard","hard at","at aerobics","aerobics in","in hopes","hopes of","of doing","doing well","well in","in a","a national","national competition","Most students","students goof","goof off","off :",": drinking","drinking ,",", partying","partying ,",", and","and focusing","focusing on","on sex","Eun-shik ,",", a","a law","law student","student who","who 's","'s been","been in","in the","the military","military ,",", is","is older","older but","but socially","socially inept","He likes","likes Eun-hyo","Eun-hyo ;","; even","even though","though his","his earnest","earnest and","and simple","simple side","side appeals","appeals to","to her","her ,",", his","his juvenile","juvenile excesses","excesses make","make him","him irrelevant","irrelevant when","when Sung-ok","Sung-ok ,",", a","a good-looking","good-looking rich","rich kid","kid ,",", charms","charms Eun-hyo","They begin","begin an","an affair","affair ,",", leaving","leaving Eun-shik","Eun-shik on","on the","the sidelines","The national","national competition","competition approaches","approaches and","and complications","complications arise"]}

Fathers Of The Sport will refer to the heartfelt devotion of sport displayed by players of yesterday compared to today's star driven talented young players. Their talents and skills made them aspire to become some of the most recognized and influential basketball players ever. In return for their contributions, Fathers of the Sport will enlighten the world to the game's legendary origins in playground basketball which transcended onto the courts of the NBA and into the hearts and lives of an infinite number of fans.

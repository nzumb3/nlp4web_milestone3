{"title":"Wiebo's War","plot":"Tells the story of a Christian community, at war with the oil and gas industry. Wiebo Ludwig is a suspect in a series of pipeline bombings near his farm. The bombings echo a campaign of sabotage he waged 10 years ago: barricading roads, blowing up wells, culminating in the unsolved death of a teen aged girl. The Ludwigs live according to their religious values. They are self-sufficient in food and energy, but isolated, with seven unmarried adult children, and 38 grandchildren. They believe that those who don't share their beliefs, like filmmaker David York, are living in terrible darkness.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Tell","the","stori","of","a","Christian","communiti",",","at","war","with","the","oil","and","gas","industri",".","Wiebo","Ludwig","is","a","suspect","in","a","seri","of","pipelin","bomb","near","his","farm",".","The","bomb","echo","a","campaign","of","sabotag","he","wage","10","year","ago",":","barricad","road",",","blow","up","well",",","culmin","in","the","unsolv","death","of","a","teen","age","girl",".","The","Ludwig","live","accord","to","their","religi","valu",".","They","are","self-suffici","in","food","and","energi",",","but","isol",",","with","seven","unmarri","adult","children",",","and","38","grandchildren",".","They","believ","that","those","who","do","n't","share","their","belief",",","like","filmmak","David","York",",","are","live","in","terribl","dark","."],"lemmas":["tell","the","story","of","a","christian","community",",","at","war","with","the","oil","and","gas","industry",".","Wiebo","Ludwig","be","a","suspect","in","a","series","of","pipeline","bombing","near","he","farm",".","the","bombing","echo","a","campaign","of","sabotage","he","wage","10","year","ago",":","barricade","road",",","blow","up","well",",","culminate","in","the","unsolved","death","of","a","teen","aged","girl",".","the","Ludwigs","live","accord","to","they","religious","value",".","they","be","self-sufficient","in","food","and","energy",",","but","isolate",",","with","seven","unmarried","adult","child",",","and","38","grandchild",".","they","believe","that","those","who","do","not","share","they","belief",",","like","filmmaker","David","York",",","be","live","in","terrible","darkness","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tells the story","the story of","story of a","of a Christian","a Christian community","Christian community ,","community , at",", at war","at war with","war with the","with the oil","the oil and","oil and gas","and gas industry","Wiebo Ludwig is","Ludwig is a","is a suspect","a suspect in","suspect in a","in a series","a series of","series of pipeline","of pipeline bombings","pipeline bombings near","bombings near his","near his farm","The bombings echo","bombings echo a","echo a campaign","a campaign of","campaign of sabotage","of sabotage he","sabotage he waged","he waged 10","waged 10 years","10 years ago","years ago :","ago : barricading",": barricading roads","barricading roads ,","roads , blowing",", blowing up","blowing up wells","up wells ,","wells , culminating",", culminating in","culminating in the","in the unsolved","the unsolved death","unsolved death of","death of a","of a teen","a teen aged","teen aged girl","The Ludwigs live","Ludwigs live according","live according to","according to their","to their religious","their religious values","They are self-sufficient","are self-sufficient in","self-sufficient in food","in food and","food and energy","and energy ,","energy , but",", but isolated","but isolated ,","isolated , with",", with seven","with seven unmarried","seven unmarried adult","unmarried adult children","adult children ,","children , and",", and 38","and 38 grandchildren","They believe that","believe that those","that those who","those who do","who do n't","do n't share","n't share their","share their beliefs","their beliefs ,","beliefs , like",", like filmmaker","like filmmaker David","filmmaker David York","David York ,","York , are",", are living","are living in","living in terrible","in terrible darkness"],"2grams":["Tells the","the story","story of","of a","a Christian","Christian community","community ,",", at","at war","war with","with the","the oil","oil and","and gas","gas industry","Wiebo Ludwig","Ludwig is","is a","a suspect","suspect in","in a","a series","series of","of pipeline","pipeline bombings","bombings near","near his","his farm","The bombings","bombings echo","echo a","a campaign","campaign of","of sabotage","sabotage he","he waged","waged 10","10 years","years ago","ago :",": barricading","barricading roads","roads ,",", blowing","blowing up","up wells","wells ,",", culminating","culminating in","in the","the unsolved","unsolved death","death of","of a","a teen","teen aged","aged girl","The Ludwigs","Ludwigs live","live according","according to","to their","their religious","religious values","They are","are self-sufficient","self-sufficient in","in food","food and","and energy","energy ,",", but","but isolated","isolated ,",", with","with seven","seven unmarried","unmarried adult","adult children","children ,",", and","and 38","38 grandchildren","They believe","believe that","that those","those who","who do","do n't","n't share","share their","their beliefs","beliefs ,",", like","like filmmaker","filmmaker David","David York","York ,",", are","are living","living in","in terrible","terrible darkness"]}

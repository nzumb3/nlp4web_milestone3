{"title":"Dancing Salmon Home","plot":"'Dancing Salmon Home' is a journey of loss and reunification, across generations and oceans, as the Winnemem Wintu tribe of Northern California journeys to New Zealand to meet their long-lost Chinook salmon relatives, which have been missing from their river for 65 years. Along the way, the 28 tribal members hold four days of ceremony beside New Zealand's Rakaia River, forging enduring bonds with the Maori people of the region, and sharing a message of respect for the natural world, and launching plans to bring their salmon home.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["'","Danc","Salmon","Home","'","is","a","journey","of","loss","and","reunif",",","across","generat","and","ocean",",","as","the","Winnemem","Wintu","tribe","of","Northern","California","journey","to","New","Zealand","to","meet","their","long-lost","Chinook","salmon","relat",",","which","have","been","miss","from","their","river","for","65","year",".","Along","the","way",",","the","28","tribal","member","hold","four","day","of","ceremoni","besid","New","Zealand","'s","Rakaia","River",",","forg","endur","bond","with","the","Maori","peopl","of","the","region",",","and","share","a","messag","of","respect","for","the","natur","world",",","and","launch","plan","to","bring","their","salmon","home","."],"lemmas":["'","Dancing","Salmon","Home","'","be","a","journey","of","loss","and","reunification",",","across","generation","and","ocean",",","as","the","Winnemem","Wintu","tribe","of","northern","California","journey","to","New","Zealand","to","meet","they","long-lost","Chinook","salmon","relative",",","which","have","be","miss","from","they","river","for","65","year",".","along","the","way",",","the","28","tribal","member","hold","four","day","of","ceremony","beside","New","Zealand","'s","Rakaia","River",",","forge","enduring","bond","with","the","maori","people","of","the","region",",","and","share","a","message","of","respect","for","the","natural","world",",","and","launch","plan","to","bring","they","salmon","home","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Dancing Salmon","Dancing Salmon Home","Salmon Home '","Home ' is","' is a","is a journey","a journey of","journey of loss","of loss and","loss and reunification","and reunification ,","reunification , across",", across generations","across generations and","generations and oceans","and oceans ,","oceans , as",", as the","as the Winnemem","the Winnemem Wintu","Winnemem Wintu tribe","Wintu tribe of","tribe of Northern","of Northern California","Northern California journeys","California journeys to","journeys to New","to New Zealand","New Zealand to","Zealand to meet","to meet their","meet their long-lost","their long-lost Chinook","long-lost Chinook salmon","Chinook salmon relatives","salmon relatives ,","relatives , which",", which have","which have been","have been missing","been missing from","missing from their","from their river","their river for","river for 65","for 65 years","Along the way","the way ,","way , the",", the 28","the 28 tribal","28 tribal members","tribal members hold","members hold four","hold four days","four days of","days of ceremony","of ceremony beside","ceremony beside New","beside New Zealand","New Zealand 's","Zealand 's Rakaia","'s Rakaia River","Rakaia River ,","River , forging",", forging enduring","forging enduring bonds","enduring bonds with","bonds with the","with the Maori","the Maori people","Maori people of","people of the","of the region","the region ,","region , and",", and sharing","and sharing a","sharing a message","a message of","message of respect","of respect for","respect for the","for the natural","the natural world","natural world ,","world , and",", and launching","and launching plans","launching plans to","plans to bring","to bring their","bring their salmon","their salmon home"],"2grams":["' Dancing","Dancing Salmon","Salmon Home","Home '","' is","is a","a journey","journey of","of loss","loss and","and reunification","reunification ,",", across","across generations","generations and","and oceans","oceans ,",", as","as the","the Winnemem","Winnemem Wintu","Wintu tribe","tribe of","of Northern","Northern California","California journeys","journeys to","to New","New Zealand","Zealand to","to meet","meet their","their long-lost","long-lost Chinook","Chinook salmon","salmon relatives","relatives ,",", which","which have","have been","been missing","missing from","from their","their river","river for","for 65","65 years","Along the","the way","way ,",", the","the 28","28 tribal","tribal members","members hold","hold four","four days","days of","of ceremony","ceremony beside","beside New","New Zealand","Zealand 's","'s Rakaia","Rakaia River","River ,",", forging","forging enduring","enduring bonds","bonds with","with the","the Maori","Maori people","people of","of the","the region","region ,",", and","and sharing","sharing a","a message","message of","of respect","respect for","for the","the natural","natural world","world ,",", and","and launching","launching plans","plans to","to bring","bring their","their salmon","salmon home"]}

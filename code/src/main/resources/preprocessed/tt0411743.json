{"title":"White Skin","plot":"Thierry has just become acquainted with Claire, and already he is deeply in love with her - even if she has the one characteristic he doesn't like in a woman: very pale skin. Despite Claire's attempts to dissuade him, they are fatally attracted to each other. Thierry is obsessed with her, and his best friend Henri sees him physically and mentally decaying. When Thierry finds out that Claire's sister had tried to kill Henri in a hotel, he realizes he knows very little about her, and about the mysterious genetic laws of heredity.","genres":["Drama"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["Thierri","has","just","becom","acquaint","with","Clair",",","and","alreadi","he","is","deepli","in","love","with","her","-","even","if","she","has","the","one","characterist","he","doe","n't","like","in","a","woman",":","veri","pale","skin",".","Despit","Clair","'s","attempt","to","dissuad","him",",","they","are","fatal","attract","to","each","other",".","Thierri","is","obsess","with","her",",","and","his","best","friend","Henri","see","him","physic","and","mental","decay",".","When","Thierri","find","out","that","Clair","'s","sister","had","tri","to","kill","Henri","in","a","hotel",",","he","realiz","he","know","veri","littl","about","her",",","and","about","the","mysteri","genet","law","of","hered","."],"lemmas":["Thierry","have","just","become","acquaint","with","Claire",",","and","already","he","be","deeply","in","love","with","she","-","even","if","she","have","the","one","characteristic","he","do","not","like","in","a","woman",":","very","pale","skin",".","despite","Claire","'s","attempt","to","dissuade","he",",","they","be","fatally","attract","to","each","other",".","Thierry","be","obsess","with","she",",","and","he","best","friend","Henri","see","he","physically","and","mentally","decaying",".","when","Thierry","find","out","that","Claire","'s","sister","have","try","to","kill","Henri","in","a","hotel",",","he","realize","he","know","very","little","about","she",",","and","about","the","mysterious","genetic","law","of","heredity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Thierry has just","has just become","just become acquainted","become acquainted with","acquainted with Claire","with Claire ,","Claire , and",", and already","and already he","already he is","he is deeply","is deeply in","deeply in love","in love with","love with her","with her -","her - even","- even if","even if she","if she has","she has the","has the one","the one characteristic","one characteristic he","characteristic he does","he does n't","does n't like","n't like in","like in a","in a woman","a woman :","woman : very",": very pale","very pale skin","Despite Claire 's","Claire 's attempts","'s attempts to","attempts to dissuade","to dissuade him","dissuade him ,","him , they",", they are","they are fatally","are fatally attracted","fatally attracted to","attracted to each","to each other","Thierry is obsessed","is obsessed with","obsessed with her","with her ,","her , and",", and his","and his best","his best friend","best friend Henri","friend Henri sees","Henri sees him","sees him physically","him physically and","physically and mentally","and mentally decaying","When Thierry finds","Thierry finds out","finds out that","out that Claire","that Claire 's","Claire 's sister","'s sister had","sister had tried","had tried to","tried to kill","to kill Henri","kill Henri in","Henri in a","in a hotel","a hotel ,","hotel , he",", he realizes","he realizes he","realizes he knows","he knows very","knows very little","very little about","little about her","about her ,","her , and",", and about","and about the","about the mysterious","the mysterious genetic","mysterious genetic laws","genetic laws of","laws of heredity"],"2grams":["Thierry has","has just","just become","become acquainted","acquainted with","with Claire","Claire ,",", and","and already","already he","he is","is deeply","deeply in","in love","love with","with her","her -","- even","even if","if she","she has","has the","the one","one characteristic","characteristic he","he does","does n't","n't like","like in","in a","a woman","woman :",": very","very pale","pale skin","Despite Claire","Claire 's","'s attempts","attempts to","to dissuade","dissuade him","him ,",", they","they are","are fatally","fatally attracted","attracted to","to each","each other","Thierry is","is obsessed","obsessed with","with her","her ,",", and","and his","his best","best friend","friend Henri","Henri sees","sees him","him physically","physically and","and mentally","mentally decaying","When Thierry","Thierry finds","finds out","out that","that Claire","Claire 's","'s sister","sister had","had tried","tried to","to kill","kill Henri","Henri in","in a","a hotel","hotel ,",", he","he realizes","realizes he","he knows","knows very","very little","little about","about her","her ,",", and","and about","about the","the mysterious","mysterious genetic","genetic laws","laws of","of heredity"]}

{"title":"Alanis Morissette: Live at Montreux 2012","plot":"Alanis Morissette is one of the most successful female artists and songwriters of all time and has sold in excess of 60 million albums worldwide. Her voice is instantly recognisable and she is a consummate live performer. On 2 July 2012 Alanis Morissette returned to Montreux as part of her Guardian Angel Tour in support of her new album \"Havoc And Bright Lights\". It was her third appearance at the festival. The set showcased a number of tracks from the new album (at that point still to be released) alongside classic tracks from across her career. This is Alanis Morissette live at her very best.","genres":["Music"],"stems":["Alani","Morissett","is","one","of","the","most","success","femal","artist","and","songwrit","of","all","time","and","has","sold","in","excess","of","60","million","album","worldwid",".","Her","voic","is","instant","recognis","and","she","is","a","consumm","live","perform",".","On","2","Juli","2012","Alani","Morissett","return","to","Montreux","as","part","of","her","Guardian","Angel","Tour","in","support","of","her","new","album","\"","Havoc","And","Bright","Light","\"",".","It","was","her","third","appear","at","the","festiv",".","The","set","showcas","a","number","of","track","from","the","new","album","(","at","that","point","still","to","be","releas",")","alongsid","classic","track","from","across","her","career",".","This","is","Alani","Morissett","live","at","her","veri","best","."],"lemmas":["Alanis","Morissette","be","one","of","the","most","successful","female","artist","and","songwriter","of","all","time","and","have","sell","in","excess","of","60","million","album","worldwide",".","she","voice","be","instantly","recognisable","and","she","be","a","consummate","live","performer",".","on","2","July","2012","Alanis","Morissette","return","to","Montreux","as","part","of","she","Guardian","Angel","Tour","in","support","of","she","new","album","``","Havoc","and","Bright","Lights","''",".","it","be","she","third","appearance","at","the","festival",".","the","set","showcase","a","number","of","track","from","the","new","album","-lrb-","at","that","point","still","to","be","release","-rrb-","alongside","classic","track","from","across","she","career",".","this","be","Alanis","Morissette","live","at","she","very","best","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Alanis Morissette is","Morissette is one","is one of","one of the","of the most","the most successful","most successful female","successful female artists","female artists and","artists and songwriters","and songwriters of","songwriters of all","of all time","all time and","time and has","and has sold","has sold in","sold in excess","in excess of","excess of 60","of 60 million","60 million albums","million albums worldwide","Her voice is","voice is instantly","is instantly recognisable","instantly recognisable and","recognisable and she","and she is","she is a","is a consummate","a consummate live","consummate live performer","On 2 July","2 July 2012","July 2012 Alanis","2012 Alanis Morissette","Alanis Morissette returned","Morissette returned to","returned to Montreux","to Montreux as","Montreux as part","as part of","part of her","of her Guardian","her Guardian Angel","Guardian Angel Tour","Angel Tour in","Tour in support","in support of","support of her","of her new","her new album","new album \"","album \" Havoc","\" Havoc And","Havoc And Bright","And Bright Lights","Bright Lights \"","It was her","was her third","her third appearance","third appearance at","appearance at the","at the festival","The set showcased","set showcased a","showcased a number","a number of","number of tracks","of tracks from","tracks from the","from the new","the new album","new album (","album ( at","( at that","at that point","that point still","point still to","still to be","to be released","be released )","released ) alongside",") alongside classic","alongside classic tracks","classic tracks from","tracks from across","from across her","across her career","This is Alanis","is Alanis Morissette","Alanis Morissette live","Morissette live at","live at her","at her very","her very best"],"2grams":["Alanis Morissette","Morissette is","is one","one of","of the","the most","most successful","successful female","female artists","artists and","and songwriters","songwriters of","of all","all time","time and","and has","has sold","sold in","in excess","excess of","of 60","60 million","million albums","albums worldwide","Her voice","voice is","is instantly","instantly recognisable","recognisable and","and she","she is","is a","a consummate","consummate live","live performer","On 2","2 July","July 2012","2012 Alanis","Alanis Morissette","Morissette returned","returned to","to Montreux","Montreux as","as part","part of","of her","her Guardian","Guardian Angel","Angel Tour","Tour in","in support","support of","of her","her new","new album","album \"","\" Havoc","Havoc And","And Bright","Bright Lights","Lights \"","It was","was her","her third","third appearance","appearance at","at the","the festival","The set","set showcased","showcased a","a number","number of","of tracks","tracks from","from the","the new","new album","album (","( at","at that","that point","point still","still to","to be","be released","released )",") alongside","alongside classic","classic tracks","tracks from","from across","across her","her career","This is","is Alanis","Alanis Morissette","Morissette live","live at","at her","her very","very best"]}

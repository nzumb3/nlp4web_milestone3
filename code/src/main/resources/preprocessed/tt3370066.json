{"title":"The Surgery Ship","plot":"A team of volunteer doctors and nurses are on board a unique ship. Crammed with medical supplies and volunteer medics, this floating hospital sails to the poorest nations on earth. This year they sail for Guinea on the West African Coast. On arrival they will face the most severe of medical issues, not seen in other parts of the world. But the medical challenges are only half of the story. They will confront ethical decisions as they decide who will be helped and who will not. This is a searing, complex journey for the volunteer medics, as they deal with life and death cases - and balance the fates of these patients in their hands.","genres":["Adventure"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","team","of","volunt","doctor","and","nurs","are","on","board","a","uniqu","ship",".","Cram","with","medic","suppli","and","volunt","medic",",","this","float","hospit","sail","to","the","poorest","nation","on","earth",".","This","year","they","sail","for","Guinea","on","the","West","African","Coast",".","On","arriv","they","will","face","the","most","sever","of","medic","issu",",","not","seen","in","other","part","of","the","world",".","But","the","medic","challeng","are","onli","half","of","the","stori",".","They","will","confront","ethic","decis","as","they","decid","who","will","be","help","and","who","will","not",".","This","is","a","sear",",","complex","journey","for","the","volunt","medic",",","as","they","deal","with","life","and","death","case","-","and","balanc","the","fate","of","these","patient","in","their","hand","."],"lemmas":["a","team","of","volunteer","doctor","and","nurse","be","on","board","a","unique","ship",".","cram","with","medical","supplies","and","volunteer","medic",",","this","floating","hospital","sail","to","the","poorest","nation","on","earth",".","this","year","they","sail","for","Guinea","on","the","West","African","Coast",".","on","arrival","they","will","face","the","most","severe","of","medical","issue",",","not","see","in","other","part","of","the","world",".","but","the","medical","challenge","be","only","half","of","the","story",".","they","will","confront","ethical","decision","as","they","decide","who","will","be","help","and","who","will","not",".","this","be","a","searing",",","complex","journey","for","the","volunteer","medic",",","as","they","deal","with","life","and","death","case","-","and","balance","the","fate","of","these","patient","in","they","hand","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A team of","team of volunteer","of volunteer doctors","volunteer doctors and","doctors and nurses","and nurses are","nurses are on","are on board","on board a","board a unique","a unique ship","Crammed with medical","with medical supplies","medical supplies and","supplies and volunteer","and volunteer medics","volunteer medics ,","medics , this",", this floating","this floating hospital","floating hospital sails","hospital sails to","sails to the","to the poorest","the poorest nations","poorest nations on","nations on earth","This year they","year they sail","they sail for","sail for Guinea","for Guinea on","Guinea on the","on the West","the West African","West African Coast","On arrival they","arrival they will","they will face","will face the","face the most","the most severe","most severe of","severe of medical","of medical issues","medical issues ,","issues , not",", not seen","not seen in","seen in other","in other parts","other parts of","parts of the","of the world","But the medical","the medical challenges","medical challenges are","challenges are only","are only half","only half of","half of the","of the story","They will confront","will confront ethical","confront ethical decisions","ethical decisions as","decisions as they","as they decide","they decide who","decide who will","who will be","will be helped","be helped and","helped and who","and who will","who will not","This is a","is a searing","a searing ,","searing , complex",", complex journey","complex journey for","journey for the","for the volunteer","the volunteer medics","volunteer medics ,","medics , as",", as they","as they deal","they deal with","deal with life","with life and","life and death","and death cases","death cases -","cases -

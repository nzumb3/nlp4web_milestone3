{"title":"Lumière and Company","plot":"40 international directors were asked to make a short film using the original Cinematographe invented by the Lumière Brothers, working under conditions similar to those of 1895. There were three rules: (1) The film could be no longer than 52 seconds, (2) no synchronized sound was permitted, and (3) no more than three takes. The results run the gamut from Zhang Yimou's convention-thwarting joke to David Lynch's bizarre miniature epic.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["40","intern","director","were","ask","to","make","a","short","film","use","the","origin","Cinematograph","invent","by","the","Lumièr","Brother",",","work","under","condit","similar","to","those","of","1895",".","There","were","three","rule",":","(","1",")","The","film","could","be","no","longer","than","52","second",",","(","2",")","no","synchron","sound","was","permit",",","and","(","3",")","no","more","than","three","take",".","The","result","run","the","gamut","from","Zhang","Yimou","'s","convention-thwart","joke","to","David","Lynch","'s","bizarr","miniatur","epic","."],"lemmas":["40","international","director","be","ask","to","make","a","short","film","use","the","original","cinematographe","invent","by","the","Lumière","Brothers",",","work","under","condition","similar","to","those","of","1895",".","there","be","three","rule",":","-lrb-","1","-rrb-","the","film","could","be","no","longer","than","52","seconds",",","-lrb-","2","-rrb-","no","synchronize","sound","be","permit",",","and","-lrb-","3","-rrb-","no","more","than","three","take",".","the","result","run","the","gamut","from","Zhang","Yimou","'s","convention-thwarting","joke","to","David","Lynch","'s","bizarre","miniature","epic","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["40 international directors","international directors were","directors were asked","were asked to","asked to make","to make a","make a short","a short film","short film using","film using the","using the original","the original Cinematographe","original Cinematographe invented","Cinematographe invented by","invented by the","by the Lumière","the Lumière Brothers","Lumière Brothers ,","Brothers , working",", working under","working under conditions","under conditions similar","conditions similar to","similar to those","to those of","those of 1895","There were three","were three rules","three rules :","rules : (",": ( 1","( 1 )","1 ) The",") The film","The film could","film could be","could be no","be no longer","no longer than","longer than 52","than 52 seconds","52 seconds ,","seconds , (",", ( 2","( 2 )","2 ) no",") no synchronized","no synchronized sound","synchronized sound was","sound was permitted","was permitted ,","permitted , and",", and (","and ( 3","( 3 )","3 ) no",") no more","no more than","more than three","than three takes","The results run","results run the","run the gamut","the gamut from","gamut from Zhang","from Zhang Yimou","Zhang Yimou 's","Yimou 's convention-thwarting","'s convention-thwarting joke","convention-thwarting joke to","joke to David","to David Lynch","David Lynch 's","Lynch 's bizarre","'s bizarre miniature","bizarre miniature epic"],"2grams":["40 international","international directors","directors were","were asked","asked to","to make","make a","a short","short film","film using","using the","the original","original Cinematographe","Cinematographe invented","invented by","by the","the Lumière","Lumière Brothers","Brothers ,",", working","working under","under conditions","conditions similar","similar to","to those","those of","of 1895","There were","were three","three rules","rules :",": (","( 1","1 )",") The","The film","film could","could be","be no","no longer","longer than","than 52","52 seconds","seconds ,",", (","( 2","2 )",") no","no synchronized","synchronized sound","sound was","was permitted","permitted ,",", and","and (","( 3","3 )",") no","no more","more than","than three","three takes","The results","results run","run the","the gamut","gamut from","from Zhang","Zhang Yimou","Yimou 's","'s convention-thwarting","convention-thwarting joke","joke to","to David","David Lynch","Lynch 's","'s bizarre","bizarre miniature","miniature epic"]}

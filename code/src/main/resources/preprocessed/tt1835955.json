{"title":"Errors of the Human Body","plot":"Seeking a new laboratory to pursue his controversial genetic research, Dr Geoff Burton takes up a position at the world-renowned Institute for Molecular Cell Biology & Genetics in wintry Dresden, Germany. His contribution to their most top-secret project - a human regeneration gene - has the potential to make something miraculous out of a personal tragedy that has haunted him for years. But when he uncovers a conspiracy amongst his colleagues, he finds instead something quite different: a terrifying new virus, with potentially devastating consequences for humanity - and for Geoff, who is not only its first victim, but its unwitting source.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Seek","a","new","laboratori","to","pursu","his","controversi","genet","research",",","Dr","Geoff","Burton","take","up","a","posit","at","the","world-renown","Institut","for","Molecular","Cell","Biolog","&","Genet","in","wintri","Dresden",",","Germani",".","His","contribut","to","their","most","top-secret","project","-","a","human","regener","gene","-","has","the","potenti","to","make","someth","miracul","out","of","a","person","tragedi","that","has","haunt","him","for","year",".","But","when","he","uncov","a","conspiraci","amongst","his","colleagu",",","he","find","instead","someth","quit","differ",":","a","terrifi","new","virus",",","with","potenti","devast","consequ","for","human","-","and","for","Geoff",",","who","is","not","onli","it","first","victim",",","but","it","unwit","sourc","."],"lemmas":["seek","a","new","laboratory","to","pursue","he","controversial","genetic","research",",","dr","Geoff","Burton","take","up","a","position","at","the","world-renowned","Institute","for","molecular","Cell","Biology","&","Genetics","in","wintry","Dresden",",","Germany",".","he","contribution","to","they","most","top-secret","project","-","a","human","regeneration","gene","-","have","the","potential","to","make","something","miraculous","out","of","a","personal","tragedy","that","have","haunt","he","for","year",".","but","when","he","uncover","a","conspiracy","amongst","he","colleague",",","he","find","instead","something","quite","different",":","a","terrifying","new","virus",",","with","potentially","devastating","consequence","for","humanity","-","and","for","Geoff",",","who","be","not","only","its","first","victim",",","but","its","unwitting","source","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Seeking a new","a new laboratory","new laboratory to","laboratory to pursue","to pursue his","pursue his controversial","his controversial genetic","controversial genetic research","genetic research ,","research , Dr",", Dr Geoff","Dr Geoff Burton","Geoff Burton takes","Burton takes up","takes up a","up a position","a position at","position at the","at the world-renowned","the world-renowned Institute","world-renowned Institute for","Institute for Molecular","for Molecular Cell","Molecular Cell Biology","Cell Biology &","Biology & Genetics","& Genetics in","Genetics in wintry","in wintry Dresden","wintry Dresden ,","Dresden , Germany","His contribution to","contribution to their","to their most","their most top-secret","most top-secret project","top-secret project -","project -

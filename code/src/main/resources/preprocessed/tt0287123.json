{"title":"The Wednesday Night Save the World Society","plot":"Feeling increasingly trapped, frustrated and alone, middle-aged Los Angeles resident Dee Barnes decides to turn her life (and hopefully the lives of others) around by starting a weekly discussion open to anyone who cares to join. She soon finds her house filled with an assortment of characters, including a bulimic goth, a sexist jerk, and a meek young man who only wants to protect the environment. As they open up to each other with their ideas and feelings, they gradually start to learn more about themselves.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Family"],"stems":["Feel","increas","trap",",","frustrat","and","alon",",","middle-ag","Los","Angele","resid","Dee","Barn","decid","to","turn","her","life","(","and","hope","the","live","of","other",")","around","by","start","a","week","discuss","open","to","anyon","who","care","to","join",".","She","soon","find","her","hous","fill","with","an","assort","of","charact",",","includ","a","bulim","goth",",","a","sexist","jerk",",","and","a","meek","young","man","who","onli","want","to","protect","the","environ",".","As","they","open","up","to","each","other","with","their","idea","and","feel",",","they","gradual","start","to","learn","more","about","themselv","."],"lemmas":["feel","increasingly","trapped",",","frustrated","and","alone",",","middle-aged","Los","Angeles","resident","Dee","Barnes","decide","to","turn","she","life","-lrb-","and","hopefully","the","life","of","other","-rrb-","around","by","start","a","weekly","discussion","open","to","anyone","who","care","to","join",".","she","soon","find","she","house","fill","with","a","assortment","of","character",",","include","a","bulimic","goth",",","a","sexist","jerk",",","and","a","meek","young","man","who","only","want","to","protect","the","environment",".","as","they","open","up","to","each","other","with","they","idea","and","feeling",",","they","gradually","start","to","learn","more","about","themselves","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Feeling increasingly trapped","increasingly trapped ,","trapped , frustrated",", frustrated and","frustrated and alone","and alone ,","alone , middle-aged",", middle-aged Los","middle-aged Los Angeles","Los Angeles resident","Angeles resident Dee","resident Dee Barnes","Dee Barnes decides","Barnes decides to","decides to turn","to turn her","turn her life","her life (","life ( and","( and hopefully","and hopefully the","hopefully the lives","the lives of","lives of others","of others )","others ) around",") around by","around by starting","by starting a","starting a weekly","a weekly discussion","weekly discussion open","discussion open to","open to anyone","to anyone who","anyone who cares","who cares to","cares to join","She soon finds","soon finds her","finds her house","her house filled","house filled with","filled with an","with an assortment","an assortment of","assortment of characters","of characters ,","characters , including",", including a","including a bulimic","a bulimic goth","bulimic goth ,","goth , a",", a sexist","a sexist jerk","sexist jerk ,","jerk , and",", and a","and a meek","a meek young","meek young man","young man who","man who only","who only wants","only wants to","wants to protect","to protect the","protect the environment","As they open","they open up","open up to","up to each","to each other","each other with","other with their","with their ideas","their ideas and","ideas and feelings","and feelings ,","feelings , they",", they gradually","they gradually start","gradually start to","start to learn","to learn more","learn more about","more about themselves"],"2grams":["Feeling increasingly","increasingly trapped","trapped ,",", frustrated","frustrated and","and alone","alone ,",", middle-aged","middle-aged Los","Los Angeles","Angeles resident","resident Dee","Dee Barnes","Barnes decides","decides to","to turn","turn her","her life","life (","( and","and hopefully","hopefully the","the lives","lives of","of others","others )",") around","around by","by starting","starting a","a weekly","weekly discussion","discussion open","open to","to anyone","anyone who","who cares","cares to","to join","She soon","soon finds","finds her","her house","house filled","filled with","with an","an assortment","assortment of","of characters","characters ,",", including","including a","a bulimic","bulimic goth","goth ,",", a","a sexist","sexist jerk","jerk ,",", and","and a","a meek","meek young","young man","man who","who only","only wants","wants to","to protect","protect the","the environment","As they","they open","open up","up to","to each","each other","other with","with their","their ideas","ideas and","and feelings","feelings ,",", they","they gradually","gradually start","start to","to learn","learn more","more about","about themselves"]}

{"title":"My Life in Ruins","plot":"Georgia is an American academic who's lost her teaching job in Athens. She's taken a job as a tour guide, but she hates it and it shows: the tourists, mostly American, are bored with history and facts; they want to shop. Every group has a goofy couple, a frat boy, a sullen teen, a feuding couple, divorcées looking for a mate, and a funny guy. This group is no exception, plus there's no air conditioning and a bearded silent driver. Thanks to an unlikely friendship, plus daisies, an ice-cream cone, the history of syrup, and the Oracle at Delphi, Georgia may have a shot at finding her kefi during this four-day tour.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Georgia","is","an","American","academ","who","'s","lost","her","teach","job","in","Athen",".","She","'s","taken","a","job","as","a","tour","guid",",","but","she","hate","it","and","it","show",":","the","tourist",",","most","American",",","are","bore","with","histori","and","fact",";","they","want","to","shop",".","Everi","group","has","a","goofi","coupl",",","a","frat","boy",",","a","sullen","teen",",","a","feud","coupl",",","divorcé","look","for","a","mate",",","and","a","funni","guy",".","This","group","is","no","except",",","plus","there","'s","no","air","condit","and","a","beard","silent","driver",".","Thank","to","an","unlik","friendship",",","plus","daisi",",","an","ice-cream","cone",",","the","histori","of","syrup",",","and","the","Oracl","at","Delphi",",","Georgia","may","have","a","shot","at","find","her","kefi","dure","this","four-day","tour","."],"lemmas":["Georgia","be","a","american","academic","who","be","lose","she","teaching","job","in","Athens",".","she","be","take","a","job","as","a","tour","guide",",","but","she","hate","it","and","it","show",":","the","tourist",",","mostly","american",",","be","bore","with","history","and","fact",";","they","want","to","shop",".","every","group","have","a","goofy","couple",",","a","frat","boy",",","a","sullen","teen",",","a","feuding","couple",",","divorcées","look","for","a","mate",",","and","a","funny","guy",".","this","group","be","no","exception",",","plus","there","be","no","air","conditioning","and","a","bearded","silent","driver",".","thanks","to","a","unlikely","friendship",",","plus","daisy",",","a","ice-cream","cone",",","the","history","of","syrup",",","and","the","Oracle","at","Delphi",",","Georgia","may","have","a","shot","at","find","she","kefus","during","this","four-day","tour","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Georgia is an","is an American","an American academic","American academic who","academic who 's","who 's lost","'s lost her","lost her teaching","her teaching job","teaching job in","job in Athens","She 's taken","'s taken a","taken a job","a job as","job as a","as a tour","a tour guide","tour guide ,","guide , but",", but she","but she hates","she hates it","hates it and","it and it","and it shows","it shows :","shows : the",": the tourists","the tourists ,","tourists , mostly",", mostly American","mostly American ,","American , are",", are bored","are bored with","bored with history","with history and","history and facts","and facts ;","facts ;

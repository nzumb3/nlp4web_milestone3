{"title":"In My Mother's Arms","plot":"In My Mother's Arms follows several children who live and study in the same room of a small rented house. These are forgotten children whose parents have been killed or kidnapped. They have no one to support them but Husham, a student who works tirelessly to protect them from the dangers of the streets of Baghdad. The landlord demands they vacate his house and now the only sanctuary these children have ever known is about to be lost. The film was shot in 2010: the future of the orphanage has yet to be resolved.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["In","My","Mother","'s","Arms","follow","sever","children","who","live","and","studi","in","the","same","room","of","a","small","rent","hous",".","These","are","forgotten","children","whose","parent","have","been","kill","or","kidnap",".","They","have","no","one","to","support","them","but","Husham",",","a","student","who","work","tireless","to","protect","them","from","the","danger","of","the","street","of","Baghdad",".","The","landlord","demand","they","vacat","his","hous","and","now","the","onli","sanctuari","these","children","have","ever","known","is","about","to","be","lost",".","The","film","was","shot","in","2010",":","the","futur","of","the","orphanag","has","yet","to","be","resolv","."],"lemmas":["in","My","Mother","'s","arm","follow","several","child","who","live","and","study","in","the","same","room","of","a","small","rent","house",".","these","be","forget","child","whose","parent","have","be","kill","or","kidnap",".","they","have","no","one","to","support","they","but","Husham",",","a","student","who","work","tirelessly","to","protect","they","from","the","danger","of","the","street","of","Baghdad",".","the","landlord","demand","they","vacate","he","house","and","now","the","only","sanctuary","these","child","have","ever","know","be","about","to","be","lose",".","the","film","be","shoot","in","2010",":","the","future","of","the","orphanage","have","yet","to","be","resolve","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In My Mother","My Mother 's","Mother 's Arms","'s Arms follows","Arms follows several","follows several children","several children who","children who live","who live and","live and study","and study in","study in the","in the same","the same room","same room of","room of a","of a small","a small rented","small rented house","These are forgotten","are forgotten children","forgotten children whose","children whose parents","whose parents have","parents have been","have been killed","been killed or","killed or kidnapped","They have no","have no one","no one to","one to support","to support them","support them but","them but Husham","but Husham ,","Husham , a",", a student","a student who","student who works","who works tirelessly","works tirelessly to","tirelessly to protect","to protect them","protect them from","them from the","from the dangers","the dangers of","dangers of the","of the streets","the streets of","streets of Baghdad","The landlord demands","landlord demands they","demands they vacate","they vacate his","vacate his house","his house and","house and now","and now the","now the only","the only sanctuary","only sanctuary these","sanctuary these children","these children have","children have ever","have ever known","ever known is","known is about","is about to","about to be","to be lost","The film was","film was shot","was shot in","shot in 2010","in 2010 :","2010 : the",": the future","the future of","future of the","of the orphanage","the orphanage has","orphanage has yet","has yet to","yet to be","to be resolved"],"2grams":["In My","My Mother","Mother 's","'s Arms","Arms follows","follows several","several children","children who","who live","live and","and study","study in","in the","the same","same room","room of","of a","a small","small rented","rented house","These are","are forgotten","forgotten children","children whose","whose parents","parents have","have been","been killed","killed or","or kidnapped","They have","have no","no one","one to","to support","support them","them but","but Husham","Husham ,",", a","a student","student who","who works","works tirelessly","tirelessly to","to protect","protect them","them from","from the","the dangers","dangers of","of the","the streets","streets of","of Baghdad","The landlord","landlord demands","demands they","they vacate","vacate his","his house","house and","and now","now the","the only","only sanctuary","sanctuary these","these children","children have","have ever","ever known","known is","is about","about to","to be","be lost","The film","film was","was shot","shot in","in 2010","2010 :",": the","the future","future of","of the","the orphanage","orphanage has","has yet","yet to","to be","be resolved"]}

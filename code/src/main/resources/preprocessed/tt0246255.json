{"title":"Stoovertpuram Police Station","plot":"The village of Stoovertpuram has always lived in fear and loathing of the police, who they see as a major force of oppression, and a toy of the rich, wealthy and influential, and will have nothing to do with them. When a policeman comes to their village, he gets the same reaction as that of a gang of thugs and robbers, with everyone running, hiding, and closing all doors and windows. In this atmosphere comes Inspector Rana Pratap, a young man who has grown in this small community, and who has vowed to change the way in which the police are perceived.","genres":["Action"," Drama"],"stems":["The","villag","of","Stoovertpuram","has","alway","live","in","fear","and","loath","of","the","polic",",","who","they","see","as","a","major","forc","of","oppress",",","and","a","toy","of","the","rich",",","wealthi","and","influenti",",","and","will","have","noth","to","do","with","them",".","When","a","policeman","come","to","their","villag",",","he","get","the","same","reaction","as","that","of","a","gang","of","thug","and","robber",",","with","everyon","run",",","hide",",","and","close","all","door","and","window",".","In","this","atmospher","come","Inspector","Rana","Pratap",",","a","young","man","who","has","grown","in","this","small","communiti",",","and","who","has","vow","to","chang","the","way","in","which","the","polic","are","perceiv","."],"lemmas":["the","village","of","Stoovertpuram","have","always","live","in","fear","and","loathing","of","the","police",",","who","they","see","as","a","major","force","of","oppression",",","and","a","toy","of","the","rich",",","wealthy","and","influential",",","and","will","have","nothing","to","do","with","they",".","when","a","policeman","come","to","they","village",",","he","get","the","same","reaction","as","that","of","a","gang","of","thug","and","robber",",","with","everyone","running",",","hiding",",","and","close","all","door","and","window",".","in","this","atmosphere","come","Inspector","Rana","Pratap",",","a","young","man","who","have","grow","in","this","small","community",",","and","who","have","vow","to","change","the","way","in","which","the","police","be","perceive","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The village of","village of Stoovertpuram","of Stoovertpuram has","Stoovertpuram has always","has always lived","always lived in","lived in fear","in fear and","fear and loathing","and loathing of","loathing of the","of the police","the police ,","police , who",", who they","who they see","they see as","see as a","as a major","a major force","major force of","force of oppression","of oppression ,","oppression , and",", and a","and a toy","a toy of","toy of the","of the rich","the rich ,","rich , wealthy",", wealthy and","wealthy and influential","and influential ,","influential , and",", and will","and will have","will have nothing","have nothing to","nothing to do","to do with","do with them","When a policeman","a policeman comes","policeman comes to","comes to their","to their village","their village ,","village , he",", he gets","he gets the","gets the same","the same reaction","same reaction as","reaction as that","as that of","that of a","of a gang","a gang of","gang of thugs","of thugs and","thugs and robbers","and robbers ,","robbers , with",", with everyone","with everyone running","everyone running ,","running , hiding",", hiding ,","hiding , and",", and closing","and closing all","closing all doors","all doors and","doors and windows","In this atmosphere","this atmosphere comes","atmosphere comes Inspector","comes Inspector Rana","Inspector Rana Pratap","Rana Pratap ,","Pratap , a",", a young","a young man","young man who","man who has","who has grown","has grown in","grown in this","in this small","this small community","small community ,","community , and",", and who","and who has","who has vowed","has vowed to","vowed to change","to change the","change the way","the way in","way in which","in which the","which the police","the police are","police are perceived"],"2grams":["The village","village of","of Stoovertpuram","Stoovertpuram has","has always","always lived","lived in","in fear","fear and","and loathing","loathing of","of the","the police","police ,",", who","who they","they see","see as","as a","a major","major force","force of","of oppression","oppression ,",", and","and a","a toy","toy of","of the","the rich","rich ,",", wealthy","wealthy and","and influential","influential ,",", and","and will","will have","have nothing","nothing to","to do","do with","with them","When a","a policeman","policeman comes","comes to","to their","their village","village ,",", he","he gets","gets the","the same","same reaction","reaction as","as that","that of","of a","a gang","gang of","of thugs","thugs and","and robbers","robbers ,",", with","with everyone","everyone running","running ,",", hiding","hiding ,",", and","and closing","closing all","all doors","doors and","and windows","In this","this atmosphere","atmosphere comes","comes Inspector","Inspector Rana","Rana Pratap","Pratap ,",", a","a young","young man","man who","who has","has grown","grown in","in this","this small","small community","community ,",", and","and who","who has","has vowed","vowed to","to change","change the","the way","way in","in which","which the","the police","police are","are perceived"]}

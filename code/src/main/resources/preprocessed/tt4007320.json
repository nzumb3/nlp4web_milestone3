{"title":"An American Ascent","plot":"An American Ascent documents the first African American expedition to tackle Denali, North America's highest peak and explores the complex relationship many African-Americans have with the outdoors. As the United States transitions to a 'minority majority' nation, a staggering number of people of color do not identify with America's wild places. By embarking on the grueling multi-week climb of the 20,327ft Denali, nine African-American climbers set out to bridge this 'adventure gap' - challenging outdated notions of what adventure looks like by changing the face of America's biggest and baddest mountain on the 100th anniversary of its first summit.","genres":["Action"," Documentary"," Adventure"],"stems":["An","American","Ascent","document","the","first","African","American","expedit","to","tackl","Denali",",","North","America","'s","highest","peak","and","explor","the","complex","relationship","mani","African-American","have","with","the","outdoor",".","As","the","Unite","State","transit","to","a","'","minor","major","'","nation",",","a","stagger","number","of","peopl","of","color","do","not","identifi","with","America","'s","wild","place",".","By","embark","on","the","gruel","multi-week","climb","of","the","20,327","ft","Denali",",","nine","African-American","climber","set","out","to","bridg","this","'","adventur","gap","'","-","challeng","outdat","notion","of","what","adventur","look","like","by","chang","the","face","of","America","'s","biggest","and","baddest","mountain","on","the","100th","anniversari","of","it","first","summit","."],"lemmas":["a","American","Ascent","document","the","first","african","american","expedition","to","tackle","Denali",",","North","America","'s","highest","peak","and","explore","the","complex","relationship","many","African-Americans","have","with","the","outdoors",".","as","the","United","States","transition","to","a","'","minority","majority","'","nation",",","a","staggering","number","of","people","of","color","do","not","identify","with","America","'s","wild","place",".","by","embark","on","the","grueling","multi-week","climb","of","the","20,327","ft","denali",",","nine","african-american","climber","set","out","to","bridge","this","'","adventure","gap","'","-","challenging","outdated","notion","of","what","adventure","look","like","by","change","the","face","of","America","'s","biggest","and","baddest","mountain","on","the","100th","anniversary","of","its","first","summit","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An American Ascent","American Ascent documents","Ascent documents the","documents the first","the first African","first African American","African American expedition","American expedition to","expedition to tackle","to tackle Denali","tackle Denali ,","Denali , North",", North America","North America 's","America 's highest","'s highest peak","highest peak and","peak and explores","and explores the","explores the complex","the complex relationship","complex relationship many","relationship many African-Americans","many African-Americans have","African-Americans have with","have with the","with the outdoors","As the United","the United States","United States transitions","States transitions to","transitions to a","to a '","a ' minority","' minority majority","minority majority '","majority ' nation","' nation ,","nation , a",", a staggering","a staggering number","staggering number of","number of people","of people of","people of color","of color do","color do not","do not identify","not identify with","identify with America","with America 's","America 's wild","'s wild places","By embarking on","embarking on the","on the grueling","the grueling multi-week","grueling multi-week climb","multi-week climb of","climb of the","of the 20,327","the 20,327 ft","20,327 ft Denali","ft Denali ,","Denali , nine",", nine African-American","nine African-American climbers","African-American climbers set","climbers set out","set out to","out to bridge","to bridge this","bridge this '","this ' adventure","' adventure gap","adventure gap '","gap ' -","' -

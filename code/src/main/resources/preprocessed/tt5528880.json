{"title":"Lives Well Lived","plot":"What is the definition of a Life Well Lived? We asked forty people aged 75-100 with a collective life experience of 3000 years who shared with us their secrets, wit, and wisdom. Forty voices, one shared history of lives well lived. The Lives Well Lived project captures the images, ideas and ideals of those who are proving that aging is something to cherish, not dread. That retirement doesn't mean you retire from life. And that growing older doesn't mean growing silent.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["What","is","the","definit","of","a","Life","Well","Live","?","We","ask","forti","peopl","age","75-100","with","a","collect","life","experi","of","3000","year","who","share","with","us","their","secret",",","wit",",","and","wisdom",".","Forti","voic",",","one","share","histori","of","live","well","live",".","The","Live","Well","Live","project","captur","the","imag",",","idea","and","ideal","of","those","who","are","prove","that","age","is","someth","to","cherish",",","not","dread",".","That","retir","doe","n't","mean","you","retir","from","life",".","And","that","grow","older","doe","n't","mean","grow","silent","."],"lemmas":["what","be","the","definition","of","a","Life","Well","Lived","?","we","ask","forty","people","aged","75-100","with","a","collective","life","experience","of","3000","year","who","share","with","we","they","secret",",","wit",",","and","wisdom",".","forty","voice",",","one","shared","history","of","life","well","live",".","the","life","Well","Lived","project","capture","the","image",",","idea","and","ideal","of","those","who","be","prove","that","aging","be","something","to","cherish",",","not","dread",".","that","retirement","do","not","mean","you","retire","from","life",".","and","that","grow","older","do","not","mean","grow","silent","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["What is the","is the definition","the definition of","definition of a","of a Life","a Life Well","Life Well Lived","We asked forty","asked forty people","forty people aged","people aged 75-100","aged 75-100 with","75-100 with a","with a collective","a collective life","collective life experience","life experience of","experience of 3000","of 3000 years","3000 years who","years who shared","who shared with","shared with us","with us their","us their secrets","their secrets ,","secrets , wit",", wit ,","wit , and",", and wisdom","Forty voices ,","voices , one",", one shared","one shared history","shared history of","history of lives","of lives well","lives well lived","The Lives Well","Lives Well Lived","Well Lived project","Lived project captures","project captures the","captures the images","the images ,","images , ideas",", ideas and","ideas and ideals","and ideals of","ideals of those","of those who","those who are","who are proving","are proving that","proving that aging","that aging is","aging is something","is something to","something to cherish","to cherish ,","cherish , not",", not dread","That retirement does","retirement does n't","does n't mean","n't mean you","mean you retire","you retire from","retire from life","And that growing","that growing older","growing older does","older does n't","does n't mean","n't mean growing","mean growing silent"],"2grams":["What is","is the","the definition","definition of","of a","a Life","Life Well","Well Lived","We asked","asked forty","forty people","people aged","aged 75-100","75-100 with","with a","a collective","collective life","life experience","experience of","of 3000","3000 years","years who","who shared","shared with","with us","us their","their secrets","secrets ,",", wit","wit ,",", and","and wisdom","Forty voices","voices ,",", one","one shared","shared history","history of","of lives","lives well","well lived","The Lives","Lives Well","Well Lived","Lived project","project captures","captures the","the images","images ,",", ideas","ideas and","and ideals","ideals of","of those","those who","who are","are proving","proving that","that aging","aging is","is something","something to","to cherish","cherish ,",", not","not dread","That retirement","retirement does","does n't","n't mean","mean you","you retire","retire from","from life","And that","that growing","growing older","older does","does n't","n't mean","mean growing","growing silent"]}

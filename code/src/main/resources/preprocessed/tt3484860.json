{"title":"The 25,000 Mile Love Story","plot":"Swiss endurance athlete Serge Roetheli's thirst for adventure and desire to raise money and awareness for children suffering across the globe propelled him to run a distance equal to the earth's circumference. Accompanied by his equally adventurous wife Nicole, who drove a motorcycle with their supplies and pup tent in tow, they planned and executed the journey of a lifetime. Leaving from Sion, Switzerland in 2000, they returned five years later having traversed six continents and thirty-five countries. Alone in the world's most unforgiving landscapes they confronted challenges that threatened to push them beyond their physical and emotional limits - extreme weather, civil unrest, deadly disease, horrific poverty and a variety of other life-threatening events.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Swiss","endur","athlet","Serg","Roeth","'s","thirst","for","adventur","and","desir","to","rais","money","and","awar","for","children","suffer","across","the","globe","propel","him","to","run","a","distanc","equal","to","the","earth","'s","circumfer",".","Accompani","by","his","equal","adventur","wife","Nicol",",","who","drove","a","motorcycl","with","their","suppli","and","pup","tent","in","tow",",","they","plan","and","execut","the","journey","of","a","lifetim",".","Leav","from","Sion",",","Switzerland","in","2000",",","they","return","five","year","later","have","travers","six","contin","and","thirty-f","countri",".","Alone","in","the","world","'s","most","unforgiv","landscap","they","confront","challeng","that","threaten","to","push","them","beyond","their","physic","and","emot","limit","-","extrem","weather",",","civil","unrest",",","dead","diseas",",","horrif","poverti","and","a","varieti","of","other","life-threaten","event","."],"lemmas":["swiss","endurance","athlete","Serge","Roetheli","'s","thirst","for","adventure","and","desire","to","raise","money","and","awareness","for","child","suffer","across","the","globe","propel","he","to","run","a","distance","equal","to","the","earth","'s","circumference",".","accompany","by","he","equally","adventurous","wife","Nicole",",","who","drive","a","motorcycle","with","they","supplies","and","pup","tent","in","tow",",","they","plan","and","execute","the","journey","of","a","lifetime",".","leave","from","Sion",",","Switzerland","in","2000",",","they","return","five","year","later","have","traverse","six","continent","and","thirty-five","country",".","alone","in","the","world","'s","most","unforgiving","landscape","they","confront","challenge","that","threaten","to","push","they","beyond","they","physical","and","emotional","limit","-","extreme","weather",",","civil","unrest",",","deadly","disease",",","horrific","poverty","and","a","variety","of","other","life-threatening","event","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Swiss endurance athlete","endurance athlete Serge","athlete Serge Roetheli","Serge Roetheli 's","Roetheli 's thirst","'s thirst for","thirst for adventure","for adventure and","adventure and desire","and desire to","desire to raise","to raise money","raise money and","money and awareness","and awareness for","awareness for children","for children suffering","children suffering across","suffering across the","across the globe","the globe propelled","globe propelled him","propelled him to","him to run","to run a","run a distance","a distance equal","distance equal to","equal to the","to the earth","the earth 's","earth 's circumference","Accompanied by his","by his equally","his equally adventurous","equally adventurous wife","adventurous wife Nicole","wife Nicole ,","Nicole , who",", who drove","who drove a","drove a motorcycle","a motorcycle with","motorcycle with their","with their supplies","their supplies and","supplies and pup","and pup tent","pup tent in","tent in tow","in tow ,","tow , they",", they planned","they planned and","planned and executed","and executed the","executed the journey","the journey of","journey of a","of a lifetime","Leaving from Sion","from Sion ,","Sion , Switzerland",", Switzerland in","Switzerland in 2000","in 2000 ,","2000 , they",", they returned","they returned five","returned five years","five years later","years later having","later having traversed","having traversed six","traversed six continents","six continents and","continents and thirty-five","and thirty-five countries","Alone in the","in the world","the world 's","world 's most","'s most unforgiving","most unforgiving landscapes","unforgiving landscapes they","landscapes they confronted","they confronted challenges","confronted challenges that","challenges that threatened","that threatened to","threatened to push","to push them","push them beyond","them beyond their","beyond their physical","their physical and","physical and emotional","and emotional limits","emotional limits -","limits -

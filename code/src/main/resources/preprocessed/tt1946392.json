{"title":"Shifter","plot":"Carry (Janessa O'Hearn) is still grieving over the recent death of her brother. She organizes a weekend get-away with her friends to the family cabin, only to discover her brother Ryan (Pale Christian Thomas) is not deceased, mysteriously showing up, without memory of who he is. Meanwhile Carry's two best friends, Michelle (Nicole Watson) Ryan's ex-girlfriend, now looking to rekindle the flame, having never gotten over him; while Robyn (Lia Como) is just the opposite, uneasy from the moment he entered the cabin, quietly analyzing everything about the unexpected new guest. The other friends, lead by Nigel (Brett Wise), Bailey (Nathan Dashwood) and Terry (Wade Gibb) are too stoned to know any better or even care, as long as getting laid is involved. Enter Clea (Tamara Prescott) and James (Drew Taylor) the eldest and more skeptical of the group, unclear who is telling the truth, that is until Ryan's true identity is revealed, taking this situation on a twist, that no one saw coming.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Horror"],"stems":["Carri","(","Janessa","O'Hearn",")","is","still","griev","over","the","recent","death","of","her","brother",".","She","organ","a","weekend","get-away","with","her","friend","to","the","famili","cabin",",","onli","to","discov","her","brother","Ryan","(","Pale","Christian","Thoma",")","is","not","deceas",",","mysteri","show","up",",","without","memori","of","who","he","is",".","Meanwhil","Carri","'s","two","best","friend",",","Michell","(","Nicol","Watson",")","Ryan","'s","ex-girlfriend",",","now","look","to","rekindl","the","flame",",","have","never","gotten","over","him",";","while","Robyn","(","Lia","Como",")","is","just","the","opposit",",","uneasi","from","the","moment","he","enter","the","cabin",",","quiet","analyz","everyth","about","the","unexpect","new","guest",".","The","other","friend",",","lead","by","Nigel","(","Brett","Wise",")",",","Bailey","(","Nathan","Dashwood",")","and","Terri","(","Wade","Gibb",")","are","too","stone","to","know","ani","better","or","even","care",",","as","long","as","get","laid","is","involv",".","Enter","Clea","(","Tamara","Prescott",")","and","Jame","(","Drew","Taylor",")","the","eldest","and","more","skeptic","of","the","group",",","unclear","who","is","tell","the","truth",",","that","is","until","Ryan","'s","true","ident","is","reveal",",","take","this","situat","on","a","twist",",","that","no","one","saw","come","."],"lemmas":["Carry","-lrb-","Janessa","O'Hearn","-rrb-","be","still","grieve","over","the","recent","death","of","she","brother",".","she","organize","a","weekend","get-away","with","she","friend","to","the","family","cabin",",","only","to","discover","she","brother","Ryan","-lrb-","Pale","Christian","Thomas","-rrb-","be","not","decease",",","mysteriously","show","up",",","without","memory","of","who","he","be",".","meanwhile","Carry","'s","two","best","friend",",","Michelle","-lrb-","Nicole","Watson","-rrb-","Ryan","'s","ex-girlfriend",",","now","look","to","rekindle","the","flame",",","have","never","get","over","he",";","while","Robyn","-lrb-","Lia","Como","-rrb-","be","just","the","opposite",",","uneasy","from","the","moment","he","enter","the","cabin",",","quietly","analyze","everything","about","the","unexpected","new","guest",".","the","other","friend",",","lead","by","Nigel","-lrb-","Brett","Wise","-rrb-",",","Bailey","-lrb-","Nathan","Dashwood","-rrb-","and","Terry","-lrb-","Wade","Gibb","-rrb-","be","too","stone","to","know","any","better","or","even","care",",","as","long","as","get","lay","be","involve",".","enter","Clea","-lrb-","Tamara","Prescott","-rrb-","and","James","-lrb-","Drew","Taylor","-rrb-","the","eldest","and","more","skeptical","of","the","group",",","unclear","who","be","tell","the","truth",",","that","be","until","Ryan","'s","true","identity","be","reveal",",","take","this","situation","on","a","twist",",","that","no","one","saw","come","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Carry ( Janessa","( Janessa O'Hearn","Janessa O'Hearn )","O'Hearn ) is",") is still","is still grieving","still grieving over","grieving over the","over the recent","the recent death","recent death of","death of her","of her brother","She organizes a","organizes a weekend","a weekend get-away","weekend get-away with","get-away with her","with her friends","her friends to","friends to the","to the family","the family cabin","family cabin ,","cabin , only",", only to","only to discover","to discover her","discover her brother","her brother Ryan","brother Ryan (","Ryan ( Pale","( Pale Christian","Pale Christian Thomas","Christian Thomas )","Thomas ) is",") is not","is not deceased","not deceased ,","deceased , mysteriously",", mysteriously showing","mysteriously showing up","showing up ,","up , without",", without memory","without memory of","memory of who","of who he","who he is","Meanwhile Carry 's","Carry 's two","'s two best","two best friends","best friends ,","friends , Michelle",", Michelle (","Michelle ( Nicole","( Nicole Watson","Nicole Watson )","Watson ) Ryan",") Ryan 's","Ryan 's ex-girlfriend","'s ex-girlfriend ,","ex-girlfriend , now",", now looking","now looking to","looking to rekindle","to rekindle the","rekindle the flame","the flame ,","flame , having",", having never","having never gotten","never gotten over","gotten over him","over him ;","him ;

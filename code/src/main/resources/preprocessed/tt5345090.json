{"title":"Measure for Measure","plot":"When the Duke of Vienna takes a mysterious leave of absence and leaves the strict Angelo in charge, things couldn't be worse for Claudio, who is sentenced to death for premarital sex. His sister, Isabella (a nun-in-training), however, is a very persuasive pleader. She goes to Angelo, but instead of freeing her brother, she gets an offer from Angelo to save Claudio's life if Isabella sleeps with him. The only sympathetic friend Isabella has is a priest who, in actuality, is the Duke in disguise...and he has a plan.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","the","Duke","of","Vienna","take","a","mysteri","leav","of","absenc","and","leav","the","strict","Angelo","in","charg",",","thing","could","n't","be","wors","for","Claudio",",","who","is","sentenc","to","death","for","premarit","sex",".","His","sister",",","Isabella","(","a","nun-in-train",")",",","howev",",","is","a","veri","persuas","pleader",".","She","goe","to","Angelo",",","but","instead","of","free","her","brother",",","she","get","an","offer","from","Angelo","to","save","Claudio","'s","life","if","Isabella","sleep","with","him",".","The","onli","sympathet","friend","Isabella","has","is","a","priest","who",",","in","actual",",","is","the","Duke","in","disguis","...","and","he","has","a","plan","."],"lemmas":["when","the","Duke","of","Vienna","take","a","mysterious","leave","of","absence","and","leave","the","strict","Angelo","in","charge",",","thing","could","not","be","worse","for","Claudio",",","who","be","sentence","to","death","for","premarital","sex",".","he","sister",",","Isabella","-lrb-","a","nun-in-training","-rrb-",",","however",",","be","a","very","persuasive","pleader",".","she","go","to","Angelo",",","but","instead","of","free","she","brother",",","she","get","a","offer","from","Angelo","to","save","Claudio","'s","life","if","Isabella","sleep","with","he",".","the","only","sympathetic","friend","Isabella","have","be","a","priest","who",",","in","actuality",",","be","the","Duke","in","disguise","...","and","he","have","a","plan","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When the Duke","the Duke of","Duke of Vienna","of Vienna takes","Vienna takes a","takes a mysterious","a mysterious leave","mysterious leave of","leave of absence","of absence and","absence and leaves","and leaves the","leaves the strict","the strict Angelo","strict Angelo in","Angelo in charge","in charge ,","charge , things",", things could","things could n't","could n't be","n't be worse","be worse for","worse for Claudio","for Claudio ,","Claudio , who",", who is","who is sentenced","is sentenced to","sentenced to death","to death for","death for premarital","for premarital sex","His sister ,","sister , Isabella",", Isabella (","Isabella ( a","( a nun-in-training","a nun-in-training )","nun-in-training ) ,",") , however",", however ,","however , is",", is a","is a very","a very persuasive","very persuasive pleader","She goes to","goes to Angelo","to Angelo ,","Angelo , but",", but instead","but instead of","instead of freeing","of freeing her","freeing her brother","her brother ,","brother , she",", she gets","she gets an","gets an offer","an offer from","offer from Angelo","from Angelo to","Angelo to save","to save Claudio","save Claudio 's","Claudio 's life","'s life if","life if Isabella","if Isabella sleeps","Isabella sleeps with","sleeps with him","The only sympathetic","only sympathetic friend","sympathetic friend Isabella","friend Isabella has","Isabella has is","has is a","is a priest","a priest who","priest who ,","who , in",", in actuality","in actuality ,","actuality , is",", is the","is the Duke","the Duke in","Duke in disguise","in disguise ...","disguise ... and","... and he","and he has","he has a","has a plan"],"2grams":["When the","the Duke","Duke of","of Vienna","Vienna takes","takes a","a mysterious","mysterious leave","leave of","of absence","absence and","and leaves","leaves the","the strict","strict Angelo","Angelo in","in charge","charge ,",", things","things could","could n't","n't be","be worse","worse for","for Claudio","Claudio ,",", who","who is","is sentenced","sentenced to","to death","death for","for premarital","premarital sex","His sister","sister ,",", Isabella","Isabella (","( a","a nun-in-training","nun-in-training )",") ,",", however","however ,",", is","is a","a very","very persuasive","persuasive pleader","She goes","goes to","to Angelo","Angelo ,",", but","but instead","instead of","of freeing","freeing her","her brother","brother ,",", she","she gets","gets an","an offer","offer from","from Angelo","Angelo to","to save","save Claudio","Claudio 's","'s life","life if","if Isabella","Isabella sleeps","sleeps with","with him","The only","only sympathetic","sympathetic friend","friend Isabella","Isabella has","has is","is a","a priest","priest who","who ,",", in","in actuality","actuality ,",", is","is the","the Duke","Duke in","in disguise","disguise ...","... and","and he","he has","has a","a plan"]}

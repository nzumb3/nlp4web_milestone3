{"title":"Quick, Quick, Slow","plot":"A comedy about ordinary people taking part in a dance competition. China hosts the Olympics for the first time. The whole country is excited. The forgotten generation, the same age as Red China - once passionate in their youth, then sent to the countryside in every corner of China for re-education - wants to be a part of it. A group of people - a security guard in his middle age crisis, a desperate housewife, a fame-seeker and her admirer, an odd couple at their fifties, started their own dance team. They practiced; they dreamed; they struggled. Is this for real or it is just a dream?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","comedi","about","ordinari","peopl","take","part","in","a","danc","competit",".","China","host","the","Olympic","for","the","first","time",".","The","whole","countri","is","excit",".","The","forgotten","generat",",","the","same","age","as","Red","China","-","onc","passion","in","their","youth",",","then","sent","to","the","countrysid","in","everi","corner","of","China","for","re-educ","-","want","to","be","a","part","of","it",".","A","group","of","peopl","-","a","secur","guard","in","his","middl","age","crisi",",","a","desper","housewif",",","a","fame-seek","and","her","admir",",","an","odd","coupl","at","their","fifti",",","start","their","own","danc","team",".","They","practic",";","they","dream",";","they","struggl",".","Is","this","for","real","or","it","is","just","a","dream","?"],"lemmas":["a","comedy","about","ordinary","people","take","part","in","a","dance","competition",".","China","host","the","Olympics","for","the","first","time",".","the","whole","country","be","excite",".","the","forget","generation",",","the","same","age","as","Red","China","-","once","passionate","in","they","youth",",","then","send","to","the","countryside","in","every","corner","of","China","for","re-education","-","want","to","be","a","part","of","it",".","a","group","of","people","-","a","security","guard","in","he","middle","age","crisis",",","a","desperate","housewife",",","a","fame-seeker","and","she","admirer",",","a","odd","couple","at","they","fifty",",","start","they","own","dance","team",".","they","practice",";","they","dream",";","they","struggle",".","be","this","for","real","or","it","be","just","a","dream","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A comedy about","comedy about ordinary","about ordinary people","ordinary people taking","people taking part","taking part in","part in a","in a dance","a dance competition","China hosts the","hosts the Olympics","the Olympics for","Olympics for the","for the first","the first time","The whole country","whole country is","country is excited","The forgotten generation","forgotten generation ,","generation , the",", the same","the same age","same age as","age as Red","as Red China","Red China -","China - once","- once passionate","once passionate in","passionate in their","in their youth","their youth ,","youth , then",", then sent","then sent to","sent to the","to the countryside","the countryside in","countryside in every","in every corner","every corner of","corner of China","of China for","China for re-education","for re-education -","re-education - wants","- wants to","wants to be","to be a","be a part","a part of","part of it","A group of","group of people","of people -","people - a","- a security","a security guard","security guard in","guard in his","in his middle","his middle age","middle age crisis","age crisis ,","crisis , a",", a desperate","a desperate housewife","desperate housewife ,","housewife , a",", a fame-seeker","a fame-seeker and","fame-seeker and her","and her admirer","her admirer ,","admirer , an",", an odd","an odd couple","odd couple at","couple at their","at their fifties","their fifties ,","fifties , started",", started their","started their own","their own dance","own dance team","They practiced ;","practiced ; they","; they dreamed","they dreamed ;","dreamed ; they","; they struggled","Is this for","this for real","for real or","real or it","or it is","it is just","is just a","just a dream"],"2grams":["A comedy","comedy about","about ordinary","ordinary people","people taking","taking part","part in","in a","a dance","dance competition","China hosts","hosts the","the Olympics","Olympics for","for the","the first","first time","The whole","whole country","country is","is excited","The forgotten","forgotten generation","generation ,",", the","the same","same age","age as","as Red","Red China","China -","- once","once passionate","passionate in","in their","their youth","youth ,",", then","then sent","sent to","to the","the countryside","countryside in","in every","every corner","corner of","of China","China for","for re-education","re-education -","- wants","wants to","to be","be a","a part","part of","of it","A group","group of","of people","people -","- a","a security","security guard","guard in","in his","his middle","middle age","age crisis","crisis ,",", a","a desperate","desperate housewife","housewife ,",", a","a fame-seeker","fame-seeker and","and her","her admirer","admirer ,",", an","an odd","odd couple","couple at","at their","their fifties","fifties ,",", started","started their","their own","own dance","dance team","They practiced","practiced ;","; they","they dreamed","dreamed ;","; they","they struggled","Is this","this for","for real","real or","or it","it is","is just","just a","a dream"]}

{"title":"Wonderland","plot":"There's little wonder in the working-class lives of Bill, Eileen, and their three grown daughters. They're lonely Londoners. Nadia, a cafe waitress, places personal ads, looking for love; Debbie, a single mom, entertains men at the hair salon after hours; her son spends part of the weekend with her ex, a man with a hair-trigger temper. Molly is expecting her first baby and its father acts as if the responsibility is too much for him. Eileen is bitter, complaining about her husband and the dog next door; Bill's a doormat. His West Indian neighbor offers him a drink; her own grown son locks himself in his room most of the time. Will anyone connect during this Guy Fawkes weekend?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["There","'s","littl","wonder","in","the","working-class","live","of","Bill",",","Eileen",",","and","their","three","grown","daughter",".","They","re","lone","London",".","Nadia",",","a","cafe","waitress",",","place","person","ad",",","look","for","love",";","Debbi",",","a","singl","mom",",","entertain","men","at","the","hair","salon","after","hour",";","her","son","spend","part","of","the","weekend","with","her","ex",",","a","man","with","a","hair-trigg","temper",".","Molli","is","expect","her","first","babi","and","it","father","act","as","if","the","respons","is","too","much","for","him",".","Eileen","is","bitter",",","complain","about","her","husband","and","the","dog","next","door",";","Bill","'s","a","doormat",".","His","West","Indian","neighbor","offer","him","a","drink",";","her","own","grown","son","lock","himself","in","his","room","most","of","the","time",".","Will","anyon","connect","dure","this","Guy","Fawk","weekend","?"],"lemmas":["there","'s","little","wonder","in","the","working-class","life","of","Bill",",","Eileen",",","and","they","three","grown","daughter",".","they","be","lonely","londoner",".","Nadia",",","a","cafe","waitress",",","place","personal","ad",",","look","for","love",";","Debbie",",","a","single","mom",",","entertain","man","at","the","hair","salon","after","hour",";","she","son","spend","part","of","the","weekend","with","she","ex",",","a","man","with","a","hair-trigger","temper",".","Molly","be","expect","she","first","baby","and","its","father","act","as","if","the","responsibility","be","too","much","for","he",".","Eileen","be","bitter",",","complain","about","she","husband","and","the","dog","next","door",";","Bill","be","a","doormat",".","he","West","Indian","neighbor","offer","he","a","drink",";","she","own","grown","son","lock","himself","in","he","room","most","of","the","time",".","will","anyone","connect","during","this","Guy","Fawkes","weekend","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["There 's little","'s little wonder","little wonder in","wonder in the","in the working-class","the working-class lives","working-class lives of","lives of Bill","of Bill ,","Bill , Eileen",", Eileen ,","Eileen , and",", and their","and their three","their three grown","three grown daughters","They 're lonely","'re lonely Londoners","Nadia , a",", a cafe","a cafe waitress","cafe waitress ,","waitress , places",", places personal","places personal ads","personal ads ,","ads , looking",", looking for","looking for love","for love ;","love ;

{"title":"Peaceful Exit","plot":"Anyone who has watched one in pain will know the agonising plight and moral dilema of Jim and Bronwyn Stewart. Severe brain damage has left their 2-year-old son Ian in a living hell: he can barely see, is almost deaf, has fits and is in constant pain. Doctors can do nothing for him and his prognosis is 5 years maximum. Jim and Bronwyn care for him night and day, but they would like to end their child's suffering humanely - by lethal injection. But in Britain, euthanasia is illegal.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Anyon","who","has","watch","one","in","pain","will","know","the","agonis","plight","and","moral","dilema","of","Jim","and","Bronwyn","Stewart",".","Sever","brain","damag","has","left","their","2-year-old","son","Ian","in","a","live","hell",":","he","can","bare","see",",","is","almost","deaf",",","has","fit","and","is","in","constant","pain",".","Doctor","can","do","noth","for","him","and","his","prognosi","is","5","year","maximum",".","Jim","and","Bronwyn","care","for","him","night","and","day",",","but","they","would","like","to","end","their","child","'s","suffer","human","-","by","lethal","inject",".","But","in","Britain",",","euthanasia","is","illeg","."],"lemmas":["anyone","who","have","watch","one","in","pain","will","know","the","agonising","plight","and","moral","dilema","of","Jim","and","Bronwyn","Stewart",".","severe","brain","damage","have","leave","they","2-year-old","son","Ian","in","a","living","hell",":","he","can","barely","see",",","be","almost","deaf",",","have","fit","and","be","in","constant","pain",".","doctor","can","do","nothing","for","he","and","he","prognosis","be","5","year","maximum",".","Jim","and","Bronwyn","care","for","he","night","and","day",",","but","they","would","like","to","end","they","child","'s","suffering","humanely","-","by","lethal","injection",".","but","in","Britain",",","euthanasia","be","illegal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Anyone who has","who has watched","has watched one","watched one in","one in pain","in pain will","pain will know","will know the","know the agonising","the agonising plight","agonising plight and","plight and moral","and moral dilema","moral dilema of","dilema of Jim","of Jim and","Jim and Bronwyn","and Bronwyn Stewart","Severe brain damage","brain damage has","damage has left","has left their","left their 2-year-old","their 2-year-old son","2-year-old son Ian","son Ian in","Ian in a","in a living","a living hell","living hell :","hell : he",": he can","he can barely","can barely see","barely see ,","see , is",", is almost","is almost deaf","almost deaf ,","deaf , has",", has fits","has fits and","fits and is","and is in","is in constant","in constant pain","Doctors can do","can do nothing","do nothing for","nothing for him","for him and","him and his","and his prognosis","his prognosis is","prognosis is 5","is 5 years","5 years maximum","Jim and Bronwyn","and Bronwyn care","Bronwyn care for","care for him","for him night","him night and","night and day","and day ,","day , but",", but they","but they would","they would like","would like to","like to end","to end their","end their child","their child 's","child 's suffering","'s suffering humanely","suffering humanely -","humanely - by","- by lethal","by lethal injection","But in Britain","in Britain ,","Britain , euthanasia",", euthanasia is","euthanasia is illegal"],"2grams":["Anyone who","who has","has watched","watched one","one in","in pain","pain will","will know","know the","the agonising","agonising plight","plight and","and moral","moral dilema","dilema of","of Jim","Jim and","and Bronwyn","Bronwyn Stewart","Severe brain","brain damage","damage has","has left","left their","their 2-year-old","2-year-old son","son Ian","Ian in","in a","a living","living hell","hell :",": he","he can","can barely","barely see","see ,",", is","is almost","almost deaf","deaf ,",", has","has fits","fits and","and is","is in","in constant","constant pain","Doctors can","can do","do nothing","nothing for","for him","him and","and his","his prognosis","prognosis is","is 5","5 years","years maximum","Jim and","and Bronwyn","Bronwyn care","care for","for him","him night","night and","and day","day ,",", but","but they","they would","would like","like to","to end","end their","their child","child 's","'s suffering","suffering humanely","humanely -","- by","by lethal","lethal injection","But in","in Britain","Britain ,",", euthanasia","euthanasia is","is illegal"]}

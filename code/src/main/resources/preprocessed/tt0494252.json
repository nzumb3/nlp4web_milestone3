{"title":"A Little Party","plot":"Tom, a West Coast transplant, has just bought his first home in Los Angeles. Persuaded by Gabriella, his beautiful Italian girlfriend, he decides to throw a housewarming party. His old friends from Boston fly in to join his new friends from California. The guest list includes a shady lawyer, a straight-laced pastor, a TV-addicted real estate agent, a convicted killer, a karate-kid law student, a conflicted cop, a short-fused ex-Marine, and a mouthy Italian. When an uninvited, six-foot-six hitman - sporting dreadlocks, a top hat, and a bright pink shirt - shows up to collect a debt...the party's over.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Tom",",","a","West","Coast","transplant",",","has","just","bought","his","first","home","in","Los","Angele",".","Persuad","by","Gabriella",",","his","beauti","Italian","girlfriend",",","he","decid","to","throw","a","housewarm","parti",".","His","old","friend","from","Boston","fli","in","to","join","his","new","friend","from","California",".","The","guest","list","includ","a","shadi","lawyer",",","a","straight-lac","pastor",",","a","TV-addict","real","estat","agent",",","a","convict","killer",",","a","karate-kid","law","student",",","a","conflict","cop",",","a","short-fus","ex-Marin",",","and","a","mouthi","Italian",".","When","an","uninvit",",","six-foot-six","hitman","-","sport","dreadlock",",","a","top","hat",",","and","a","bright","pink","shirt","-","show","up","to","collect","a","debt","...","the","parti","'s","over","."],"lemmas":["Tom",",","a","West","Coast","transplant",",","have","just","buy","he","first","home","in","Los","Angeles",".","persuade","by","Gabriella",",","he","beautiful","italian","girlfriend",",","he","decide","to","throw","a","housewarming","party",".","he","old","friend","from","Boston","fly","in","to","join","he","new","friend","from","California",".","the","guest","list","include","a","shady","lawyer",",","a","straight-laced","pastor",",","a","tv-addicted","real","estate","agent",",","a","convict","killer",",","a","karate-kid","law","student",",","a","conflicted","cop",",","a","short-fused","ex-marine",",","and","a","mouthy","Italian",".","when","a","uninvited",",","six-foot-six","hitman","-","sport","dreadlock",",","a","top","hat",",","and","a","bright","pink","shirt","-","show","up","to","collect","a","debt","...","the","party","'s","over","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Tom , a",", a West","a West Coast","West Coast transplant","Coast transplant ,","transplant , has",", has just","has just bought","just bought his","bought his first","his first home","first home in","home in Los","in Los Angeles","Persuaded by Gabriella","by Gabriella ,","Gabriella , his",", his beautiful","his beautiful Italian","beautiful Italian girlfriend","Italian girlfriend ,","girlfriend , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to throw","to throw a","throw a housewarming","a housewarming party","His old friends","old friends from","friends from Boston","from Boston fly","Boston fly in","fly in to","in to join","to join his","join his new","his new friends","new friends from","friends from California","The guest list","guest list includes","list includes a","includes a shady","a shady lawyer","shady lawyer ,","lawyer , a",", a straight-laced","a straight-laced pastor","straight-laced pastor ,","pastor , a",", a TV-addicted","a TV-addicted real","TV-addicted real estate","real estate agent","estate agent ,","agent , a",", a convicted","a convicted killer","convicted killer ,","killer , a",", a karate-kid","a karate-kid law","karate-kid law student","law student ,","student , a",", a conflicted","a conflicted cop","conflicted cop ,","cop , a",", a short-fused","a short-fused ex-Marine","short-fused ex-Marine ,","ex-Marine , and",", and a","and a mouthy","a mouthy Italian","When an uninvited","an uninvited ,","uninvited , six-foot-six",", six-foot-six hitman","six-foot-six hitman -","hitman -

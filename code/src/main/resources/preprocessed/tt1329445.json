{"title":"Summer Blink","plot":"Mina is 18. She is graduating from high school and is facing the summer that is the prologue to her new life. A life of no college plans, no job, no money, and no idea of what she's going to do once September comes and all of her friends are gone to college. But she does have the summer, and an opportunity to still surprise herself by what life can bring when you least expect it. Summer Blink chronicles a summer full of orange-hued memories and sweeping sensory overload. A time when you did everything society and your parents warned you not to just to prove you were alive.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Mina","is","18",".","She","is","graduat","from","high","school","and","is","face","the","summer","that","is","the","prologu","to","her","new","life",".","A","life","of","no","colleg","plan",",","no","job",",","no","money",",","and","no","idea","of","what","she","'s","go","to","do","onc","Septemb","come","and","all","of","her","friend","are","gone","to","colleg",".","But","she","doe","have","the","summer",",","and","an","opportun","to","still","surpris","herself","by","what","life","can","bring","when","you","least","expect","it",".","Summer","Blink","chronicl","a","summer","full","of","orange-hu","memori","and","sweep","sensori","overload",".","A","time","when","you","did","everyth","societi","and","your","parent","warn","you","not","to","just","to","prove","you","were","aliv","."],"lemmas":["Mina","be","18",".","she","be","graduate","from","high","school","and","be","face","the","summer","that","be","the","prologue","to","she","new","life",".","a","life","of","no","college","plan",",","no","job",",","no","money",",","and","no","idea","of","what","she","be","go","to","do","once","September","come","and","all","of","she","friend","be","go","to","college",".","but","she","do","have","the","summer",",","and","a","opportunity","to","still","surprise","herself","by","what","life","can","bring","when","you","least","expect","it",".","Summer","Blink","chronicle","a","summer","full","of","orange-hued","memory","and","sweeping","sensory","overload",".","a","time","when","you","do","everything","society","and","you","parent","warn","you","not","to","just","to","prove","you","be","alive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Mina is 18","She is graduating","is graduating from","graduating from high","from high school","high school and","school and is","and is facing","is facing the","facing the summer","the summer that","summer that is","that is the","is the prologue","the prologue to","prologue to her","to her new","her new life","A life of","life of no","of no college","no college plans","college plans ,","plans , no",", no job","no job ,","job , no",", no money","no money ,","money , and",", and no","and no idea","no idea of","idea of what","of what she","what she 's","she 's going","'s going to","going to do","to do once","do once September","once September comes","September comes and","comes and all","and all of","all of her","of her friends","her friends are","friends are gone","are gone to","gone to college","But she does","she does have","does have the","have the summer","the summer ,","summer , and",", and an","and an opportunity","an opportunity to","opportunity to still","to still surprise","still surprise herself","surprise herself by","herself by what","by what life","what life can","life can bring","can bring when","bring when you","when you least","you least expect","least expect it","Summer Blink chronicles","Blink chronicles a","chronicles a summer","a summer full","summer full of","full of orange-hued","of orange-hued memories","orange-hued memories and","memories and sweeping","and sweeping sensory","sweeping sensory overload","A time when","time when you","when you did","you did everything","did everything society","everything society and","society and your","and your parents","your parents warned","parents warned you","warned you not","you not to","not to just","to just to","just to prove","to prove you","prove you were","you were alive"],"2grams":["Mina is","is 18","She is","is graduating","graduating from","from high","high school","school and","and is","is facing","facing the","the summer","summer that","that is","is the","the prologue","prologue to","to her","her new","new life","A life","life of","of no","no college","college plans","plans ,",", no","no job","job ,",", no","no money","money ,",", and","and no","no idea","idea of","of what","what she","she 's","'s going","going to","to do","do once","once September","September comes","comes and","and all","all of","of her","her friends","friends are","are gone","gone to","to college","But she","she does","does have","have the","the summer","summer ,",", and","and an","an opportunity","opportunity to","to still","still surprise","surprise herself","herself by","by what","what life","life can","can bring","bring when","when you","you least","least expect","expect it","Summer Blink","Blink chronicles","chronicles a","a summer","summer full","full of","of orange-hued","orange-hued memories","memories and","and sweeping","sweeping sensory","sensory overload","A time","time when","when you","you did","did everything","everything society","society and","and your","your parents","parents warned","warned you","you not","not to","to just","just to","to prove","prove you","you were","were alive"]}

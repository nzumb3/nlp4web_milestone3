{"title":"Broken Song","plot":"Git, Costello and Willa Lee are street poets, hip-hop artists and songwriters from north Dublin. For these young men self-expression in the form of poetry, rap and song has become a spiritual experience. Their aim is simply to articulate the chaos that surrounds them and to fight it with their words and voices alone. In the end, the place where they live and their words are one and the same, constantly in flux, full of darkness and light. It is proof that these suburbs - that have bred darkness, murder and hate - have also inspired poetry and these unlikely artists are using words alone to fight back.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Git",",","Costello","and","Willa","Lee","are","street","poet",",","hip-hop","artist","and","songwrit","from","north","Dublin",".","For","these","young","men","self-express","in","the","form","of","poetri",",","rap","and","song","has","becom","a","spiritu","experi",".","Their","aim","is","simpli","to","articul","the","chao","that","surround","them","and","to","fight","it","with","their","word","and","voic","alon",".","In","the","end",",","the","place","where","they","live","and","their","word","are","one","and","the","same",",","constant","in","flux",",","full","of","dark","and","light",".","It","is","proof","that","these","suburb","-","that","have","bred","dark",",","murder","and","hate","-","have","also","inspir","poetri","and","these","unlik","artist","are","use","word","alon","to","fight","back","."],"lemmas":["Git",",","Costello","and","Willa","Lee","be","street","poet",",","hip-hop","artist","and","songwriter","from","north","Dublin",".","for","these","young","man","self-expression","in","the","form","of","poetry",",","rap","and","song","have","become","a","spiritual","experience",".","they","aim","be","simply","to","articulate","the","chaos","that","surround","they","and","to","fight","it","with","they","word","and","voice","alone",".","in","the","end",",","the","place","where","they","live","and","they","word","be","one","and","the","same",",","constantly","in","flux",",","full","of","darkness","and","light",".","it","be","proof","that","these","suburb","-","that","have","breed","darkness",",","murder","and","hate","-","have","also","inspire","poetry","and","these","unlikely","artist","be","use","word","alone","to","fight","back","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Git , Costello",", Costello and","Costello and Willa","and Willa Lee","Willa Lee are","Lee are street","are street poets","street poets ,","poets , hip-hop",", hip-hop artists","hip-hop artists and","artists and songwriters","and songwriters from","songwriters from north","from north Dublin","For these young","these young men","young men self-expression","men self-expression in","self-expression in the","in the form","the form of","form of poetry","of poetry ,","poetry , rap",", rap and","rap and song","and song has","song has become","has become a","become a spiritual","a spiritual experience","Their aim is","aim is simply","is simply to","simply to articulate","to articulate the","articulate the chaos","the chaos that","chaos that surrounds","that surrounds them","surrounds them and","them and to","and to fight","to fight it","fight it with","it with their","with their words","their words and","words and voices","and voices alone","In the end","the end ,","end , the",", the place","the place where","place where they","where they live","they live and","live and their","and their words","their words are","words are one","are one and","one and the","and the same","the same ,","same , constantly",", constantly in","constantly in flux","in flux ,","flux , full",", full of","full of darkness","of darkness and","darkness and light","It is proof","is proof that","proof that these","that these suburbs","these suburbs -","suburbs -

{"title":"The Legend of Ponnivala: Death and the Queen","plot":"Death and the Queen is an animated tale excerpted from the much larger Legend of Ponnivala epic, which is based on an ancient South-Indian legend known as the Annanmar Kathai or \"Elder Brothers' Story.\" It tells the tale of a local queen named Tamarai who must travel to the gates of Heaven to plead with the Hindu god Shiva. She wants him to lift a family curse of barrenness. With the burden lifted, her sons-the folk heroes Ponnar and Shankar-are born. In an effort to glorify their family and their kingdom (Ponnivalanadu), these twin kings face combat with ferocious beasts and fierce warriors, until fate reclaims them and returns their spirits to Lord Shiva at just sixteen years of age.","genres":["Animation"],"stems":["Death","and","the","Queen","is","an","anim","tale","excerpt","from","the","much","larger","Legend","of","Ponnivala","epic",",","which","is","base","on","an","ancient","South-Indian","legend","known","as","the","Annanmar","Kathai","or","\"","Elder","Brother","'","Stori",".","\"","It","tell","the","tale","of","a","local","queen","name","Tamarai","who","must","travel","to","the","gate","of","Heaven","to","plead","with","the","Hindu","god","Shiva",".","She","want","him","to","lift","a","famili","curs","of","barren",".","With","the","burden","lift",",","her","sons-th","folk","hero","Ponnar","and","Shankar-ar","born",".","In","an","effort","to","glorifi","their","famili","and","their","kingdom","(","Ponnivalanadu",")",",","these","twin","king","face","combat","with","feroci","beast","and","fierc","warrior",",","until","fate","reclaim","them","and","return","their","spirit","to","Lord","Shiva","at","just","sixteen","year","of","age","."],"lemmas":["death","and","the","Queen","be","a","animated","tale","excerpt","from","the","much","larger","Legend","of","Ponnivala","epic",",","which","be","base","on","a","ancient","south-indian","legend","know","as","the","Annanmar","Kathai","or","``","Elder","Brothers","'","Story",".","''","it","tell","the","tale","of","a","local","queen","name","Tamarai","who","must","travel","to","the","gate","of","Heaven","to","plead","with","the","Hindu","god","shiva",".","she","want","he","to","lift","a","family","curse","of","barrenness",".","with","the","burden","lift",",","she","sons-the","folk","hero","ponnar","and","shankar-are","bear",".","in","a","effort","to","glorify","they","family","and","they","kingdom","-lrb-","ponnivalanadu","-rrb-",",","these","twin","king","face","combat","with","ferocious","beast","and","fierce","warrior",",","until","fate","reclaim","they","and","return","they","spirit","to","Lord","shiva","at","just","sixteen","year","of","age","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Death

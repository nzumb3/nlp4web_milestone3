{"title":"Atlantis: The Lost Empire","plot":"1914: Milo Thatch, grandson of the great Thaddeus Thatch works in the boiler room of a museum. He knows that Atlantis was real, and he can get there if he has the mysterious Shephards journal, which can guide him to Atlantis. But he needs someone to fund a voyage. His employer thinks he's dotty, and refuses to fund any crazy idea. He returns home to his apartment and finds a woman there. She takes him to Preston B. Whitmore, an old friend of his Grandfathers. He gives him the shepherds journal, a submarine and a 5 star crew. They travel through the Atlantic ocean, face a large lobster called the Leviathan, and finally get to Atlantis. But does the Atlantis crew have a lust for discovery, or something else?","genres":["Action"," Animation"," Adventure"],"stems":["1914",":","Milo","Thatch",",","grandson","of","the","great","Thaddeus","Thatch","work","in","the","boiler","room","of","a","museum",".","He","know","that","Atlanti","was","real",",","and","he","can","get","there","if","he","has","the","mysteri","Shephard","journal",",","which","can","guid","him","to","Atlanti",".","But","he","need","someon","to","fund","a","voyag",".","His","employ","think","he","'s","dotti",",","and","refus","to","fund","ani","crazi","idea",".","He","return","home","to","his","apart","and","find","a","woman","there",".","She","take","him","to","Preston","B.","Whitmor",",","an","old","friend","of","his","Grandfath",".","He","give","him","the","shepherd","journal",",","a","submarin","and","a","5","star","crew",".","They","travel","through","the","Atlantic","ocean",",","face","a","larg","lobster","call","the","Leviathan",",","and","final","get","to","Atlanti",".","But","doe","the","Atlanti","crew","have","a","lust","for","discoveri",",","or","someth","els","?"],"lemmas":["1914",":","Milo","Thatch",",","grandson","of","the","great","Thaddeus","Thatch","work","in","the","boiler","room","of","a","museum",".","he","know","that","Atlantis","be","real",",","and","he","can","get","there","if","he","have","the","mysterious","Shephards","journal",",","which","can","guide","he","to","Atlantis",".","but","he","need","someone","to","fund","a","voyage",".","he","employer","think","he","be","dotty",",","and","refuse","to","fund","any","crazy","idea",".","he","return","home","to","he","apartment","and","find","a","woman","there",".","she","take","he","to","Preston","B.","Whitmore",",","a","old","friend","of","he","grandfather",".","he","give","he","the","shepherd","journal",",","a","submarine","and","a","5","star","crew",".","they","travel","through","the","Atlantic","ocean",",","face","a","large","lobster","call","the","Leviathan",",","and","finally","get","to","Atlantis",".","but","do","the","Atlantis","crew","have","a","lust","for","discovery",",","or","something","else","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["1914 : Milo",": Milo Thatch","Milo Thatch ,","Thatch , grandson",", grandson of","grandson of the","of the great","the great Thaddeus","great Thaddeus Thatch","Thaddeus Thatch works","Thatch works in","works in the","in the boiler","the boiler room","boiler room of","room of a","of a museum","He knows that","knows that Atlantis","that Atlantis was","Atlantis was real","was real ,","real , and",", and he","and he can","he can get","can get there","get there if","there if he","if he has","he has the","has the mysterious","the mysterious Shephards","mysterious Shephards journal","Shephards journal ,","journal , which",", which can","which can guide","can guide him","guide him to","him to Atlantis","But he needs","he needs someone","needs someone to","someone to fund","to fund a","fund a voyage","His employer thinks","employer thinks he","thinks he 's","he 's dotty","'s dotty ,","dotty , and",", and refuses","and refuses to","refuses to fund","to fund any","fund any crazy","any crazy idea","He returns home","returns home to","home to his","to his apartment","his apartment and","apartment and finds","and finds a","finds a woman","a woman there","She takes him","takes him to","him to Preston","to Preston B.","Preston B.

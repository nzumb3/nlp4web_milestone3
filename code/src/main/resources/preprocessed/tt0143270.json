{"title":"Gentila","plot":"A drama about four malcontent and oddly matched characters on a three-day journey. Each an outcast: Gadi, a petty criminal on parole seeking to make his way back into mainstream society; Yitzhak, his pensive, naive, and serious younger brother; Shoshana, a serious criminal who insists on tormenting the group; and a young, pregnant, Russian immigrant who has left her husband an meets up with the other three in a coffee shop. The characters together define their obvious marginalization from society and their search for individual dignity.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","drama","about","four","malcont","and","odd","match","charact","on","a","three-day","journey",".","Each","an","outcast",":","Gadi",",","a","petti","crimin","on","parol","seek","to","make","his","way","back","into","mainstream","societi",";","Yitzhak",",","his","pensiv",",","naiv",",","and","serious","younger","brother",";","Shoshana",",","a","serious","crimin","who","insist","on","torment","the","group",";","and","a","young",",","pregnant",",","Russian","immigr","who","has","left","her","husband","an","meet","up","with","the","other","three","in","a","coffe","shop",".","The","charact","togeth","defin","their","obvious","margin","from","societi","and","their","search","for","individu","digniti","."],"lemmas":["a","drama","about","four","malcontent","and","oddly","match","character","on","a","three-day","journey",".","each","a","outcast",":","Gadi",",","a","petty","criminal","on","parole","seek","to","make","he","way","back","into","mainstream","society",";","Yitzhak",",","he","pensive",",","naive",",","and","serious","younger","brother",";","Shoshana",",","a","serious","criminal","who","insist","on","torment","the","group",";","and","a","young",",","pregnant",",","russian","immigrant","who","have","leave","she","husband","a","meet","up","with","the","other","three","in","a","coffee","shop",".","the","character","together","define","they","obvious","marginalization","from","society","and","they","search","for","individual","dignity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A drama about","drama about four","about four malcontent","four malcontent and","malcontent and oddly","and oddly matched","oddly matched characters","matched characters on","characters on a","on a three-day","a three-day journey","Each an outcast","an outcast :","outcast : Gadi",": Gadi ,","Gadi , a",", a petty","a petty criminal","petty criminal on","criminal on parole","on parole seeking","parole seeking to","seeking to make","to make his","make his way","his way back","way back into","back into mainstream","into mainstream society","mainstream society ;","society ; Yitzhak","; Yitzhak ,","Yitzhak , his",", his pensive","his pensive ,","pensive , naive",", naive ,","naive , and",", and serious","and serious younger","serious younger brother","younger brother ;","brother ; Shoshana","; Shoshana ,","Shoshana , a",", a serious","a serious criminal","serious criminal who","criminal who insists","who insists on","insists on tormenting","on tormenting the","tormenting the group","the group ;","group ; and","; and a","and a young","a young ,","young , pregnant",", pregnant ,","pregnant , Russian",", Russian immigrant","Russian immigrant who","immigrant who has","who has left","has left her","left her husband","her husband an","husband an meets","an meets up","meets up with","up with the","with the other","the other three","other three in","three in a","in a coffee","a coffee shop","The characters together","characters together define","together define their","define their obvious","their obvious marginalization","obvious marginalization from","marginalization from society","from society and","society and their","and their search","their search for","search for individual","for individual dignity"],"2grams":["A drama","drama about","about four","four malcontent","malcontent and","and oddly","oddly matched","matched characters","characters on","on a","a three-day","three-day journey","Each an","an outcast","outcast :",": Gadi","Gadi ,",", a","a petty","petty criminal","criminal on","on parole","parole seeking","seeking to","to make","make his","his way","way back","back into","into mainstream","mainstream society","society ;","; Yitzhak","Yitzhak ,",", his","his pensive","pensive ,",", naive","naive ,",", and","and serious","serious younger","younger brother","brother ;","; Shoshana","Shoshana ,",", a","a serious","serious criminal","criminal who","who insists","insists on","on tormenting","tormenting the","the group","group ;","; and","and a","a young","young ,",", pregnant","pregnant ,",", Russian","Russian immigrant","immigrant who","who has","has left","left her","her husband","husband an","an meets","meets up","up with","with the","the other","other three","three in","in a","a coffee","coffee shop","The characters","characters together","together define","define their","their obvious","obvious marginalization","marginalization from","from society","society and","and their","their search","search for","for individual","individual dignity"]}

{"title":"Harlem Aria","plot":"Chasing his dream, Anton leaves his aunt's home in Harlem for downtown New York City, where a quick-witted street hustler named Wes cons him out of his life savings. Homeless and empty-handed, Matthew, a street musician stalled in his own dreams, invites Anton to perform with him in the park. Amazed by Anton's singing talent, Matthew befriends him and attempts to keep him safe from Wes's enterprising exploitation. Caught in the middle, Anton's journey isn't an easy one. The three men's lives entwine and lead each down a path of destruction, truth and redemption.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Chase","his","dream",",","Anton","leav","his","aunt","'s","home","in","Harlem","for","downtown","New","York","Citi",",","where","a","quick-wit","street","hustler","name","Wes","con","him","out","of","his","life","save",".","Homeless","and","empty-hand",",","Matthew",",","a","street","musician","stall","in","his","own","dream",",","invit","Anton","to","perform","with","him","in","the","park",".","Amaze","by","Anton","'s","sing","talent",",","Matthew","befriend","him","and","attempt","to","keep","him","safe","from","Wes","'s","enterpris","exploit",".","Caught","in","the","middl",",","Anton","'s","journey","is","n't","an","easi","one",".","The","three","men","'s","live","entwin","and","lead","each","down","a","path","of","destruct",",","truth","and","redempt","."],"lemmas":["chase","he","dream",",","Anton","leave","he","aunt","'s","home","in","Harlem","for","downtown","New","York","City",",","where","a","quick-witted","street","hustler","name","Wes","con","he","out","of","he","life","savings",".","homeless","and","empty-handed",",","Matthew",",","a","street","musician","stall","in","he","own","dream",",","invite","Anton","to","perform","with","he","in","the","park",".","amaze","by","Anton","'s","singing","talent",",","Matthew","befriend","he","and","attempt","to","keep","he","safe","from","Wes","'s","enterprising","exploitation",".","catch","in","the","middle",",","Anton","'s","journey","be","not","a","easy","one",".","the","three","man","'s","life","entwine","and","lead","each","down","a","path","of","destruction",",","truth","and","redemption","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Chasing his dream","his dream ,","dream , Anton",", Anton leaves","Anton leaves his","leaves his aunt","his aunt 's","aunt 's home","'s home in","home in Harlem","in Harlem for","Harlem for downtown","for downtown New","downtown New York","New York City","York City ,","City , where",", where a","where a quick-witted","a quick-witted street","quick-witted street hustler","street hustler named","hustler named Wes","named Wes cons","Wes cons him","cons him out","him out of","out of his","of his life","his life savings","Homeless and empty-handed","and empty-handed ,","empty-handed , Matthew",", Matthew ,","Matthew , a",", a street","a street musician","street musician stalled","musician stalled in","stalled in his","in his own","his own dreams","own dreams ,","dreams , invites",", invites Anton","invites Anton to","Anton to perform","to perform with","perform with him","with him in","him in the","in the park","Amazed by Anton","by Anton 's","Anton 's singing","'s singing talent","singing talent ,","talent , Matthew",", Matthew befriends","Matthew befriends him","befriends him and","him and attempts","and attempts to","attempts to keep","to keep him","keep him safe","him safe from","safe from Wes","from Wes 's","Wes 's enterprising","'s enterprising exploitation","Caught in the","in the middle","the middle ,","middle , Anton",", Anton 's","Anton 's journey","'s journey is","journey is n't","is n't an","n't an easy","an easy one","The three men","three men 's","men 's lives","'s lives entwine","lives entwine and","entwine and lead","and lead each","lead each down","each down a","down a path","a path of","path of destruction","of destruction ,","destruction , truth",", truth and","truth and redemption"],"2grams":["Chasing his","his dream","dream ,",", Anton","Anton leaves","leaves his","his aunt","aunt 's","'s home","home in","in Harlem","Harlem for","for downtown","downtown New","New York","York City","City ,",", where","where a","a quick-witted","quick-witted street","street hustler","hustler named","named Wes","Wes cons","cons him","him out","out of","of his","his life","life savings","Homeless and","and empty-handed","empty-handed ,",", Matthew","Matthew ,",", a","a street","street musician","musician stalled","stalled in","in his","his own","own dreams","dreams ,",", invites","invites Anton","Anton to","to perform","perform with","with him","him in","in the","the park","Amazed by","by Anton","Anton 's","'s singing","singing talent","talent ,",", Matthew","Matthew befriends","befriends him","him and","and attempts","attempts to","to keep","keep him","him safe","safe from","from Wes","Wes 's","'s enterprising","enterprising exploitation","Caught in","in the","the middle","middle ,",", Anton","Anton 's","'s journey","journey is","is n't","n't an","an easy","easy one","The three","three men","men 's","'s lives","lives entwine","entwine and","and lead","lead each","each down","down a","a path","path of","of destruction","destruction ,",", truth","truth and","and redemption"]}

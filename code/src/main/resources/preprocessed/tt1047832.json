{"title":"Linewatch","plot":"Michael Dixon is a seasoned agent working linewatch on the US/Mexico Border. Well respected by his peers at US Border Patrol, and well loved by his family (wife Angela and 5 year old daughter Emily), Michael's world is suddenly threatened by secrets from his past. Michael was not always the respectable family man he now has become - he was a vicious Los Angeles gang member who turned his back on the gang and his own brutal ways. But no one can quit the gang, so when a chance encounter leads the gang to Michael in New Mexico, Michael is forced to find a way to protect his family, even if it means helping the psychotic gang leader Drake smuggle a truckload of drugs across the border.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["Michael","Dixon","is","a","season","agent","work","linewatch","on","the","US/Mexico","Border",".","Well","respect","by","his","peer","at","US","Border","Patrol",",","and","well","love","by","his","famili","(","wife","Angela","and","5","year","old","daughter","Emili",")",",","Michael","'s","world","is","sudden","threaten","by","secret","from","his","past",".","Michael","was","not","alway","the","respect","famili","man","he","now","has","becom","-","he","was","a","vicious","Los","Angele","gang","member","who","turn","his","back","on","the","gang","and","his","own","brutal","way",".","But","no","one","can","quit","the","gang",",","so","when","a","chanc","encount","lead","the","gang","to","Michael","in","New","Mexico",",","Michael","is","forc","to","find","a","way","to","protect","his","famili",",","even","if","it","mean","help","the","psychot","gang","leader","Drake","smuggl","a","truckload","of","drug","across","the","border","."],"lemmas":["Michael","Dixon","be","a","seasoned","agent","work","linewatch","on","the","US/Mexico","Border",".","well","respect","by","he","peer","at","US","Border","Patrol",",","and","well","love","by","he","family","-lrb-","wife","Angela","and","5","year","old","daughter","Emily","-rrb-",",","Michael","'s","world","be","suddenly","threaten","by","secret","from","he","past",".","Michael","be","not","always","the","respectable","family","man","he","now","have","become","-","he","be","a","vicious","Los","Angeles","gang","member","who","turn","he","back","on","the","gang","and","he","own","brutal","way",".","but","no","one","can","quit","the","gang",",","so","when","a","chance","encounter","lead","the","gang","to","Michael","in","New","Mexico",",","Michael","be","force","to","find","a","way","to","protect","he","family",",","even","if","it","mean","help","the","psychotic","gang","leader","Drake","smuggle","a","truckload","of","drug","across","the","border","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Michael Dixon is","Dixon is a","is a seasoned","a seasoned agent","seasoned agent working","agent working linewatch","working linewatch on","linewatch on the","on the US/Mexico","the US/Mexico Border","Well respected by","respected by his","by his peers","his peers at","peers at US","at US Border","US Border Patrol","Border Patrol ,","Patrol , and",", and well","and well loved","well loved by","loved by his","by his family","his family (","family ( wife","( wife Angela","wife Angela and","Angela and 5","and 5 year","5 year old","year old daughter","old daughter Emily","daughter Emily )","Emily ) ,",") , Michael",", Michael 's","Michael 's world","'s world is","world is suddenly","is suddenly threatened","suddenly threatened by","threatened by secrets","by secrets from","secrets from his","from his past","Michael was not","was not always","not always the","always the respectable","the respectable family","respectable family man","family man he","man he now","he now has","now has become","has become -","become -

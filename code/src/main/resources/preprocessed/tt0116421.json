{"title":"The Glimmer Man","plot":"Jack Cole is a soft spoken, mystical, new age New York cop with a checkered past. He is transferred to Los Angeles to help Los Angeles cop Jim Campbell solve a series of brutal murders in which the victims are crucified. The murders that have happened since Jack arrived in Los Angeles just don't sit right with him. When the killer, known as the \"Family Man\", kills Ellen DunLeavy, who happens to be Jack's ex wife and the mother of his two kids, and Ellen's husband Andrew DunLeavy, it becomes personal - especially when Jack's prints are found on Ellen's body. Jack meets with his military mentor Smith, not knowing that Smith is in cahoots with local crime boss Frank Deverell.","genres":["Action"," Crime"," Comedy"],"stems":["Jack","Cole","is","a","soft","spoken",",","mystic",",","new","age","New","York","cop","with","a","checker","past",".","He","is","transfer","to","Los","Angele","to","help","Los","Angele","cop","Jim","Campbel","solv","a","seri","of","brutal","murder","in","which","the","victim","are","crucifi",".","The","murder","that","have","happen","sinc","Jack","arriv","in","Los","Angele","just","do","n't","sit","right","with","him",".","When","the","killer",",","known","as","the","\"","Famili","Man","\"",",","kill","Ellen","DunLeavi",",","who","happen","to","be","Jack","'s","ex","wife","and","the","mother","of","his","two","kid",",","and","Ellen","'s","husband","Andrew","DunLeavi",",","it","becom","person","-","especi","when","Jack","'s","print","are","found","on","Ellen","'s","bodi",".","Jack","meet","with","his","militari","mentor","Smith",",","not","know","that","Smith","is","in","cahoot","with","local","crime","boss","Frank","Deverel","."],"lemmas":["Jack","Cole","be","a","soft","speak",",","mystical",",","new","age","New","York","cop","with","a","checkered","past",".","he","be","transfer","to","Los","Angeles","to","help","Los","Angeles","cop","Jim","Campbell","solve","a","series","of","brutal","murder","in","which","the","victim","be","crucify",".","the","murder","that","have","happen","since","Jack","arrive","in","Los","Angeles","just","do","not","sit","right","with","he",".","when","the","killer",",","know","as","the","``","Family","Man","''",",","kill","Ellen","DunLeavy",",","who","happen","to","be","Jack","'s","ex","wife","and","the","mother","of","he","two","kid",",","and","Ellen","'s","husband","Andrew","DunLeavy",",","it","become","personal","-","especially","when","Jack","'s","print","be","find","on","Ellen","'s","body",".","Jack","meet","with","he","military","mentor","Smith",",","not","know","that","Smith","be","in","cahoots","with","local","crime","boss","Frank","Deverell","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jack Cole is","Cole is a","is a soft","a soft spoken","soft spoken ,","spoken , mystical",", mystical ,","mystical , new",", new age","new age New","age New York","New York cop","York cop with","cop with a","with a checkered","a checkered past","He is transferred","is transferred to","transferred to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles to","Angeles to help","to help Los","help Los Angeles","Los Angeles cop","Angeles cop Jim","cop Jim Campbell","Jim Campbell solve","Campbell solve a","solve a series","a series of","series of brutal","of brutal murders","brutal murders in","murders in which","in which the","which the victims","the victims are","victims are crucified","The murders that","murders that have","that have happened","have happened since","happened since Jack","since Jack arrived","Jack arrived in","arrived in Los","in Los Angeles","Los Angeles just","Angeles just do","just do n't","do n't sit","n't sit right","sit right with","right with him","When the killer","the killer ,","killer , known",", known as","known as the","as the \"","the \" Family","\" Family Man","Family Man \"","Man \" ,","\" , kills",", kills Ellen","kills Ellen DunLeavy","Ellen DunLeavy ,","DunLeavy , who",", who happens","who happens to","happens to be","to be Jack","be Jack 's","Jack 's ex","'s ex wife","ex wife and","wife and the","and the mother","the mother of","mother of his","of his two","his two kids","two kids ,","kids , and",", and Ellen","and Ellen 's","Ellen 's husband","'s husband Andrew","husband Andrew DunLeavy","Andrew DunLeavy ,","DunLeavy , it",", it becomes","it becomes personal","becomes personal -","personal -

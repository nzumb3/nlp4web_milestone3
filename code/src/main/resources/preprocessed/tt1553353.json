{"title":"State of Aloha","plot":"This is the 50th Anniversary of Hawaii Statehood. There is still a current dialogue and controversy about the legitimacy of Hawaii's state status. Largely anchored by personal narrative, the motivating paths toward statehood are addressed as well as the legacy left behind. Interviewees cover a representative span of the population in Hawaii, including people from the political, cultural, business, academia communities as well as the person next door. STATE OF ALOHA is in reference to Reverend Akaka's sermon on March 13, 1959-- 'The fears Hawaii may have are to be met by men and women who are living witnesses of what we really are in Hawaii, of the spirit of Aloha, men and women who can help unlock the doors to the future... For any collective anxiety, the answer is collective courage.'","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["This","is","the","50th","Anniversari","of","Hawaii","Statehood",".","There","is","still","a","current","dialogu","and","controversi","about","the","legitimaci","of","Hawaii","'s","state","status",".","Larg","anchor","by","person","narrat",",","the","motiv","path","toward","statehood","are","address","as","well","as","the","legaci","left","behind",".","Interviewe","cover","a","repres","span","of","the","popul","in","Hawaii",",","includ","peopl","from","the","polit",",","cultur",",","busi",",","academia","communiti","as","well","as","the","person","next","door",".","STATE","OF","ALOHA","is","in","refer","to","Reverend","Akaka","'s","sermon","on","March","13",",","1959","--","'","The","fear","Hawaii","may","have","are","to","be","met","by","men","and","women","who","are","live","wit","of","what","we","realli","are","in","Hawaii",",","of","the","spirit","of","Aloha",",","men","and","women","who","can","help","unlock","the","door","to","the","futur","...","For","ani","collect","anxieti",",","the","answer","is","collect","courag",".","'"],"lemmas":["this","be","the","50th","anniversary","of","Hawaii","Statehood",".","there","be","still","a","current","dialogue","and","controversy","about","the","legitimacy","of","Hawaii","'s","state","status",".","largely","anchor","by","personal","narrative",",","the","motivate","path","toward","statehood","be","address","as","well","as","the","legacy","leave","behind",".","interviewee","cover","a","representative","span","of","the","population","in","Hawaii",",","include","people","from","the","political",",","cultural",",","business",",","academia","community","as","well","as","the","person","next","door",".","state","of","ALOHA","be","in","reference","to","Reverend","Akaka","'s","sermon","on","March","13",",","1959","--","'","the","fear","Hawaii","may","have","be","to","be","meet","by","man","and","woman","who","be","live","witness","of","what","we","really","be","in","Hawaii",",","of","the","spirit","of","Aloha",",","man","and","woman","who","can","help","unlock","the","door","to","the","future","...","for","any","collective","anxiety",",","the","answer","be","collective","courage",".","'"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is the","is the 50th","the 50th Anniversary","50th Anniversary of","Anniversary of Hawaii","of Hawaii Statehood","There is still","is still a","still a current","a current dialogue","current dialogue and","dialogue and controversy","and controversy about","controversy about the","about the legitimacy","the legitimacy of","legitimacy of Hawaii","of Hawaii 's","Hawaii 's state","'s state status","Largely anchored by","anchored by personal","by personal narrative","personal narrative ,","narrative , the",", the motivating","the motivating paths","motivating paths toward","paths toward statehood","toward statehood are","statehood are addressed","are addressed as","addressed as well","as well as","well as the","as the legacy","the legacy left","legacy left behind","Interviewees cover a","cover a representative","a representative span","representative span of","span of the","of the population","the population in","population in Hawaii","in Hawaii ,","Hawaii , including",", including people","including people from","people from the","from the political","the political ,","political , cultural",", cultural ,","cultural , business",", business ,","business , academia",", academia communities","academia communities as","communities as well","as well as","well as the","as the person","the person next","person next door","STATE OF ALOHA","OF ALOHA is","ALOHA is in","is in reference","in reference to","reference to Reverend","to Reverend Akaka","Reverend Akaka 's","Akaka 's sermon","'s sermon on","sermon on March","on March 13","March 13 ,","13 , 1959",", 1959 --","1959 -- '","-- ' The","' The fears","The fears Hawaii","fears Hawaii may","Hawaii may have","may have are","have are to","are to be","to be met","be met by","met by men","by men and","men and women","and women who","women who are","who are living","are living witnesses","living witnesses of","witnesses of what","of what we","what we really","we really are","really are in","are in Hawaii","in Hawaii ,","Hawaii , of",", of the","of the spirit","the spirit of","spirit of Aloha","of Aloha ,","Aloha , men",", men and","men and women","and women who","women who can","who can help","can help unlock","help unlock the","unlock the doors","the doors to","doors to the","to the future","the future ...","future ...

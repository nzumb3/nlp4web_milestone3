{"title":"Corpus Christi: Playing with Redemption","plot":"Inspired by Terrence McNally's Passion Play told through the lens of a young gay Jesus, Corpus Christi: Playing with Redemption follows a group of actors who began production on the play seven years ago in a small church. Within months they suddenly found themselves thrust in the world spotlight touring to international acclaim. The documentary follows the troupe and the playwright sharing their stories with supporters and protesters as they continue their tour across the world to communities where hate and bigotry are much more prevalent. Mirroring the reflections of dialogue in society today, especially in regards to civil rights, marriage equality, HIV/AIDS, and separation of church and state, this production has become a vehicle of change for a community struggling to find its voice. Meanwhile, the company of actors find themselves on a journey that would forever change their lives.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Inspire","by","Terrenc","McNalli","'s","Passion","Play","told","through","the","len","of","a","young","gay","Jesus",",","Corpus","Christi",":","Play","with","Redempt","follow","a","group","of","actor","who","began","product","on","the","play","seven","year","ago","in","a","small","church",".","Within","month","they","sudden","found","themselv","thrust","in","the","world","spotlight","tour","to","intern","acclaim",".","The","documentari","follow","the","troup","and","the","playwright","share","their","stori","with","support","and","protest","as","they","continu","their","tour","across","the","world","to","communiti","where","hate","and","bigotri","are","much","more","preval",".","Mirror","the","reflect","of","dialogu","in","societi","today",",","especi","in","regard","to","civil","right",",","marriag","equal",",","HIV/AIDS",",","and","separ","of","church","and","state",",","this","product","has","becom","a","vehicl","of","chang","for","a","communiti","struggl","to","find","it","voic",".","Meanwhil",",","the","compani","of","actor","find","themselv","on","a","journey","that","would","forev","chang","their","live","."],"lemmas":["inspire","by","Terrence","McNally","'s","Passion","Play","tell","through","the","lens","of","a","young","gay","Jesus",",","Corpus","Christi",":","play","with","redemption","follow","a","group","of","actor","who","begin","production","on","the","play","seven","year","ago","in","a","small","church",".","within","month","they","suddenly","find","themselves","thrust","in","the","world","spotlight","tour","to","international","acclaim",".","the","documentary","follow","the","troupe","and","the","playwright","share","they","story","with","supporter","and","protester","as","they","continue","they","tour","across","the","world","to","community","where","hate","and","bigotry","be","much","more","prevalent",".","mirror","the","reflection","of","dialogue","in","society","today",",","especially","in","regard","to","civil","rights",",","marriage","equality",",","hiv/aids",",","and","separation","of","church","and","state",",","this","production","have","become","a","vehicle","of","change","for","a","community","struggle","to","find","its","voice",".","meanwhile",",","the","company","of","actor","find","themselves","on","a","journey","that","would","forever","change","they","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Inspired

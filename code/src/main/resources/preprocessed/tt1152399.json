{"title":"Ghost Bird","plot":"Ghost Bird is a non-fiction feature about a small town in Arkansas, an extinct giant woodpecker and everybody looking for the Holy Grail of birding - the Ivory-billed woodpecker. Following numerous sightings and its widely announced rediscovery in 2005, the world's best birders have been unable to locate even one \"Lord God Bird\" after over three years of intensive searching. Ghost Bird examines the meaning of hope, faith and the limits of certainty in the quest to resurrect this lost species...unless, like the Holy Grail itself, the Ivory-bill remains forever out of reach.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Ghost","Bird","is","a","non-fict","featur","about","a","small","town","in","Arkansa",",","an","extinct","giant","woodpeck","and","everybodi","look","for","the","Holi","Grail","of","bird","-","the","Ivory-bil","woodpeck",".","Follow","numer","sight","and","it","wide","announc","rediscoveri","in","2005",",","the","world","'s","best","birder","have","been","unabl","to","locat","even","one","\"","Lord","God","Bird","\"","after","over","three","year","of","intens","search",".","Ghost","Bird","examin","the","mean","of","hope",",","faith","and","the","limit","of","certainti","in","the","quest","to","resurrect","this","lost","speci","...","unless",",","like","the","Holi","Grail","itself",",","the","Ivory-bil","remain","forev","out","of","reach","."],"lemmas":["ghost","bird","be","a","non-fiction","feature","about","a","small","town","in","Arkansas",",","a","extinct","giant","woodpecker","and","everybody","look","for","the","holy","grail","of","birding","-","the","ivory-billed","woodpecker",".","follow","numerous","sighting","and","its","widely","announce","rediscovery","in","2005",",","the","world","'s","best","birder","have","be","unable","to","locate","even","one","``","Lord","God","Bird","''","after","over","three","year","of","intensive","search",".","ghost","bird","examine","the","meaning","of","hope",",","faith","and","the","limit","of","certainty","in","the","quest","to","resurrect","this","lost","species","...","unless",",","like","the","Holy","Grail","itself",",","the","ivory-bill","remain","forever","out","of","reach","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Ghost Bird is","Bird is a","is a non-fiction","a non-fiction feature","non-fiction feature about","feature about a","about a small","a small town","small town in","town in Arkansas","in Arkansas ,","Arkansas , an",", an extinct","an extinct giant","extinct giant woodpecker","giant woodpecker and","woodpecker and everybody","and everybody looking","everybody looking for","looking for the","for the Holy","the Holy Grail","Holy Grail of","Grail of birding","of birding -","birding - the","- the Ivory-billed","the Ivory-billed woodpecker","Following numerous sightings","numerous sightings and","sightings and its","and its widely","its widely announced","widely announced rediscovery","announced rediscovery in","rediscovery in 2005","in 2005 ,","2005 , the",", the world","the world 's","world 's best","'s best birders","best birders have","birders have been","have been unable","been unable to","unable to locate","to locate even","locate even one","even one \"","one \" Lord","\" Lord God","Lord God Bird","God Bird \"","Bird \" after","\" after over","after over three","over three years","three years of","years of intensive","of intensive searching","Ghost Bird examines","Bird examines the","examines the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of hope","of hope ,","hope , faith",", faith and","faith and the","and the limits","the limits of","limits of certainty","of certainty in","certainty in the","in the quest","the quest to","quest to resurrect","to resurrect this","resurrect this lost","this lost species","lost species ...","species ... unless","... unless ,","unless , like",", like the","like the Holy","the Holy Grail","Holy Grail itself","Grail itself ,","itself , the",", the Ivory-bill","the Ivory-bill remains","Ivory-bill remains forever","remains forever out","forever out of","out of reach"],"2grams":["Ghost Bird","Bird is","is a","a non-fiction","non-fiction feature","feature about","about a","a small","small town","town in","in Arkansas","Arkansas ,",", an","an extinct","extinct giant","giant woodpecker","woodpecker and","and everybody","everybody looking","looking for","for the","the Holy","Holy Grail","Grail of","of birding","birding -","- the","the Ivory-billed","Ivory-billed woodpecker","Following numerous","numerous sightings","sightings and","and its","its widely","widely announced","announced rediscovery","rediscovery in","in 2005","2005 ,",", the","the world","world 's","'s best","best birders","birders have","have been","been unable","unable to","to locate","locate even","even one","one \"","\" Lord","Lord God","God Bird","Bird \"","\" after","after over","over three","three years","years of","of intensive","intensive searching","Ghost Bird","Bird examines","examines the","the meaning","meaning of","of hope","hope ,",", faith","faith and","and the","the limits","limits of","of certainty","certainty in","in the","the quest","quest to","to resurrect","resurrect this","this lost","lost species","species ...","... unless","unless ,",", like","like the","the Holy","Holy Grail","Grail itself","itself ,",", the","the Ivory-bill","Ivory-bill remains","remains forever","forever out","out of","of reach"]}

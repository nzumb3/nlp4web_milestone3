{"title":"The Happiest Girl in the World","plot":"Delia, a young Romanian girl, comes to Bucharest with her parents to collect a prize she has won in a contest organized by a soft-drinks company. The prize is a beautiful new car. All Delia has to do now is appear in front of the camera in a commercial. All goes well until it becomes clear that Delia and her parents have very different ideas about what to do with the new car. Meanwhile, the contest's sponsor needs a radiant prize-winner with a gleaming smile. A wicked satire and a psychological portrait of a society perverted by its slavery to capitalism and consumerism.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Delia",",","a","young","Romanian","girl",",","come","to","Bucharest","with","her","parent","to","collect","a","prize","she","has","won","in","a","contest","organ","by","a","soft-drink","compani",".","The","prize","is","a","beauti","new","car",".","All","Delia","has","to","do","now","is","appear","in","front","of","the","camera","in","a","commerci",".","All","goe","well","until","it","becom","clear","that","Delia","and","her","parent","have","veri","differ","idea","about","what","to","do","with","the","new","car",".","Meanwhil",",","the","contest","'s","sponsor","need","a","radiant","prize-winn","with","a","gleam","smile",".","A","wick","satir","and","a","psycholog","portrait","of","a","societi","pervert","by","it","slaveri","to","capit","and","consumer","."],"lemmas":["Delia",",","a","young","romanian","girl",",","come","to","Bucharest","with","she","parent","to","collect","a","prize","she","have","win","in","a","contest","organize","by","a","soft-drinks","company",".","the","prize","be","a","beautiful","new","car",".","all","Delia","have","to","do","now","be","appear","in","front","of","the","camera","in","a","commercial",".","all","go","well","until","it","become","clear","that","Delia","and","she","parent","have","very","different","idea","about","what","to","do","with","the","new","car",".","meanwhile",",","the","contest","'s","sponsor","need","a","radiant","prize-winner","with","a","gleaming","smile",".","a","wicked","satire","and","a","psychological","portrait","of","a","society","pervert","by","its","slavery","to","capitalism","and","consumerism","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Delia , a",", a young","a young Romanian","young Romanian girl","Romanian girl ,","girl , comes",", comes to","comes to Bucharest","to Bucharest with","Bucharest with her","with her parents","her parents to","parents to collect","to collect a","collect a prize","a prize she","prize she has","she has won","has won in","won in a","in a contest","a contest organized","contest organized by","organized by a","by a soft-drinks","a soft-drinks company","The prize is","prize is a","is a beautiful","a beautiful new","beautiful new car","All Delia has","Delia has to","has to do","to do now","do now is","now is appear","is appear in","appear in front","in front of","front of the","of the camera","the camera in","camera in a","in a commercial","All goes well","goes well until","well until it","until it becomes","it becomes clear","becomes clear that","clear that Delia","that Delia and","Delia and her","and her parents","her parents have","parents have very","have very different","very different ideas","different ideas about","ideas about what","about what to","what to do","to do with","do with the","with the new","the new car","Meanwhile , the",", the contest","the contest 's","contest 's sponsor","'s sponsor needs","sponsor needs a","needs a radiant","a radiant prize-winner","radiant prize-winner with","prize-winner with a","with a gleaming","a gleaming smile","A wicked satire","wicked satire and","satire and a","and a psychological","a psychological portrait","psychological portrait of","portrait of a","of a society","a society perverted","society perverted by","perverted by its","by its slavery","its slavery to","slavery to capitalism","to capitalism and","capitalism and consumerism"],"2grams":["Delia ,",", a","a young","young Romanian","Romanian girl","girl ,",", comes","comes to","to Bucharest","Bucharest with","with her","her parents","parents to","to collect","collect a","a prize","prize she","she has","has won","won in","in a","a contest","contest organized","organized by","by a","a soft-drinks","soft-drinks company","The prize","prize is","is a","a beautiful","beautiful new","new car","All Delia","Delia has","has to","to do","do now","now is","is appear","appear in","in front","front of","of the","the camera","camera in","in a","a commercial","All goes","goes well","well until","until it","it becomes","becomes clear","clear that","that Delia","Delia and","and her","her parents","parents have","have very","very different","different ideas","ideas about","about what","what to","to do","do with","with the","the new","new car","Meanwhile ,",", the","the contest","contest 's","'s sponsor","sponsor needs","needs a","a radiant","radiant prize-winner","prize-winner with","with a","a gleaming","gleaming smile","A wicked","wicked satire","satire and","and a","a psychological","psychological portrait","portrait of","of a","a society","society perverted","perverted by","by its","its slavery","slavery to","to capitalism","capitalism and","and consumerism"]}

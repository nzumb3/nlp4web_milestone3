Her tenuous grasp on reality further fluctuates when a man (Matthew Powers) whom she met in a restaurant and started an affair is called to go to India for an assignment. The final straw occurs when she is evicted and moves into a sleazy hotel. She then starts seeking casual sex in unorthodox locations just to have human contact.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["An","unemploy","ex-offic","worker","(","Anna","Thomson",")","search","for","work","float","a","fragil","line","of","saniti","as","she","struggl","to","find","friendship","and","companionship",".","Her","tenuous","grasp","on","realiti","further","fluctuat","when","a","man","(","Matthew","Power",")","whom","she","met","in","a","restaur","and","start","an","affair","is","call","to","go","to","India","for","an","assign",".","The","final","straw","occur","when","she","is","evict","and","move","into","a","sleazi","hotel",".","She","then","start","seek","casual","sex","in","unorthodox","locat","just","to","have","human","contact","."],"lemmas":["a","unemployed","ex-office","worker","-lrb-","Anna","Thomson","-rrb-","search","for","work","float","a","fragile","line","of","sanity","as","she","struggle","to","find","friendship","and","companionship",".","she","tenuous","grasp","on","reality","further","fluctuate","when","a","man","-lrb-","Matthew","Powers","-rrb-","whom","she","meet","in","a","restaurant","and","start","a","affair","be","call","to","go","to","India","for","a","assignment",".","the","final","straw","occur","when","she","be","evict","and","move","into","a","sleazy","hotel",".","she","then","start","seek","casual","sex","in","unorthodox","location","just","to","have","human","contact","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An unemployed ex-office","unemployed ex-office worker","ex-office worker (","worker ( Anna","( Anna Thomson","Anna Thomson )","Thomson ) searching",") searching for","searching for work","for work floats","work floats a","floats a fragile","a fragile line","fragile line of","line of sanity","of sanity as","sanity as she","as she struggles","she struggles to","struggles to find","to find friendship","find friendship and","friendship and companionship","Her tenuous grasp","tenuous grasp on","grasp on reality","on reality further","reality further fluctuates","further fluctuates when","fluctuates when a","when a man","a man (","man ( Matthew","( Matthew Powers","Matthew Powers )","Powers ) whom",") whom she","whom she met","she met in","met in a","in a restaurant","a restaurant and","restaurant and started","and started an","started an affair","an affair is","affair is called","is called to","called to go","to go to","go to India","to India for","India for an","for an assignment","The final straw","final straw occurs","straw occurs when","occurs when she","when she is","she is evicted","is evicted and","evicted and moves","and moves into","moves into a","into a sleazy","a sleazy hotel","She then starts","then starts seeking","starts seeking casual","seeking casual sex","casual sex in","sex in unorthodox","in unorthodox locations","unorthodox locations just","locations just to","just to have","to have human","have human contact"],"2grams":["An unemployed","unemployed ex-office","ex-office worker","worker (","( Anna","Anna Thomson","Thomson )",") searching","searching for","for work","work floats","floats a","a fragile","fragile line","line of","of sanity","sanity as","as she","she struggles","struggles to","to find","find friendship","friendship and","and companionship","Her tenuous","tenuous grasp","grasp on","on reality","reality further","further fluctuates","fluctuates when","when a","a man","man (","( Matthew","Matthew Powers","Powers )",") whom","whom she","she met","met in","in a","a restaurant","restaurant and","and started","started an","an affair","affair is","is called","called to","to go","go to","to India","India for","for an","an assignment","The final","final straw","straw occurs","occurs when","when she","she is","is evicted","evicted and","and moves","moves into","into a","a sleazy","sleazy hotel","She then","then starts","starts seeking","seeking casual","casual sex","sex in","in unorthodox","unorthodox locations","locations just","just to","to have","have human","human contact"]}

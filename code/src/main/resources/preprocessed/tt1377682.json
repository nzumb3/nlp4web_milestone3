{"title":"Disco Cops: The Movie","plot":"The disco cops, an elite group of people who preserve disco, are in trouble. They have a new enemy, named Twostep, which they must stop in order to save funky disco dances and music. This new enemy is trying to bring on an evolution of music and start an era of rap music and dance moves. It will be almost impossible to find him, for he leaves his crime sites with no trace. When two disco cops from a group called 'the Bee Gee squad' find him, they must stop his rain of rap music. With a little help from Phycidelic, the two disco cops will have to take down this enemy. After Twostep realizes that he needs help, he hires an assassin named Mr. Popnlocket. This ruthless man doesn't care what he does, as long as he gets paid. With this new threat, the disco cops stand no chance against twostep. An inside woman named Amanda is the disco cops last hope.","genres":["Action"," Crime","

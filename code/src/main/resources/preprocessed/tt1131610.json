{"title":"We're All Angels","plot":"For a year, cameras follow pop duo Jason and deMarco as they give concerts and interviews, assemble a new CD, and go on the road to promote it. They sing Christian rock, including dance remixes. They are gay and they have been a couple for four years. They talk about their childhood and youth - Jason belonged to a Pentacostal church, deMarco was raised Catholic. They and their parents talk about family, coming to terms with sexuality, and the changing views of homosexuality within some churches. Jason and deMarco's particular mission is to reach gay youth with an anti-suicide message, helping them to reconcile the spiritual with the physical.","genres":["Documentary"," Romance"],"stems":["For","a","year",",","camera","follow","pop","duo","Jason","and","deMarco","as","they","give","concert","and","interview",",","assembl","a","new","CD",",","and","go","on","the","road","to","promot","it",".","They","sing","Christian","rock",",","includ","danc","remix",".","They","are","gay","and","they","have","been","a","coupl","for","four","year",".","They","talk","about","their","childhood","and","youth","-","Jason","belong","to","a","Pentacost","church",",","deMarco","was","rais","Cathol",".","They","and","their","parent","talk","about","famili",",","come","to","term","with","sexual",",","and","the","chang","view","of","homosexu","within","some","church",".","Jason","and","deMarco","'s","particular","mission","is","to","reach","gay","youth","with","an","anti-suicid","messag",",","help","them","to","reconcil","the","spiritu","with","the","physic","."],"lemmas":["for","a","year",",","camera","follow","pop","duo","Jason","and","deMarco","as","they","give","concert","and","interview",",","assemble","a","new","CD",",","and","go","on","the","road","to","promote","it",".","they","sing","Christian","rock",",","include","dance","remix",".","they","be","gay","and","they","have","be","a","couple","for","four","year",".","they","talk","about","they","childhood","and","youth","-","Jason","belong","to","a","pentacostal","church",",","demarco","be","raise","Catholic",".","they","and","they","parent","talk","about","family",",","come","to","term","with","sexuality",",","and","the","change","view","of","homosexuality","within","some","church",".","Jason","and","deMarco","'s","particular","mission","be","to","reach","gay","youth","with","a","anti-suicide","message",",","help","they","to","reconcile","the","spiritual","with","the","physical","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["For a year","a year ,","year , cameras",", cameras follow","cameras follow pop","follow pop duo","pop duo Jason","duo Jason and","Jason and deMarco","and deMarco as","deMarco as they","as they give","they give concerts","give concerts and","concerts and interviews","and interviews ,","interviews , assemble",", assemble a","assemble a new","a new CD","new CD ,","CD , and",", and go","and go on","go on the","on the road","the road to","road to promote","to promote it","They sing Christian","sing Christian rock","Christian rock ,","rock , including",", including dance","including dance remixes","They are gay","are gay and","gay and they","and they have","they have been","have been a","been a couple","a couple for","couple for four","for four years","They talk about","talk about their","about their childhood","their childhood and","childhood and youth","and youth -","youth -

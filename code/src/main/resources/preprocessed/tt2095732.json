{"title":"Obliteration","plot":"Obliteration, a multimedia installation by the Iranian born artist Elahe Massumi, uses the practice of female circumcision to explore the difficulties which women still face in this supposedly enlightened era. Routinely carried out throughout Africa and in parts of Middle East, female circumcision involves the removal of the clitoris and sometimes-other portions of the female genitalia from young girls and young women. The painful procedure, which is frequently performed without benefit of anesthesia, is deemed necessary to ensure that the young women will be marriageable.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Obliter",",","a","multimedia","instal","by","the","Iranian","born","artist","Elahe","Massumi",",","use","the","practic","of","femal","circumcis","to","explor","the","difficulti","which","women","still","face","in","this","suppos","enlighten","era",".","Routin","carri","out","throughout","Africa","and","in","part","of","Middl","East",",","femal","circumcis","involv","the","remov","of","the","clitori","and","sometimes-oth","portion","of","the","femal","genitalia","from","young","girl","and","young","women",".","The","pain","procedur",",","which","is","frequent","perform","without","benefit","of","anesthesia",",","is","deem","necessari","to","ensur","that","the","young","women","will","be","marriag","."],"lemmas":["Obliteration",",","a","multimedia","installation","by","the","Iranian","bear","artist","Elahe","Massumi",",","use","the","practice","of","female","circumcision","to","explore","the","difficulty","which","woman","still","face","in","this","supposedly","enlighten","era",".","routinely","carry","out","throughout","Africa","and","in","part","of","Middle","East",",","female","circumcision","involve","the","removal","of","the","clitoris","and","sometimes-other","portion","of","the","female","genitalium","from","young","girl","and","young","woman",".","the","painful","procedure",",","which","be","frequently","perform","without","benefit","of","anesthesia",",","be","deem","necessary","to","ensure","that","the","young","woman","will","be","marriageable","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Obliteration , a",", a multimedia","a multimedia installation","multimedia installation by","installation by the","by the Iranian","the Iranian born","Iranian born artist","born artist Elahe","artist Elahe Massumi","Elahe Massumi ,","Massumi , uses",", uses the","uses the practice","the practice of","practice of female","of female circumcision","female circumcision to","circumcision to explore","to explore the","explore the difficulties","the difficulties which","difficulties which women","which women still","women still face","still face in","face in this","in this supposedly","this supposedly enlightened","supposedly enlightened era","Routinely carried out","carried out throughout","out throughout Africa","throughout Africa and","Africa and in","and in parts","in parts of","parts of Middle","of Middle East","Middle East ,","East , female",", female circumcision","female circumcision involves","circumcision involves the","involves the removal","the removal of","removal of the","of the clitoris","the clitoris and","clitoris and sometimes-other","and sometimes-other portions","sometimes-other portions of","portions of the","of the female","the female genitalia","female genitalia from","genitalia from young","from young girls","young girls and","girls and young","and young women","The painful procedure","painful procedure ,","procedure , which",", which is","which is frequently","is frequently performed","frequently performed without","performed without benefit","without benefit of","benefit of anesthesia","of anesthesia ,","anesthesia , is",", is deemed","is deemed necessary","deemed necessary to","necessary to ensure","to ensure that","ensure that the","that the young","the young women","young women will","women will be","will be marriageable"],"2grams":["Obliteration ,",", a","a multimedia","multimedia installation","installation by","by the","the Iranian","Iranian born","born artist","artist Elahe","Elahe Massumi","Massumi ,",", uses","uses the","the practice","practice of","of female","female circumcision","circumcision to","to explore","explore the","the difficulties","difficulties which","which women","women still","still face","face in","in this","this supposedly","supposedly enlightened","enlightened era","Routinely carried","carried out","out throughout","throughout Africa","Africa and","and in","in parts","parts of","of Middle","Middle East","East ,",", female","female circumcision","circumcision involves","involves the","the removal","removal of","of the","the clitoris","clitoris and","and sometimes-other","sometimes-other portions","portions of","of the","the female","female genitalia","genitalia from","from young","young girls","girls and","and young","young women","The painful","painful procedure","procedure ,",", which","which is","is frequently","frequently performed","performed without","without benefit","benefit of","of anesthesia","anesthesia ,",", is","is deemed","deemed necessary","necessary to","to ensure","ensure that","that the","the young","young women","women will","will be","be marriageable"]}

{"title":"Princess Aurora","plot":"A woman gets killed in a department store. No one imagines this could lead to serial murders, but two days after the first murder, another homicide occurs. A woman is suffocated to death and the only evidence left at the crime scene is a sticker of the cartoon character \"Princess Aurora\". A veteran detective OH suspects an attractive and lively woman named JUNG Soon-jung as the murderer. However, he does not tell anyone -not even his partner- that Jung also happens to be his ex-wife. Again and again, the Princess Aurora sticker is found... each with a dead body.","genres":["Crime"," Mystery"," Drama"],"stems":["A","woman","get","kill","in","a","depart","store",".","No","one","imagin","this","could","lead","to","serial","murder",",","but","two","day","after","the","first","murder",",","anoth","homicid","occur",".","A","woman","is","suffoc","to","death","and","the","onli","evid","left","at","the","crime","scene","is","a","sticker","of","the","cartoon","charact","\"","Princess","Aurora","\"",".","A","veteran","detect","OH","suspect","an","attract","and","live","woman","name","JUNG","Soon-jung","as","the","murder",".","Howev",",","he","doe","not","tell","anyon","-","not","even","his","partner","-","that","Jung","also","happen","to","be","his","ex-wif",".","Again","and","again",",","the","Princess","Aurora","sticker","is","found","...","each","with","a","dead","bodi","."],"lemmas":["a","woman","get","kill","in","a","department","store",".","no","one","imagine","this","could","lead","to","serial","murder",",","but","two","day","after","the","first","murder",",","another","homicide","occur",".","a","woman","be","suffocate","to","death","and","the","only","evidence","leave","at","the","crime","scene","be","a","sticker","of","the","cartoon","character","``","Princess","Aurora","''",".","a","veteran","detective","oh","suspect","a","attractive","and","lively","woman","name","JUNG","soon-jung","as","the","murderer",".","however",",","he","do","not","tell","anyone","-","not","even","he","partner","-","that","Jung","also","happen","to","be","he","ex-wife",".","again","and","again",",","the","Princess","Aurora","sticker","be","find","...","each","with","a","dead","body","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A woman gets","woman gets killed","gets killed in","killed in a","in a department","a department store","No one imagines","one imagines this","imagines this could","this could lead","could lead to","lead to serial","to serial murders","serial murders ,","murders , but",", but two","but two days","two days after","days after the","after the first","the first murder","first murder ,","murder , another",", another homicide","another homicide occurs","A woman is","woman is suffocated","is suffocated to","suffocated to death","to death and","death and the","and the only","the only evidence","only evidence left","evidence left at","left at the","at the crime","the crime scene","crime scene is","scene is a","is a sticker","a sticker of","sticker of the","of the cartoon","the cartoon character","cartoon character \"","character \" Princess","\" Princess Aurora","Princess Aurora \"","A veteran detective","veteran detective OH","detective OH suspects","OH suspects an","suspects an attractive","an attractive and","attractive and lively","and lively woman","lively woman named","woman named JUNG","named JUNG Soon-jung","JUNG Soon-jung as","Soon-jung as the","as the murderer","However , he",", he does","he does not","does not tell","not tell anyone","tell anyone -","anyone - not","- not even","not even his","even his partner","his partner -","partner - that","- that Jung","that Jung also","Jung also happens","also happens to","happens to be","to be his","be his ex-wife","Again and again","and again ,","again , the",", the Princess","the Princess Aurora","Princess Aurora sticker","Aurora sticker is","sticker is found","is found ...","found ... each","... each with","each with a","with a dead","a dead body"],"2grams":["A woman","woman gets","gets killed","killed in","in a","a department","department store","No one","one imagines","imagines this","this could","could lead","lead to","to serial","serial murders","murders ,",", but","but two","two days","days after","after the","the first","first murder","murder ,",", another","another homicide","homicide occurs","A woman","woman is","is suffocated","suffocated to","to death","death and","and the","the only","only evidence","evidence left","left at","at the","the crime","crime scene","scene is","is a","a sticker","sticker of","of the","the cartoon","cartoon character","character \"","\" Princess","Princess Aurora","Aurora \"","A veteran","veteran detective","detective OH","OH suspects","suspects an","an attractive","attractive and","and lively","lively woman","woman named","named JUNG","JUNG Soon-jung","Soon-jung as","as the","the murderer","However ,",", he","he does","does not","not tell","tell anyone","anyone -","- not","not even","even his","his partner","partner -","- that","that Jung","Jung also","also happens","happens to","to be","be his","his ex-wife","Again and","and again","again ,",", the","the Princess","Princess Aurora","Aurora sticker","sticker is","is found","found ...","... each","each with","with a","a dead","dead body"]}

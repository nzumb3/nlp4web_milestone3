{"title":"Duplicate Sholay","plot":"When Thakur Baldev Singh gets blinded by notorious bandit Gabbar Singh, he seeks the assistance of two former convicts, Jay and Veeru, to bring Gabbar before him so that he can mete out justice in his own way. This was the plot of the original 1975 classic, in this one too Baldev does seek the assistance of Veeru and Jay, but they come together with three other friends, namely Balli, Tara Singh, and Mithun (look-alikes of Sanjay Dutt, Sunny Deol, and Mithun Chakraborty respectively). Also seeking vengeance for her rape is Lajwanti, alias Daku Chutiya, who was raped by Gabbar. Lajwanti is none other than Basanti's sister, who dances in Chandni Bar. Gabbar is assisted by various bandits, including the Singh brothers: Jangal, Mangal, and Dangal, all escaped convicts. The Duplicates are also assisted by Shahenshah, and an Anil Kapoor look-alike. Watch the fun and frolic unfold as the Duplicates team up to fight the invincible Gabbar

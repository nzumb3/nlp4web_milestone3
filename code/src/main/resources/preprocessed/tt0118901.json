Meanwhile, Werner must contend with his nutty supervisor, who insists that he only care for patients with full insurance. Can Werner sidestep the hospital's legal team and do what's best for the patient?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Werner","Ernst","is","a","young","hospit","resid","who","becom","embroil","in","a","legal","battl","between","two","half-sist","who","are","fight","over","the","care","of","their","comatos","father",".","But","are","they","realli","fight","over","their","father","'s","care",",","or","over","his","$","10","million","estat","?","Meanwhil",",","Werner","must","contend","with","his","nutti","supervisor",",","who","insist","that","he","onli","care","for","patient","with","full","insur",".","Can","Werner","sidestep","the","hospit","'s","legal","team","and","do","what","'s","best","for","the","patient","?"],"lemmas":["Werner","Ernst","be","a","young","hospital","resident","who","become","embroil","in","a","legal","battle","between","two","half-sister","who","be","fight","over","the","care","of","they","comatose","father",".","but","be","they","really","fight","over","they","father","'s","care",",","or","over","he","$","10","million","estate","?","meanwhile",",","Werner","must","contend","with","he","nutty","supervisor",",","who","insist","that","he","only","care","for","patient","with","full","insurance",".","can","Werner","sidestep","the","hospital","'s","legal","team","and","do","what","be","best","for","the","patient","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Werner Ernst is","Ernst is a","is a young","a young hospital","young hospital resident","hospital resident who","resident who becomes","who becomes embroiled","becomes embroiled in","embroiled in a","in a legal","a legal battle","legal battle between","battle between two","between two half-sisters","two half-sisters who","half-sisters who are","who are fighting","are fighting over","fighting over the","over the care","the care of","care of their","of their comatose","their comatose father","But are they","are they really","they really fighting","really fighting over","fighting over their","over their father","their father 's","father 's care","'s care ,","care , or",", or over","or over his","over his $","his $ 10","$ 10 million","10 million estate","Meanwhile , Werner",", Werner must","Werner must contend","must contend with","contend with his","with his nutty","his nutty supervisor","nutty supervisor ,","supervisor , who",", who insists","who insists that","insists that he","that he only","he only care","only care for","care for patients","for patients with","patients with full","with full insurance","Can Werner sidestep","Werner sidestep the","sidestep the hospital","the hospital 's","hospital 's legal","'s legal team","legal team and","team and do","and do what","do what 's","what 's best","'s best for","best for the","for the patient"],"2grams":["Werner Ernst","Ernst is","is a","a young","young hospital","hospital resident","resident who","who becomes","becomes embroiled","embroiled in","in a","a legal","legal battle","battle between","between two","two half-sisters","half-sisters who","who are","are fighting","fighting over","over the","the care","care of","of their","their comatose","comatose father","But are","are they","they really","really fighting","fighting over","over their","their father","father 's","'s care","care ,",", or","or over","over his","his $","$ 10","10 million","million estate","Meanwhile ,",", Werner","Werner must","must contend","contend with","with his","his nutty","nutty supervisor","supervisor ,",", who","who insists","insists that","that he","he only","only care","care for","for patients","patients with","with full","full insurance","Can Werner","Werner sidestep","sidestep the","the hospital","hospital 's","'s legal","legal team","team and","and do","do what","what 's","'s best","best for","for the","the patient"]}

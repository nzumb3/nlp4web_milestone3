{"title":"Eating Alabama","plot":"In search of a simpler life, a young couple returns home to Alabama where they set out to eat the way their grandparents did - locally and seasonally. But as their new diet forces them to navigate the agricultural industrial complex, they soon realize that nearly everything about the food system has changed since farmers once populated their family histories. A thoughtful and often funny essay on community, the South and sustainability, \"Eating Alabama\" is a story about why food matters.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","search","of","a","simpler","life",",","a","young","coupl","return","home","to","Alabama","where","they","set","out","to","eat","the","way","their","grandpar","did","-","local","and","season",".","But","as","their","new","diet","forc","them","to","navig","the","agricultur","industri","complex",",","they","soon","realiz","that","near","everyth","about","the","food","system","has","chang","sinc","farmer","onc","popul","their","famili","histori",".","A","thought","and","often","funni","essay","on","communiti",",","the","South","and","sustain",",","\"","Eate","Alabama","\"","is","a","stori","about","whi","food","matter","."],"lemmas":["in","search","of","a","simpler","life",",","a","young","couple","return","home","to","Alabama","where","they","set","out","to","eat","the","way","they","grandparent","do","-","locally","and","seasonally",".","but","as","they","new","diet","force","they","to","navigate","the","agricultural","industrial","complex",",","they","soon","realize","that","nearly","everything","about","the","food","system","have","change","since","farmer","once","populate","they","family","history",".","a","thoughtful","and","often","funny","essay","on","community",",","the","South","and","sustainability",",","``","Eating","Alabama","''","be","a","story","about","why","food","matter","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In search of","search of a","of a simpler","a simpler life","simpler life ,","life , a",", a young","a young couple","young couple returns","couple returns home","returns home to","home to Alabama","to Alabama where","Alabama where they","where they set","they set out","set out to","out to eat","to eat the","eat the way","the way their","way their grandparents","their grandparents did","grandparents did -","did - locally","- locally and","locally and seasonally","But as their","as their new","their new diet","new diet forces","diet forces them","forces them to","them to navigate","to navigate the","navigate the agricultural","the agricultural industrial","agricultural industrial complex","industrial complex ,","complex , they",", they soon","they soon realize","soon realize that","realize that nearly","that nearly everything","nearly everything about","everything about the","about the food","the food system","food system has","system has changed","has changed since","changed since farmers","since farmers once","farmers once populated","once populated their","populated their family","their family histories","A thoughtful and","thoughtful and often","and often funny","often funny essay","funny essay on","essay on community","on community ,","community , the",", the South","the South and","South and sustainability","and sustainability ,","sustainability , \"",", \" Eating","\" Eating Alabama","Eating Alabama \"","Alabama \" is","\" is a","is a story","a story about","story about why","about why food","why food matters"],"2grams":["In search","search of","of a","a simpler","simpler life","life ,",", a","a young","young couple","couple returns","returns home","home to","to Alabama","Alabama where","where they","they set","set out","out to","to eat","eat the","the way","way their","their grandparents","grandparents did","did -","- locally","locally and","and seasonally","But as","as their","their new","new diet","diet forces","forces them","them to","to navigate","navigate the","the agricultural","agricultural industrial","industrial complex","complex ,",", they","they soon","soon realize","realize that","that nearly","nearly everything","everything about","about the","the food","food system","system has","has changed","changed since","since farmers","farmers once","once populated","populated their","their family","family histories","A thoughtful","thoughtful and","and often","often funny","funny essay","essay on","on community","community ,",", the","the South","South and","and sustainability","sustainability ,",", \"","\" Eating","Eating Alabama","Alabama \"","\" is","is a","a story","story about","about why","why food","food matters"]}

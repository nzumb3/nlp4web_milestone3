{"title":"After Death","plot":"When failed inventor James Jones (Paul Freeman) dies in a laboratory accident, his estranged children return to the family estate to settle his affairs. They each bring their own baggage: Eloise (Claira Watson Parr) has never recovered from the loss of her mother and brother, and cant find a lasting job or relationship. Yossarian (Ben Shockley) is a presenter on a bad daytime TV show. Suki (Nicola Goodchild) has always been the practical one, and she takes out her ill humor on her timid spouse, Colin (Jonathan Hansler). The only thing the siblings seem to share is their guilt over abandoning their father seven years ago, when he accidentally killed their brother Tom (David Wayman). A lawyer (David Acton) hired by their shady Uncle Simon (Linal Haft) informs the siblings that their father had borrowed against the house for his last experiment, and that his estate belongs to the bank. This news sets the siblings on a scavenger hunt, which leads them to their fathers last invention: a link to the supernatural world. They must find what they need to make the link work, or the souls of their father and brother will be lost forever when they lose the house.","genres":["Comedy"," Mystery","

Hundreds of thousands of people gathered in St Peter's square to pay tribute to his 27-year Pontificate. Following His moving funeral, it was time to think of preparing the conclave, which would see the papacy pass from John Paul II to his successor Benedict XVI, through a religious ceremony regulated by ancient tradition and new customs.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["April","2",",","2005","-","7,37","pm",":","it","was","announc","to","the","world","that","John","Paul","II","had","return","to","the","hous","of","the","Father",".","Hundr","of","thousand","of","peopl","gather","in","St","Peter","'s","squar","to","pay","tribut","to","his","27-year","Pontif",".","Follow","His","move","funer",",","it","was","time","to","think","of","prepar","the","conclav",",","which","would","see","the","papaci","pass","from","John","Paul","II","to","his","successor","Benedict","XVI",",","through","a","religi","ceremoni","regul","by","ancient","tradit","and","new","custom","."],"lemmas":["April","2",",","2005","-","7,37","pm",":","it","be","announce","to","the","world","that","John","Paul","II","have","return","to","the","house","of","the","Father",".","hundred","of","thousand","of","people","gather","in","St","Peter","'s","square","to","pay","tribute","to","he","27-year","Pontificate",".","follow","he","move","funeral",",","it","be","time","to","think","of","prepare","the","conclave",",","which","would","see","the","papacy","pass","from","John","Paul","II","to","he","successor","Benedict","XVI",",","through","a","religious","ceremony","regulate","by","ancient","tradition","and","new","custom","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["April 2 ,","2 , 2005",", 2005 -","2005 - 7,37","- 7,37 pm","7,37 pm :","pm : it",": it was","it was announced","was announced to","announced to the","to the world","the world that","world that John","that John Paul","John Paul II","Paul II had","II had returned","had returned to","returned to the","to the house","the house of","house of the","of the Father","Hundreds of thousands","of thousands of","thousands of people","of people gathered","people gathered in","gathered in St","in St Peter","St Peter 's","Peter 's square","'s square to","square to pay","to pay tribute","pay tribute to","tribute to his","to his 27-year","his 27-year Pontificate","Following His moving","His moving funeral","moving funeral ,","funeral , it",", it was","it was time","was time to","time to think","to think of","think of preparing","of preparing the","preparing the conclave","the conclave ,","conclave , which",", which would","which would see","would see the","see the papacy","the papacy pass","papacy pass from","pass from John","from John Paul","John Paul II","Paul II to","II to his","to his successor","his successor Benedict","successor Benedict XVI","Benedict XVI ,","XVI , through",", through a","through a religious","a religious ceremony","religious ceremony regulated","ceremony regulated by","regulated by ancient","by ancient tradition","ancient tradition and","tradition and new","and new customs"],"2grams":["April 2","2 ,",", 2005","2005 -","- 7,37","7,37 pm","pm :",": it","it was","was announced","announced to","to the","the world","world that","that John","John Paul","Paul II","II had","had returned","returned to","to the","the house","house of","of the","the Father","Hundreds of","of thousands","thousands of","of people","people gathered","gathered in","in St","St Peter","Peter 's","'s square","square to","to pay","pay tribute","tribute to","to his","his 27-year","27-year Pontificate","Following His","His moving","moving funeral","funeral ,",", it","it was","was time","time to","to think","think of","of preparing","preparing the","the conclave","conclave ,",", which","which would","would see","see the","the papacy","papacy pass","pass from","from John","John Paul","Paul II","II to","to his","his successor","successor Benedict","Benedict XVI","XVI ,",", through","through a","a religious","religious ceremony","ceremony regulated","regulated by","by ancient","ancient tradition","tradition and","and new","new customs"]}

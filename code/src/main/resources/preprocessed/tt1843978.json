{"title":"Lynching Charlie Lynch","plot":"In 2006, Charlie Lynch was invited by the civic leaders of Morro Bay, CA to open a medical marijuana dispensary within the city limits. Offered a business license and asked to join the Chamber of Commerce, Lynch opened and maintained his business according to the most rigorous standards available. However, marijuana remains a Class 1 narcotic according to the DEA, and Lynch's business soon became the target of a large Federal investigation. This film explores the horrific descent into hell faced by Mr. Lynch - previously a law abiding citizen without so much as a speeding ticket, as he is cast as a Pablo Escobar and thrown into Federal detention.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","2006",",","Charli","Lynch","was","invit","by","the","civic","leader","of","Morro","Bay",",","CA","to","open","a","medic","marijuana","dispensari","within","the","citi","limit",".","Offere","a","busi","licens","and","ask","to","join","the","Chamber","of","Commerc",",","Lynch","open","and","maintain","his","busi","accord","to","the","most","rigor","standard","avail",".","Howev",",","marijuana","remain","a","Class","1","narcot","accord","to","the","DEA",",","and","Lynch","'s","busi","soon","becam","the","target","of","a","larg","Feder","investig",".","This","film","explor","the","horrif","descent","into","hell","face","by","Mr.","Lynch","-","previous","a","law","abid","citizen","without","so","much","as","a","speed","ticket",",","as","he","is","cast","as","a","Pablo","Escobar","and","thrown","into","Feder","detent","."],"lemmas":["in","2006",",","Charlie","Lynch","be","invite","by","the","civic","leader","of","Morro","Bay",",","CA","to","open","a","medical","marijuana","dispensary","within","the","city","limit",".","offer","a","business","license","and","ask","to","join","the","Chamber","of","Commerce",",","Lynch","open","and","maintain","he","business","accord","to","the","most","rigorous","standard","available",".","however",",","marijuana","remain","a","class","1","narcotic","accord","to","the","DEA",",","and","Lynch","'s","business","soon","become","the","target","of","a","large","Federal","investigation",".","this","film","explore","the","horrific","descent","into","hell","face","by","Mr.","Lynch","-","previously","a","law","abide","citizen","without","so","much","as","a","speeding","ticket",",","as","he","be","cast","as","a","Pablo","Escobar","and","throw","into","Federal","detention","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 2006 ,","2006 , Charlie",", Charlie Lynch","Charlie Lynch was","Lynch was invited","was invited by","invited by the","by the civic","the civic leaders","civic leaders of","leaders of Morro","of Morro Bay","Morro Bay ,","Bay , CA",", CA to","CA to open","to open a","open a medical","a medical marijuana","medical marijuana dispensary","marijuana dispensary within","dispensary within the","within the city","the city limits","Offered a business","a business license","business license and","license and asked","and asked to","asked to join","to join the","join the Chamber","the Chamber of","Chamber of Commerce","of Commerce ,","Commerce , Lynch",", Lynch opened","Lynch opened and","opened and maintained","and maintained his","maintained his business","his business according","business according to","according to the","to the most","the most rigorous","most rigorous standards","rigorous standards available","However , marijuana",", marijuana remains","marijuana remains a","remains a Class","a Class 1","Class 1 narcotic","1 narcotic according","narcotic according to","according to the","to the DEA","the DEA ,","DEA , and",", and Lynch","and Lynch 's","Lynch 's business","'s business soon","business soon became","soon became the","became the target","the target of","target of a","of a large","a large Federal","large Federal investigation","This film explores","film explores the","explores the horrific","the horrific descent","horrific descent into","descent into hell","into hell faced","hell faced by","faced by Mr.","by Mr. Lynch","Mr. Lynch -","Lynch -

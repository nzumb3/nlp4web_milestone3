{"title":"Namaste Nepal","plot":"Cinterra Pictures and Purgatory Productions present Namaste Nepal, a feature documentary about the journey of a lifetime and the power of travel to change perceptions. Namaste Nepal is an adventure that proves that friendship crosses borders and speaks its own language. The film follows American students from their privileged homes in the Silicon Valley to the district of Manang, Nepal 13,000 ft. high into the Himalayan Mountains. There the American Students immerse themselves in Nepali culture and open themselves up to ways of living vastly different than their own upbringing, as they foster relationships with a group of Manangi high schoolers. Both groups of students come away forever changed by their experience, and better prepared to be citizens of our increasingly globalized world.","genres":["Adventure","

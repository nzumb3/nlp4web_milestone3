{"title":"Border Lost","plot":"Over five thousand people illegally cross the border each day. There are areas where crime is at its highest, where criminals prey upon these defenseless groups. An elite task force is put together with high expectations of solving this problem that is plaguing our border. After only a few short years, the operation is shut down due to the weight of overwhelming politics and red tape. With one of their own killed, and another missing, three agents decide to take the law into their own hands. Doing what was necessary from the beginning, but was always off limits, they decide to cross into Mexico. They find themselves up against more than they bargained for.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Over","five","thousand","peopl","illeg","cross","the","border","each","day",".","There","are","area","where","crime","is","at","it","highest",",","where","crimin","prey","upon","these","defenseless","group",".","An","elit","task","forc","is","put","togeth","with","high","expect","of","solv","this","problem","that","is","plagu","our","border",".","After","onli","a","few","short","year",",","the","oper","is","shut","down","due","to","the","weight","of","overwhelm","polit","and","red","tape",".","With","one","of","their","own","kill",",","and","anoth","miss",",","three","agent","decid","to","take","the","law","into","their","own","hand",".","Do","what","was","necessari","from","the","begin",",","but","was","alway","off","limit",",","they","decid","to","cross","into","Mexico",".","They","find","themselv","up","against","more","than","they","bargain","for","."],"lemmas":["over","five","thousand","people","illegally","cross","the","border","each","day",".","there","be","area","where","crime","be","at","its","highest",",","where","criminal","prey","upon","these","defenseless","group",".","a","elite","task","force","be","put","together","with","high","expectation","of","solve","this","problem","that","be","plague","we","border",".","after","only","a","few","short","year",",","the","operation","be","shut","down","due","to","the","weight","of","overwhelming","politics","and","red","tape",".","with","one","of","they","own","kill",",","and","another","miss",",","three","agent","decide","to","take","the","law","into","they","own","hand",".","do","what","be","necessary","from","the","beginning",",","but","be","always","off","limit",",","they","decide","to","cross","into","Mexico",".","they","find","themselves","up","against","more","than","they","bargain","for","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Over

{"title":"A Place Called Home: An Adoption Story","plot":"A Place Called Home: An Adoption Story is the heartwarming true story of one family's struggle to adopt nine children in the face of overwhelming odds. Five years in the making, A Place Called Home is a documentary filled with the joy and pain that can often accompany the adoption process. After reading a Mother's Day newspaper article, Baby Boomers Tom and Jean (of Indianapolis, Indiana) decided to wave goodbye to their four year-old empty nest and attempt the second largest sibling group adoption in United States history. As the story unfolds, we learn of the abuse the children suffered at the hands of their stepfather and watch as they prepare for a possible new life with Tom and Jean. During the trial period, they discover that the road to adoption is even more difficult than they had originally imagined. Sensitive and affectionate in its portrayal, the film chronicles the evolution of the adoption from moments of doubt to moments of hope and triumph. A Place Called Home gives viewers a rare glimpse into the emotional bonding of two families as they confront their pasts and work for a better future... together.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","Place","Call","Home",":","An","Adoption","Stori","is","the","heartwarm","true","stori","of","one","famili","'s","struggl","to","adopt","nine","children","in","the","face","of","overwhelm","odd",".","Five","year","in","the","make",",","A","Place","Call","Home","is","a","documentari","fill","with","the","joy","and","pain","that","can","often","accompani","the","adopt","process",".","After","read","a","Mother","'s","Day","newspap","articl",",","Babi","Boomer","Tom","and","Jean","(","of","Indianapoli",",","Indiana",")","decid","to","wave","goodby","to","their","four","year-old","empti","nest","and","attempt","the","second","largest","sibl","group","adopt","in","Unite","State","histori",".","As","the","stori","unfold",",","we","learn","of","the","abus","the","children","suffer","at","the","hand","of","their","stepfath","and","watch","as","they","prepar","for","a","possibl","new","life","with","Tom","and","Jean",".","Dure","the","trial","period",",","they","discov","that","the","road","to","adopt","is","even","more","difficult","than","they","had","origin","imagin",".","Sensit","and","affection","in","it","portray",",","the","film","chronicl","the","evolut","of","the","adopt","from","moment","of","doubt","to","moment","of","hope","and","triumph",".","A","Place","Call","Home","give","viewer","a","rare","glimps","into","the","emot","bond","of","two","famili","as","they","confront","their","past","and","work","for","a","better","futur","...","togeth","."],"lemmas":["a","place","call","Home",":","An","Adoption","Story","be","the","heartwarming","true","story","of","one","family","'s","struggle","to","adopt","nine","child","in","the","face","of","overwhelming","odds",".","five","year","in","the","making",",","a","place","call","Home","be","a","documentary","fill","with","the","joy","and","pain","that","can","often","accompany","the","adoption","process",".","after","read","a","Mother","'s","Day","newspaper","article",",","Baby","Boomers","Tom","and","Jean","-lrb-","of","Indianapolis",",","Indiana","-rrb-","decide","to","wave","goodbye","to","they","four","year-old","empty","nest","and","attempt","the","second","largest","sibling","group","adoption","in","United","States","history",".","as","the","story","unfold",",","we","learn","of","the","abuse","the","child","suffer","at","the","hand","of","they","stepfather","and","watch","as","they","prepare","for","a","possible","new","life","with","Tom","and","Jean",".","during","the","trial","period",",","they","discover","that","the","road","to","adoption","be","even","more","difficult","than","they","have","originally","imagine",".","sensitive","and","affectionate","in","its","portrayal",",","the","film","chronicle","the","evolution","of","the","adoption","from","moment","of","doubt","to","moment","of","hope","and","triumph",".","a","place","call","Home","give","viewer","a","rare","glimpse","into","the","emotional","bonding","of","two","family","as","they","confront","they","past","and","work","for","a","better","future","...","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

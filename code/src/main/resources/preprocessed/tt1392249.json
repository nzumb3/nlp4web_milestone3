{"title":"Night and Fog","plot":"Ann Hui's darkly realistic Night and Fog starts at the end of the story: a man murders his wife and, based on statements by unreliable witnesses, the film goes on to investigate how things could have got this far and what kind of man was able to kill his family; questions that almost inevitably remain unanswered. Night and Fog, named after Nuit et brouillard (1955), Alain Resnais' documentary about concentration camps, looks at the difficult problem of domestic violence. An elderly man from Hong Kong takes a wife from outside the city and goes on to neglect and abuse the woman. Ann Hui's cool registering camera is juxtaposed with flashbacks within flashbacks and dream sequences, just as in her earlier film, Song of the Exile (1990).","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Ann","Hui","'s","dark","realist","Night","and","Fog","start","at","the","end","of","the","stori",":","a","man","murder","his","wife","and",",","base","on","statement","by","unreli","wit",",","the","film","goe","on","to","investig","how","thing","could","have","got","this","far","and","what","kind","of","man","was","abl","to","kill","his","famili",";","question","that","almost","inevit","remain","unansw",".","Night","and","Fog",",","name","after","Nuit","et","brouillard","(","1955",")",",","Alain","Resnai","'","documentari","about","concentr","camp",",","look","at","the","difficult","problem","of","domest","violenc",".","An","elder","man","from","Hong","Kong","take","a","wife","from","outsid","the","citi","and","goe","on","to","neglect","and","abus","the","woman",".","Ann","Hui","'s","cool","regist","camera","is","juxtapos","with","flashback","within","flashback","and","dream","sequenc",",","just","as","in","her","earlier","film",",","Song","of","the","Exile","(","1990",")","."],"lemmas":["Ann","Hui","'s","darkly","realistic","night","and","fog","start","at","the","end","of","the","story",":","a","man","murder","he","wife","and",",","base","on","statement","by","unreliable","witness",",","the","film","go","on","to","investigate","how","thing","could","have","get","this","far","and","what","kind","of","man","be","able","to","kill","he","family",";","question","that","almost","inevitably","remain","unanswered",".","night","and","fog",",","name","after","nuit","et","brouillard","-lrb-","1955","-rrb-",",","Alain","Resnais","'","documentary","about","concentration","camp",",","look","at","the","difficult","problem","of","domestic","violence",".","a","elderly","man","from","Hong","Kong","take","a","wife","from","outside","the","city","and","go","on","to","neglect","and","abuse","the","woman",".","Ann","Hui","'s","cool","register","camera","be","juxtapose","with","flashback","within","flashback","and","dream","sequence",",","just","as","in","she","earlier","film",",","song","of","the","exile","-lrb-","1990","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ann Hui 's","Hui 's darkly","'s darkly realistic","darkly realistic Night","realistic Night and","Night and Fog","and Fog starts","Fog starts at","starts at the","at the end","the end of","end of the","of the story","the story :","story : a",": a man","a man murders","man murders his","murders his wife","his wife and","wife and ,","and , based",", based on","based on statements","on statements by","statements by unreliable","by unreliable witnesses","unreliable witnesses ,","witnesses , the",", the film","the film goes","film goes on","goes on to","on to investigate","to investigate how","investigate how things","how things could","things could have","could have got","have got this","got this far","this far and","far and what","and what kind","what kind of","kind of man","of man was","man was able","was able to","able to kill","to kill his","kill his family","his family ;","family ;

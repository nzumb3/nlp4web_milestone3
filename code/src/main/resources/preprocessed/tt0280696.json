{"title":"Garage Days","plot":"A coming-of-age comedy about a young Sydney band trying to get a foothold in the competitive world of rock n' roll. After the band's first gig is a colossal failure, the lead singer takes it upon himself to go out and pursue the most successful rock manager in the country. Meanwhile the other members of the band continue to deal with the kind of every day life issues that can ultimately tear a band apart. It may be the dawn of a new millennium but it's still a long way to the top if you want to rock n' roll.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["A","coming-of-ag","comedi","about","a","young","Sydney","band","tri","to","get","a","foothold","in","the","competit","world","of","rock","n","'","roll",".","After","the","band","'s","first","gig","is","a","coloss","failur",",","the","lead","singer","take","it","upon","himself","to","go","out","and","pursu","the","most","success","rock","manag","in","the","countri",".","Meanwhil","the","other","member","of","the","band","continu","to","deal","with","the","kind","of","everi","day","life","issu","that","can","ultim","tear","a","band","apart",".","It","may","be","the","dawn","of","a","new","millennium","but","it","'s","still","a","long","way","to","the","top","if","you","want","to","rock","n","'","roll","."],"lemmas":["a","coming-of-age","comedy","about","a","young","Sydney","band","try","to","get","a","foothold","in","the","competitive","world","of","rock","n","'","roll",".","after","the","band","'s","first","gig","be","a","colossal","failure",",","the","lead","singer","take","it","upon","himself","to","go","out","and","pursue","the","most","successful","rock","manager","in","the","country",".","meanwhile","the","other","member","of","the","band","continue","to","deal","with","the","kind","of","every","day","life","issue","that","can","ultimately","tear","a","band","apart",".","it","may","be","the","dawn","of","a","new","millennium","but","it","be","still","a","long","way","to","the","top","if","you","want","to","rock","n","'","roll","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A coming-of-age comedy","coming-of-age comedy about","comedy about a","about a young","a young Sydney","young Sydney band","Sydney band trying","band trying to","trying to get","to get a","get a foothold","a foothold in","foothold in the","in the competitive","the competitive world","competitive world of","world of rock","of rock n","rock n '","n ' roll","After the band","the band 's","band 's first","'s first gig","first gig is","gig is a","is a colossal","a colossal failure","colossal failure ,","failure , the",", the lead","the lead singer","lead singer takes","singer takes it","takes it upon","it upon himself","upon himself to","himself to go","to go out","go out and","out and pursue","and pursue the","pursue the most","the most successful","most successful rock","successful rock manager","rock manager in","manager in the","in the country","Meanwhile the other","the other members","other members of","members of the","of the band","the band continue","band continue to","continue to deal","to deal with","deal with the","with the kind","the kind of","kind of every","of every day","every day life","day life issues","life issues that","issues that can","that can ultimately","can ultimately tear","ultimately tear a","tear a band","a band apart","It may be","may be the","be the dawn","the dawn of","dawn of a","of a new","a new millennium","new millennium but","millennium but it","but it 's","it 's still","'s still a","still a long","a long way","long way to","way to the","to the top","the top if","top if you","if you want","you want to","want to rock","to rock n","rock n '","n ' roll"],"2grams":["A coming-of-age","coming-of-age comedy","comedy about","about a","a young","young Sydney","Sydney band","band trying","trying to","to get","get a","a foothold","foothold in","in the","the competitive","competitive world","world of","of rock","rock n","n '","' roll","After the","the band","band 's","'s first","first gig","gig is","is a","a colossal","colossal failure","failure ,",", the","the lead","lead singer","singer takes","takes it","it upon","upon himself","himself to","to go","go out","out and","and pursue","pursue the","the most","most successful","successful rock","rock manager","manager in","in the","the country","Meanwhile the","the other","other members","members of","of the","the band","band continue","continue to","to deal","deal with","with the","the kind","kind of","of every","every day","day life","life issues","issues that","that can","can ultimately","ultimately tear","tear a","a band","band apart","It may","may be","be the","the dawn","dawn of","of a","a new","new millennium","millennium but","but it","it 's","'s still","still a","a long","long way","way to","to the","the top","top if","if you","you want","want to","to rock","rock n","n '","' roll"]}

{"title":"The Auction","plot":"Gaby owns a farm on which he raises lambs: Gagnon and Sons Farm. But he has no sons. Rather, he has two daughters that he raised like princesses and who live far away, in the big city. One day, the oldest asks him for some financial support so she doesn't end up losing her house. Gaby, for whom fatherhood has evolved to a point where it became unreasonable, decides to dismantle the farm.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Gabi","own","a","farm","on","which","he","rais","lamb",":","Gagnon","and","Son","Farm",".","But","he","has","no","son",".","Rather",",","he","has","two","daughter","that","he","rais","like","princess","and","who","live","far","away",",","in","the","big","citi",".","One","day",",","the","oldest","ask","him","for","some","financi","support","so","she","doe","n't","end","up","lose","her","hous",".","Gabi",",","for","whom","fatherhood","has","evolv","to","a","point","where","it","becam","unreason",",","decid","to","dismantl","the","farm","."],"lemmas":["Gaby","own","a","farm","on","which","he","raise","lamb",":","Gagnon","and","Sons","Farm",".","but","he","have","no","son",".","rather",",","he","have","two","daughter","that","he","raise","like","princess","and","who","live","far","away",",","in","the","big","city",".","one","day",",","the","oldest","ask","he","for","some","financial","support","so","she","do","not","end","up","lose","she","house",".","Gaby",",","for","whom","fatherhood","have","evolve","to","a","point","where","it","become","unreasonable",",","decide","to","dismantle","the","farm","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gaby owns a","owns a farm","a farm on","farm on which","on which he","which he raises","he raises lambs","raises lambs :","lambs : Gagnon",": Gagnon and","Gagnon and Sons","and Sons Farm","But he has","he has no","has no sons","Rather , he",", he has","he has two","has two daughters","two daughters that","daughters that he","that he raised","he raised like","raised like princesses","like princesses and","princesses and who","and who live","who live far","live far away","far away ,","away , in",", in the","in the big","the big city","One day ,","day , the",", the oldest","the oldest asks","oldest asks him","asks him for","him for some","for some financial","some financial support","financial support so","support so she","so she does","she does n't","does n't end","n't end up","end up losing","up losing her","losing her house","Gaby , for",", for whom","for whom fatherhood","whom fatherhood has","fatherhood has evolved","has evolved to","evolved to a","to a point","a point where","point where it","where it became","it became unreasonable","became unreasonable ,","unreasonable , decides",", decides to","decides to dismantle","to dismantle the","dismantle the farm"],"2grams":["Gaby owns","owns a","a farm","farm on","on which","which he","he raises","raises lambs","lambs :",": Gagnon","Gagnon and","and Sons","Sons Farm","But he","he has","has no","no sons","Rather ,",", he","he has","has two","two daughters","daughters that","that he","he raised","raised like","like princesses","princesses and","and who","who live","live far","far away","away ,",", in","in the","the big","big city","One day","day ,",", the","the oldest","oldest asks","asks him","him for","for some","some financial","financial support","support so","so she","she does","does n't","n't end","end up","up losing","losing her","her house","Gaby ,",", for","for whom","whom fatherhood","fatherhood has","has evolved","evolved to","to a","a point","point where","where it","it became","became unreasonable","unreasonable ,",", decides","decides to","to dismantle","dismantle the","the farm"]}

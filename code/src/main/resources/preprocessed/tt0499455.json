She speaks with a nondescript American accent, and it's impossible to pinpoint her ethnicity. We never learn why she made her decision -- she has made it already. We don't know whom she represents, what she believes in - we only know she believes it absolutely.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["A","19-year-old","girl","prepar","to","becom","a","suicid","bomber","in","Time","Squar",".","She","speak","with","a","nondescript","American","accent",",","and","it","'s","imposs","to","pinpoint","her","ethnic",".","We","never","learn","whi","she","made","her","decis","--","she","has","made","it","alreadi",".","We","do","n't","know","whom","she","repres",",","what","she","believ","in","-","we","onli","know","she","believ","it","absolut","."],"lemmas":["a","19-year-old","girl","prepare","to","become","a","suicide","bomber","in","Times","Square",".","she","speak","with","a","nondescript","american","accent",",","and","it","be","impossible","to","pinpoint","she","ethnicity",".","we","never","learn","why","she","make","she","decision","--","she","have","make","it","already",".","we","do","not","know","whom","she","represent",",","what","she","believe","in","-","we","only","know","she","believe","it","absolutely","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A 19-year-old girl","19-year-old girl prepares","girl prepares to","prepares to become","to become a","become a suicide","a suicide bomber","suicide bomber in","bomber in Times","in Times Square","She speaks with","speaks with a","with a nondescript","a nondescript American","nondescript American accent","American accent ,","accent , and",", and it","and it 's","it 's impossible","'s impossible to","impossible to pinpoint","to pinpoint her","pinpoint her ethnicity","We never learn","never learn why","learn why she","why she made","she made her","made her decision","her decision --","decision -- she","-- she has","she has made","has made it","made it already","We do n't","do n't know","n't know whom","know whom she","whom she represents","she represents ,","represents , what",", what she","what she believes","she believes in","believes in -","in - we","- we only","we only know","only know she","know she believes","she believes it","believes it absolutely"],"2grams":["A 19-year-old","19-year-old girl","girl prepares","prepares to","to become","become a","a suicide","suicide bomber","bomber in","in Times","Times Square","She speaks","speaks with","with a","a nondescript","nondescript American","American accent","accent ,",", and","and it","it 's","'s impossible","impossible to","to pinpoint","pinpoint her","her ethnicity","We never","never learn","learn why","why she","she made","made her","her decision","decision --","-- she","she has","has made","made it","it already","We do","do n't","n't know","know whom","whom she","she represents","represents ,",", what","what she","she believes","believes in","in -","- we","we only","only know","know she","she believes","believes it","it absolutely"]}

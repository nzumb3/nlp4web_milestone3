{"title":"Gravity and Grace","plot":"Hannah is about to have her third miscarriage. Working as a social worker at the Mission to Seafarers, she discovers a stowaway drifting aimlessly in the harbor, and decides to give the young man shelter in a decommissioned, cold war era nuclear fallout bunker that is being redesigned by her partner Antonia to serve as an archive dedicated to hagiographic graphology (the study of the saints through their handwriting). Hannah then retreats to a secluded cottage deep in the woods to confront pain and illumination alone.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Hannah","is","about","to","have","her","third","miscarriag",".","Work","as","a","social","worker","at","the","Mission","to","Seafar",",","she","discov","a","stowaway","drift","aimless","in","the","harbor",",","and","decid","to","give","the","young","man","shelter","in","a","decommiss",",","cold","war","era","nuclear","fallout","bunker","that","is","be","redesign","by","her","partner","Antonia","to","serv","as","an","archiv","dedic","to","hagiograph","grapholog","(","the","studi","of","the","saint","through","their","handwrit",")",".","Hannah","then","retreat","to","a","seclud","cottag","deep","in","the","wood","to","confront","pain","and","illumin","alon","."],"lemmas":["Hannah","be","about","to","have","she","third","miscarriage",".","work","as","a","social","worker","at","the","Mission","to","Seafarers",",","she","discover","a","stowaway","drift","aimlessly","in","the","harbor",",","and","decide","to","give","the","young","man","shelter","in","a","decommissioned",",","cold","war","era","nuclear","fallout","bunker","that","be","be","redesign","by","she","partner","Antonia","to","serve","as","a","archive","dedicate","to","hagiographic","graphology","-lrb-","the","study","of","the","saint","through","they","handwriting","-rrb-",".","Hannah","then","retreat","to","a","secluded","cottage","deep","in","the","wood","to","confront","pain","and","illumination","alone","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hannah is about","is about to","about to have","to have her","have her third","her third miscarriage","Working as a","as a social","a social worker","social worker at","worker at the","at the Mission","the Mission to","Mission to Seafarers","to Seafarers ,","Seafarers , she",", she discovers","she discovers a","discovers a stowaway","a stowaway drifting","stowaway drifting aimlessly","drifting aimlessly in","aimlessly in the","in the harbor","the harbor ,","harbor , and",", and decides","and decides to","decides to give","to give the","give the young","the young man","young man shelter","man shelter in","shelter in a","in a decommissioned","a decommissioned ,","decommissioned , cold",", cold war","cold war era","war era nuclear","era nuclear fallout","nuclear fallout bunker","fallout bunker that","bunker that is","that is being","is being redesigned","being redesigned by","redesigned by her","by her partner","her partner Antonia","partner Antonia to","Antonia to serve","to serve as","serve as an","as an archive","an archive dedicated","archive dedicated to","dedicated to hagiographic","to hagiographic graphology","hagiographic graphology (","graphology ( the","( the study","the study of","study of the","of the saints","the saints through","saints through their","through their handwriting","their handwriting )","Hannah then retreats","then retreats to","retreats to a","to a secluded","a secluded cottage","secluded cottage deep","cottage deep in","deep in the","in the woods","the woods to","woods to confront","to confront pain","confront pain and","pain and illumination","and illumination alone"],"2grams":["Hannah is","is about","about to","to have","have her","her third","third miscarriage","Working as","as a","a social","social worker","worker at","at the","the Mission","Mission to","to Seafarers","Seafarers ,",", she","she discovers","discovers a","a stowaway","stowaway drifting","drifting aimlessly","aimlessly in","in the","the harbor","harbor ,",", and","and decides","decides to","to give","give the","the young","young man","man shelter","shelter in","in a","a decommissioned","decommissioned ,",", cold","cold war","war era","era nuclear","nuclear fallout","fallout bunker","bunker that","that is","is being","being redesigned","redesigned by","by her","her partner","partner Antonia","Antonia to","to serve","serve as","as an","an archive","archive dedicated","dedicated to","to hagiographic","hagiographic graphology","graphology (","( the","the study","study of","of the","the saints","saints through","through their","their handwriting","handwriting )","Hannah then","then retreats","retreats to","to a","a secluded","secluded cottage","cottage deep","deep in","in the","the woods","woods to","to confront","confront pain","pain and","and illumination","illumination alone"]}

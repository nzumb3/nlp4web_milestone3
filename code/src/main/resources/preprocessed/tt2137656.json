{"title":"This Life of Mine The Leon T. Garr Story","plot":"Leon T. Garr was born in March 23, 1914, in Ruston, Louisiana. He endured and witnessed unspeakable horrors as a young man growing up in America's deep south. After serving in the U.S. Army during World War II, Mr. Garr migrated to Los Angeles, California. With a third grade education, he entered the construction business and amassed millions, which he used to help enrich others. At the age of seventy six, Mr. Garr purchased a failed savings and loan, and transformed it into Founders National Bank. Mr. Garr became Chairman Garr, and with that, Founders Bank became the only National Bank owned by an African American west of the Mississippi. His documentary is a rich American tale of a driven man who, in his own words, tells of his life's journey through nearly one hundred years of America's most triumphant and tragic times.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Leon","T.","Garr","was","born","in","March","23",",","1914",",","in","Ruston",",","Louisiana",".","He","endur","and","wit","unspeak","horror","as","a","young","man","grow","up","in","America","'s","deep","south",".","After","serv","in","the","U.S.","Armi","dure","World","War","II",",","Mr.","Garr","migrat","to","Los","Angele",",","California",".","With","a","third","grade","educ",",","he","enter","the","construct","busi","and","amass","million",",","which","he","use","to","help","enrich","other",".","At","the","age","of","seventi","six",",","Mr.","Garr","purchas","a","fail","save","and","loan",",","and","transform","it","into","Founder","Nation","Bank",".","Mr.","Garr","becam","Chairman","Garr",",","and","with","that",",","Founder","Bank","becam","the","onli","Nation","Bank","own","by","an","African","American","west","of","the","Mississippi",".","His","documentari","is","a","rich","American","tale","of","a","driven","man","who",",","in","his","own","word",",","tell","of","his","life","'s","journey","through","near","one","hundr","year","of","America","'s","most","triumphant","and","tragic","time","."],"lemmas":["Leon","T.","Garr","be","bear","in","March","23",",","1914",",","in","Ruston",",","Louisiana",".","he","endure","and","witness","unspeakable","horror","as","a","young","man","grow","up","in","America","'s","deep","south",".","after","serve","in","the","U.S.","Army","during","World","War","II",",","Mr.","Garr","migrate","to","Los","Angeles",",","California",".","with","a","third","grade","education",",","he","enter","the","construction","business","and","amass","million",",","which","he","use","to","help","enrich","other",".","at","the","age","of","seventy","six",",","Mr.","Garr","purchase","a","fail","savings","and","loan",",","and","transform","it","into","Founders","National","Bank",".","Mr.","Garr","become","Chairman","Garr",",","and","with","that",",","Founders","Bank","become","the","only","National","Bank","own","by","a","african","american","west","of","the","Mississippi",".","he","documentary","be","a","rich","american","tale","of","a","driven","man","who",",","in","he","own","word",",","tell","of","he","life","'s","journey","through","nearly","one","hundred","year","of","America","'s","most","triumphant","and","tragic","time","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Leon T.

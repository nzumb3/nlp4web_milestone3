{"title":"Evergreen: Sangnoksu","plot":"Chun-Je and her father's strong bond is tested when signs of political corruption starts surfacing from the shadows. They both witnessed, as citizens, a series of dark events that followed after the election of president Lee Myong-bak in 2007. For the first time in history, a past president committed a suicide. A fraudulent presidential election due to NIS intervention took place. The crash of the Sewol ferry killed 304 people, with the source of the cause unrevealed. More than ever, fear and ignorance is engraved in the hearts of Korean citizens. The father, opting for safety, has given up on his country and has relocated to Nepal. However, Chun-Je has chosen to remain in Korea. Along with a small number of conscious and brave individuals, she stands in protest against the evil regime, demanding the truth. Justice vs. Power. Consciousness vs. Ignorance. Who will prevail?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Chun-J","and","her","father","'s","strong","bond","is","test","when","sign","of","polit","corrupt","start","surfac","from","the","shadow",".","They","both","wit",",","as","citizen",",","a","seri","of","dark","event","that","follow","after","the","elect","of","presid","Lee","Myong-bak","in","2007",".","For","the","first","time","in","histori",",","a","past","presid","commit","a","suicid",".","A","fraudul","presidenti","elect","due","to","NIS","intervent","took","place",".","The","crash","of","the","Sewol","ferri","kill","304","peopl",",","with","the","sourc","of","the","caus","unrev",".","More","than","ever",",","fear","and","ignor","is","engrav","in","the","heart","of","Korean","citizen",".","The","father",",","opt","for","safeti",",","has","given","up","on","his","countri","and","has","reloc","to","Nepal",".","Howev",",","Chun-J","has","chosen","to","remain","in","Korea",".","Along","with","a","small","number","of","conscious","and","brave","individu",",","she","stand","in","protest","against","the","evil","regim",",","demand","the","truth",".","Justic","vs.","Power",".","Conscious","vs.","Ignoranc",".","Who","will","prevail","?"],"lemmas":["chun-je","and","she","father","'s","strong","bond","be","test","when","sign","of","political","corruption","start","surface","from","the","shadow",".","they","both","witness",",","as","citizen",",","a","series","of","dark","event","that","follow","after","the","election","of","president","Lee","Myong-bak","in","2007",".","for","the","first","time","in","history",",","a","past","president","commit","a","suicide",".","a","fraudulent","presidential","election","due","to","NIS","intervention","take","place",".","the","crash","of","the","Sewol","ferry","kill","304","people",",","with","the","source","of","the","cause","unrevealed",".","more","than","ever",",","fear","and","ignorance","be","engrave","in","the","heart","of","korean","citizen",".","the","father",",","opt","for","safety",",","have","give","up","on","he","country","and","have","relocate","to","Nepal",".","however",",","chun-je","have","choose","to","remain","in","Korea",".","along","with","a","small","number","of","conscious","and","brave","individual",",","she","stand","in","protest","against","the","evil","regime",",","demand","the","truth",".","Justice","vs.","Power",".","consciousness","vs.","ignorance",".","who","will","prevail","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Chun-Je

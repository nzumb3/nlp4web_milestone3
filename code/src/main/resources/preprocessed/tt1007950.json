{"title":"Diminished Capacity","plot":"Cooper is a Chicago journalist with post-concussion memory loss. His mother wants help moving Uncle Rollie, who's facing his own fading memory, into a care home. Cooper's boss tells him to take a few days, so Cooper drives home. Rollie doesn't want to move, and his salvation may be a rare baseball card of a 1908 Chicago Cub. Maybe they can sell it in Chicago for enough for Rollie to live at home with help. Cooper teams up with Charlotte, his recently-divorced high-school flame, and her son; they take Rollie to a memorabilia market. Rollie insists on keeping the card in his pocket, while more than one rascal wants to divest the old man of his treasure. Can the underdogs carry the day?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Cooper","is","a","Chicago","journalist","with","post-concuss","memori","loss",".","His","mother","want","help","move","Uncle","Rolli",",","who","'s","face","his","own","fade","memori",",","into","a","care","home",".","Cooper","'s","boss","tell","him","to","take","a","few","day",",","so","Cooper","drive","home",".","Rolli","doe","n't","want","to","move",",","and","his","salvat","may","be","a","rare","basebal","card","of","a","1908","Chicago","Cub",".","Mayb","they","can","sell","it","in","Chicago","for","enough","for","Rolli","to","live","at","home","with","help",".","Cooper","team","up","with","Charlott",",","his","recently-divorc","high-school","flame",",","and","her","son",";","they","take","Rolli","to","a","memorabilia","market",".","Rolli","insist","on","keep","the","card","in","his","pocket",",","while","more","than","one","rascal","want","to","divest","the","old","man","of","his","treasur",".","Can","the","underdog","carri","the","day","?"],"lemmas":["Cooper","be","a","Chicago","journalist","with","post-concussion","memory","loss",".","he","mother","want","help","move","Uncle","Rollie",",","who","be","face","he","own","fading","memory",",","into","a","care","home",".","Cooper","'s","boss","tell","he","to","take","a","few","day",",","so","Cooper","drive","home",".","Rollie","do","not","want","to","move",",","and","he","salvation","may","be","a","rare","baseball","card","of","a","1908","Chicago","cub",".","maybe","they","can","sell","it","in","Chicago","for","enough","for","Rollie","to","live","at","home","with","help",".","Cooper","team","up","with","Charlotte",",","he","recently-divorced","high-school","flame",",","and","she","son",";","they","take","Rollie","to","a","memorabilia","market",".","Rollie","insist","on","keep","the","card","in","he","pocket",",","while","more","than","one","rascal","want","to","divest","the","old","man","of","he","treasure",".","can","the","underdog","carry","the","day","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cooper is a","is a Chicago","a Chicago journalist","Chicago journalist with","journalist with post-concussion","with post-concussion memory","post-concussion memory loss","His mother wants","mother wants help","wants help moving","help moving Uncle","moving Uncle Rollie","Uncle Rollie ,","Rollie , who",", who 's","who 's facing","'s facing his","facing his own","his own fading","own fading memory","fading memory ,","memory , into",", into a","into a care","a care home","Cooper 's boss","'s boss tells","boss tells him","tells him to","him to take","to take a","take a few","a few days","few days ,","days , so",", so Cooper","so Cooper drives","Cooper drives home","Rollie does n't","does n't want","n't want to","want to move","to move ,","move , and",", and his","and his salvation","his salvation may","salvation may be","may be a","be a rare","a rare baseball","rare baseball card","baseball card of","card of a","of a 1908","a 1908 Chicago","1908 Chicago Cub","Maybe they can","they can sell","can sell it","sell it in","it in Chicago","in Chicago for","Chicago for enough","for enough for","enough for Rollie","for Rollie to","Rollie to live","to live at","live at home","at home with","home with help","Cooper teams up","teams up with","up with Charlotte","with Charlotte ,","Charlotte , his",", his recently-divorced","his recently-divorced high-school","recently-divorced high-school flame","high-school flame ,","flame , and",", and her","and her son","her son ;","son ;

{"title":"Aurora: Operation Intercept","plot":"There have been two mysterious plane crashes in only 48 hours. The aircraft suddenly lose control and crash, killing everyone aboard. A woman of Russian descent, Francesca Zaborszin, the daughter of a slain Federal investigator, claims responsibility for the crashes. She believes her father was killed by the FBI as part of a cover-up operation and wishes to avenge his death by threatening to down more aircraft using the same electromagnetic pulse method. She also intends to crash a stolen military jet into the White House. There's no time to ground the planes: just enough time to try to stop her.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["There","have","been","two","mysteri","plane","crash","in","onli","48","hour",".","The","aircraft","sudden","lose","control","and","crash",",","kill","everyon","aboard",".","A","woman","of","Russian","descent",",","Francesca","Zaborszin",",","the","daughter","of","a","slain","Feder","investig",",","claim","respons","for","the","crash",".","She","believ","her","father","was","kill","by","the","FBI","as","part","of","a","cover-up","oper","and","wish","to","aveng","his","death","by","threaten","to","down","more","aircraft","use","the","same","electromagnet","puls","method",".","She","also","intend","to","crash","a","stolen","militari","jet","into","the","White","Hous",".","There","'s","no","time","to","ground","the","plane",":","just","enough","time","to","tri","to","stop","her","."],"lemmas":["there","have","be","two","mysterious","plane","crash","in","only","48","hour",".","the","aircraft","suddenly","lose","control","and","crash",",","kill","everyone","aboard",".","a","woman","of","russian","descent",",","Francesca","Zaborszin",",","the","daughter","of","a","slay","Federal","investigator",",","claim","responsibility","for","the","crash",".","she","believe","she","father","be","kill","by","the","FBI","as","part","of","a","cover-up","operation","and","wish","to","avenge","he","death","by","threaten","to","down","more","aircraft","use","the","same","electromagnetic","pulse","method",".","she","also","intend","to","crash","a","stolen","military","jet","into","the","White","House",".","there","be","no","time","to","grind","the","plane",":","just","enough","time","to","try","to","stop","she","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["There have been","have been two","been two mysterious","two mysterious plane","mysterious plane crashes","plane crashes in","crashes in only","in only 48","only 48 hours","The aircraft suddenly","aircraft suddenly lose","suddenly lose control","lose control and","control and crash","and crash ,","crash , killing",", killing everyone","killing everyone aboard","A woman of","woman of Russian","of Russian descent","Russian descent ,","descent , Francesca",", Francesca Zaborszin","Francesca Zaborszin ,","Zaborszin , the",", the daughter","the daughter of","daughter of a","of a slain","a slain Federal","slain Federal investigator","Federal investigator ,","investigator , claims",", claims responsibility","claims responsibility for","responsibility for the","for the crashes","She believes her","believes her father","her father was","father was killed","was killed by","killed by the","by the FBI","the FBI as","FBI as part","as part of","part of a","of a cover-up","a cover-up operation","cover-up operation and","operation and wishes","and wishes to","wishes to avenge","to avenge his","avenge his death","his death by","death by threatening","by threatening to","threatening to down","to down more","down more aircraft","more aircraft using","aircraft using the","using the same","the same electromagnetic","same electromagnetic pulse","electromagnetic pulse method","She also intends","also intends to","intends to crash","to crash a","crash a stolen","a stolen military","stolen military jet","military jet into","jet into the","into the White","the White House","There 's no","'s no time","no time to","time to ground","to ground the","ground the planes","the planes :","planes : just",": just enough","just enough time","enough time to","time to try","to try to","try to stop","to stop her"],"2grams":["There have","have been","been two","two mysterious","mysterious plane","plane crashes","crashes in","in only","only 48","48 hours","The aircraft","aircraft suddenly","suddenly lose","lose control","control and","and crash","crash ,",", killing","killing everyone","everyone aboard","A woman","woman of","of Russian","Russian descent","descent ,",", Francesca","Francesca Zaborszin","Zaborszin ,",", the","the daughter","daughter of","of a","a slain","slain Federal","Federal investigator","investigator ,",", claims","claims responsibility","responsibility for","for the","the crashes","She believes","believes her","her father","father was","was killed","killed by","by the","the FBI","FBI as","as part","part of","of a","a cover-up","cover-up operation","operation and","and wishes","wishes to","to avenge","avenge his","his death","death by","by threatening","threatening to","to down","down more","more aircraft","aircraft using","using the","the same","same electromagnetic","electromagnetic pulse","pulse method","She also","also intends","intends to","to crash","crash a","a stolen","stolen military","military jet","jet into","into the","the White","White House","There 's","'s no","no time","time to","to ground","ground the","the planes","planes :",": just","just enough","enough time","time to","to try","try to","to stop","stop her"]}

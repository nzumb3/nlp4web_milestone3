{"title":"Un posto sicuro","plot":"Casale Monferrato, 2011. The town is excited because of the impending verdict of the trial against Eternit, the factory which produced asbestos: the company's managers are in the dock, responding to the harmful effects which have been proved with thousand of deaths. One of the employees who got sick for asbestos is Eduardo: he has been working in the plant for a life and now he is gravely ill. He has little time to repair the relationship with his son Luca, ruined during the past years. And Luca, also thanks to the love for his girlfriend Raffaella, is ready to reconcile.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Casal","Monferrato",",","2011",".","The","town","is","excit","becaus","of","the","impend","verdict","of","the","trial","against","Eternit",",","the","factori","which","produc","asbesto",":","the","compani","'s","manag","are","in","the","dock",",","respond","to","the","harm","effect","which","have","been","prove","with","thousand","of","death",".","One","of","the","employe","who","got","sick","for","asbesto","is","Eduardo",":","he","has","been","work","in","the","plant","for","a","life","and","now","he","is","grave","ill",".","He","has","littl","time","to","repair","the","relationship","with","his","son","Luca",",","ruin","dure","the","past","year",".","And","Luca",",","also","thank","to","the","love","for","his","girlfriend","Raffaella",",","is","readi","to","reconcil","."],"lemmas":["Casale","Monferrato",",","2011",".","the","town","be","excited","because","of","the","impending","verdict","of","the","trial","against","Eternit",",","the","factory","which","produce","asbestos",":","the","company","'s","manager","be","in","the","dock",",","respond","to","the","harmful","effect","which","have","be","prove","with","thousand","of","death",".","one","of","the","employee","who","get","sick","for","asbestos","be","Eduardo",":","he","have","be","work","in","the","plant","for","a","life","and","now","he","be","gravely","ill",".","he","have","little","time","to","repair","the","relationship","with","he","son","Luca",",","ruin","during","the","past","year",".","and","Luca",",","also","thanks","to","the","love","for","he","girlfriend","Raffaella",",","be","ready","to","reconcile","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Casale Monferrato ,","Monferrato , 2011","The town is","town is excited","is excited because","excited because of","because of the","of the impending","the impending verdict","impending verdict of","verdict of the","of the trial","the trial against","trial against Eternit","against Eternit ,","Eternit , the",", the factory","the factory which","factory which produced","which produced asbestos","produced asbestos :","asbestos : the",": the company","the company 's","company 's managers","'s managers are","managers are in","are in the","in the dock","the dock ,","dock , responding",", responding to","responding to the","to the harmful","the harmful effects","harmful effects which","effects which have","which have been","have been proved","been proved with","proved with thousand","with thousand of","thousand of deaths","One of the","of the employees","the employees who","employees who got","who got sick","got sick for","sick for asbestos","for asbestos is","asbestos is Eduardo","is Eduardo :","Eduardo : he",": he has","he has been","has been working","been working in","working in the","in the plant","the plant for","plant for a","for a life","a life and","life and now","and now he","now he is","he is gravely","is gravely ill","He has little","has little time","little time to","time to repair","to repair the","repair the relationship","the relationship with","relationship with his","with his son","his son Luca","son Luca ,","Luca , ruined",", ruined during","ruined during the","during the past","the past years","And Luca ,","Luca , also",", also thanks","also thanks to","thanks to the","to the love","the love for","love for his","for his girlfriend","his girlfriend Raffaella","girlfriend Raffaella ,","Raffaella , is",", is ready","is ready to","ready to reconcile"],"2grams":["Casale Monferrato","Monferrato ,",", 2011","The town","town is","is excited","excited because","because of","of the","the impending","impending verdict","verdict of","of the","the trial","trial against","against Eternit","Eternit ,",", the","the factory","factory which","which produced","produced asbestos","asbestos :",": the","the company","company 's","'s managers","managers are","are in","in the","the dock","dock ,",", responding","responding to","to the","the harmful","harmful effects","effects which","which have","have been","been proved","proved with","with thousand","thousand of","of deaths","One of","of the","the employees","employees who","who got","got sick","sick for","for asbestos","asbestos is","is Eduardo","Eduardo :",": he","he has","has been","been working","working in","in the","the plant","plant for","for a","a life","life and","and now","now he","he is","is gravely","gravely ill","He has","has little","little time","time to","to repair","repair the","the relationship","relationship with","with his","his son","son Luca","Luca ,",", ruined","ruined during","during the","the past","past years","And Luca","Luca ,",", also","also thanks","thanks to","to the","the love","love for","for his","his girlfriend","girlfriend Raffaella","Raffaella ,",", is","is ready","ready to","to reconcile"]}

{"title":"Morocco","plot":"Troubled teenager Ben (16) unintentionally confronts his father Heinrich (Tukur), a successful German theatre director staging a play in Marrakesh, with his past and his neglected responsibilities. After a falling out with his estranged father, Ben loses himself in the shadowy Medina and sleazy nightclubs of Marrakesh, where he meets a feisty Berber girl Karima (18) and follows her to her hometown, far beyond the city and across unfamiliar and barren land. She helps him gain the courage to stand up to his father.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"],"stems":["Troubl","teenag","Ben","(","16",")","unintent","confront","his","father","Heinrich","(","Tukur",")",",","a","success","German","theatr","director","stage","a","play","in","Marrakesh",",","with","his","past","and","his","neglect","respons",".","After","a","fall","out","with","his","estrang","father",",","Ben","lose","himself","in","the","shadowi","Medina","and","sleazi","nightclub","of","Marrakesh",",","where","he","meet","a","feisti","Berber","girl","Karima","(","18",")","and","follow","her","to","her","hometown",",","far","beyond","the","citi","and","across","unfamiliar","and","barren","land",".","She","help","him","gain","the","courag","to","stand","up","to","his","father","."],"lemmas":["troubled","teenager","Ben","-lrb-","16","-rrb-","unintentionally","confront","he","father","Heinrich","-lrb-","Tukur","-rrb-",",","a","successful","german","theatre","director","stage","a","play","in","Marrakesh",",","with","he","past","and","he","neglect","responsibility",".","after","a","fall","out","with","he","estrange","father",",","Ben","lose","himself","in","the","shadowy","Medina","and","sleazy","nightclub","of","Marrakesh",",","where","he","meet","a","feisty","Berber","girl","Karima","-lrb-","18","-rrb-","and","follow","she","to","she","hometown",",","far","beyond","the","city","and","across","unfamiliar","and","barren","land",".","she","help","he","gain","the","courage","to","stand","up","to","he","father","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Troubled teenager Ben","teenager Ben (","Ben ( 16","( 16 )","16 ) unintentionally",") unintentionally confronts","unintentionally confronts his","confronts his father","his father Heinrich","father Heinrich (","Heinrich ( Tukur","( Tukur )","Tukur ) ,",") , a",", a successful","a successful German","successful German theatre","German theatre director","theatre director staging","director staging a","staging a play","a play in","play in Marrakesh","in Marrakesh ,","Marrakesh , with",", with his","with his past","his past and","past and his","and his neglected","his neglected responsibilities","After a falling","a falling out","falling out with","out with his","with his estranged","his estranged father","estranged father ,","father , Ben",", Ben loses","Ben loses himself","loses himself in","himself in the","in the shadowy","the shadowy Medina","shadowy Medina and","Medina and sleazy","and sleazy nightclubs","sleazy nightclubs of","nightclubs of Marrakesh","of Marrakesh ,","Marrakesh , where",", where he","where he meets","he meets a","meets a feisty","a feisty Berber","feisty Berber girl","Berber girl Karima","girl Karima (","Karima ( 18","( 18 )","18 ) and",") and follows","and follows her","follows her to","her to her","to her hometown","her hometown ,","hometown , far",", far beyond","far beyond the","beyond the city","the city and","city and across","and across unfamiliar","across unfamiliar and","unfamiliar and barren","and barren land","She helps him","helps him gain","him gain the","gain the courage","the courage to","courage to stand","to stand up","stand up to","up to his","to his father"],"2grams":["Troubled teenager","teenager Ben","Ben (","( 16","16 )",") unintentionally","unintentionally confronts","confronts his","his father","father Heinrich","Heinrich (","( Tukur","Tukur )",") ,",", a","a successful","successful German","German theatre","theatre director","director staging","staging a","a play","play in","in Marrakesh","Marrakesh ,",", with","with his","his past","past and","and his","his neglected","neglected responsibilities","After a","a falling","falling out","out with","with his","his estranged","estranged father","father ,",", Ben","Ben loses","loses himself","himself in","in the","the shadowy","shadowy Medina","Medina and","and sleazy","sleazy nightclubs","nightclubs of","of Marrakesh","Marrakesh ,",", where","where he","he meets","meets a","a feisty","feisty Berber","Berber girl","girl Karima","Karima (","( 18","18 )",") and","and follows","follows her","her to","to her","her hometown","hometown ,",", far","far beyond","beyond the","the city","city and","and across","across unfamiliar","unfamiliar and","and barren","barren land","She helps","helps him","him gain","gain the","the courage","courage to","to stand","stand up","up to","to his","his father"]}

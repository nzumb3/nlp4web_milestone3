{"title":"Hostage of an Illusion","plot":"Pablo is a 60 years old writer. He meets by chance an ex pupil, Laura. Now, she is an attractive 35 years old woman. She was very much in love with him, when he was her professor at college. Now, she bursts into his life, as a passionate lover. He rediscovers his sexuality and the illusion of being young once more. But Laura seems to suffer a psychotic brake. She feels chased by the porter and militarism from the neighboring barracks. Laura is put in an asylum, but from time to time, Laura will appear and disappear, becoming someone ethereal, like a picture from an unrecoverable youth.","genres":["Crime"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Pablo","is","a","60","year","old","writer",".","He","meet","by","chanc","an","ex","pupil",",","Laura",".","Now",",","she","is","an","attract","35","year","old","woman",".","She","was","veri","much","in","love","with","him",",","when","he","was","her","professor","at","colleg",".","Now",",","she","burst","into","his","life",",","as","a","passion","lover",".","He","rediscov","his","sexual","and","the","illus","of","be","young","onc","more",".","But","Laura","seem","to","suffer","a","psychot","brake",".","She","feel","chase","by","the","porter","and","militar","from","the","neighbor","barrack",".","Laura","is","put","in","an","asylum",",","but","from","time","to","time",",","Laura","will","appear","and","disappear",",","becom","someon","ether",",","like","a","pictur","from","an","unrecover","youth","."],"lemmas":["Pablo","be","a","60","year","old","writer",".","he","meet","by","chance","a","ex","pupil",",","Laura",".","now",",","she","be","a","attractive","35","year","old","woman",".","she","be","very","much","in","love","with","he",",","when","he","be","she","professor","at","college",".","now",",","she","burst","into","he","life",",","as","a","passionate","lover",".","he","rediscover","he","sexuality","and","the","illusion","of","be","young","once","more",".","but","Laura","seem","to","suffer","a","psychotic","brake",".","she","feel","chase","by","the","porter","and","militarism","from","the","neighboring","barracks",".","Laura","be","put","in","a","asylum",",","but","from","time","to","time",",","Laura","will","appear","and","disappear",",","become","someone","ethereal",",","like","a","picture","from","a","unrecoverable","youth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Pablo is a","is a 60","a 60 years","60 years old","years old writer","He meets by","meets by chance","by chance an","chance an ex","an ex pupil","ex pupil ,","pupil , Laura","Now , she",", she is","she is an","is an attractive","an attractive 35","attractive 35 years","35 years old","years old woman","She was very","was very much","very much in","much in love","in love with","love with him","with him ,","him , when",", when he","when he was","he was her","was her professor","her professor at","professor at college","Now , she",", she bursts","she bursts into","bursts into his","into his life","his life ,","life , as",", as a","as a passionate","a passionate lover","He rediscovers his","rediscovers his sexuality","his sexuality and","sexuality and the","and the illusion","the illusion of","illusion of being","of being young","being young once","young once more","But Laura seems","Laura seems to","seems to suffer","to suffer a","suffer a psychotic","a psychotic brake","She feels chased","feels chased by","chased by the","by the porter","the porter and","porter and militarism","and militarism from","militarism from the","from the neighboring","the neighboring barracks","Laura is put","is put in","put in an","in an asylum","an asylum ,","asylum , but",", but from","but from time","from time to","time to time","to time ,","time , Laura",", Laura will","Laura will appear","will appear and","appear and disappear","and disappear ,","disappear , becoming",", becoming someone","becoming someone ethereal","someone ethereal ,","ethereal , like",", like a","like a picture","a picture from","picture from an","from an unrecoverable","an unrecoverable youth"],"2grams":["Pablo is","is a","a 60","60 years","years old","old writer","He meets","meets by","by chance","chance an","an ex","ex pupil","pupil ,",", Laura","Now ,",", she","she is","is an","an attractive","attractive 35","35 years","years old","old woman","She was","was very","very much","much in","in love","love with","with him","him ,",", when","when he","he was","was her","her professor","professor at","at college","Now ,",", she","she bursts","bursts into","into his","his life","life ,",", as","as a","a passionate","passionate lover","He rediscovers","rediscovers his","his sexuality","sexuality and","and the","the illusion","illusion of","of being","being young","young once","once more","But Laura","Laura seems","seems to","to suffer","suffer a","a psychotic","psychotic brake","She feels","feels chased","chased by","by the","the porter","porter and","and militarism","militarism from","from the","the neighboring","neighboring barracks","Laura is","is put","put in","in an","an asylum","asylum ,",", but","but from","from time","time to","to time","time ,",", Laura","Laura will","will appear","appear and","and disappear","disappear ,",", becoming","becoming someone","someone ethereal","ethereal ,",", like","like a","a picture","picture from","from an","an unrecoverable","unrecoverable youth"]}

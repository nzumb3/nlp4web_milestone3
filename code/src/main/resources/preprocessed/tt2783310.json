{"title":"Toxicity: Hunters Point","plot":"After years of toxic waste dumping by the Navy, residents of the impoverished neighborhood of Hunters Point, San Francisco are being affected by the harmful contaminants in the air and water. Hunters Point was categorized as a SuperFund site in 1989, declaring it as one of the most toxic sites in United States. Despite that, the neglect given by the Navy is appalling, even till this day. This documentary intends to expose the human side of this forgotten site and the negative implications that the government continues to ignore.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["After","year","of","toxic","wast","dump","by","the","Navi",",","resid","of","the","impoverish","neighborhood","of","Hunter","Point",",","San","Francisco","are","be","affect","by","the","harm","contamin","in","the","air","and","water",".","Hunter","Point","was","categor","as","a","SuperFund","site","in","1989",",","declar","it","as","one","of","the","most","toxic","site","in","Unite","State",".","Despit","that",",","the","neglect","given","by","the","Navi","is","appal",",","even","till","this","day",".","This","documentari","intend","to","expos","the","human","side","of","this","forgotten","site","and","the","negat","implic","that","the","govern","continu","to","ignor","."],"lemmas":["after","year","of","toxic","waste","dump","by","the","Navy",",","resident","of","the","impoverished","neighborhood","of","Hunters","Point",",","San","Francisco","be","be","affect","by","the","harmful","contaminant","in","the","air","and","water",".","Hunters","Point","be","categorize","as","a","superfund","site","in","1989",",","declare","it","as","one","of","the","most","toxic","site","in","United","States",".","despite","that",",","the","neglect","give","by","the","Navy","be","appalling",",","even","till","this","day",".","this","documentary","intend","to","expose","the","human","side","of","this","forget","site","and","the","negative","implication","that","the","government","continue","to","ignore","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["After years of","years of toxic","of toxic waste","toxic waste dumping","waste dumping by","dumping by the","by the Navy","the Navy ,","Navy , residents",", residents of","residents of the","of the impoverished","the impoverished neighborhood","impoverished neighborhood of","neighborhood of Hunters","of Hunters Point","Hunters Point ,","Point , San",", San Francisco","San Francisco are","Francisco are being","are being affected","being affected by","affected by the","by the harmful","the harmful contaminants","harmful contaminants in","contaminants in the","in the air","the air and","air and water","Hunters Point was","Point was categorized","was categorized as","categorized as a","as a SuperFund","a SuperFund site","SuperFund site in","site in 1989","in 1989 ,","1989 , declaring",", declaring it","declaring it as","it as one","as one of","one of the","of the most","the most toxic","most toxic sites","toxic sites in","sites in United","in United States","Despite that ,","that , the",", the neglect","the neglect given","neglect given by","given by the","by the Navy","the Navy is","Navy is appalling","is appalling ,","appalling , even",", even till","even till this","till this day","This documentary intends","documentary intends to","intends to expose","to expose the","expose the human","the human side","human side of","side of this","of this forgotten","this forgotten site","forgotten site and","site and the","and the negative","the negative implications","negative implications that","implications that the","that the government","the government continues","government continues to","continues to ignore"],"2grams":["After years","years of","of toxic","toxic waste","waste dumping","dumping by","by the","the Navy","Navy ,",", residents","residents of","of the","the impoverished","impoverished neighborhood","neighborhood of","of Hunters","Hunters Point","Point ,",", San","San Francisco","Francisco are","are being","being affected","affected by","by the","the harmful","harmful contaminants","contaminants in","in the","the air","air and","and water","Hunters Point","Point was","was categorized","categorized as","as a","a SuperFund","SuperFund site","site in","in 1989","1989 ,",", declaring","declaring it","it as","as one","one of","of the","the most","most toxic","toxic sites","sites in","in United","United States","Despite that","that ,",", the","the neglect","neglect given","given by","by the","the Navy","Navy is","is appalling","appalling ,",", even","even till","till this","this day","This documentary","documentary intends","intends to","to expose","expose the","the human","human side","side of","of this","this forgotten","forgotten site","site and","and the","the negative","negative implications","implications that","that the","the government","government continues","continues to","to ignore"]}

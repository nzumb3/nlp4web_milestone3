{"title":"God Grew Tired of Us","plot":"In 1987, Sudan's Muslim government pronounced death to all males in the Christian south: 27,000 boys fled to Ethiopia on foot. In 1991, they were forced to flee to Kenya; 12,000 survived to live in a U.N. camp in Kakuma. Archival footage documents the 1,000 mile flight; we see life in the camp. We follow three young men who repatriate to the U.S. John Bul Dau goes to Syracuse, and by the film's end, becomes a spokesperson for the Lost Boys and Lost Girls of Sudan; Daniel Abol Pach and Panther Bior go to Pittsburgh. All work several jobs, send money back to the camp, search for relatives lost in the civil war, acclimatize to the U.S., seek an education, and miss their homeland.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","1987",",","Sudan","'s","Muslim","govern","pronounc","death","to","all","male","in","the","Christian","south",":","27,000","boy","fled","to","Ethiopia","on","foot",".","In","1991",",","they","were","forc","to","flee","to","Kenya",";","12,000","surviv","to","live","in","a","U.N.","camp","in","Kakuma",".","Archival","footag","document","the","1,000","mile","flight",";","we","see","life","in","the","camp",".","We","follow","three","young","men","who","repatri","to","the","U.S.","John","Bul","Dau","goe","to","Syracus",",","and","by","the","film","'s","end",",","becom","a","spokesperson","for","the","Lost","Boy","and","Lost","Girl","of","Sudan",";","Daniel","Abol","Pach","and","Panther","Bior","go","to","Pittsburgh",".","All","work","sever","job",",","send","money","back","to","the","camp",",","search","for","relat","lost","in","the","civil","war",",","acclimat","to","the","U.S.",",","seek","an","educ",",","and","miss","their","homeland","."],"lemmas":["in","1987",",","Sudan","'s","muslim","government","pronounce","death","to","all","male","in","the","christian","south",":","27,000","boy","flee","to","Ethiopia","on","foot",".","in","1991",",","they","be","force","to","flee","to","Kenya",";","12,000","survive","to","live","in","a","U.N.","camp","in","Kakuma",".","archival","footage","document","the","1,000","mile","flight",";","we","see","life","in","the","camp",".","we","follow","three","young","man","who","repatriate","to","the","U.S.","John","Bul","Dau","go","to","Syracuse",",","and","by","the","film","'s","end",",","become","a","spokesperson","for","the","Lost","Boys","and","Lost","Girls","of","Sudan",";","Daniel","Abol","Pach","and","panther","bior","go","to","Pittsburgh",".","all","work","several","job",",","send","money","back","to","the","camp",",","search","for","relative","lose","in","the","civil","war",",","acclimatize","to","the","U.S.",",","seek","a","education",",","and","miss","they","homeland","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1987 ,","1987 , Sudan",", Sudan 's","Sudan 's Muslim","'s Muslim government","Muslim government pronounced","government pronounced death","pronounced death to","death to all","to all males","all males in","males in the","in the Christian","the Christian south","Christian south :","south : 27,000",": 27,000 boys","27,000 boys fled","boys fled to","fled to Ethiopia","to Ethiopia on","Ethiopia on foot","In 1991 ,","1991 , they",", they were","they were forced","were forced to","forced to flee","to flee to","flee to Kenya","to Kenya ;","Kenya ;

Apart from the usual misunderstanding difficulties that newly-married couples would face, this is of a different kind. Ram is forced to take a decision in that problematic situation. What follows is an emotional tale.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Mystery"],"stems":["The","film","take","on","a","journey","through","the","love","stori","of","Ram","(","Dhanush",")","and","Janani","(","Shruthi",")","who","are","12th","standard","student","and","eventu","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","As","they","grow","up",",","so","doe","their","affin","for","each","other",",","and","despit","opposit","from","the","elder",",","they","tie","the","knot",".","When","they","start","a","fresh","life",",","problem","start","to","grow","up",".","Apart","from","the","usual","misunderstand","difficulti","that","newly-marri","coupl","would","face",",","this","is","of","a","differ","kind",".","Ram","is","forc","to","take","a","decis","in","that","problemat","situat",".","What","follow","is","an","emot","tale","."],"lemmas":["the","film","take","on","a","journey","through","the","love","story","of","Ram","-lrb-","Dhanush","-rrb-","and","Janani","-lrb-","Shruthi","-rrb-","who","be","12th","standard","student","and","eventually","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","as","they","grow","up",",","so","do","they","affinity","for","each","other",",","and","despite","opposition","from","the","elder",",","they","tie","the","knot",".","when","they","start","a","fresh","life",",","problem","start","to","grow","up",".","apart","from","the","usual","misunderstanding","difficulty","that","newly-married","couple","would","face",",","this","be","of","a","different","kind",".","Ram","be","force","to","take","a","decision","in","that","problematic","situation",".","what","follow","be","a","emotional","tale","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The film takes","film takes on","takes on a","on a journey","a journey through","journey through the","through the love","the love story","love story of","story of Ram","of Ram (","Ram ( Dhanush","( Dhanush )","Dhanush ) and",") and Janani","and Janani (","Janani ( Shruthi","( Shruthi )","Shruthi ) who",") who are","who are 12th","are 12th standard","12th standard students","standard students and","students and eventually","and eventually falls","eventually falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with each","with each other","As they grow","they grow up","grow up ,","up , so",", so does","so does their","does their affinity","their affinity for","affinity for each","for each other","each other ,","other , and",", and despite","and despite opposition","despite opposition from","opposition from the","from the elders","the elders ,","elders , they",", they tie","they tie the","tie the knot","When they start","they start a","start a fresh","a fresh life","fresh life ,","life , problems",", problems start","problems start to","start to grow","to grow up","Apart from the","from the usual","the usual misunderstanding","usual misunderstanding difficulties","misunderstanding difficulties that","difficulties that newly-married","that newly-married couples","newly-married couples would","couples would face","would face ,","face , this",", this is","this is of","is of a","of a different","a different kind","Ram is forced","is forced to","forced to take","to take a","take a decision","a decision in","decision in that","in that problematic","that problematic situation","What follows is","follows is an","is an emotional","an emotional tale"],"2grams":["The film","film takes","takes on","on a","a journey","journey through","through the","the love","love story","story of","of Ram","Ram (","( Dhanush","Dhanush )",") and","and Janani","Janani (","( Shruthi","Shruthi )",") who","who are","are 12th","12th standard","standard students","students and","and eventually","eventually falls","falls in","in love","love with","with each","each other","As they","they grow","grow up","up ,",", so","so does","does their","their affinity","affinity for","for each","each other","other ,",", and","and despite","despite opposition","opposition from","from the","the elders","elders ,",", they","they tie","tie the","the knot","When they","they start","start a","a fresh","fresh life","life ,",", problems","problems start","start to","to grow","grow up","Apart from","from the","the usual","usual misunderstanding","misunderstanding difficulties","difficulties that","that newly-married","newly-married couples","couples would","would face","face ,",", this","this is","is of","of a","a different","different kind","Ram is","is forced","forced to","to take","take a","a decision","decision in","in that","that problematic","problematic situation","What follows","follows is","is an","an emotional","emotional tale"]}

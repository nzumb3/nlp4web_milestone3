{"title":"Mithunam","plot":"Wedded together for fifty years, knowing each other inside out, Appadaasu and Buchchi Laxmi fill their retired days with raw quarrels and ripe loves. Emotional entanglements enslave them to each other to such an extent that they break bonds even with their own kith and kin. It is common for stray notes to sprout up when two people live with each other and associate. But, veteran orchestrators as they are, they conjure up symphonies out of thin air with the magic wand of their love and set up Harmony in the Music of their Married Life.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["Wed","togeth","for","fifti","year",",","know","each","other","insid","out",",","Appadaasu","and","Buchchi","Laxmi","fill","their","retir","day","with","raw","quarrel","and","ripe","love",".","Emotion","entangl","enslav","them","to","each","other","to","such","an","extent","that","they","break","bond","even","with","their","own","kith","and","kin",".","It","is","common","for","stray","note","to","sprout","up","when","two","peopl","live","with","each","other","and","associ",".","But",",","veteran","orchestr","as","they","are",",","they","conjur","up","symphoni","out","of","thin","air","with","the","magic","wand","of","their","love","and","set","up","Harmoni","in","the","Music","of","their","Marri","Life","."],"lemmas":["wed","together","for","fifty","year",",","know","each","other","inside","out",",","Appadaasu","and","Buchchi","Laxmi","fill","they","retired","day","with","raw","quarrel","and","ripe","love",".","emotional","entanglement","enslave","they","to","each","other","to","such","a","extent","that","they","break","bond","even","with","they","own","kith","and","kin",".","it","be","common","for","stray","note","to","sprout","up","when","two","people","live","with","each","other","and","associate",".","but",",","veteran","orchestrator","as","they","be",",","they","conjure","up","symphony","out","of","thin","air","with","the","magic","wand","of","they","love","and","set","up","Harmony","in","the","music","of","they","Married","Life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wedded together for","together for fifty","for fifty years","fifty years ,","years , knowing",", knowing each","knowing each other","each other inside","other inside out","inside out ,","out , Appadaasu",", Appadaasu and","Appadaasu and Buchchi","and Buchchi Laxmi","Buchchi Laxmi fill","Laxmi fill their","fill their retired","their retired days","retired days with","days with raw","with raw quarrels","raw quarrels and","quarrels and ripe","and ripe loves","Emotional entanglements enslave","entanglements enslave them","enslave them to","them to each","to each other","each other to","other to such","to such an","such an extent","an extent that","extent that they","that they break","they break bonds","break bonds even","bonds even with","even with their","with their own","their own kith","own kith and","kith and kin","It is common","is common for","common for stray","for stray notes","stray notes to","notes to sprout","to sprout up","sprout up when","up when two","when two people","two people live","people live with","live with each","with each other","each other and","other and associate","But , veteran",", veteran orchestrators","veteran orchestrators as","orchestrators as they","as they are","they are ,","are , they",", they conjure","they conjure up","conjure up symphonies","up symphonies out","symphonies out of","out of thin","of thin air","thin air with","air with the","with the magic","the magic wand","magic wand of","wand of their","of their love","their love and","love and set","and set up","set up Harmony","up Harmony in","Harmony in the","in the Music","the Music of","Music of their","of their Married","their Married Life"],"2grams":["Wedded together","together for","for fifty","fifty years","years ,",", knowing","knowing each","each other","other inside","inside out","out ,",", Appadaasu","Appadaasu and","and Buchchi","Buchchi Laxmi","Laxmi fill","fill their","their retired","retired days","days with","with raw","raw quarrels","quarrels and","and ripe","ripe loves","Emotional entanglements","entanglements enslave","enslave them","them to","to each","each other","other to","to such","such an","an extent","extent that","that they","they break","break bonds","bonds even","even with","with their","their own","own kith","kith and","and kin","It is","is common","common for","for stray","stray notes","notes to","to sprout","sprout up","up when","when two","two people","people live","live with","with each","each other","other and","and associate","But ,",", veteran","veteran orchestrators","orchestrators as","as they","they are","are ,",", they","they conjure","conjure up","up symphonies","symphonies out","out of","of thin","thin air","air with","with the","the magic","magic wand","wand of","of their","their love","love and","and set","set up","up Harmony","Harmony in","in the","the Music","Music of","of their","their Married","Married Life"]}

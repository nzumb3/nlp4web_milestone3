{"title":"No Rootless Colonists: Na Gaeil-Phrotastunaigh","plot":"Despite their origins as colonists and planters the Protestants of Ireland, North and South, have put down deep roots and have been central to the story of the Irish Language for over four hundred years. Drawing on John Hewitt's memorable phrase, documentary-maker Louis Marcus re-assesses the position of the Planter Protestant in Ireland particularly in relation to the preservation and promotion of Irish language and culture. How many are aware that Queen Elizabeth I commissioned an Irish grammar and paid for the development of the Irish typescript so that it could be published? The English dilemma - whether to develop the Irish language to promote Protestantism or to obliterate it to effect the Anglicisation of Ireland - was a perennial source of contention.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Despit","their","origin","as","colonist","and","planter","the","Protest","of","Ireland",",","North","and","South",",","have","put","down","deep","root","and","have","been","central","to","the","stori","of","the","Irish","Languag","for","over","four","hundr","year",".","Draw","on","John","Hewitt","'s","memor","phrase",",","documentary-mak","Loui","Marcus","re-assess","the","posit","of","the","Planter","Protest","in","Ireland","particular","in","relat","to","the","preserv","and","promot","of","Irish","languag","and","cultur",".","How","mani","are","awar","that","Queen","Elizabeth","I","commiss","an","Irish","grammar","and","paid","for","the","develop","of","the","Irish","typescript","so","that","it","could","be","publish","?","The","English","dilemma","-","whether","to","develop","the","Irish","languag","to","promot","Protestant","or","to","obliter","it","to","effect","the","Anglicis","of","Ireland","-","was","a","perenni","sourc","of","content","."],"lemmas":["despite","they","origin","as","colonist","and","planter","the","Protestants","of","Ireland",",","North","and","South",",","have","put","down","deep","root","and","have","be","central","to","the","story","of","the","irish","language","for","over","four","hundred","year",".","draw","on","John","Hewitt","'s","memorable","phrase",",","documentary-maker","Louis","Marcus","re-assess","the","position","of","the","Planter","Protestant","in","Ireland","particularly","in","relation","to","the","preservation","and","promotion","of","irish","language","and","culture",".","how","many","be","aware","that","Queen","Elizabeth","I","commission","a","irish","grammar","and","pay","for","the","development","of","the","irish","typescript","so","that","it","could","be","publish","?","the","English","dilemma","-","whether","to","develop","the","irish","language","to","promote","Protestantism","or","to","obliterate","it","to","effect","the","Anglicisation","of","Ireland","-","be","a","perennial","source","of","contention","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Despite their origins","their origins as","origins as colonists","as colonists and","colonists and planters","and planters the","planters the Protestants","the Protestants of","Protestants of Ireland","of Ireland ,","Ireland , North",", North and","North and South","and South ,","South , have",", have put","have put down","put down deep","down deep roots","deep roots and","roots and have","and have been","have been central","been central to","central to the","to the story","the story of","story of the","of the Irish","the Irish Language","Irish Language for","Language for over","for over four","over four hundred","four hundred years","Drawing on John","on John Hewitt","John Hewitt 's","Hewitt 's memorable","'s memorable phrase","memorable phrase ,","phrase , documentary-maker",", documentary-maker Louis","documentary-maker Louis Marcus","Louis Marcus re-assesses","Marcus re-assesses the","re-assesses the position","the position of","position of the","of the Planter","the Planter Protestant","Planter Protestant in","Protestant in Ireland","in Ireland particularly","Ireland particularly in","particularly in relation","in relation to","relation to the","to the preservation","the preservation and","preservation and promotion","and promotion of","promotion of Irish","of Irish language","Irish language and","language and culture","How many are","many are aware","are aware that","aware that Queen","that Queen Elizabeth","Queen Elizabeth I","Elizabeth I commissioned","I commissioned an","commissioned an Irish","an Irish grammar","Irish grammar and","grammar and paid","and paid for","paid for the","for the development","the development of","development of the","of the Irish","the Irish typescript","Irish typescript so","typescript so that","so that it","that it could","it could be","could be published","The English dilemma","English dilemma -","dilemma -

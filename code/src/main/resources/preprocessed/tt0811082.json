{"title":"Stalking Santa","plot":"Millions of people believe in him. Thousands claim to have seen him. But only one man is foolish enough to try to prove his existence. Self-proclaimed \"Santologist\" Dr. Lloyd Darrow will stop at nothing to take on government conspiracy, corporate suppression and fake mall Santas, all in pursuit of the world's oldest yuletide enigma. With emotional (and financial) support from his perplexed wife Barbara, dysfunctional devotion from his needy intern Clarence, and despite growing resentment from his 12-year old son Keith, Lloyd is determined to reveal the truth. It's an obsession that lands him finding out Santa-linked phenomena such as the hieroglyphics of Egypt, the Roswell crash and the Town Center Shopping Plaza in Polka City, OH (to name a few); and an obsession that just might cost him his family, his sanity and his self-respect.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Million","of","peopl","believ","in","him",".","Thousand","claim","to","have","seen","him",".","But","onli","one","man","is","foolish","enough","to","tri","to","prove","his","exist",".","Self-proclaim","\"","Santologist","\"","Dr.","Lloyd","Darrow","will","stop","at","noth","to","take","on","govern","conspiraci",",","corpor","suppress","and","fake","mall","Santa",",","all","in","pursuit","of","the","world","'s","oldest","yuletid","enigma",".","With","emot","(","and","financi",")","support","from","his","perplex","wife","Barbara",",","dysfunct","devot","from","his","needi","intern","Clarenc",",","and","despit","grow","resent","from","his","12-year","old","son","Keith",",","Lloyd","is","determin","to","reveal","the","truth",".","It","'s","an","obsess","that","land","him","find","out","Santa-link","phenomena","such","as","the","hieroglyph","of","Egypt",",","the","Roswel","crash","and","the","Town","Center","Shop","Plaza","in","Polka","Citi",",","OH","(","to","name","a","few",")",";","and","an","obsess","that","just","might","cost","him","his","famili",",","his","saniti","and","his","self-respect","."],"lemmas":["million","of","people","believe","in","he",".","thousand","claim","to","have","see","he",".","but","only","one","man","be","foolish","enough","to","try","to","prove","he","existence",".","self-proclaimed","``","Santologist","''","Dr.","Lloyd","Darrow","will","stop","at","nothing","to","take","on","government","conspiracy",",","corporate","suppression","and","fake","mall","santa",",","all","in","pursuit","of","the","world","'s","oldest","yuletide","enigma",".","with","emotional","-lrb-","and","financial","-rrb-","support","from","he","perplexed","wife","Barbara",",","dysfunctional","devotion","from","he","needy","intern","Clarence",",","and","despite","grow","resentment","from","he","12-year","old","son","Keith",",","Lloyd","be","determine","to","reveal","the","truth",".","it","be","a","obsession","that","land","he","find","out","santa-linked","phenomenon","such","as","the","hieroglyphic","of","Egypt",",","the","Roswell","crash","and","the","Town","Center","Shopping","Plaza","in","Polka","City",",","oh","-lrb-","to","name","a","few","-rrb-",";","and","a","obsession","that","just","might","cost","he","he","family",",","he","sanity","and","he","self-respect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Millions

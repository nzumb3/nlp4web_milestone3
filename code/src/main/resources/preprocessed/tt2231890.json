{"title":"A Survivor from Magadan","plot":"This is a true story of Dr. Ata Safavi, a retired urologist who currently lives in Toronto. In 1947. at the age of 20, Safavi, a leftist activist in Iran was threatened by (Mohammad Reza) Shah's agents with exile to a remote town in south of Iran. Thus, he decided to escape to the Soviet Union, envisioned by many Iranians as the Communists' paradise. For his attempted illegal entry into the soviet union, he was immediately captured and sentenced to two years in prison, where he was obliged to work in a brick works factory. Later KGB, agents took him for additional investigations and convicted him for espionage for imperialism to spend twenty five years in a prison in Magadan, a town located in northeastern Russia and a part of Siberia, While most of his three thousands fellow prisoners died or committed suicide, Ata decided to fight for his right to live. This is the story of his best years spent in the most inhuman circumstances.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","a","true","stori","of","Dr.","Ata","Safavi",",","a","retir","urologist","who","current","live","in","Toronto",".","In","1947",".","at","the","age","of","20",",","Safavi",",","a","leftist","activist","in","Iran","was","threaten","by","(","Mohammad","Reza",")","Shah","'s","agent","with","exil","to","a","remot","town","in","south","of","Iran",".","Thus",",","he","decid","to","escap","to","the","Soviet","Union",",","envis","by","mani","Iranian","as","the","Communist","'","paradis",".","For","his","attempt","illeg","entri","into","the","soviet","union",",","he","was","immedi","captur","and","sentenc","to","two","year","in","prison",",","where","he","was","oblig","to","work","in","a","brick","work","factori",".","Later","KGB",",","agent","took","him","for","addit","investig","and","convict","him","for","espionag","for","imperi","to","spend","twenti","five","year","in","a","prison","in","Magadan",",","a","town","locat","in","northeastern","Russia","and","a","part","of","Siberia",",","While","most","of","his","three","thousand","fellow","prison","die","or","commit","suicid",",","Ata","decid","to","fight","for","his","right","to","live",".","This","is","the","stori","of","his","best","year","spent","in","the","most","inhuman","circumst","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","true","story","of","Dr.","Ata","Safavi",",","a","retired","urologist","who","currently","live","in","Toronto",".","in","1947",".","at","the","age","of","20",",","Safavi",",","a","leftist","activist","in","Iran","be","threaten","by","-lrb-","Mohammad","Reza","-rrb-","Shah","'s","agent","with","exile","to","a","remote","town","in","south","of","Iran",".","thus",",","he","decide","to","escape","to","the","Soviet","Union",",","envision","by","many","Iranians","as","the","Communists","'","paradise",".","for","he","attempted","illegal","entry","into","the","soviet","union",",","he","be","immediately","capture","and","sentence","to","two","year","in","prison",",","where","he","be","oblige","to","work","in","a","brick","work","factory",".","later","KGB",",","agent","take","he","for","additional","investigation","and","convict","he","for","espionage","for","imperialism","to","spend","twenty","five","year","in","a","prison","in","Magadan",",","a","town","located","in","northeastern","Russia","and","a","part","of","Siberia",",","while","most","of","he","three","thousand","fellow","prisoner","die","or","committed","suicide",",","Ata","decide","to","fight","for","he","right","to","live",".","this","be","the","story","of","he","best","year","spend","in","the","most","inhuman","circumstance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This

{"title":"Crush Ball","plot":"Apart from the fact that she looks different from the rest of her family, Kay is a normal happy 20 year old, who enjoys fighting with her sister Suzy, a computer whiz and her brother Mike, a star Dodgeball player. Ever since their father Robert disappeared several years ago, their mother Sally had taken over the household. One day, Mike discovers the secret behind Robert's disappearance and embarks a pursuit for the truth. Kay soon learns the truth that this all has to do with her past links to the Lee clan (an underground clan behind the deadly game of CRUSHBALL). Her endurance is tested to the limit in her first game. She's up against the Death God, Jin, the most powerful and destructive player in the game. Who is Kay really? And will she prove to be a CRUSHBALL player worthy of the Lee clan and save her adopted family? This action mystery depicts the unconditional love of a family and a story of fate that crossed the path of two families","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Apart","from","the","fact","that","she","look","differ","from","the","rest","of","her","famili",",","Kay","is","a","normal","happi","20","year","old",",","who","enjoy","fight","with","her","sister","Suzi",",","a","comput","whiz","and","her","brother","Mike",",","a","star","Dodgebal","player",".","Ever","sinc","their","father","Robert","disappear","sever","year","ago",",","their","mother","Salli","had","taken","over","the","household",".","One","day",",","Mike","discov","the","secret","behind","Robert","'s","disappear","and","embark","a","pursuit","for","the","truth",".","Kay","soon","learn","the","truth","that","this","all","has","to","do","with","her","past","link","to","the","Lee","clan","(","an","underground","clan","behind","the","dead","game","of","CRUSHBALL",")",".","Her","endur","is","test","to","the","limit","in","her","first","game",".","She","'s","up","against","the","Death","God",",","Jin",",","the","most","power","and","destruct","player","in","the","game",".","Who","is","Kay","realli","?","And","will","she","prove","to","be","a","CRUSHBALL","player","worthi","of","the","Lee","clan","and","save","her","adopt","famili","?","This","action","mysteri","depict","the","uncondit","love","of","a","famili","and","a","stori","of","fate","that","cross","the","path","of","two","famili"],"lemmas":["apart","from","the","fact","that","she","look","different","from","the","rest","of","she","family",",","Kay","be","a","normal","happy","20","year","old",",","who","enjoy","fight","with","she","sister","Suzy",",","a","computer","whiz","and","she","brother","Mike",",","a","star","Dodgeball","player",".","ever","since","they","father","Robert","disappear","several","year","ago",",","they","mother","Sally","have","take","over","the","household",".","one","day",",","Mike","discover","the","secret","behind","Robert","'s","disappearance","and","embark","a","pursuit","for","the","truth",".","Kay","soon","learn","the","truth","that","this","all","have","to","do","with","she","past","link","to","the","Lee","clan","-lrb-","a","underground","clan","behind","the","deadly","game","of","crushball","-rrb-",".","she","endurance","be","test","to","the","limit","in","she","first","game",".","she","be","up","against","the","Death","God",",","Jin",",","the","most","powerful","and","destructive","player","in","the","game",".","who","be","Kay","really","?","and","will","she","prove","to","be","a","CRUSHBALL","player","worthy","of","the","Lee","clan","and","save","she","adopted","family","?","this","action","mystery","depict","the","unconditional","love","of","a","family","and","a","story","of","fate","that","cross","the","path","of","two","family"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Apart

{"title":"Space Tourists","plot":"Space Tourists succeeds in surprising its audience with images and situations that have very little to do with the futuristic fantasy of 'space-tourism'. The filmmaker sets up encounters with the least likely people imaginable: places even stranger and more unknown than outer space itself. With extra-ordinary access and truly first-time images the film investigates the emotional oscillations of an expensive enterprise and questions the meaning and boundaries of the human spirit and our hunger for adventure and discovery.","genres":["Adventure"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Space","Tourist","succeed","in","surpris","it","audienc","with","imag","and","situat","that","have","veri","littl","to","do","with","the","futurist","fantasi","of","'","space-tour","'",".","The","filmmak","set","up","encount","with","the","least","like","peopl","imagin",":","place","even","stranger","and","more","unknown","than","outer","space","itself",".","With","extra-ordinari","access","and","truli","first-tim","imag","the","film","investig","the","emot","oscil","of","an","expens","enterpris","and","question","the","mean","and","boundari","of","the","human","spirit","and","our","hunger","for","adventur","and","discoveri","."],"lemmas":["Space","Tourists","succeed","in","surprise","its","audience","with","image","and","situation","that","have","very","little","to","do","with","the","futuristic","fantasy","of","'","space-tourism","'",".","the","filmmaker","set","up","encounter","with","the","least","likely","people","imaginable",":","place","even","stranger","and","more","unknown","than","outer","space","itself",".","with","extra-ordinary","access","and","truly","first-time","image","the","film","investigate","the","emotional","oscillation","of","a","expensive","enterprise","and","question","the","meaning","and","boundary","of","the","human","spirit","and","we","hunger","for","adventure","and","discovery","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Space Tourists succeeds","Tourists succeeds in","succeeds in surprising","in surprising its","surprising its audience","its audience with","audience with images","with images and","images and situations","and situations that","situations that have","that have very","have very little","very little to","little to do","to do with","do with the","with the futuristic","the futuristic fantasy","futuristic fantasy of","fantasy of '","of ' space-tourism","' space-tourism '","The filmmaker sets","filmmaker sets up","sets up encounters","up encounters with","encounters with the","with the least","the least likely","least likely people","likely people imaginable","people imaginable :","imaginable : places",": places even","places even stranger","even stranger and","stranger and more","and more unknown","more unknown than","unknown than outer","than outer space","outer space itself","With extra-ordinary access","extra-ordinary access and","access and truly","and truly first-time","truly first-time images","first-time images the","images the film","the film investigates","film investigates the","investigates the emotional","the emotional oscillations","emotional oscillations of","oscillations of an","of an expensive","an expensive enterprise","expensive enterprise and","enterprise and questions","and questions the","questions the meaning","the meaning and","meaning and boundaries","and boundaries of","boundaries of the","of the human","the human spirit","human spirit and","spirit and our","and our hunger","our hunger for","hunger for adventure","for adventure and","adventure and discovery"],"2grams":["Space Tourists","Tourists succeeds","succeeds in","in surprising","surprising its","its audience","audience with","with images","images and","and situations","situations that","that have","have very","very little","little to","to do","do with","with the","the futuristic","futuristic fantasy","fantasy of","of '","' space-tourism","space-tourism '","The filmmaker","filmmaker sets","sets up","up encounters","encounters with","with the","the least","least likely","likely people","people imaginable","imaginable :",": places","places even","even stranger","stranger and","and more","more unknown","unknown than","than outer","outer space","space itself","With extra-ordinary","extra-ordinary access","access and","and truly","truly first-time","first-time images","images the","the film","film investigates","investigates the","the emotional","emotional oscillations","oscillations of","of an","an expensive","expensive enterprise","enterprise and","and questions","questions the","the meaning","meaning and","and boundaries","boundaries of","of the","the human","human spirit","spirit and","and our","our hunger","hunger for","for adventure","adventure and","and discovery"]}

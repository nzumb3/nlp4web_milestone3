{"title":"The Englishman Who Went Up a Hill But Came Down a Mountain","plot":"Two English cartographers visit the small South Wales village of Ffynnon Garw, to measure what is claimed to be the \"first mountain inside of Wales\". It's 1917, and the war in Europe continues. The villagers are very proud of their \"mountain\", and are understandably disappointed and furious to find that it is in fact a \"hill\". Not to be outwitted by a rule (and the Englishmen who enforce it), the villagers set out to make their hill into a mountain, but to do so they must keep the English from leaving, before the job is done.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","English","cartograph","visit","the","small","South","Wale","villag","of","Ffynnon","Garw",",","to","measur","what","is","claim","to","be","the","\"","first","mountain","insid","of","Wale","\"",".","It","'s","1917",",","and","the","war","in","Europ","continu",".","The","villag","are","veri","proud","of","their","\"","mountain","\"",",","and","are","understand","disappoint","and","furious","to","find","that","it","is","in","fact","a","\"","hill","\"",".","Not","to","be","outwit","by","a","rule","(","and","the","Englishmen","who","enforc","it",")",",","the","villag","set","out","to","make","their","hill","into","a","mountain",",","but","to","do","so","they","must","keep","the","English","from","leav",",","befor","the","job","is","done","."],"lemmas":["two","english","cartographer","visit","the","small","South","Wales","village","of","Ffynnon","Garw",",","to","measure","what","be","claim","to","be","the","``","first","mountain","inside","of","Wales","''",".","it","be","1917",",","and","the","war","in","Europe","continue",".","the","villager","be","very","proud","of","they","``","mountain","''",",","and","be","understandably","disappointed","and","furious","to","find","that","it","be","in","fact","a","``","hill","''",".","not","to","be","outwit","by","a","rule","-lrb-","and","the","Englishmen","who","enforce","it","-rrb-",",","the","villager","set","out","to","make","they","hill","into","a","mountain",",","but","to","do","so","they","must","keep","the","English","from","leave",",","before","the","job","be","do","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Two English cartographers","English cartographers visit","cartographers visit the","visit the small","the small South","small South Wales","South Wales village","Wales village of","village of Ffynnon","of Ffynnon Garw","Ffynnon Garw ,","Garw , to",", to measure","to measure what","measure what is","what is claimed","is claimed to","claimed to be","to be the","be the \"","the \" first","\" first mountain","first mountain inside","mountain inside of","inside of Wales","of Wales \"","It 's 1917","'s 1917 ,","1917 , and",", and the","and the war","the war in","war in Europe","in Europe continues","The villagers are","villagers are very","are very proud","very proud of","proud of their","of their \"","their \" mountain","\" mountain \"","mountain \" ,","\" , and",", and are","and are understandably","are understandably disappointed","understandably disappointed and","disappointed and furious","and furious to","furious to find","to find that","find that it","that it is","it is in","is in fact","in fact a","fact a \"","a \" hill","\" hill \"","Not to be","to be outwitted","be outwitted by","outwitted by a","by a rule","a rule (","rule ( and","( and the","and the Englishmen","the Englishmen who","Englishmen who enforce","who enforce it","enforce it )","it ) ,",") , the",", the villagers","the villagers set","villagers set out","set out to","out to make","to make their","make their hill","their hill into","hill into a","into a mountain","a mountain ,","mountain , but",", but to","but to do","to do so","do so they","so they must","they must keep","must keep the","keep the English","the English from","English from leaving","from leaving ,","leaving , before",", before the","before the job","the job is","job is done"],"2grams":["Two English","English cartographers","cartographers visit","visit the","the small","small South","South Wales","Wales village","village of","of Ffynnon","Ffynnon Garw","Garw ,",", to","to measure","measure what","what is","is claimed","claimed to","to be","be the","the \"","\" first","first mountain","mountain inside","inside of","of Wales","Wales \"","It 's","'s 1917","1917 ,",", and","and the","the war","war in","in Europe","Europe continues","The villagers","villagers are","are very","very proud","proud of","of their","their \"","\" mountain","mountain \"","\" ,",", and","and are","are understandably","understandably disappointed","disappointed and","and furious","furious to","to find","find that","that it","it is","is in","in fact","fact a","a \"","\" hill","hill \"","Not to","to be","be outwitted","outwitted by","by a","a rule","rule (","( and","and the","the Englishmen","Englishmen who","who enforce","enforce it","it )",") ,",", the","the villagers","villagers set","set out","out to","to make","make their","their hill","hill into","into a","a mountain","mountain ,",", but","but to","to do","do so","so they","they must","must keep","keep the","the English","English from","from leaving","leaving ,",", before","before the","the job","job is","is done"]}

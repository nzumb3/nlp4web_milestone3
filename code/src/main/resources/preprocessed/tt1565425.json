{"title":"Grand Opening","plot":"After just being laid-off from his assistant manager job at Winn Supermarket, Pablo Mercado buys a scratch-off ticket on his way out the door and hits it BIG! And now, his greatest dream seems possible: to open his very own supermarket El Osso Grande (The Big Bear). But with Pablos new found wealth comes new found problems. First, he has to split his winnings with his ex-wife by making her co-owner. Then, the perfect location for his store turns out to be right down the street from Winns; now his rival. Determined to succeed, Pablo hires a dysfunctional but supportive store staff - his twenty-something year-old daughter and cashier, (with big plans of her own), the Worlds Fastest Bagger and his army of bag boys, a stockroom clerk with an unusual talent with knives, a butcher who's afraid of blood, and a gossiping security guard who likes to hit on the male customers more than fighting crime. With the help of his loyal employees, Pablo does all he can to survive his Grand Opening!","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["After","just","be","laid-off","from","his","assist","manag","job","at","Winn","Supermarket",",","Pablo","Mercado","buy","a","scratch-off","ticket","on","his","way","out","the","door","and","hit","it","BIG","!","And","now",",","his","greatest","dream","seem","possibl",":","to","open","his","veri","own","supermarket","El","Osso","Grand","(","The","Big","Bear",")",".","But","with","Pablo","new","found","wealth","come","new","found","problem",".","First",",","he","has","to","split","his","win","with","his","ex-wif","by","make","her","co-own",".","Then",",","the","perfect","locat","for","his","store","turn","out","to","be","right","down","the","street","from","Winn",";","now","his","rival",".","Determin","to","succeed",",","Pablo","hire","a","dysfunct","but","support","store","staff","-","his","twenty-someth","year-old","daughter","and","cashier",",","(","with","big","plan","of","her","own",")",",","the","World","Fastest","Bagger","and","his","armi","of","bag","boy",",","a","stockroom","clerk","with","an","unusu","talent","with","knive",",","a","butcher","who","'s","afraid","of","blood",",","and","a","gossip","secur","guard","who","like","to","hit","on","the","male","custom","more","than","fight","crime",".","With","the","help","of","his","loyal","employe",",","Pablo","doe","all","he","can","to","surviv","his","Grand","Opene","!"],"lemmas":["after","just","be","laid-off","from","he","assistant","manager","job","at","Winn","Supermarket",",","Pablo","Mercado","buy","a","scratch-off","ticket","on","he","way","out","the","door","and","hit","it","BIG","!","and","now",",","he","greatest","dream","seem","possible",":","to","open","he","very","own","supermarket","El","Osso","Grande","-lrb-","The","Big","Bear","-rrb-",".","but","with","pablo","new","find","wealth","come","new","find","problem",".","first",",","he","have","to","split","he","winnings","with","he","ex-wife","by","make","she","co-owner",".","then",",","the","perfect","location","for","he","store","turn","out","to","be","right","down","the","street","from","Winns",";","now","he","rival",".","determine","to","succeed",",","Pablo","hire","a","dysfunctional","but","supportive","store","staff","-","he","twenty-something","year-old","daughter","and","cashier",",","-lrb-","with","big","plan","of","she","own","-rrb-",",","the","Worlds","Fastest","Bagger","and","he","army","of","bag","boy",",","a","stockroom","clerk","with","a","unusual","talent","with","knife",",","a","butcher","who","be","afraid","of","blood",",","and","a","gossip","security","guard","who","like","to","hit","on","the","male","customer","more","than","fight","crime",".","with","the","help","of","he","loyal","employee",",","Pablo","do","all","he","can","to","survive","he","Grand","Opening","!"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After just being","just being laid-off","being laid-off from","laid-off from his","from his assistant","his assistant manager","assistant manager job","manager job at","job at Winn","at Winn Supermarket","Winn Supermarket ,","Supermarket , Pablo",", Pablo Mercado","Pablo Mercado buys","Mercado buys a","buys a scratch-off","a scratch-off ticket","scratch-off ticket on","ticket on his","on his way","his way out","way out the","out the door","the door and","door and hits","and hits it","hits it BIG","And now ,","now , his",", his greatest","his greatest dream","greatest dream seems","dream seems possible","seems possible :","possible : to",": to open","to open his","open his very","his very own","very own supermarket","own supermarket El","supermarket El Osso","El Osso Grande","Osso Grande (","Grande ( The","( The Big","The Big Bear","Big Bear )","But with Pablos","with Pablos new","Pablos new found","new found wealth","found wealth comes","wealth comes new","comes new found","new found problems","First , he",", he has","he has to","has to split","to split his","split his winnings","his winnings with","winnings with his","with his ex-wife","his ex-wife by","ex-wife by making","by making her","making her co-owner","Then , the",", the perfect","the perfect location","perfect location for","location for his","for his store","his store turns","store turns out","turns out to","out to be","to be right","be right down","right down the","down the street","the street from","street from Winns","from Winns ;","Winns ;

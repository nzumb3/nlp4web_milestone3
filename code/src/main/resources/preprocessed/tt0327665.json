{"title":"Spin, Shoot & Run","plot":"The sun is setting and we see Dave, an artist, at the Laundromat. Fretting over his wife's ticking clock, Dave happens upon Ruby, a tempestuous beauty on the run with a mean-looking baby on her arm while toting a gun. Thus begins a series of capers that revolve around the helpless, yet, testy baby, a strapping town sheriff, a gun-loving bounty hunter and a snitching clown. All are involved in an ever-twisting plot in a quest for ownership of the baby Lloyd. The all night journey ultimately provides all characters their unsought solutions towards the lives they've been wanting.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["The","sun","is","set","and","we","see","Dave",",","an","artist",",","at","the","Laundromat",".","Fret","over","his","wife","'s","tick","clock",",","Dave","happen","upon","Rubi",",","a","tempestu","beauti","on","the","run","with","a","mean-look","babi","on","her","arm","while","tote","a","gun",".","Thus","begin","a","seri","of","caper","that","revolv","around","the","helpless",",","yet",",","testi","babi",",","a","strap","town","sheriff",",","a","gun-lov","bounti","hunter","and","a","snitch","clown",".","All","are","involv","in","an","ever-twist","plot","in","a","quest","for","ownership","of","the","babi","Lloyd",".","The","all","night","journey","ultim","provid","all","charact","their","unsought","solut","toward","the","live","they","ve","been","want","."],"lemmas":["the","sun","be","set","and","we","see","Dave",",","a","artist",",","at","the","Laundromat",".","fret","over","he","wife","'s","tick","clock",",","Dave","happen","upon","Ruby",",","a","tempestuous","beauty","on","the","run","with","a","mean-looking","baby","on","she","arm","while","tote","a","gun",".","thus","begin","a","series","of","caper","that","revolve","around","the","helpless",",","yet",",","testy","baby",",","a","strapping","town","sheriff",",","a","gun-loving","bounty","hunter","and","a","snitch","clown",".","all","be","involve","in","a","ever-twisting","plot","in","a","quest","for","ownership","of","the","baby","Lloyd",".","the","all","night","journey","ultimately","provide","all","character","they","unsought","solution","towards","the","life","they","have","be","want","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The sun is","sun is setting","is setting and","setting and we","and we see","we see Dave","see Dave ,","Dave , an",", an artist","an artist ,","artist , at",", at the","at the Laundromat","Fretting over his","over his wife","his wife 's","wife 's ticking","'s ticking clock","ticking clock ,","clock , Dave",", Dave happens","Dave happens upon","happens upon Ruby","upon Ruby ,","Ruby , a",", a tempestuous","a tempestuous beauty","tempestuous beauty on","beauty on the","on the run","the run with","run with a","with a mean-looking","a mean-looking baby","mean-looking baby on","baby on her","on her arm","her arm while","arm while toting","while toting a","toting a gun","Thus begins a","begins a series","a series of","series of capers","of capers that","capers that revolve","that revolve around","revolve around the","around the helpless","the helpless ,","helpless , yet",", yet ,","yet , testy",", testy baby","testy baby ,","baby , a",", a strapping","a strapping town","strapping town sheriff","town sheriff ,","sheriff , a",", a gun-loving","a gun-loving bounty","gun-loving bounty hunter","bounty hunter and","hunter and a","and a snitching","a snitching clown","All are involved","are involved in","involved in an","in an ever-twisting","an ever-twisting plot","ever-twisting plot in","plot in a","in a quest","a quest for","quest for ownership","for ownership of","ownership of the","of the baby","the baby Lloyd","The all night","all night journey","night journey ultimately","journey ultimately provides","ultimately provides all","provides all characters","all characters their","characters their unsought","their unsought solutions","unsought solutions towards","solutions towards the","towards the lives","the lives they","lives they 've","they 've been","'ve been wanting"],"2grams":["The sun","sun is","is setting","setting and","and we","we see","see Dave","Dave ,",", an","an artist","artist ,",", at","at the","the Laundromat","Fretting over","over his","his wife","wife 's","'s ticking","ticking clock","clock ,",", Dave","Dave happens","happens upon","upon Ruby","Ruby ,",", a","a tempestuous","tempestuous beauty","beauty on","on the","the run","run with","with a","a mean-looking","mean-looking baby","baby on","on her","her arm","arm while","while toting","toting a","a gun","Thus begins","begins a","a series","series of","of capers","capers that","that revolve","revolve around","around the","the helpless","helpless ,",", yet","yet ,",", testy","testy baby","baby ,",", a","a strapping","strapping town","town sheriff","sheriff ,",", a","a gun-loving","gun-loving bounty","bounty hunter","hunter and","and a","a snitching","snitching clown","All are","are involved","involved in","in an","an ever-twisting","ever-twisting plot","plot in","in a","a quest","quest for","for ownership","ownership of","of the","the baby","baby Lloyd","The all","all night","night journey","journey ultimately","ultimately provides","provides all","all characters","characters their","their unsought","unsought solutions","solutions towards","towards the","the lives","lives they","they 've","'ve been","been wanting"]}

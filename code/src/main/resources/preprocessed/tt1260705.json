{"title":"Flying Rabbits","plot":"Yukari always wanted to become a flight attendant and has just been hired by Japan Airlines. However, due to an unexpected mistake, she has also been recruited to the company's basketball team (the JAL \"Rabbits\") despite being a lousy at basketball. Forced to divide her time between job training and playing basketball, Yukari makes an increasing amount of mistakes in both areas. Frustrated, she nearly gives up on her dream career, but somehow finds the strength to keep trying both in the skies and on the court.","genres":["Comedy"," Sport"],"stems":["Yukari","alway","want","to","becom","a","flight","attend","and","has","just","been","hire","by","Japan","Airlin",".","Howev",",","due","to","an","unexpect","mistak",",","she","has","also","been","recruit","to","the","compani","'s","basketbal","team","(","the","JAL","\"","Rabbit","\"",")","despit","be","a","lousi","at","basketbal",".","Forc","to","divid","her","time","between","job","train","and","play","basketbal",",","Yukari","make","an","increas","amount","of","mistak","in","both","area",".","Frustrat",",","she","near","give","up","on","her","dream","career",",","but","somehow","find","the","strength","to","keep","tri","both","in","the","sky","and","on","the","court","."],"lemmas":["Yukari","always","want","to","become","a","flight","attendant","and","have","just","be","hire","by","Japan","Airlines",".","however",",","due","to","a","unexpected","mistake",",","she","have","also","be","recruit","to","the","company","'s","basketball","team","-lrb-","the","JAL","``","Rabbits","''","-rrb-","despite","be","a","lousy","at","basketball",".","force","to","divide","she","time","between","job","training","and","playing","basketball",",","Yukari","make","a","increase","amount","of","mistake","in","both","area",".","frustrated",",","she","nearly","give","up","on","she","dream","career",",","but","somehow","find","the","strength","to","keep","try","both","in","the","sky","and","on","the","court","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Yukari always wanted","always wanted to","wanted to become","to become a","become a flight","a flight attendant","flight attendant and","attendant and has","and has just","has just been","just been hired","been hired by","hired by Japan","by Japan Airlines","However , due",", due to","due to an","to an unexpected","an unexpected mistake","unexpected mistake ,","mistake , she",", she has","she has also","has also been","also been recruited","been recruited to","recruited to the","to the company","the company 's","company 's basketball","'s basketball team","basketball team (","team ( the","( the JAL","the JAL \"","JAL \" Rabbits","\" Rabbits \"","Rabbits \" )","\" ) despite",") despite being","despite being a","being a lousy","a lousy at","lousy at basketball","Forced to divide","to divide her","divide her time","her time between","time between job","between job training","job training and","training and playing","and playing basketball","playing basketball ,","basketball , Yukari",", Yukari makes","Yukari makes an","makes an increasing","an increasing amount","increasing amount of","amount of mistakes","of mistakes in","mistakes in both","in both areas","Frustrated , she",", she nearly","she nearly gives","nearly gives up","gives up on","up on her","on her dream","her dream career","dream career ,","career , but",", but somehow","but somehow finds","somehow finds the","finds the strength","the strength to","strength to keep","to keep trying","keep trying both","trying both in","both in the","in the skies","the skies and","skies and on","and on the","on the court"],"2grams":["Yukari always","always wanted","wanted to","to become","become a","a flight","flight attendant","attendant and","and has","has just","just been","been hired","hired by","by Japan","Japan Airlines","However ,",", due","due to","to an","an unexpected","unexpected mistake","mistake ,",", she","she has","has also","also been","been recruited","recruited to","to the","the company","company 's","'s basketball","basketball team","team (","( the","the JAL","JAL \"","\" Rabbits","Rabbits \"","\" )",") despite","despite being","being a","a lousy","lousy at","at basketball","Forced to","to divide","divide her","her time","time between","between job","job training","training and","and playing","playing basketball","basketball ,",", Yukari","Yukari makes","makes an","an increasing","increasing amount","amount of","of mistakes","mistakes in","in both","both areas","Frustrated ,",", she","she nearly","nearly gives","gives up","up on","on her","her dream","dream career","career ,",", but","but somehow","somehow finds","finds the","the strength","strength to","to keep","keep trying","trying both","both in","in the","the skies","skies and","and on","on the","the court"]}

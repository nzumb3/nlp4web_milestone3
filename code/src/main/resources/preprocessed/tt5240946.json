{"title":"Isabells Traum","plot":"London, New years eve 1947: The writer Isabell Atkins suffers from a serious creative crisis.

Her husband, her former best source of inspiration is, allegedly traveling for months because of his profession and can no longer inspire. Your therapist, and her best friend Richard can no longer help. As she drives away a weekend to relax and kick back, but it is raided at night and knocked unconscious. When she regains consciousness, she appears to be like in another world. It takes a while until she realizes that she is trapped in her own world, the book what she wanted to write last. Now she has with its main characters the difficult task - Rachel, Steve and Amy - to pass a dangerous adventure in which you have to deal with a drug dealer, and to convince them that all her life, all her experiences and memories are pure fiction and have never existed, to rediscover a way in her reality. But will she be able to return so readily?","genres":["Fantasy"],"stems":["London",",","New","year","eve","1947",":","The","writer","Isabel","Atkin","suffer","from","a","serious","creativ","crisi",".","No","novel","is","more","about",",","no","short","stori",",","the","word","simpli","no","longer","flow",".","Her","husband",",","her","former","best","sourc","of","inspir","is",",","alleg","travel","for","month","becaus","of","his","profess","and","can","no","longer","inspir",".","Your","therapist",",","and","her","best","friend","Richard","can","no","longer","help",".","As","she","drive","away","a","weekend","to","relax","and","kick","back",",","but","it","is","raid","at","night","and","knock","unconsci",".","When","she","regain","conscious",",","she","appear","to","be","like","in","anoth","world",".","It","take","a","while","until","she","realiz","that","she","is","trap","in","her","own","world",",","the","book","what","she","want","to","write","last",".","Now","she","has","with","it","main","charact","the","difficult","task","-","Rachel",",","Steve","and","Ami","-","to","pass","a","danger","adventur","in","which","you","have","to","deal","with","a","drug","dealer",",","and","to","convinc","them","that","all","her","life",",","all","her","experi","and","memori","are","pure","fiction","and","have","never","exist",",","to","rediscov","a","way","in","her","realiti",".","But","will","she","be","abl","to","return","so","readili","?"],"lemmas":["London",",","New","year","eve","1947",":","the","writer","Isabell","Atkins","suffer","from","a","serious","creative","crisis",".","no","novel","be","more","about",",","no","short","story",",","the","word","simply","no","longer","flow",".","she","husband",",","she","former","best","source","of","inspiration","be",",","allegedly","travel","for","month","because","of","he","profession","and","can","no","longer","inspire",".","you","therapist",",","and","she","best","friend","Richard","can","no","longer","help",".","as","she","drive","away","a","weekend","to","relax","and","kick","back",",","but","it","be","raid","at","night","and","knock","unconscious",".","when","she","regain","consciousness",",","she","appear","to","be","like","in","another","world",".","it","take","a","while","until","she","realize","that","she","be","trap","in","she","own","world",",","the","book","what","she","want","to","write","last",".","now","she","have","with","its","main","character","the","difficult","task","-","Rachel",",","Steve","and","Amy","-","to","pass","a","dangerous","adventure","in","which","you","have","to","deal","with","a","drug","dealer",",","and","to","convince","they","that","all","she","life",",","all","she","experience","and","memory","be","pure","fiction","and","have","never","exist",",","to","rediscover","a","way","in","she","reality",".","but","will","she","be","able","to","return","so","readily","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["London

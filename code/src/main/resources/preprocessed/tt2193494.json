{"title":"ELEW: Live from Infinity","plot":"Eric Lewis had a busy summer: he held down a nationwide tour with Josh Groban, opened the Dave Matthews Caravan tour, showed off his skills to President Obama, composed a ballet and acted in live theater, all while struggling to complete his second album, Rockjazz vol. 2. Eric has met this tremendous success by transforming into his artistic alter ego: ELEW, who performs Rockjazz, a ferocious mix of rock physicality and jazz precision hammered out on a grand piano. ELEW: Live from Infinity is a mix of Eric's music, moments from his life and the live musical, cut together to provide perspective on the places one must go to maintain world class artistry.","genres":["Biography"," Music","

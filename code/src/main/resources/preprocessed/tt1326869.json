{"title":"Stuck Like Chuck","plot":"Charlie is a lovable loser who can't find a way to work up the courage to ask the girl of his dreams out. After some scheming with Rob, his stoner roommate, Charlie and Juliet find themselves locked in their Film-201 class. Stuck spending the night together, Charlie and Juliet finally open up to each other through a series of witty conversations. Filled with sharp dialogue, movie references and indie film clichés, this film was made with both humor and heart.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Charli","is","a","lovabl","loser","who","ca","n't","find","a","way","to","work","up","the","courag","to","ask","the","girl","of","his","dream","out",".","After","some","scheme","with","Rob",",","his","stoner","roommat",",","Charli","and","Juliet","find","themselv","lock","in","their","Film-201","class",".","Stuck","spend","the","night","togeth",",","Charli","and","Juliet","final","open","up","to","each","other","through","a","seri","of","witti","convers",".","Fill","with","sharp","dialogu",",","movi","refer","and","indi","film","cliché",",","this","film","was","made","with","both","humor","and","heart","."],"lemmas":["Charlie","be","a","lovable","loser","who","can","not","find","a","way","to","work","up","the","courage","to","ask","the","girl","of","he","dream","out",".","after","some","scheming","with","Rob",",","he","stoner","roommate",",","Charlie","and","Juliet","find","themselves","lock","in","they","film-201","class",".","stuck","spending","the","night","together",",","Charlie","and","Juliet","finally","open","up","to","each","other","through","a","series","of","witty","conversation",".","fill","with","sharp","dialogue",",","movie","reference","and","indie","film","clichés",",","this","film","be","make","with","both","humor","and","heart","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Charlie is a","is a lovable","a lovable loser","lovable loser who","loser who ca","who ca n't","ca n't find","n't find a","find a way","a way to","way to work","to work up","work up the","up the courage","the courage to","courage to ask","to ask the","ask the girl","the girl of","girl of his","of his dreams","his dreams out","After some scheming","some scheming with","scheming with Rob","with Rob ,","Rob , his",", his stoner","his stoner roommate","stoner roommate ,","roommate , Charlie",", Charlie and","Charlie and Juliet","and Juliet find","Juliet find themselves","find themselves locked","themselves locked in","locked in their","in their Film-201","their Film-201 class","Stuck spending the","spending the night","the night together","night together ,","together , Charlie",", Charlie and","Charlie and Juliet","and Juliet finally","Juliet finally open","finally open up","open up to","up to each","to each other","each other through","other through a","through a series","a series of","series of witty","of witty conversations","Filled with sharp","with sharp dialogue","sharp dialogue ,","dialogue , movie",", movie references","movie references and","references and indie","and indie film","indie film clichés","film clichés ,","clichés , this",", this film","this film was","film was made","was made with","made with both","with both humor","both humor and","humor and heart"],"2grams":["Charlie is","is a","a lovable","lovable loser","loser who","who ca","ca n't","n't find","find a","a way","way to","to work","work up","up the","the courage","courage to","to ask","ask the","the girl","girl of","of his","his dreams","dreams out","After some","some scheming","scheming with","with Rob","Rob ,",", his","his stoner","stoner roommate","roommate ,",", Charlie","Charlie and","and Juliet","Juliet find","find themselves","themselves locked","locked in","in their","their Film-201","Film-201 class","Stuck spending","spending the","the night","night together","together ,",", Charlie","Charlie and","and Juliet","Juliet finally","finally open","open up","up to","to each","each other","other through","through a","a series","series of","of witty","witty conversations","Filled with","with sharp","sharp dialogue","dialogue ,",", movie","movie references","references and","and indie","indie film","film clichés","clichés ,",", this","this film","film was","was made","made with","with both","both humor","humor and","and heart"]}

{"title":"The Lock In","plot":"Filmed at the Harrogate Theatre in 2012, this live extravaganza brings \"The Demon Barbers\", winners of Best Live Act at the BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards 2009, together with some of England's most exciting young traditional and hip hop dancers to create the high energy dance spectacular \"The Lock In\" Clog, Sword and Morris meet B-boying, Popping and Krump in this humorous and unmissable visual feast. This fast-paced and innovative spectacular brings some of the UK's oldest forms of dance bang up to date as they collide with some of the youngest. The extraordinary dancing is as dynamic and ground-breaking as Stomp was a decade ago. Folk is having a massive resurgence and The Lock In is at the cutting edge of this revival.","genres":["Musical"],"stems":["Film","at","the","Harrog","Theatr","in","2012",",","this","live","extravaganza","bring","\"","The","Demon","Barber","\"",",","winner","of","Best","Live","Act","at","the","BBC","Radio","2","Folk","Award","2009",",","togeth","with","some","of","England","'s","most","excit","young","tradit","and","hip","hop","dancer","to","creat","the","high","energi","danc","spectacular","\"","The","Lock","In","\"","Clog",",","Sword","and","Morri","meet","B-boy",",","Pop","and","Krump","in","this","humor","and","unmiss","visual","feast",".","This","fast-pac","and","innov","spectacular","bring","some","of","the","UK","'s","oldest","form","of","danc","bang","up","to","date","as","they","collid","with","some","of","the","youngest",".","The","extraordinari","danc","is","as","dynam","and","ground-break","as","Stomp","was","a","decad","ago",".","Folk","is","have","a","massiv","resurg","and","The","Lock","In","is","at","the","cut","edg","of","this","reviv","."],"lemmas":["film","at","the","Harrogate","Theatre","in","2012",",","this","live","extravaganza","bring","``","the","Demon","Barbers","''",",","winner","of","best","Live","Act","at","the","BBC","Radio","2","folk","award","2009",",","together","with","some","of","England","'s","most","exciting","young","traditional","and","hip","hop","dancer","to","create","the","high","energy","dance","spectacular","``","the","Lock","In","''","Clog",",","Sword","and","Morris","meet","b-boying",",","Popping","and","Krump","in","this","humorous","and","unmissable","visual","feast",".","this","fast-paced","and","innovative","spectacular","bring","some","of","the","UK","'s","oldest","form","of","dance","bang","up","to","date","as","they","collide","with","some","of","the","youngest",".","the","extraordinary","dancing","be","as","dynamic","and","ground-breaking","as","Stomp","be","a","decade","ago",".","folk","be","have","a","massive","resurgence","and","the","Lock","In","be","at","the","cut","edge","of","this","revival","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Filmed

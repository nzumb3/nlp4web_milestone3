One day, he saves a rich philanthropist's life and is awarded a credit card that can withdraw a thousand US dollars every day. Mazen's life turns around overnight. He finally funds his courage and asks Elsa out on a date. Ultimately, Mazen's newly found love-for-life attracts unwanted attention from unsavory people who decide to give him a very hard time in order to push him to relinquish his credit

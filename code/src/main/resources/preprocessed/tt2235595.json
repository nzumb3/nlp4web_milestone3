{"title":"Landlocked","plot":"This is the amazing story of how the state of South Carolina changed fishing history forever. During the Great Depression the state undertook a controversial project. Through the use of federal funds, 40 miles of dams and dikes were constructed to flood 160,000 acres from the historic, moss-hung Low Country of Charleston all the way inland to Columbia to create Santee Cooper. This was done to create hydroelectric power for the surrounding rural areas. When the lock of the Dams were closed, the striped bass, originally an ocean dwelling fish, became landlocked and unable to go back to saltwater. After several years, fishermen and biologists realized the fish were thriving and reproducing, incredibly for the first time ever in freshwater.","genres":["Documentary"," History","

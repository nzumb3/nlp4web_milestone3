{"title":"20 Wheels to Memphis","plot":"Jett Ford is a female Harley rider who has a lifelong dream of visiting the home of her hero, Elvis. She along with her motorcycle club, The Girlz of Graceland, embark on a 4,000 mile, round-trip journey from San Diego to Memphis on their motorcycles. This diverse group of women -a firefighter, a cancer patient, straight, gay, white collar and blue collar, share friendship, sisterhood and living life on their terms. They come together to enjoy a common bond - the road. 20 WHEELS TO MEMPHIS documents this journey as the Girlz of Graceland ride through desert heat, thunderstorms and motorcycle breakdowns to make their way to Memphis. But this is not just about women on a joy ride. Spending months preparing for the cross-country adventure, the Girlz collected donations and money to present to 'Presley Place', a charity in Memphis that assists homeless and poverty-stricken families. As they make their way from San Diego to Memphis, they encounter curious locals who are intrigued by the free-spirit, friendship and humanity of these courageous women. This inspirational story demonstrates how our diversity and individuality can bring us together, to celebrate our common humanity and compassion, and discover what positive things we can do for our own lives and for others.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Jett","Ford","is","a","femal","Harley","rider","who","has","a","lifelong","dream","of","visit","the","home","of","her","hero",",","Elvis",".","She","along","with","her","motorcycl","club",",","The","Girlz","of","Graceland",",","embark","on","a","4,000","mile",",","round-trip","journey","from","San","Diego","to","Memphi","on","their","motorcycl",".","This","divers","group","of","women","-","a","firefight",",","a","cancer","patient",",","straight",",","gay",",","white","collar","and","blue","collar",",","share","friendship",",","sisterhood","and","live","life","on","their","term",".","They","come","togeth","to","enjoy","a","common","bond","-","the","road",".","20","WHEELS","TO","MEMPHIS","document","this","journey","as","the","Girlz","of","Graceland","ride","through","desert","heat",",","thunderstorm","and","motorcycl","breakdown","to","make","their","way","to","Memphi",".","But","this","is","not","just","about","women","on","a","joy","ride",".","Spend","month","prepar","for","the","cross-countri","adventur",",","the","Girlz","collect","donat","and","money","to","present","to","'","Presley","Place","'",",","a","chariti","in","Memphi","that","assist","homeless","and","poverty-stricken","famili",".","As","they","make","their","way","from","San","Diego","to","Memphi",",","they","encount","curious","local","who","are","intrigu","by","the","free-spirit",",","friendship","and","human","of","these","courag","women",".","This","inspir","stori","demonstr","how","our","divers","and","individu","can","bring","us","togeth",",","to","celebr","our","common","human","and","compass",",","and","discov","what","posit","thing","we","can","do","for","our","own","live","and","for","other","."],"lemmas":["Jett","Ford","be","a","female","Harley","rider","who","have","a","lifelong","dream","of","visit","the","home","of","she","hero",",","Elvis",".","she","along","with","she","motorcycle","club",",","the","Girlz","of","Graceland",",","embark","on","a","4,000","mile",",","round-trip","journey","from","San","Diego","to","Memphis","on","they","motorcycle",".","this","diverse","group","of","woman","-","a","firefighter",",","a","cancer","patient",",","straight",",","gay",",","white","collar","and","blue","collar",",","share","friendship",",","sisterhood","and","live","life","on","they","term",".","they","come","together","to","enjoy","a","common","bond","-","the","road",".","20","wheel","to","MEMPHIS","document","this","journey","as","the","Girlz","of","Graceland","ride","through","desert","heat",",","thunderstorm","and","motorcycle","breakdown","to","make","they","way","to","Memphis",".","but","this","be","not","just","about","woman","on","a","joy","ride",".","spending","month","prepare","for","the","cross-country","adventure",",","the","Girlz","collect","donation","and","money","to","present","to","'","Presley","Place","'",",","a","charity","in","Memphis","that","assist","homeless","and","poverty-stricken","family",".","as","they","make","they","way","from","San","Diego","to","Memphis",",","they","encounter","curious","local","who","be","intrigue","by","the","free-spirit",",","friendship","and","humanity","of","these","courageous","woman",".","this","inspirational","story","demonstrate","how","we","diversity","and","individuality","can","bring","we","together",",","to","celebrate","we","common","humanity","and","compassion",",","and","discover","what","positive","thing","we","can","do","for","we","own","life","and","for","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Jett

{"title":"Hier encore, je t'esp√©rais toujours","plot":"The story of a woman whose husband is missing and presumed dead - of her fight, and her enduring love for him and for his country. Nadine Bari lead us down the roads of Guinea in search of her Guinean husband. Along the way, she recounts her long battle with political authorities to find out the truth about her husband's disappearance. Full of great hope and profound despair, her story resembles that of thousands of women still seeking the truth about the fate of their missing husbands, fathers, brothers and sons. In 2007, her determination inspired the UN signing of the International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","stori","of","a","woman","whose","husband","is","miss","and","presum","dead","-","of","her","fight",",","and","her","endur","love","for","him","and","for","his","countri",".","Nadin","Bari","lead","us","down","the","road","of","Guinea","in","search","of","her","Guinean","husband",".","Along","the","way",",","she","recount","her","long","battl","with","polit","author","to","find","out","the","truth","about","her","husband","'s","disappear",".","Full","of","great","hope","and","profound","despair",",","her","stori","resembl","that","of","thousand","of","women","still","seek","the","truth","about","the","fate","of","their","miss","husband",",","father",",","brother","and","son",".","In","2007",",","her","determin","inspir","the","UN","sign","of","the","Internat","Convent","for","the","Protect","of","All","Person","from","Enforc","Disappear","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","a","woman","whose","husband","be","miss","and","presume","dead","-","of","she","fight",",","and","she","enduring","love","for","he","and","for","he","country",".","nadine","barus","lead","we","down","the","road","of","Guinea","in","search","of","she","guinean","husband",".","along","the","way",",","she","recount","she","long","battle","with","political","authority","to","find","out","the","truth","about","she","husband","'s","disappearance",".","full","of","great","hope","and","profound","despair",",","she","story","resemble","that","of","thousand","of","woman","still","seek","the","truth","about","the","fate","of","they","miss","husband",",","father",",","brother","and","son",".","in","2007",",","she","determination","inspire","the","UN","signing","of","the","International","Convention","for","the","Protection","of","All","Persons","from","enforce","disappearance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The story of","story of a","of a woman","a woman whose","woman whose husband","whose husband is","husband is missing","is missing and","missing and presumed","and presumed dead","presumed dead -","dead -

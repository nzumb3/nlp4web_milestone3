{"title":"Operation Filmmaker","plot":"Soon after the fall of Baghdad in 2003, a young and charismatic film student, Muthana Mohmed, stands in the rubble of the city's film school and explains to an American television audience that his dream of becoming a filmmaker has been destroyed - first by Saddam Hussein, then by American bombs. This brief, fortuitous appearance on MTV changes Muthana's life forever. Watching in the United States, actor/director Liev Schreiber stops channel surfing, utterly captivated. Feeling guilty about a war he opposed, Schreiber decides to extend to the unknown Iraqi the opportunity of a lifetime - to come to Prague to work on an American movie, Everything is Illuminated. On set, frustrated expectations complicate the relationship between Muthana and his American benefactors in what becomes a cross-cultural endeavor gone awry. Filmmaker Nina Davenport becomes increasingly entangled in the young Iraqi's life as his visa is about to expire and the threat of returning to Baghdad looms. Operation Filmmaker, revealing on several levels, addresses the power dynamics between the American filmmaker and her Iraqi subject, unfolding as an engaging parable about the U.S. invasion of Iraq.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Soon","after","the","fall","of","Baghdad","in","2003",",","a","young","and","charismat","film","student",",","Muthana","Mohm",",","stand","in","the","rubbl","of","the","citi","'s","film","school","and","explain","to","an","American","televis","audienc","that","his","dream","of","becom","a","filmmak","has","been","destroy","-","first","by","Saddam","Hussein",",","then","by","American","bomb",".","This","brief",",","fortuit","appear","on","MTV","chang","Muthana","'s","life","forev",".","Watch","in","the","Unite","State",",","actor/director","Liev","Schreiber","stop","channel","surf",",","utter","captiv",".","Feel","guilti","about","a","war","he","oppos",",","Schreiber","decid","to","extend","to","the","unknown","Iraqi","the","opportun","of","a","lifetim","-","to","come","to","Pragu","to","work","on","an","American","movi",",","Everyth","is","Illumin",".","On","set",",","frustrat","expect","complic","the","relationship","between","Muthana","and","his","American","benefactor","in","what","becom","a","cross-cultur","endeavor","gone","awri",".","Filmmak","Nina","Davenport","becom","increas","entangl","in","the","young","Iraqi","'s","life","as","his","visa","is","about","to","expir","and","the","threat","of","return","to","Baghdad","loom",".","Operat","Filmmak",",","reveal","on","sever","level",",","address","the","power","dynam","between","the","American","filmmak","and","her","Iraqi","subject",",","unfold","as","an","engag","parabl","about","the","U.S.","invas","of","Iraq","."],"lemmas":["soon","after","the","fall","of","Baghdad","in","2003",",","a","young","and","charismatic","film","student",",","Muthana","Mohmed",",","stand","in","the","rubble","of","the","city","'s","film","school","and","explain","to","a","american","television","audience","that","he","dream","of","become","a","filmmaker","have","be","destroy","-","first","by","Saddam","Hussein",",","then","by","american","bomb",".","this","brief",",","fortuitous","appearance","on","MTV","change","Muthana","'s","life","forever",".","watch","in","the","United","States",",","actor/director","Liev","Schreiber","stop","channel","surfing",",","utterly","captivate",".","feel","guilty","about","a","war","he","oppose",",","Schreiber","decide","to","extend","to","the","unknown","iraqi","the","opportunity","of","a","lifetime","-","to","come","to","Prague","to","work","on","a","american","movie",",","Everything","be","Illuminated",".","on","set",",","frustrated","expectation","complicate","the","relationship","between","Muthana","and","he","american","benefactor","in","what","become","a","cross-cultural","endeavor","go","awry",".","Filmmaker","Nina","Davenport","become","increasingly","entangled","in","the","young","iraqi","'s","life","as","he","visa","be","about","to","expire","and","the","threat","of","return","to","Baghdad","loom",".","Operation","Filmmaker",",","reveal","on","several","level",",","address","the","power","dynamics","between","the","american","filmmaker","and","she","iraqi","subject",",","unfold","as","a","engaging","parable","about","the","U.S.","invasion","of","Iraq","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Soon after the","after the fall","the fall of","fall of Baghdad","of Baghdad in","Baghdad in 2003","in 2003 ,","2003 , a",", a young","a young and","young and charismatic","and charismatic film","charismatic film student","film student ,","student , Muthana",", Muthana Mohmed","Muthana Mohmed ,","Mohmed , stands",", stands in","stands in the","in the rubble","the rubble of","rubble of the","of the city","the city 's","city 's film","'s film school","film school and","school and explains","and explains to","explains to an","to an American","an American television","American television audience","television audience that","audience that his","that his dream","his dream of","dream of becoming","of becoming a","becoming a filmmaker","a filmmaker has","filmmaker has been","has been destroyed","been destroyed -","destroyed -

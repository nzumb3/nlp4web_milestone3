Graham Marshall thought submitting a 3 track demo to a record company was boring so he had an idea... A singer/songwriter from Linwood Scotland; Graham, along with his trusty companion armed with a camera, both set out to conquer the streets of the U.K in this mammouth musical adventure.

Graham set out to prove that the 'Talent Show' isn't the only way to go if you want to 'Make it'.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["You","can","onli","hear","'","No","'","so","mani","time","befor","you","do","someth","utter","absurd",".","Graham","Marshal","thought","submit","a","3","track","demo","to","a","record","compani","was","bore","so","he","had","an","idea","...","A","singer/songwrit","from","Linwood","Scotland",";","Graham",",","along","with","his","trusti","companion","arm","with","a","camera",",","both","set","out","to","conquer","the","street","of","the","U.K","in","this","mammouth","music","adventur",".","Film","over","a","period","of","7","day",",","Graham","busk","an","amaz","18","gig",",","cover","1500","mile","from","John","O'Groat","in","north","east","Scotland",",","to","Land","'s","End","in","Southwest","England",".","Graham","set","out","to","prove","that","the","'","Talent","Show","'","is","n't","the","onli","way","to","go","if","you","want","to","'","Make","it","'","."],"lemmas":["you","can","only","hear","'","no","'","so","many","time","before","you","do","something","utterly","absurd",".","Graham","Marshall","think","submit","a","3","track","demo","to","a","record","company","be","boring","so","he","have","a","idea","...","a","singer/songwriter","from","Linwood","Scotland",";","Graham",",","along","with","he","trusty","companion","arm","with","a","camera",",","both","set","out","to","conquer","the","street","of","the","U.K","in","this","mammouth","musical","adventure",".","film","over","a","period","of","7","day",",","Graham","busk","a","amazing","18","gig",",","cover","1500","mile","from","John","O'Groats","in","north","east","Scotland",",","to","Land","'s","End","in","Southwest","England",".","Graham","set","out","to","prove","that","the","'","Talent","Show","'","be","not","the","only","way","to","go","if","you","want","to","'","Make","it","'","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["You can only","can only hear","only hear '","hear ' No","' No '","No ' so","' so many","so many times","many times before","times before you","before you do","you do something","do something utterly","something utterly absurd","Graham Marshall thought","Marshall thought submitting","thought submitting a","submitting a 3","a 3 track","3 track demo","track demo to","demo to a","to a record","a record company","record company was","company was boring","was boring so","boring so he","so he had","he had an","had an idea","an idea ...","idea ...

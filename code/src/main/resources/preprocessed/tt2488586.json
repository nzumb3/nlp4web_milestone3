{"title":"Delicious","plot":"Recently released from prison, French chef Jacques pursues an obsession -- to leave his past behind and work for the great British chef Victor Ellwood. He knows Victor had an affair with his mother and may even be his dad. Working for iron-fisted Victor is back-breaking, but his existence is softened by the presence of a curious girl living in the downstairs flat. As he falls in love with her, he realises she not only has an aversion to restaurants, but food of all kinds. Is her eating disorder a force too resilient for anything, even love to cure?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Recent","releas","from","prison",",","French","chef","Jacqu","pursu","an","obsess","--","to","leav","his","past","behind","and","work","for","the","great","British","chef","Victor","Ellwood",".","He","know","Victor","had","an","affair","with","his","mother","and","may","even","be","his","dad",".","Work","for","iron-fist","Victor","is","back-break",",","but","his","exist","is","soften","by","the","presenc","of","a","curious","girl","live","in","the","downstair","flat",".","As","he","fall","in","love","with","her",",","he","realis","she","not","onli","has","an","avers","to","restaur",",","but","food","of","all","kind",".","Is","her","eat","disord","a","forc","too","resili","for","anyth",",","even","love","to","cure","?"],"lemmas":["recently","release","from","prison",",","french","chef","Jacques","pursue","a","obsession","--","to","leave","he","past","behind","and","work","for","the","great","british","chef","Victor","Ellwood",".","he","know","Victor","have","a","affair","with","he","mother","and","may","even","be","he","dad",".","work","for","iron-fisted","Victor","be","back-breaking",",","but","he","existence","be","soften","by","the","presence","of","a","curious","girl","live","in","the","downstairs","flat",".","as","he","fall","in","love","with","she",",","he","realise","she","not","only","have","a","aversion","to","restaurant",",","but","food","of","all","kind",".","be","she","eating","disorder","a","force","too","resilient","for","anything",",","even","love","to","cure","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Recently released from","released from prison","from prison ,","prison , French",", French chef","French chef Jacques","chef Jacques pursues","Jacques pursues an","pursues an obsession","an obsession --","obsession -- to","-- to leave","to leave his","leave his past","his past behind","past behind and","behind and work","and work for","work for the","for the great","the great British","great British chef","British chef Victor","chef Victor Ellwood","He knows Victor","knows Victor had","Victor had an","had an affair","an affair with","affair with his","with his mother","his mother and","mother and may","and may even","may even be","even be his","be his dad","Working for iron-fisted","for iron-fisted Victor","iron-fisted Victor is","Victor is back-breaking","is back-breaking ,","back-breaking , but",", but his","but his existence","his existence is","existence is softened","is softened by","softened by the","by the presence","the presence of","presence of a","of a curious","a curious girl","curious girl living","girl living in","living in the","in the downstairs","the downstairs flat","As he falls","he falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with her","with her ,","her , he",", he realises","he realises she","realises she not","she not only","not only has","only has an","has an aversion","an aversion to","aversion to restaurants","to restaurants ,","restaurants , but",", but food","but food of","food of all","of all kinds","Is her eating","her eating disorder","eating disorder a","disorder a force","a force too","force too resilient","too resilient for","resilient for anything","for anything ,","anything , even",", even love","even love to","love to cure"],"2grams":["Recently released","released from","from prison","prison ,",", French","French chef","chef Jacques","Jacques pursues","pursues an","an obsession","obsession --","-- to","to leave","leave his","his past","past behind","behind and","and work","work for","for the","the great","great British","British chef","chef Victor","Victor Ellwood","He knows","knows Victor","Victor had","had an","an affair","affair with","with his","his mother","mother and","and may","may even","even be","be his","his dad","Working for","for iron-fisted","iron-fisted Victor","Victor is","is back-breaking","back-breaking ,",", but","but his","his existence","existence is","is softened","softened by","by the","the presence","presence of","of a","a curious","curious girl","girl living","living in","in the","the downstairs","downstairs flat","As he","he falls","falls in","in love","love with","with her","her ,",", he","he realises","realises she","she not","not only","only has","has an","an aversion","aversion to","to restaurants","restaurants ,",", but","but food","food of","of all","all kinds","Is her","her eating","eating disorder","disorder a","a force","force too","too resilient","resilient for","for anything","anything ,",", even","even love","love to","to cure"]}

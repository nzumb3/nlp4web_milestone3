It recounts the long history of the dream of an isthmian canal, and tells how the collapse of an ambitious French canal effort, doomed by poor planning and rampant disease, provided an opening for a United States eager to announce its expanded presence on the world stage.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["This","film","chronicl","the","remark","stori","of","what","was","the","largest","and","most","ambiti","engin","project","in","histori",",","in","one","of","the","most","hostil","environ","on","earth",".","It","recount","the","long","histori","of","the","dream","of","an","isthmian","canal",",","and","tell","how","the","collaps","of","an","ambiti","French","canal","effort",",","doom","by","poor","plan","and","rampant","diseas",",","provid","an","open","for","a","Unite","State","eager","to","announc","it","expand","presenc","on","the","world","stage","."],"lemmas":["this","film","chronicle","the","remarkable","story","of","what","be","the","largest","and","most","ambitious","engineering","project","in","history",",","in","one","of","the","most","hostile","environment","on","earth",".","it","recount","the","long","history","of","the","dream","of","a","isthmian","canal",",","and","tell","how","the","collapse","of","a","ambitious","french","canal","effort",",","doom","by","poor","planning","and","rampant","disease",",","provide","a","opening","for","a","United","States","eager","to","announce","its","expanded","presence","on","the","world","stage","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["This film chronicles","film chronicles the","chronicles the remarkable","the remarkable story","remarkable story of","story of what","of what was","what was the","was the largest","the largest and","largest and most","and most ambitious","most ambitious engineering","ambitious engineering project","engineering project in","project in history","in history ,","history , in",", in one","in one of","one of the","of the most","the most hostile","most hostile environments","hostile environments on","environments on earth","It recounts the","recounts the long","the long history","long history of","history of the","of the dream","the dream of","dream of an","of an isthmian","an isthmian canal","isthmian canal ,","canal , and",", and tells","and tells how","tells how the","how the collapse","the collapse of","collapse of an","of an ambitious","an ambitious French","ambitious French canal","French canal effort","canal effort ,","effort , doomed",", doomed by","doomed by poor","by poor planning","poor planning and","planning and rampant","and rampant disease","rampant disease ,","disease , provided",", provided an","provided an opening","an opening for","opening for a","for a United","a United States","United States eager","States eager to","eager to announce","to announce its","announce its expanded","its expanded presence","expanded presence on","presence on the","on the world","the world stage"],"2grams":["This film","film chronicles","chronicles the","the remarkable","remarkable story","story of","of what","what was","was the","the largest","largest and","and most","most ambitious","ambitious engineering","engineering project","project in","in history","history ,",", in","in one","one of","of the","the most","most hostile","hostile environments","environments on","on earth","It recounts","recounts the","the long","long history","history of","of the","the dream","dream of","of an","an isthmian","isthmian canal","canal ,",", and","and tells","tells how","how the","the collapse","collapse of","of an","an ambitious","ambitious French","French canal","canal effort","effort ,",", doomed","doomed by","by poor","poor planning","planning and","and rampant","rampant disease","disease ,",", provided","provided an","an opening","opening for","for a","a United","United States","States eager","eager to","to announce","announce its","its expanded","expanded presence","presence on","on the","the world","world stage"]}

{"title":"100% Arabic","plot":"The movie takes place in a poverty-stricken, rent-controlled neighborhood on the outskirts of Paris. Algerian immigrants, many of whom are in France illegally, the place has earned the nickname of \"100%Arabica\". It's a rough neighborhood - crime is rampant, gangs of juvenile delinquents roam the streets, and the police are afraid to patrol the area. When the out-of-touch mayor decides that he wants to restore order to the area, he offers a subsidy to Slimane, the imam of the local mosque. If Slimane can get people off the streets, the mayor will continue the payments. Soon the byways of 100%Arabica are almost peaceful - but not because of something Slimane has done. The reason is that a new Rai Band, Rap Oriental, has taken the neighborhood by storm...","genres":["Comedy"," Music"],"stems":["The","movi","take","place","in","a","poverty-stricken",",","rent-control","neighborhood","on","the","outskirt","of","Pari",".","Algerian","immigr",",","mani","of","whom","are","in","Franc","illeg",",","the","place","has","earn","the","nicknam","of","\"","100","%","Arabica","\"",".","It","'s","a","rough","neighborhood","-","crime","is","rampant",",","gang","of","juvenil","delinqu","roam","the","street",",","and","the","polic","are","afraid","to","patrol","the","area",".","When","the","out-of-touch","mayor","decid","that","he","want","to","restor","order","to","the","area",",","he","offer","a","subsidi","to","Sliman",",","the","imam","of","the","local","mosqu",".","If","Sliman","can","get","peopl","off","the","street",",","the","mayor","will","continu","the","payment",".","Soon","the","byway","of","100","%","Arabica","are","almost","peac","-","but","not","becaus","of","someth","Sliman","has","done",".","The","reason","is","that","a","new","Rai","Band",",","Rap","Oriental",",","has","taken","the","neighborhood","by","storm","..."],"lemmas":["the","movie","take","place","in","a","poverty-stricken",",","rent-controlled","neighborhood","on","the","outskirts","of","Paris",".","Algerian","immigrant",",","many","of","whom","be","in","France","illegally",",","the","place","have","earn","the","nickname","of","``","100","%","arabica","''",".","it","be","a","rough","neighborhood","-","crime","be","rampant",",","gang","of","juvenile","delinquent","roam","the","street",",","and","the","police","be","afraid","to","patrol","the","area",".","when","the","out-of-touch","mayor","decide","that","he","want","to","restore","order","to","the","area",",","he","offer","a","subsidy","to","Slimane",",","the","imam","of","the","local","mosque",".","if","Slimane","can","get","people","off","the","street",",","the","mayor","will","continue","the","payment",".","soon","the","byway","of","100","%","arabica","be","almost","peaceful","-","but","not","because","of","something","Slimane","have","do",".","the","reason","be","that","a","new","Rai","Band",",","rap","oriental",",","have","take","the","neighborhood","by","storm","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The movie takes","movie takes place","takes place in","place in a","in a poverty-stricken","a poverty-stricken ,","poverty-stricken , rent-controlled",", rent-controlled neighborhood","rent-controlled neighborhood on","neighborhood on the","on the outskirts","the outskirts of","outskirts of Paris","Algerian immigrants ,","immigrants , many",", many of","many of whom","of whom are","whom are in","are in France","in France illegally","France illegally ,","illegally , the",", the place","the place has","place has earned","has earned the","earned the nickname","the nickname of","nickname of \"","of \" 100","\" 100 %","100 % Arabica","% Arabica \"","It 's a","'s a rough","a rough neighborhood","rough neighborhood -","neighborhood -

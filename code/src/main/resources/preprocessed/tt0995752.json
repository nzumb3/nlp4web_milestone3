{"title":"Tashan","plot":"What happens when you throw two guys who hate each other together. A cool call center executive Jimmy Cliff (Saif Ali Khan), a desi wannabe gangster Bachchan Pande (Akshay Kumar) add for good measure a beautiful girl Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) who cant be trusted - on a journey across spectacular India - a journey which will alter the course of their lives in more ways than one - a journey where even enemies need to trust each other if they want to stay alive. Trouble is, in this world no one can be trusted ever. And to top it all there is the evil eye of Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor - Slumdog Millionaire and 24), maverick gangster who enjoys killing people as much as he enjoys learning to speak English.","genres":["Action"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["What","happen","when","you","throw","two","guy","who","hate","each","other","togeth",".","A","cool","call","center","execut","Jimmi","Cliff","(","Saif","Ali","Khan",")",",","a","desi","wannab","gangster","Bachchan","Pand","(","Akshay","Kumar",")","add","for","good","measur","a","beauti","girl","Pooja","(","Kareena","Kapoor",")","who","cant","be","trust","-","on","a","journey","across","spectacular","India","-","a","journey","which","will","alter","the","cours","of","their","live","in","more","way","than","one","-","a","journey","where","even","enemi","need","to","trust","each","other","if","they","want","to","stay","aliv",".","Troubl","is",",","in","this","world","no","one","can","be","trust","ever",".","And","to","top","it","all","there","is","the","evil","eye","of","Bhaiyyaji","(","Anil","Kapoor","-","Slumdog","Millionair","and","24",")",",","maverick","gangster","who","enjoy","kill","peopl","as","much","as","he","enjoy","learn","to","speak","English","."],"lemmas":["what","happen","when","you","throw","two","guy","who","hate","each","other","together",".","a","cool","call","center","executive","Jimmy","Cliff","-lrb-","Saif","Ali","Khan","-rrb-",",","a","desi","wannabe","gangster","Bachchan","Pande","-lrb-","Akshay","Kumar","-rrb-","add","for","good","measure","a","beautiful","girl","Pooja","-lrb-","Kareena","Kapoor","-rrb-","who","cant","be","trust","-","on","a","journey","across","spectacular","India","-","a","journey","which","will","alter","the","course","of","they","life","in","more","way","than","one","-","a","journey","where","even","enemy","need","to","trust","each","other","if","they","want","to","stay","alive",".","trouble","be",",","in","this","world","no","one","can","be","trust","ever",".","and","to","top","it","all","there","be","the","evil","eye","of","Bhaiyyaji","-lrb-","Anil","Kapoor","-","Slumdog","Millionaire","and","24","-rrb-",",","maverick","gangster","who","enjoy","kill","people","as","much","as","he","enjoy","learn","to","speak","English","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["What happens when","happens when you","when you throw","you throw two","throw two guys","two guys who","guys who hate","who hate each","hate each other","each other together","A cool call","cool call center","call center executive","center executive Jimmy","executive Jimmy Cliff","Jimmy Cliff (","Cliff ( Saif","( Saif Ali","Saif Ali Khan","Ali Khan )","Khan ) ,",") , a",", a desi","a desi wannabe","desi wannabe gangster","wannabe gangster Bachchan","gangster Bachchan Pande","Bachchan Pande (","Pande ( Akshay","( Akshay Kumar","Akshay Kumar )","Kumar ) add",") add for","add for good","for good measure","good measure a","measure a beautiful","a beautiful girl","beautiful girl Pooja","girl Pooja (","Pooja ( Kareena","( Kareena Kapoor","Kareena Kapoor )","Kapoor ) who",") who cant","who cant be","cant be trusted","be trusted -","trusted -

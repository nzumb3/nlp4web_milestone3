{"title":"Stonewalk","plot":"Stonewalk is the story of a two-thousand-pound stone, a 500-mile journey, and a man committed to ending war. Overwhelmed by worldwide images of civilian massacre, Lewis Randa commissioned a granite memorial inscribed with the words \"Unknown Civilians Killed in War.\" He traveled the eastern seaboard waging peace while enlisting community members to join his efforts. Stonewalk presents the organization, physical endurance, and sense of humor needed to pull a stone monument along the country roads and city highways of the USA. The film explores the motivations that spur grassroots performance and captures the emotions of translating beliefs into actions. Producer and actor, Jimmy Tingle says, \"Lewis is the only man crazy enough to pull a two-thousand pound stone 500 miles and then make you regret that you weren't part of the journey.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Stonewalk","is","the","stori","of","a","two-thousand-pound","stone",",","a","500-mile","journey",",","and","a","man","commit","to","end","war",".","Overwhelm","by","worldwid","imag","of","civilian","massacr",",","Lewi","Randa","commiss","a","granit","memori","inscrib","with","the","word","\"","Unknown","Civilian","Kill","in","War",".","\"","He","travel","the","eastern","seaboard","wage","peac","while","enlist","communiti","member","to","join","his","effort",".","Stonewalk","present","the","organ",",","physic","endur",",","and","sens","of","humor","need","to","pull","a","stone","monument","along","the","countri","road","and","citi","highway","of","the","USA",".","The","film","explor","the","motiv","that","spur","grassroot","perform","and","captur","the","emot","of","translat","belief","into","action",".","Produc","and","actor",",","Jimmi","Tingl","say",",","\"","Lewi","is","the","onli","man","crazi","enough","to","pull","a","two-thousand","pound","stone","500","mile","and","then","make","you","regret","that","you","were","n't","part","of","the","journey",".","\""],"lemmas":["Stonewalk","be","the","story","of","a","two-thousand-pound","stone",",","a","500-mile","journey",",","and","a","man","commit","to","end","war",".","overwhelm","by","worldwide","image","of","civilian","massacre",",","Lewis","Randa","commission","a","granite","memorial","inscribe","with","the","word","``","unknown","civilian","kill","in","War",".","''","he","travel","the","eastern","seaboard","wage","peace","while","enlist","community","member","to","join","he","effort",".","Stonewalk","present","the","organization",",","physical","endurance",",","and","sense","of","humor","need","to","pull","a","stone","monument","along","the","country","road","and","city","highway","of","the","usa",".","the","film","explore","the","motivation","that","spur","grassroot","performance","and","capture","the","emotion","of","translate","belief","into","action",".","producer","and","actor",",","Jimmy","Tingle","say",",","``","Lewis","be","the","only","man","crazy","enough","to","pull","a","two-thousand","pound","stone","500","mile","and","then","make","you","regret","that","you","be","not","part","of","the","journey",".","''"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Stonewalk

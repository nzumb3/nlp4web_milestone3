{"title":"L.A., I Hate You","plot":"Inspired by true events, L.A., I HATE YOU intertwines three tales of sex, violence, redemption, murder and unthinkable twists all taking place in the City of Angels; Los Angeles. When a desperate husband suddenly regrets the hit he has ordered on his handicapped wife, he frantically attempts to stop the murder. However, this sets in a motion a series of events far greater than he can control for the lives of some seemingly unconnected people, including an action star wannabe, a frustrated family man, and a guilt-ridden boyfriend. Starring Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, Halloween), William Forsythe (The Devil's Rejects) and Dedee Pfeiffer (Vamp), L.A., I HATE YOU will lead you on a wild and steamy ride through the seedy and visceral streets of LA, where broken dreams are the daily reality...","genres":["Crime"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["Inspire","by","true","event",",","L.A.",",","I","HATE","YOU","intertwin","three","tale","of","sex",",","violenc",",","redempt",",","murder","and","unthink","twist","all","take","place","in","the","Citi","of","Angel",";","Los","Angele",".","When","a","desper","husband","sudden","regret","the","hit","he","has","order","on","his","handicap","wife",",","he","frantic","attempt","to","stop","the","murder",".","Howev",",","this","set","in","a","motion","a","seri","of","event","far","greater","than","he","can","control","for","the","live","of","some","seem","unconnect","peopl",",","includ","an","action","star","wannab",",","a","frustrat","famili","man",",","and","a","guilt-ridden","boyfriend",".","Star","Malcolm","McDowel","(","A","Clockwork","Orang",",","Halloween",")",",","William","Forsyth","(","The","Devil","'s","Reject",")","and","Dede","Pfeiffer","(","Vamp",")",",","L.A.",",","I","HATE","YOU","will","lead","you","on","a","wild","and","steami","ride","through","the","seedi","and","viscer","street","of","LA",",","where","broken","dream","are","the","daili","realiti","..."],"lemmas":["inspire","by","true","event",",","L.A.",",","I","hate","you","intertwine","three","tale","of","sex",",","violence",",","redemption",",","murder","and","unthinkable","twist","all","take","place","in","the","City","of","Angels",";","Los","Angeles",".","when","a","desperate","husband","suddenly","regret","the","hit","he","have","order","on","he","handicapped","wife",",","he","frantically","attempt","to","stop","the","murder",".","however",",","this","set","in","a","motion","a","series","of","event","far","greater","than","he","can","control","for","the","life","of","some","seemingly","unconnected","people",",","include","a","action","star","wannabe",",","a","frustrated","family","man",",","and","a","guilt-ridden","boyfriend",".","star","Malcolm","McDowell","-lrb-","A","Clockwork","Orange",",","Halloween","-rrb-",",","William","Forsythe","-lrb-","The","Devil","'s","reject","-rrb-","and","Dedee","Pfeiffer","-lrb-","Vamp","-rrb-",",","L.A.",",","I","hate","you","will","lead","you","on","a","wild","and","steamy","ride","through","the","seedy","and","visceral","street","of","LA",",","where","broken","dream","be","the","daily","reality","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Inspired by true","by true events","true events ,","events , L.A.",", L.A. ,","L.A. , I",", I HATE","I HATE YOU","HATE YOU intertwines","YOU intertwines three","intertwines three tales","three tales of","tales of sex","of sex ,","sex , violence",", violence ,","violence , redemption",", redemption ,","redemption , murder",", murder and","murder and unthinkable","and unthinkable twists","unthinkable twists all","twists all taking","all taking place","taking place in","place in the","in the City","the City of","City of Angels","of Angels ;","Angels ;

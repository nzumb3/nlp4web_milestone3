{"title":"Just Like Brothers","plot":"Since Charlie is no longer there, the lives of Boris, Elie, and Maxime have been torn apart. These three men, who have nothing in common, all shared one thing: their love for Charlie. One loved her like a sister, one loved her like the woman of his dreams, one loved her like a friend. Except that Charlie is dead and none of them - not Boris, an accomplished businessman, not Elie, a night owl scriptwriter, and not Maxime, still living at home with his mother - know how to deal with it. But because she asked them to do so, they abruptly decide to undertake a journey together, heading for Corsica and the house that Charlie loved so much. Except that here they are stuck in a car together for over 500 miles. It's going to be a long journey. Boris, Elie and Maxime, three men, three generations, no affinity. But by the time they arrive at their destination, they will have realized one majorly important thing: Charlie has changed their lives forever.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Sinc","Charli","is","no","longer","there",",","the","live","of","Bori",",","Elie",",","and","Maxim","have","been","torn","apart",".","These","three","men",",","who","have","noth","in","common",",","all","share","one","thing",":","their","love","for","Charli",".","One","love","her","like","a","sister",",","one","love","her","like","the","woman","of","his","dream",",","one","love","her","like","a","friend",".","Except","that","Charli","is","dead","and","none","of","them","-","not","Bori",",","an","accomplish","businessman",",","not","Elie",",","a","night","owl","scriptwrit",",","and","not","Maxim",",","still","live","at","home","with","his","mother","-","know","how","to","deal","with","it",".","But","becaus","she","ask","them","to","do","so",",","they","abrupt","decid","to","undertak","a","journey","togeth",",","head","for","Corsica","and","the","hous","that","Charli","love","so","much",".","Except","that","here","they","are","stuck","in","a","car","togeth","for","over","500","mile",".","It","'s","go","to","be","a","long","journey",".","Bori",",","Elie","and","Maxim",",","three","men",",","three","generat",",","no","affin",".","But","by","the","time","they","arriv","at","their","destin",",","they","will","have","realiz","one","major","import","thing",":","Charli","has","chang","their","live","forev","."],"lemmas":["since","Charlie","be","no","longer","there",",","the","life","of","Boris",",","Elie",",","and","Maxime","have","be","tear","apart",".","these","three","man",",","who","have","nothing","in","common",",","all","share","one","thing",":","they","love","for","Charlie",".","one","love","she","like","a","sister",",","one","love","she","like","the","woman","of","he","dream",",","one","love","she","like","a","friend",".","except","that","Charlie","be","dead","and","none","of","they","-","not","Boris",",","a","accomplished","businessman",",","not","Elie",",","a","night","owl","scriptwriter",",","and","not","Maxime",",","still","live","at","home","with","he","mother","-","know","how","to","deal","with","it",".","but","because","she","ask","they","to","do","so",",","they","abruptly","decide","to","undertake","a","journey","together",",","head","for","Corsica","and","the","house","that","Charlie","love","so","much",".","except","that","here","they","be","stick","in","a","car","together","for","over","500","mile",".","it","be","go","to","be","a","long","journey",".","Boris",",","Elie","and","Maxime",",","three","man",",","three","generation",",","no","affinity",".","but","by","the","time","they","arrive","at","they","destination",",","they","will","have","realize","one","majorly","important","thing",":","Charlie","have","change","they","life","forever","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Since Charlie is","Charlie is no","is no longer","no longer there","longer there ,","there , the",", the lives","the lives of","lives of Boris","of Boris ,","Boris , Elie",", Elie ,","Elie , and",", and Maxime","and Maxime have","Maxime have been","have been torn","been torn apart","These three men","three men ,","men , who",", who have","who have nothing","have nothing in","nothing in common","in common ,","common , all",", all shared","all shared one","shared one thing","one thing :","thing : their",": their love","their love for","love for Charlie","One loved her","loved her like","her like a","like a sister","a sister ,","sister , one",", one loved","one loved her","loved her like","her like the","like the woman","the woman of","woman of his","of his dreams","his dreams ,","dreams , one",", one loved","one loved her","loved her like","her like a","like a friend","Except that Charlie","that Charlie is","Charlie is dead","is dead and","dead and none","and none of","none of them","of them -","them -

{"title":"Mystery Play","plot":"Sadie and Jude arrive independently at a house in Hampstead, London, both to meet a man called Shelby, who has promised to help them. Sadie believes him to be a therapist, who can help her summon the courage to leave her abusive boyfriend, while Jude believes him to be a financial adviser who might just be able to lend him the money he so desperately owes his landlord. The truth gradually starts to emerge about the mysterious Mr Shelby, who is neither counsellor nor financial adviser, but something more... much more.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Sadi","and","Jude","arriv","independ","at","a","hous","in","Hampstead",",","London",",","both","to","meet","a","man","call","Shelbi",",","who","has","promis","to","help","them",".","Sadi","believ","him","to","be","a","therapist",",","who","can","help","her","summon","the","courag","to","leav","her","abus","boyfriend",",","while","Jude","believ","him","to","be","a","financi","advis","who","might","just","be","abl","to","lend","him","the","money","he","so","desper","owe","his","landlord",".","The","truth","gradual","start","to","emerg","about","the","mysteri","Mr","Shelbi",",","who","is","neither","counsellor","nor","financi","advis",",","but","someth","more","...","much","more","."],"lemmas":["Sadie","and","Jude","arrive","independently","at","a","house","in","Hampstead",",","London",",","both","to","meet","a","man","call","Shelby",",","who","have","promise","to","help","they",".","Sadie","believe","he","to","be","a","therapist",",","who","can","help","she","summon","the","courage","to","leave","she","abusive","boyfriend",",","while","Jude","believe","he","to","be","a","financial","adviser","who","might","just","be","able","to","lend","he","the","money","he","so","desperately","owe","he","landlord",".","the","truth","gradually","start","to","emerge","about","the","mysterious","Mr","Shelby",",","who","be","neither","counsellor","nor","financial","adviser",",","but","something","more","...","much","more","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sadie and Jude","and Jude arrive","Jude arrive independently","arrive independently at","independently at a","at a house","a house in","house in Hampstead","in Hampstead ,","Hampstead , London",", London ,","London , both",", both to","both to meet","to meet a","meet a man","a man called","man called Shelby","called Shelby ,","Shelby , who",", who has","who has promised","has promised to","promised to help","to help them","Sadie believes him","believes him to","him to be","to be a","be a therapist","a therapist ,","therapist , who",", who can","who can help","can help her","help her summon","her summon the","summon the courage","the courage to","courage to leave","to leave her","leave her abusive","her abusive boyfriend","abusive boyfriend ,","boyfriend , while",", while Jude","while Jude believes","Jude believes him","believes him to","him to be","to be a","be a financial","a financial adviser","financial adviser who","adviser who might","who might just","might just be","just be able","be able to","able to lend","to lend him","lend him the","him the money","the money he","money he so","he so desperately","so desperately owes","desperately owes his","owes his landlord","The truth gradually","truth gradually starts","gradually starts to","starts to emerge","to emerge about","emerge about the","about the mysterious","the mysterious Mr","mysterious Mr Shelby","Mr Shelby ,","Shelby , who",", who is","who is neither","is neither counsellor","neither counsellor nor","counsellor nor financial","nor financial adviser","financial adviser ,","adviser , but",", but something","but something more","something more ...","more ... much","... much more"],"2grams":["Sadie and","and Jude","Jude arrive","arrive independently","independently at","at a","a house","house in","in Hampstead","Hampstead ,",", London","London ,",", both","both to","to meet","meet a","a man","man called","called Shelby","Shelby ,",", who","who has","has promised","promised to","to help","help them","Sadie believes","believes him","him to","to be","be a","a therapist","therapist ,",", who","who can","can help","help her","her summon","summon the","the courage","courage to","to leave","leave her","her abusive","abusive boyfriend","boyfriend ,",", while","while Jude","Jude believes","believes him","him to","to be","be a","a financial","financial adviser","adviser who","who might","might just","just be","be able","able to","to lend","lend him","him the","the money","money he","he so","so desperately","desperately owes","owes his","his landlord","The truth","truth gradually","gradually starts","starts to","to emerge","emerge about","about the","the mysterious","mysterious Mr","Mr Shelby","Shelby ,",", who","who is","is neither","neither counsellor","counsellor nor","nor financial","financial adviser","adviser ,",", but","but something","something more","more ...","... much","much more"]}

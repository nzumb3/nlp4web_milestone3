{"title":"6 Bullets","plot":"Veteran mercenary Samson Gaul (Jean-Claude Van Damme) knows that in the heat of battle, every bullet counts. He retired from combat when his actions resulted in the deaths of helpless victims, but now he's the last hope for a desperate father. Mixed Martial Artist, Andrew Fayden (Joe Flanigan, Stargate: Atlantis) knows how to fight, but alone he's unprepared to navigate the corrupt streets of a foreign city to find his kidnapped daughter. Together, these warriors will stop at nothing to tear apart a vile network of criminals that prey upon the innocent.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Veteran","mercenari","Samson","Gaul","(","Jean-Claud","Van","Damm",")","know","that","in","the","heat","of","battl",",","everi","bullet","count",".","He","retir","from","combat","when","his","action","result","in","the","death","of","helpless","victim",",","but","now","he","'s","the","last","hope","for","a","desper","father",".","Mix","Martial","Artist",",","Andrew","Fayden","(","Joe","Flanigan",",","Stargat",":","Atlanti",")","know","how","to","fight",",","but","alon","he","'s","unprepar","to","navig","the","corrupt","street","of","a","foreign","citi","to","find","his","kidnap","daughter",".","Togeth",",","these","warrior","will","stop","at","noth","to","tear","apart","a","vile","network","of","crimin","that","prey","upon","the","innoc","."],"lemmas":["veteran","mercenary","Samson","Gaul","-lrb-","Jean-Claude","Van","Damme","-rrb-","know","that","in","the","heat","of","battle",",","every","bullet","count",".","he","retire","from","combat","when","he","action","result","in","the","death","of","helpless","victim",",","but","now","he","be","the","last","hope","for","a","desperate","father",".","Mixed","Martial","Artist",",","Andrew","Fayden","-lrb-","Joe","Flanigan",",","Stargate",":","Atlantis","-rrb-","know","how","to","fight",",","but","alone","he","be","unprepared","to","navigate","the","corrupt","street","of","a","foreign","city","to","find","he","kidnap","daughter",".","together",",","these","warrior","will","stop","at","nothing","to","tear","apart","a","vile","network","of","criminal","that","prey","upon","the","innocent","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Veteran mercenary Samson","mercenary Samson Gaul","Samson Gaul (","Gaul ( Jean-Claude","( Jean-Claude Van","Jean-Claude Van Damme","Van Damme )","Damme ) knows",") knows that","knows that in","that in the","in the heat","the heat of","heat of battle","of battle ,","battle , every",", every bullet","every bullet counts","He retired from","retired from combat","from combat when","combat when his","when his actions","his actions resulted","actions resulted in","resulted in the","in the deaths","the deaths of","deaths of helpless","of helpless victims","helpless victims ,","victims , but",", but now","but now he","now he 's","he 's the","'s the last","the last hope","last hope for","hope for a","for a desperate","a desperate father","Mixed Martial Artist","Martial Artist ,","Artist , Andrew",", Andrew Fayden","Andrew Fayden (","Fayden ( Joe","( Joe Flanigan","Joe Flanigan ,","Flanigan , Stargate",", Stargate :","Stargate : Atlantis",": Atlantis )","Atlantis ) knows",") knows how","knows how to","how to fight","to fight ,","fight , but",", but alone","but alone he","alone he 's","he 's unprepared","'s unprepared to","unprepared to navigate","to navigate the","navigate the corrupt","the corrupt streets","corrupt streets of","streets of a","of a foreign","a foreign city","foreign city to","city to find","to find his","find his kidnapped","his kidnapped daughter","Together , these",", these warriors","these warriors will","warriors will stop","will stop at","stop at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to tear","to tear apart","tear apart a","apart a vile","a vile network","vile network of","network of criminals","of criminals that","criminals that prey","that prey upon","prey upon the","upon the innocent"],"2grams":["Veteran mercenary","mercenary Samson","Samson Gaul","Gaul (","( Jean-Claude","Jean-Claude Van","Van Damme","Damme )",") knows","knows that","that in","in the","the heat","heat of","of battle","battle ,",", every","every bullet","bullet counts","He retired","retired from","from combat","combat when","when his","his actions","actions resulted","resulted in","in the","the deaths","deaths of","of helpless","helpless victims","victims ,",", but","but now","now he","he 's","'s the","the last","last hope","hope for","for a","a desperate","desperate father","Mixed Martial","Martial Artist","Artist ,",", Andrew","Andrew Fayden","Fayden (","( Joe","Joe Flanigan","Flanigan ,",", Stargate","Stargate :",": Atlantis","Atlantis )",") knows","knows how","how to","to fight","fight ,",", but","but alone","alone he","he 's","'s unprepared","unprepared to","to navigate","navigate the","the corrupt","corrupt streets","streets of","of a","a foreign","foreign city","city to","to find","find his","his kidnapped","kidnapped daughter","Together ,",", these","these warriors","warriors will","will stop","stop at","at nothing","nothing to","to tear","tear apart","apart a","a vile","vile network","network of","of criminals","criminals that","that prey","prey upon","upon the","the innocent"]}

{"title":"Some Body","plot":"Samantha is a schoolteacher lost in the netherworld of her late 20's - no longer young but not yet middle aged. She leaves her long-time boyfriend, who she's been living with in a \"brother and sister\" relationship for quite some time. Wanting change and searching for an elusive happiness, Samantha strikes out on her own. But she quickly finds the regeneration she seeks can be far from romantic. From the classrooms filled with smiling children, to the crowded bars of Los Angeles, Samantha goes looking for life; its fun, its love, its passion, and its meaning. This is a film about what she found.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Samantha","is","a","schoolteach","lost","in","the","netherworld","of","her","late","20","'s","-","no","longer","young","but","not","yet","middl","age",".","She","leav","her","long-tim","boyfriend",",","who","she","'s","been","live","with","in","a","\"","brother","and","sister","\"","relationship","for","quit","some","time",".","Want","chang","and","search","for","an","elus","happi",",","Samantha","strike","out","on","her","own",".","But","she","quick","find","the","regener","she","seek","can","be","far","from","romant",".","From","the","classroom","fill","with","smile","children",",","to","the","crowd","bar","of","Los","Angele",",","Samantha","goe","look","for","life",";","it","fun",",","it","love",",","it","passion",",","and","it","mean",".","This","is","a","film","about","what","she","found","."],"lemmas":["Samantha","be","a","schoolteacher","lose","in","the","netherworld","of","she","late","20","'s","-","no","longer","young","but","not","yet","middle","aged",".","she","leave","she","long-time","boyfriend",",","who","she","be","be","live","with","in","a","``","brother","and","sister","''","relationship","for","quite","some","time",".","want","change","and","search","for","a","elusive","happiness",",","Samantha","strike","out","on","she","own",".","but","she","quickly","find","the","regeneration","she","seek","can","be","far","from","romantic",".","from","the","classroom","fill","with","smile","child",",","to","the","crowded","bar","of","Los","Angeles",",","Samantha","go","look","for","life",";","its","fun",",","its","love",",","its","passion",",","and","its","meaning",".","this","be","a","film","about","what","she","find","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Samantha is a","is a schoolteacher","a schoolteacher lost","schoolteacher lost in","lost in the","in the netherworld","the netherworld of","netherworld of her","of her late","her late 20","late 20 's","20 's -","'s - no","- no longer","no longer young","longer young but","young but not","but not yet","not yet middle","yet middle aged","She leaves her","leaves her long-time","her long-time boyfriend","long-time boyfriend ,","boyfriend , who",", who she","who she 's","she 's been","'s been living","been living with","living with in","with in a","in a \"","a \" brother","\" brother and","brother and sister","and sister \"","sister \" relationship","\" relationship for","relationship for quite","for quite some","quite some time","Wanting change and","change and searching","and searching for","searching for an","for an elusive","an elusive happiness","elusive happiness ,","happiness , Samantha",", Samantha strikes","Samantha strikes out","strikes out on","out on her","on her own","But she quickly","she quickly finds","quickly finds the","finds the regeneration","the regeneration she","regeneration she seeks","she seeks can","seeks can be","can be far","be far from","far from romantic","From the classrooms","the classrooms filled","classrooms filled with","filled with smiling","with smiling children","smiling children ,","children , to",", to the","to the crowded","the crowded bars","crowded bars of","bars of Los","of Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , Samantha",", Samantha goes","Samantha goes looking","goes looking for","looking for life","for life ;","life ;

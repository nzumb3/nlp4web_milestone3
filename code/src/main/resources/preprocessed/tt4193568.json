{"title":"America Will Never Forget Their Sacrifices","plot":"The film was inspired by the 'Honor Flight' program of taking veterans to see their memorials. Many are to frail to make the physical journey. Our objective was to capture the essence of the experience for veterans so that they could witness the gratitude of the nation. The film is to be reproduced on DVD and on line and presented for no charge to those who would help us ensure as many veterans as possible see it. All work on the film was done pro bono. The entire production staff are veterans.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["The","film","was","inspir","by","the","'","Honor","Flight","'","program","of","take","veteran","to","see","their","memori",".","Mani","are","to","frail","to","make","the","physic","journey",".","Our","object","was","to","captur","the","essenc","of","the","experi","for","veteran","so","that","they","could","wit","the","gratitud","of","the","nation",".","The","film","is","to","be","reproduc","on","DVD","and","on","line","and","present","for","no","charg","to","those","who","would","help","us","ensur","as","mani","veteran","as","possibl","see","it",".","All","work","on","the","film","was","done","pro","bono",".","The","entir","product","staff","are","veteran","."],"lemmas":["the","film","be","inspire","by","the","'","honor","Flight","'","program","of","take","veteran","to","see","they","memorial",".","many","be","to","frail","to","make","the","physical","journey",".","we","objective","be","to","capture","the","essence","of","the","experience","for","veteran","so","that","they","could","witness","the","gratitude","of","the","nation",".","the","film","be","to","be","reproduce","on","dvd","and","on","line","and","present","for","no","charge","to","those","who","would","help","we","ensure","as","many","veteran","as","possible","see","it",".","all","work","on","the","film","be","do","pro","bono",".","the","entire","production","staff","be","veteran","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The film was","film was inspired","was inspired by","inspired by the","by the '","the ' Honor","' Honor Flight","Honor Flight '","Flight ' program","' program of","program of taking","of taking veterans","taking veterans to","veterans to see","to see their","see their memorials","Many are to","are to frail","to frail to","frail to make","to make the","make the physical","the physical journey","Our objective was","objective was to","was to capture","to capture the","capture the essence","the essence of","essence of the","of the experience","the experience for","experience for veterans","for veterans so","veterans so that","so that they","that they could","they could witness","could witness the","witness the gratitude","the gratitude of","gratitude of the","of the nation","The film is","film is to","is to be","to be reproduced","be reproduced on","reproduced on DVD","on DVD and","DVD and on","and on line","on line and","line and presented","and presented for","presented for no","for no charge","no charge to","charge to those","to those who","those who would","who would help","would help us","help us ensure","us ensure as","ensure as many","as many veterans","many veterans as","veterans as possible","as possible see","possible see it","All work on","work on the","on the film","the film was","film was done","was done pro","done pro bono","The entire production","entire production staff","production staff are","staff are veterans"],"2grams":["The film","film was","was inspired","inspired by","by the","the '","' Honor","Honor Flight","Flight '","' program","program of","of taking","taking veterans","veterans to","to see","see their","their memorials","Many are","are to","to frail","frail to","to make","make the","the physical","physical journey","Our objective","objective was","was to","to capture","capture the","the essence","essence of","of the","the experience","experience for","for veterans","veterans so","so that","that they","they could","could witness","witness the","the gratitude","gratitude of","of the","the nation","The film","film is","is to","to be","be reproduced","reproduced on","on DVD","DVD and","and on","on line","line and","and presented","presented for","for no","no charge","charge to","to those","those who","who would","would help","help us","us ensure","ensure as","as many","many veterans","veterans as","as possible","possible see","see it","All work","work on","on the","the film","film was","was done","done pro","pro bono","The entire","entire production","production staff","staff are","are veterans"]}

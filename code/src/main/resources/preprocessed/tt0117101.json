{"title":"My Entire Life","plot":"All Wally Mellish, an ex-convict in 1960s Australia, wants to do is live a quiet life with his girlfriend Beryl. Unfortunately when two police officers come around to disturb this, a misunderstanding quickly becomes out of control, resulting Wally, Beryl and her child being trapped in their house, surrounded by armed police under the impression that Wally is holding everyone hostage. Events quickly spiral into a media circus as, through the siege, Wally - inadvertently - manages to become a symbol for the anti-war movement.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["All","Walli","Mellish",",","an","ex-convict","in","1960s","Australia",",","want","to","do","is","live","a","quiet","life","with","his","girlfriend","Beryl",".","Unfortun","when","two","polic","offic","come","around","to","disturb","this",",","a","misunderstand","quick","becom","out","of","control",",","result","Walli",",","Beryl","and","her","child","be","trap","in","their","hous",",","surround","by","arm","polic","under","the","impress","that","Walli","is","hold","everyon","hostag",".","Event","quick","spiral","into","a","media","circus","as",",","through","the","sieg",",","Walli","-","inadvert","-","manag","to","becom","a","symbol","for","the","anti-war","movement","."],"lemmas":["all","Wally","Mellish",",","a","ex-convict","in","1960s","Australia",",","want","to","do","be","live","a","quiet","life","with","he","girlfriend","Beryl",".","unfortunately","when","two","police","officer","come","around","to","disturb","this",",","a","misunderstanding","quickly","become","out","of","control",",","result","Wally",",","Beryl","and","she","child","be","trap","in","they","house",",","surround","by","armed","police","under","the","impression","that","Wally","be","hold","everyone","hostage",".","event","quickly","spiral","into","a","media","circus","as",",","through","the","siege",",","Wally","-","inadvertently","-","manage","to","become","a","symbol","for","the","anti-war","movement","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["All Wally Mellish","Wally Mellish ,","Mellish , an",", an ex-convict","an ex-convict in","ex-convict in 1960s","in 1960s Australia","1960s Australia ,","Australia , wants",", wants to","wants to do","to do is","do is live","is live a","live a quiet","a quiet life","quiet life with","life with his","with his girlfriend","his girlfriend Beryl","Unfortunately when two","when two police","two police officers","police officers come","officers come around","come around to","around to disturb","to disturb this","disturb this ,","this , a",", a misunderstanding","a misunderstanding quickly","misunderstanding quickly becomes","quickly becomes out","becomes out of","out of control","of control ,","control , resulting",", resulting Wally","resulting Wally ,","Wally , Beryl",", Beryl and","Beryl and her","and her child","her child being","child being trapped","being trapped in","trapped in their","in their house","their house ,","house , surrounded",", surrounded by","surrounded by armed","by armed police","armed police under","police under the","under the impression","the impression that","impression that Wally","that Wally is","Wally is holding","is holding everyone","holding everyone hostage","Events quickly spiral","quickly spiral into","spiral into a","into a media","a media circus","media circus as","circus as ,","as , through",", through the","through the siege","the siege ,","siege , Wally",", Wally -","Wally - inadvertently","- inadvertently -","inadvertently - manages","- manages to","manages to become","to become a","become a symbol","a symbol for","symbol for the","for the anti-war","the anti-war movement"],"2grams":["All Wally","Wally Mellish","Mellish ,",", an","an ex-convict","ex-convict in","in 1960s","1960s Australia","Australia ,",", wants","wants to","to do","do is","is live","live a","a quiet","quiet life","life with","with his","his girlfriend","girlfriend Beryl","Unfortunately when","when two","two police","police officers","officers come","come around","around to","to disturb","disturb this","this ,",", a","a misunderstanding","misunderstanding quickly","quickly becomes","becomes out","out of","of control","control ,",", resulting","resulting Wally","Wally ,",", Beryl","Beryl and","and her","her child","child being","being trapped","trapped in","in their","their house","house ,",", surrounded","surrounded by","by armed","armed police","police under","under the","the impression","impression that","that Wally","Wally is","is holding","holding everyone","everyone hostage","Events quickly","quickly spiral","spiral into","into a","a media","media circus","circus as","as ,",", through","through the","the siege","siege ,",", Wally","Wally -","- inadvertently","inadvertently -","- manages","manages to","to become","become a","a symbol","symbol for","for the","the anti-war","anti-war movement"]}

{"title":"El Paso","plot":"The Horváth family is a Romani family with seven children, and the story begins with the tragic death of the father. His wife, Vera, is suddenly in a fight with the authorities, determined to keep her large family together at all costs, but she is hopelessly ill-prepared for the task. They are evicted from their home and her case-Vera versus the city-finds its way to a young, ambitious lawyer. She doesn't know the world of the Romani, nor is she particularly interested in it. Initially she takes the case as a springboard for her career. Despite her prejudices, incomprehension and sometimes Vera herself, she doesn't abandon the case. Luckily she is not the only one who sides with the family. There is a social worker whose attempts to help the Horváths are also motivated by his entirely private interest in the attractive lawyer.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","Horváth","famili","is","a","Romani","famili","with","seven","children",",","and","the","stori","begin","with","the","tragic","death","of","the","father",".","His","wife",",","Vera",",","is","sudden","in","a","fight","with","the","author",",","determin","to","keep","her","larg","famili","togeth","at","all","cost",",","but","she","is","hopeless","ill-prepar","for","the","task",".","They","are","evict","from","their","home","and","her","case-Vera","versus","the","city-find","it","way","to","a","young",",","ambiti","lawyer",".","She","doe","n't","know","the","world","of","the","Romani",",","nor","is","she","particular","interest","in","it",".","Initial","she","take","the","case","as","a","springboard","for","her","career",".","Despit","her","prejudic",",","incomprehens","and","sometim","Vera","herself",",","she","doe","n't","abandon","the","case",".","Luckili","she","is","not","the","onli","one","who","side","with","the","famili",".","There","is","a","social","worker","whose","attempt","to","help","the","Horváth","are","also","motiv","by","his","entir","privat","interest","in","the","attract","lawyer","."],"lemmas":["the","Horváth","family","be","a","romani","family","with","seven","child",",","and","the","story","begin","with","the","tragic","death","of","the","father",".","he","wife",",","Vera",",","be","suddenly","in","a","fight","with","the","authority",",","determine","to","keep","she","large","family","together","at","all","cost",",","but","she","be","hopelessly","ill-prepared","for","the","task",".","they","be","evict","from","they","home","and","she","case-vera","versus","the","city-find","its","way","to","a","young",",","ambitious","lawyer",".","she","do","not","know","the","world","of","the","Romani",",","nor","be","she","particularly","interested","in","it",".","initially","she","take","the","case","as","a","springboard","for","she","career",".","despite","she","prejudice",",","incomprehension","and","sometimes","Vera","herself",",","she","do","not","abandon","the","case",".","luckily","she","be","not","the","only","one","who","side","with","the","family",".","there","be","a","social","worker","whose","attempt","to","help","the","Horváths","be","also","motivate","by","he","entirely","private","interest","in","the","attractive","lawyer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

{"title":"The Egg","plot":"A portrait of two people thrown together by circumstance and a bit of larceny. Chiao-Dahn might be a low-level gang member, but he's also a first-class goofball-more likely to break out dancing than to break the law. Ordered to kidnap and bring the beautiful but slightly spoiled Yumi to San Francisco, the seemingly hapless Chiao-Dahn soon finds himself at LAX, with no idea how to get to S.F. and saddled with a kidnapping victim who would rather go shopping than cooperate.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","portrait","of","two","peopl","thrown","togeth","by","circumst","and","a","bit","of","larceni",".","Chiao-Dahn","might","be","a","low-level","gang","member",",","but","he","'s","also","a","first-class","goofball-mor","like","to","break","out","danc","than","to","break","the","law",".","Ordere","to","kidnap","and","bring","the","beauti","but","slight","spoil","Yumi","to","San","Francisco",",","the","seem","hapless","Chiao-Dahn","soon","find","himself","at","LAX",",","with","no","idea","how","to","get","to","S.F.","and","saddl","with","a","kidnap","victim","who","would","rather","go","shop","than","cooper","."],"lemmas":["a","portrait","of","two","people","throw","together","by","circumstance","and","a","bit","of","larceny",".","Chiao-Dahn","might","be","a","low-level","gang","member",",","but","he","be","also","a","first-class","goofball-more","likely","to","break","out","dancing","than","to","break","the","law",".","order","to","kidnap","and","bring","the","beautiful","but","slightly","spoil","Yumi","to","San","Francisco",",","the","seemingly","hapless","Chiao-Dahn","soon","find","himself","at","LAX",",","with","no","idea","how","to","get","to","S.F.","and","saddle","with","a","kidnapping","victim","who","would","rather","go","shopping","than","cooperate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A portrait of","portrait of two","of two people","two people thrown","people thrown together","thrown together by","together by circumstance","by circumstance and","circumstance and a","and a bit","a bit of","bit of larceny","Chiao-Dahn might be","might be a","be a low-level","a low-level gang","low-level gang member","gang member ,","member , but",", but he","but he 's","he 's also","'s also a","also a first-class","a first-class goofball-more","first-class goofball-more likely","goofball-more likely to","likely to break","to break out","break out dancing","out dancing than","dancing than to","than to break","to break the","break the law","Ordered to kidnap","to kidnap and","kidnap and bring","and bring the","bring the beautiful","the beautiful but","beautiful but slightly","but slightly spoiled","slightly spoiled Yumi","spoiled Yumi to","Yumi to San","to San Francisco","San Francisco ,","Francisco , the",", the seemingly","the seemingly hapless","seemingly hapless Chiao-Dahn","hapless Chiao-Dahn soon","Chiao-Dahn soon finds","soon finds himself","finds himself at","himself at LAX","at LAX ,","LAX , with",", with no","with no idea","no idea how","idea how to","how to get","to get to","get to S.F.","to S.F. and","S.F. and saddled","and saddled with","saddled with a","with a kidnapping","a kidnapping victim","kidnapping victim who","victim who would","who would rather","would rather go","rather go shopping","go shopping than","shopping than cooperate"],"2grams":["A portrait","portrait of","of two","two people","people thrown","thrown together","together by","by circumstance","circumstance and","and a","a bit","bit of","of larceny","Chiao-Dahn might","might be","be a","a low-level","low-level gang","gang member","member ,",", but","but he","he 's","'s also","also a","a first-class","first-class goofball-more","goofball-more likely","likely to","to break","break out","out dancing","dancing than","than to","to break","break the","the law","Ordered to","to kidnap","kidnap and","and bring","bring the","the beautiful","beautiful but","but slightly","slightly spoiled","spoiled Yumi","Yumi to","to San","San Francisco","Francisco ,",", the","the seemingly","seemingly hapless","hapless Chiao-Dahn","Chiao-Dahn soon","soon finds","finds himself","himself at","at LAX","LAX ,",", with","with no","no idea","idea how","how to","to get","get to","to S.F.","S.F. and","and saddled","saddled with","with a","a kidnapping","kidnapping victim","victim who","who would","would rather","rather go","go shopping","shopping than","than cooperate"]}

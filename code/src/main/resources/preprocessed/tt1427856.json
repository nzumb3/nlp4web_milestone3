{"title":"Death March of Bataan","plot":"After the fall of Manila, the Americans were hurled back by the advanced of the enemy. In the face of the onslaught General MacArthur ordered a fighting retreat by all USAFFE units consisting of some 30.000 American and 120.000 Filipino troops to Bataan Peninsular until reinforcements arrive. But with the Pacific Fleet been crippled at Pear Harbor, no aid would be forthcoming. After Bataan fell 76.000 American and Filipino troops were forced to march under horrendous conditions in the heat for 60 miles to a POW camp enclosure called Camp O'Donnell. By the time they reached the camp nearly 11.000 POW's had died or were murdered by the Japanese.","genres":["War"],"stems":["After","the","fall","of","Manila",",","the","American","were","hurl","back","by","the","advanc","of","the","enemi",".","In","the","face","of","the","onslaught","Gener","MacArthur","order","a","fight","retreat","by","all","USAFFE","unit","consist","of","some","30.000","American","and","120.000","Filipino","troop","to","Bataan","Peninsular","until","reinforc","arriv",".","But","with","the","Pacif","Fleet","been","crippl","at","Pear","Harbor",",","no","aid","would","be","forthcom",".","After","Bataan","fell","76.000","American","and","Filipino","troop","were","forc","to","march","under","horrend","condit","in","the","heat","for","60","mile","to","a","POW","camp","enclosur","call","Camp","O'Donnel",".","By","the","time","they","reach","the","camp","near","11.000","POW","'s","had","die","or","were","murder","by","the","Japanes","."],"lemmas":["after","the","fall","of","Manila",",","the","Americans","be","hurl","back","by","the","advanced","of","the","enemy",".","in","the","face","of","the","onslaught","General","MacArthur","order","a","fighting","retreat","by","all","USAFFE","unit","consist","of","some","30.000","american","and","120.000","Filipino","troops","to","Bataan","Peninsular","until","reinforcement","arrive",".","but","with","the","Pacific","Fleet","be","cripple","at","Pear","Harbor",",","no","aid","would","be","forthcoming",".","after","Bataan","fall","76.000","American","and","Filipino","troops","be","force","to","march","under","horrendous","condition","in","the","heat","for","60","mile","to","a","pow","camp","enclosure","call","Camp","O'Donnell",".","by","the","time","they","reach","the","camp","nearly","11.000","POW","'s","have","die","or","be","murder","by","the","Japanese","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After

{"title":"Unmistaken Child","plot":"In Nepal, a venerable monk, Geshe Lama Konchog, dies and one of his disciples, a youthful monk named Tenzin Zopa, searches for his master's reincarnation. The film follows his search to the Tsum Valley where he finds a young boy of the right age who uncannily responds to Konchog's possessions. Is this the reincarnation of the master? After the boy passes several tests, Tenzin takes him to meet the Dalai Lama. Will the parents agree to let the boy go to the monastery, and, if so, how will the child respond? Central to the film is the relationship the child develops with Tenzin.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Nepal",",","a","vener","monk",",","Gesh","Lama","Konchog",",","die","and","one","of","his","discipl",",","a","youth","monk","name","Tenzin","Zopa",",","search","for","his","master","'s","reincarn",".","The","film","follow","his","search","to","the","Tsum","Valley","where","he","find","a","young","boy","of","the","right","age","who","uncannili","respond","to","Konchog","'s","possess",".","Is","this","the","reincarn","of","the","master","?","After","the","boy","pass","sever","test",",","Tenzin","take","him","to","meet","the","Dalai","Lama",".","Will","the","parent","agre","to","let","the","boy","go","to","the","monasteri",",","and",",","if","so",",","how","will","the","child","respond","?","Central","to","the","film","is","the","relationship","the","child","develop","with","Tenzin","."],"lemmas":["in","Nepal",",","a","venerable","monk",",","Geshe","Lama","Konchog",",","die","and","one","of","he","disciple",",","a","youthful","monk","name","Tenzin","Zopa",",","search","for","he","master","'s","reincarnation",".","the","film","follow","he","search","to","the","Tsum","Valley","where","he","find","a","young","boy","of","the","right","age","who","uncannily","respond","to","Konchog","'s","possession",".","be","this","the","reincarnation","of","the","master","?","after","the","boy","pass","several","test",",","Tenzin","take","he","to","meet","the","Dalai","Lama",".","will","the","parent","agree","to","let","the","boy","go","to","the","monastery",",","and",",","if","so",",","how","will","the","child","respond","?","central","to","the","film","be","the","relationship","the","child","develop","with","Tenzin","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Nepal ,","Nepal , a",", a venerable","a venerable monk","venerable monk ,","monk , Geshe",", Geshe Lama","Geshe Lama Konchog","Lama Konchog ,","Konchog , dies",", dies and","dies and one","and one of","one of his","of his disciples","his disciples ,","disciples , a",", a youthful","a youthful monk","youthful monk named","monk named Tenzin","named Tenzin Zopa","Tenzin Zopa ,","Zopa , searches",", searches for","searches for his","for his master","his master 's","master 's reincarnation","The film follows","film follows his","follows his search","his search to","search to the","to the Tsum","the Tsum Valley","Tsum Valley where","Valley where he","where he finds","he finds a","finds a young","a young boy","young boy of","boy of the","of the right","the right age","right age who","age who uncannily","who uncannily responds","uncannily responds to","responds to Konchog","to Konchog 's","Konchog 's possessions","Is this the","this the reincarnation","the reincarnation of","reincarnation of the","of the master","After the boy","the boy passes","boy passes several","passes several tests","several tests ,","tests , Tenzin",", Tenzin takes","Tenzin takes him","takes him to","him to meet","to meet the","meet the Dalai","the Dalai Lama","Will the parents","the parents agree","parents agree to","agree to let","to let the","let the boy","the boy go","boy go to","go to the","to the monastery","the monastery ,","monastery , and",", and ,","and , if",", if so","if so ,","so , how",", how will","how will the","will the child","the child respond","Central to the","to the film","the film is","film is the","is the relationship","the relationship the","relationship the child","the child develops","child develops with","develops with Tenzin"],"2grams":["In Nepal","Nepal ,",", a","a venerable","venerable monk","monk ,",", Geshe","Geshe Lama","Lama Konchog","Konchog ,",", dies","dies and","and one","one of","of his","his disciples","disciples ,",", a","a youthful","youthful monk","monk named","named Tenzin","Tenzin Zopa","Zopa ,",", searches","searches for","for his","his master","master 's","'s reincarnation","The film","film follows","follows his","his search","search to","to the","the Tsum","Tsum Valley","Valley where","where he","he finds","finds a","a young","young boy","boy of","of the","the right","right age","age who","who uncannily","uncannily responds","responds to","to Konchog","Konchog 's","'s possessions","Is this","this the","the reincarnation","reincarnation of","of the","the master","After the","the boy","boy passes","passes several","several tests","tests ,",", Tenzin","Tenzin takes","takes him","him to","to meet","meet the","the Dalai","Dalai Lama","Will the","the parents","parents agree","agree to","to let","let the","the boy","boy go","go to","to the","the monastery","monastery ,",", and","and ,",", if","if so","so ,",", how","how will","will the","the child","child respond","Central to","to the","the film","film is","is the","the relationship","relationship the","the child","child develops","develops with","with Tenzin"]}

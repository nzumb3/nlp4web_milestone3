{"title":"Jag Jeondeyan De Mele","plot":"Wealthy Abhijot Singh is sent away from his home so that he can stay from the peasants, especially his sweetheart, Mitro. Years later, he does return, and rekindles his romance for Mitro, who has blossomed into a real beauty, much to the chagrin of his dominating father, Kartar, who not only wants him to wed Shivcharan Kaur, but also pressurizes Mitro's family into forcing her to marry someone else. In despair, Mitro kills herself, a devastated Abhijot re-locates to Canada and refuses to get married. He does relent after his father's health suffers and becomes wheel-chair bound. Hoping to get him married to a girl of their choice, Kartar and the rest of the family are not aware of Abhijot's real intentions, and will not be ready for the shock that awaits them when he does return back home.","genres":["Drama","

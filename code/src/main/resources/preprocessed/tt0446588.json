{"title":"Rock & Roll Superhero","plot":"Everyone has a dream; becoming a successful rock musician is Watt White's dream and his obsession. Shot over the course of three years, Rock & Roll Superhero, follows the ups and downs of Watt's hopeful path to superstardom, from his origins in a thematic costume band to a tight, sophisticated act that's looked upon with interest by major record labels. He and his bass player form the core partnership of the band, joining forces with two Israeli musicians-for-hire who eventually cause Watt to go into serious debt. A clash of cultures and styles arises within the band, inspiring a change in music and image which leads them to the brink of a major record deal. But when disastrous gigs threaten Watt's chances, he must choose between his loyalty to his friends and his own blind ambition. A cultural Anthropologist who saw the film told me Watt White's struggle for fame is symbolic of the American character - a fascination with fame, a belief in one's grand destiny, and a yearning for riches.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Everyon","has","a","dream",";","becom","a","success","rock","musician","is","Watt","White","'s","dream","and","his","obsess",".","Shot","over","the","cours","of","three","year",",","Rock","&","Roll","Superhero",",","follow","the","up","and","down","of","Watt","'s","hope","path","to","superstardom",",","from","his","origin","in","a","themat","costum","band","to","a","tight",",","sophist","act","that","'s","look","upon","with","interest","by","major","record","label",".","He","and","his","bass","player","form","the","core","partnership","of","the","band",",","join","forc","with","two","Israeli","musicians-for-hir","who","eventu","caus","Watt","to","go","into","serious","debt",".","A","clash","of","cultur","and","style","aris","within","the","band",",","inspir","a","chang","in","music","and","imag","which","lead","them","to","the","brink","of","a","major","record","deal",".","But","when","disastr","gig","threaten","Watt","'s","chanc",",","he","must","choos","between","his","loyalti","to","his","friend","and","his","own","blind","ambit",".","A","cultur","Anthropologist","who","saw","the","film","told","me","Watt","White","'s","struggl","for","fame","is","symbol","of","the","American","charact","-","a","fascin","with","fame",",","a","belief","in","one","'s","grand","destini",",","and","a","yearn","for","rich","."],"lemmas":["everyone","have","a","dream",";","become","a","successful","rock","musician","be","Watt","White","'s","dream","and","he","obsession",".","shot","over","the","course","of","three","year",",","Rock","&","Roll","Superhero",",","follow","the","up","and","downs","of","Watt","'s","hopeful","path","to","superstardom",",","from","he","origin","in","a","thematic","costume","band","to","a","tight",",","sophisticated","act","that","be","look","upon","with","interest","by","major","record","label",".","he","and","he","bass","player","form","the","core","partnership","of","the","band",",","join","force","with","two","israeli","musicians-for-hire","who","eventually","cause","Watt","to","go","into","serious","debt",".","a","clash","of","culture","and","style","arise","within","the","band",",","inspiring","a","change","in","music","and","image","which","lead","they","to","the","brink","of","a","major","record","deal",".","but","when","disastrous","gig","threaten","Watt","'s","chance",",","he","must","choose","between","he","loyalty","to","he","friend","and","he","own","blind","ambition",".","a","cultural","anthropologist","who","see","the","film","tell","I","Watt","White","'s","struggle","for","fame","be","symbolic","of","the","american","character","-","a","fascination","with","fame",",","a","belief","in","one","'s","grand","destiny",",","and","a","yearning","for","riches","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Everyone has a","has a dream","a dream ;","dream ;

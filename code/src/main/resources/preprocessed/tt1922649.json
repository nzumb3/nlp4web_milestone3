{"title":"Letter One","plot":"LETTER ONE articulates an actor's (writer's) struggle with cultural stereotypes in film, television and theater. Provoked by culturally offensive content in a television script for the series, Rent A Goalie, in which actor Tony Nardi had been asked to consider participation, actor/writer Nardi refused the 'offer', wrote a letter instead (to the producers via casting director) and went public with the Letter. LETTER ONE is the first of three 'theatrical' monologues, TWO LETTERS...AND COUNTING!, that decry the moribund state of Canadian film, television and theater. The live presentations of the Letters have aroused considerable controversy in Canada. LETTER ONE was filmed in front of a live audience.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["LETTER","ONE","articul","an","actor","'s","(","writer","'s",")","struggl","with","cultur","stereotyp","in","film",",","televis","and","theater",".","Provok","by","cultur","offens","content","in","a","televis","script","for","the","seri",",","Rent","A","Goali",",","in","which","actor","Toni","Nardi","had","been","ask","to","consid","particip",",","actor/writ","Nardi","refus","the","'","offer","'",",","wrote","a","letter","instead","(","to","the","produc","via","cast","director",")","and","went","public","with","the","Letter",".","LETTER","ONE","is","the","first","of","three","'","theatric","'","monologu",",","TWO","LETTERS","...","AND","COUNTING","!",",","that","decri","the","moribund","state","of","Canadian","film",",","televis","and","theater",".","The","live","present","of","the","Letter","have","arous","consider","controversi","in","Canada",".","LETTER","ONE","was","film","in","front","of","a","live","audienc","."],"lemmas":["letter","one","articulate","a","actor","'s","-lrb-","writer","'s","-rrb-","struggle","with","cultural","stereotype","in","film",",","television","and","theater",".","provoke","by","culturally","offensive","content","in","a","television","script","for","the","series",",","Rent","A","Goalie",",","in","which","actor","Tony","Nardi","have","be","ask","to","consider","participation",",","actor/writer","Nardi","refuse","the","'","offer","'",",","write","a","letter","instead","-lrb-","to","the","producer","via","casting","director","-rrb-","and","go","public","with","the","Letter",".","letter","one","be","the","first","of","three","'","theatrical","'","monologue",",","two","letter","...","AND","COUNTING","!",",","that","decry","the","moribund","state","of","canadian","film",",","television","and","theater",".","the","live","presentation","of","the","letter","have","arouse","considerable","controversy","in","Canada",".","letter","one","be","film","in","front","of","a","live","audience","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["LETTER ONE articulates","ONE articulates an","articulates an actor","an actor 's","actor 's (","'s ( writer","( writer 's","writer 's )","'s ) struggle",") struggle with","struggle with cultural","with cultural stereotypes","cultural stereotypes in","stereotypes in film","in film ,","film , television",", television and","television and theater","Provoked by culturally","by culturally offensive","culturally offensive content","offensive content in","content in a","in a television","a television script","television script for","script for the","for the series","the series ,","series , Rent",", Rent A","Rent A Goalie","A Goalie ,","Goalie , in",", in which","in which actor","which actor Tony","actor Tony Nardi","Tony Nardi had","Nardi had been","had been asked","been asked to","asked to consider","to consider participation","consider participation ,","participation , actor/writer",", actor/writer Nardi","actor/writer Nardi refused","Nardi refused the","refused the '","the ' offer","' offer '","offer ' ,","' , wrote",", wrote a","wrote a letter","a letter instead","letter instead (","instead ( to","( to the","to the producers","the producers via","producers via casting","via casting director","casting director )","director ) and",") and went","and went public","went public with","public with the","with the Letter","LETTER ONE is","ONE is the","is the first","the first of","first of three","of three '","three ' theatrical","' theatrical '","theatrical ' monologues","' monologues ,","monologues , TWO",", TWO LETTERS","TWO LETTERS ...","LETTERS ...

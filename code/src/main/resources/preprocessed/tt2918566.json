their history...a chapter of peace...prosperity...and unity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Word","of","Revolut","is","a","documentari","about","a","cultur","tri","to","reviv","and","progress","from","a","histori","of","violenc",".","While","the","countri","of","El","Salvador","has","suffer","the","aftermath","of","a","civil","war","and","the","growth","of","gang","violenc",",","Salvadoran","resid","in","the","Unite","State","face","challeng","with","their","ident",",","cultur",",","and","negat","connot","denot","by","the","media",".","Through","the","hope","voic","of","hip-hop","artist","'",",","a","professor",",","and","a","communiti","activist",",","this","documentari","help","promot","chang","and","bring","cultur","ident","to","a","cultur","that","is","begin","a","new","chapter","in","their","histori","...","a","chapter","of","peac","...","prosper","...","and","uniti","."],"lemmas":["word","of","Revolution","be","a","documentary","about","a","culture","try","to","revive","and","progress","from","a","history","of","violence",".","while","the","country","of","El","Salvador","have","suffer","the","aftermath","of","a","civil","war","and","the","growth","of","gang","violence",",","Salvadorans","reside","in","the","United","States","face","challenge","with","they","identity",",","culture",",","and","negative","connotation","denote","by","the","media",".","through","the","hopeful","voice","of","hip-hop","artist","'",",","a","professor",",","and","a","community","activist",",","this","documentary","help","promote","change","and","bring","cultural","identity","to","a","culture","that","be","begin","a","new","chapter","in","they","history","...","a","chapter","of","peace","...","prosperity","...","and","unity","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Words

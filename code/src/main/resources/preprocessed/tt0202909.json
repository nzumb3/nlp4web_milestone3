{"title":"A Hole in the Head","plot":"A Hole In The Head examines the development of \"modern\" trepanation as used by people in the United Kingdom, The United States, and The Netherlands for the purpose of attaining a higher level of consciousness. This procedure, used by the ancient Egyptians, Incas, and others, is believed by the voluntarily trepanned to allow for renewed brain pulsations that increase brain blood volume and thereby improve brain function. Interviews regarding the history and efficacy of the procedure are also held with some of the world's most respected neurosurgeons and anthropologists.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","Hole","In","The","Head","examin","the","develop","of","\"","modern","\"","trepan","as","use","by","peopl","in","the","Unite","Kingdom",",","The","Unite","State",",","and","The","Netherland","for","the","purpos","of","attain","a","higher","level","of","conscious",".","This","procedur",",","use","by","the","ancient","Egyptian",",","Incas",",","and","other",",","is","believ","by","the","voluntarili","trepan","to","allow","for","renew","brain","pulsat","that","increas","brain","blood","volum","and","therebi","improv","brain","function",".","Interview","regard","the","histori","and","efficaci","of","the","procedur","are","also","held","with","some","of","the","world","'s","most","respect","neurosurgeon","and","anthropologist","."],"lemmas":["a","hole","in","the","Head","examine","the","development","of","``","modern","''","trepanation","as","use","by","people","in","the","United","Kingdom",",","The","United","States",",","and","the","Netherlands","for","the","purpose","of","attain","a","higher","level","of","consciousness",".","this","procedure",",","use","by","the","ancient","Egyptians",",","Incas",",","and","other",",","be","believe","by","the","voluntarily","trepan","to","allow","for","renew","brain","pulsation","that","increase","brain","blood","volume","and","thereby","improve","brain","function",".","interview","regard","the","history","and","efficacy","of","the","procedure","be","also","hold","with","some","of","the","world","'s","most","respected","neurosurgeon","and","anthropologist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A Hole In","Hole In The","In The Head","The Head examines","Head examines the","examines the development","the development of","development of \"","of \" modern","\" modern \"","modern \" trepanation","\" trepanation as","trepanation as used","as used by","used by people","by people in","people in the","in the United","the United Kingdom","United Kingdom ,","Kingdom , The",", The United","The United States","United States ,","States , and",", and The","and The Netherlands","The Netherlands for","Netherlands for the","for the purpose","the purpose of","purpose of attaining","of attaining a","attaining a higher","a higher level","higher level of","level of consciousness","This procedure ,","procedure , used",", used by","used by the","by the ancient","the ancient Egyptians","ancient Egyptians ,","Egyptians , Incas",", Incas ,","Incas , and",", and others","and others ,","others , is",", is believed","is believed by","believed by the","by the voluntarily","the voluntarily trepanned","voluntarily trepanned to","trepanned to allow","to allow for","allow for renewed","for renewed brain","renewed brain pulsations","brain pulsations that","pulsations that increase","that increase brain","increase brain blood","brain blood volume","blood volume and","volume and thereby","and thereby improve","thereby improve brain","improve brain function","Interviews regarding the","regarding the history","the history and","history and efficacy","and efficacy of","efficacy of the","of the procedure","the procedure are","procedure are also","are also held","also held with","held with some","with some of","some of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's most","'s most respected","most respected neurosurgeons","respected neurosurgeons and","neurosurgeons and anthropologists"],"2grams":["A Hole","Hole In","In The","The Head","Head examines","examines the","the development","development of","of \"","\" modern","modern \"","\" trepanation","trepanation as","as used","used by","by people","people in","in the","the United","United Kingdom","Kingdom ,",", The","The United","United States","States ,",", and","and The","The Netherlands","Netherlands for","for the","the purpose","purpose of","of attaining","attaining a","a higher","higher level","level of","of consciousness","This procedure","procedure ,",", used","used by","by the","the ancient","ancient Egyptians","Egyptians ,",", Incas","Incas ,",", and","and others","others ,",", is","is believed","believed by","by the","the voluntarily","voluntarily trepanned","trepanned to","to allow","allow for","for renewed","renewed brain","brain pulsations","pulsations that","that increase","increase brain","brain blood","blood volume","volume and","and thereby","thereby improve","improve brain","brain function","Interviews regarding","regarding the","the history","history and","and efficacy","efficacy of","of the","the procedure","procedure are","are also","also held","held with","with some","some of","of the","the world","world 's","'s most","most respected","respected neurosurgeons","neurosurgeons and","and anthropologists"]}

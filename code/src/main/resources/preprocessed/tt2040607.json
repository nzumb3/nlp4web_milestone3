{"title":"Dancing Cows","plot":"The band plays and nobody listens. Musician 1 blames the crowd, Musician 2 blames the music. We'll follow the journeys of Three Women Without Men, One Man With Three Women and A Prodigal Son who tries to communicate with his father for the first time but realizes he may have left it too late. When the band disbands the whole town starts to fall apart - this is when Groucho Marx, the Cows and George turn up. Dancing Cows is a story about hope and about how easy it is to change the planet if 'you play from the heart' instead of pointing the finger.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["The","band","play","and","nobodi","listen",".","Musician","1","blame","the","crowd",",","Musician","2","blame","the","music",".","We","ll","follow","the","journey","of","Three","Women","Without","Men",",","One","Man","With","Three","Women","and","A","Prodig","Son","who","tri","to","communic","with","his","father","for","the","first","time","but","realiz","he","may","have","left","it","too","late",".","When","the","band","disband","the","whole","town","start","to","fall","apart","-","this","is","when","Groucho","Marx",",","the","Cow","and","Georg","turn","up",".","Danc","Cow","is","a","stori","about","hope","and","about","how","easi","it","is","to","chang","the","planet","if","'","you","play","from","the","heart","'","instead","of","point","the","finger","."],"lemmas":["the","band","play","and","nobody","listen",".","musician","1","blame","the","crowd",",","musician","2","blame","the","music",".","we","will","follow","the","journey","of","Three","Women","without","Men",",","One","Man","With","Three","Women","and","A","Prodigal","Son","who","try","to","communicate","with","he","father","for","the","first","time","but","realize","he","may","have","leave","it","too","late",".","when","the","band","disband","the","whole","town","start","to","fall","apart","-","this","be","when","Groucho","Marx",",","the","Cows","and","George","turn","up",".","dancing","cow","be","a","story","about","hope","and","about","how","easy","it","be","to","change","the","planet","if","'","you","play","from","the","heart","'","instead","of","point","the","finger","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The band plays","band plays and","plays and nobody","and nobody listens","Musician 1 blames","1 blames the","blames the crowd","the crowd ,","crowd , Musician",", Musician 2","Musician 2 blames","2 blames the","blames the music","We 'll follow","'ll follow the","follow the journeys","the journeys of","journeys of Three","of Three Women","Three Women Without","Women Without Men","Without Men ,","Men , One",", One Man","One Man With","Man With Three","With Three Women","Three Women and","Women and A","and A Prodigal","A Prodigal Son","Prodigal Son who","Son who tries","who tries to","tries to communicate","to communicate with","communicate with his","with his father","his father for","father for the","for the first","the first time","first time but","time but realizes","but realizes he","realizes he may","he may have","may have left","have left it","left it too","it too late","When the band","the band disbands","band disbands the","disbands the whole","the whole town","whole town starts","town starts to","starts to fall","to fall apart","fall apart -","apart - this","- this is","this is when","is when Groucho","when Groucho Marx","Groucho Marx ,","Marx , the",", the Cows","the Cows and","Cows and George","and George turn","George turn up","Dancing Cows is","Cows is a","is a story","a story about","story about hope","about hope and","hope and about","and about how","about how easy","how easy it","easy it is","it is to","is to change","to change the","change the planet","the planet if","planet if '","if ' you","' you play","you play from","play from the","from the heart","the heart '","heart ' instead","' instead of","instead of pointing","of pointing the","pointing the finger"],"2grams":["The band","band plays","plays and","and nobody","nobody listens","Musician 1","1 blames","blames the","the crowd","crowd ,",", Musician","Musician 2","2 blames","blames the","the music","We 'll","'ll follow","follow the","the journeys","journeys of","of Three","Three Women","Women Without","Without Men","Men ,",", One","One Man","Man With","With Three","Three Women","Women and","and A","A Prodigal","Prodigal Son","Son who","who tries","tries to","to communicate","communicate with","with his","his father","father for","for the","the first","first time","time but","but realizes","realizes he","he may","may have","have left","left it","it too","too late","When the","the band","band disbands","disbands the","the whole","whole town","town starts","starts to","to fall","fall apart","apart -","- this","this is","is when","when Groucho","Groucho Marx","Marx ,",", the","the Cows","Cows and","and George","George turn","turn up","Dancing Cows","Cows is","is a","a story","story about","about hope","hope and","and about","about how","how easy","easy it","it is","is to","to change","change the","the planet","planet if","if '","' you","you play","play from","from the","the heart","heart '","' instead","instead of","of pointing","pointing the","the finger"]}

{"title":"Noodle","plot":"At thirty-seven, Miri is a twice-widowed, El Al flight attendant. Her well-regulated existence is suddenly turned upside down by an abandoned Chinese boy whose migrant-worker mother has been summarily deported from Israel. The film is a touching comic-drama in which two human beings -- as different from each other as Tel Aviv is from Beijing -- accompany each other on a remarkable journey, one that takes them both back to a meaningful life.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["At","thirty-seven",",","Miri","is","a","twice-widow",",","El","Al","flight","attend",".","Her","well-regul","exist","is","sudden","turn","upsid","down","by","an","abandon","Chines","boy","whose","migrant-work","mother","has","been","summarili","deport","from","Israel",".","The","film","is","a","touch","comic-drama","in","which","two","human","be","--","as","differ","from","each","other","as","Tel","Aviv","is","from","Beij","--","accompani","each","other","on","a","remark","journey",",","one","that","take","them","both","back","to","a","meaning","life","."],"lemmas":["at","thirty-seven",",","Miri","be","a","twice-widowed",",","El","Al","flight","attendant",".","she","well-regulated","existence","be","suddenly","turn","upside","down","by","a","abandoned","chinese","boy","whose","migrant-worker","mother","have","be","summarily","deport","from","Israel",".","the","film","be","a","touch","comic-drama","in","which","two","human","being","--","as","different","from","each","other","as","Tel","Aviv","be","from","Beijing","--","accompany","each","other","on","a","remarkable","journey",",","one","that","take","they","both","back","to","a","meaningful","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["At thirty-seven ,","thirty-seven , Miri",", Miri is","Miri is a","is a twice-widowed","a twice-widowed ,","twice-widowed , El",", El Al","El Al flight","Al flight attendant","Her well-regulated existence","well-regulated existence is","existence is suddenly","is suddenly turned","suddenly turned upside","turned upside down","upside down by","down by an","by an abandoned","an abandoned Chinese","abandoned Chinese boy","Chinese boy whose","boy whose migrant-worker","whose migrant-worker mother","migrant-worker mother has","mother has been","has been summarily","been summarily deported","summarily deported from","deported from Israel","The film is","film is a","is a touching","a touching comic-drama","touching comic-drama in","comic-drama in which","in which two","which two human","two human beings","human beings --","beings -- as","-- as different","as different from","different from each","from each other","each other as","other as Tel","as Tel Aviv","Tel Aviv is","Aviv is from","is from Beijing","from Beijing --","Beijing -- accompany","-- accompany each","accompany each other","each other on","other on a","on a remarkable","a remarkable journey","remarkable journey ,","journey , one",", one that","one that takes","that takes them","takes them both","them both back","both back to","back to a","to a meaningful","a meaningful life"],"2grams":["At thirty-seven","thirty-seven ,",", Miri","Miri is","is a","a twice-widowed","twice-widowed ,",", El","El Al","Al flight","flight attendant","Her well-regulated","well-regulated existence","existence is","is suddenly","suddenly turned","turned upside","upside down","down by","by an","an abandoned","abandoned Chinese","Chinese boy","boy whose","whose migrant-worker","migrant-worker mother","mother has","has been","been summarily","summarily deported","deported from","from Israel","The film","film is","is a","a touching","touching comic-drama","comic-drama in","in which","which two","two human","human beings","beings --","-- as","as different","different from","from each","each other","other as","as Tel","Tel Aviv","Aviv is","is from","from Beijing","Beijing --","-- accompany","accompany each","each other","other on","on a","a remarkable","remarkable journey","journey ,",", one","one that","that takes","takes them","them both","both back","back to","to a","a meaningful","meaningful life"]}

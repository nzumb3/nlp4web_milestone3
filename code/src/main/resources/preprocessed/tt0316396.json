{"title":"Peter Pan","plot":"In stifling Edwardian London, Wendy Darling mesmerizes her brothers every night with bedtime tales of swordplay, swashbuckling, and the fearsome Captain Hook. But the children become the heroes of an even greater story, when Peter Pan flies into their nursery one night and leads them over moonlit rooftops through a galaxy of stars and to the lush jungles of Neverland. Wendy and her brothers join Peter and the Lost Boys in an exhilarating life--free of grown-up rules--while also facing the inevitable showdown with Hook and his bloodthirsty pirates.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Family"],"stems":["In","stifl","Edwardian","London",",","Wendi","Darl","mesmer","her","brother","everi","night","with","bedtim","tale","of","swordplay",",","swashbuckl",",","and","the","fearsom","Captain","Hook",".","But","the","children","becom","the","hero","of","an","even","greater","stori",",","when","Peter","Pan","fli","into","their","nurseri","one","night","and","lead","them","over","moonlit","rooftop","through","a","galaxi","of","star","and","to","the","lush","jungl","of","Neverland",".","Wendi","and","her","brother","join","Peter","and","the","Lost","Boy","in","an","exhilar","life","--","free","of","grown-up","rule","--","while","also","face","the","inevit","showdown","with","Hook","and","his","bloodthirsti","pirat","."],"lemmas":["in","stifle","Edwardian","London",",","Wendy","Darling","mesmerize","she","brother","every","night","with","bedtime","tale","of","swordplay",",","swashbuckling",",","and","the","fearsome","Captain","Hook",".","but","the","child","become","the","hero","of","a","even","greater","story",",","when","Peter","Pan","fly","into","they","nursery","one","night","and","lead","they","over","moonlit","rooftop","through","a","galaxy","of","star","and","to","the","lush","jungle","of","Neverland",".","wendy","and","she","brother","join","Peter","and","the","Lost","Boys","in","a","exhilarating","life","--","free","of","grown-up","rule","--","while","also","face","the","inevitable","showdown","with","hook","and","he","bloodthirsty","pirate","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In stifling Edwardian","stifling Edwardian London","Edwardian London ,","London , Wendy",", Wendy Darling","Wendy Darling mesmerizes","Darling mesmerizes her","mesmerizes her brothers","her brothers every","brothers every night","every night with","night with bedtime","with bedtime tales","bedtime tales of","tales of swordplay","of swordplay ,","swordplay , swashbuckling",", swashbuckling ,","swashbuckling , and",", and the","and the fearsome","the fearsome Captain","fearsome Captain Hook","But the children","the children become","children become the","become the heroes","the heroes of","heroes of an","of an even","an even greater","even greater story","greater story ,","story , when",", when Peter","when Peter Pan","Peter Pan flies","Pan flies into","flies into their","into their nursery","their nursery one","nursery one night","one night and","night and leads","and leads them","leads them over","them over moonlit","over moonlit rooftops","moonlit rooftops through","rooftops through a","through a galaxy","a galaxy of","galaxy of stars","of stars and","stars and to","and to the","to the lush","the lush jungles","lush jungles of","jungles of Neverland","Wendy and her","and her brothers","her brothers join","brothers join Peter","join Peter and","Peter and the","and the Lost","the Lost Boys","Lost Boys in","Boys in an","in an exhilarating","an exhilarating life","exhilarating life --","life -- free","-- free of","free of grown-up","of grown-up rules","grown-up rules --","rules -- while","-- while also","while also facing","also facing the","facing the inevitable","the inevitable showdown","inevitable showdown with","showdown with Hook","with Hook and","Hook and his","and his bloodthirsty","his bloodthirsty pirates"],"2grams":["In stifling","stifling Edwardian","Edwardian London","London ,",", Wendy","Wendy Darling","Darling mesmerizes","mesmerizes her","her brothers","brothers every","every night","night with","with bedtime","bedtime tales","tales of","of swordplay","swordplay ,",", swashbuckling","swashbuckling ,",", and","and the","the fearsome","fearsome Captain","Captain Hook","But the","the children","children become","become the","the heroes","heroes of","of an","an even","even greater","greater story","story ,",", when","when Peter","Peter Pan","Pan flies","flies into","into their","their nursery","nursery one","one night","night and","and leads","leads them","them over","over moonlit","moonlit rooftops","rooftops through","through a","a galaxy","galaxy of","of stars","stars and","and to","to the","the lush","lush jungles","jungles of","of Neverland","Wendy and","and her","her brothers","brothers join","join Peter","Peter and","and the","the Lost","Lost Boys","Boys in","in an","an exhilarating","exhilarating life","life --","-- free","free of","of grown-up","grown-up rules","rules --","-- while","while also","also facing","facing the","the inevitable","inevitable showdown","showdown with","with Hook","Hook and","and his","his bloodthirsty","bloodthirsty pirates"]}

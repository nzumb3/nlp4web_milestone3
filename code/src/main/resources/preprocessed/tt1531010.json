{"title":"Shed Your Tears and Walk Away","plot":"Real-life drama about why, in a beautiful and quirky rural town, film- maker Jez Lewis' childhood friends are killing themselves. Beginning with a personal quest for understanding, the film moves into a year-long drama of human tragedy and redemption as principal character Cass comes to terms with his own mortality and attempts to lift himself out of his cycle of self-destruction. This core narrative carves an upward arc through an intimate study of a place often described as paradise, but which harbours an undertow of lethal hedonism and disillusionment. As people continue to kill themselves during the making of the film, a maelstrom of conflicting values throws up unexpected truths about the human condition.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Real-lif","drama","about","whi",",","in","a","beauti","and","quirki","rural","town",",","film","-","maker","Jez","Lewi","'","childhood","friend","are","kill","themselv",".","Begin","with","a","person","quest","for","understand",",","the","film","move","into","a","year-long","drama","of","human","tragedi","and","redempt","as","princip","charact","Cass","come","to","term","with","his","own","mortal","and","attempt","to","lift","himself","out","of","his","cycl","of","self-destruct",".","This","core","narrat","carv","an","upward","arc","through","an","intim","studi","of","a","place","often","describ","as","paradis",",","but","which","harbour","an","undertow","of","lethal","hedon","and","disillusion",".","As","peopl","continu","to","kill","themselv","dure","the","make","of","the","film",",","a","maelstrom","of","conflict","valu","throw","up","unexpect","truth","about","the","human","condit","."],"lemmas":["real-life","drama","about","why",",","in","a","beautiful","and","quirky","rural","town",",","film","-","maker","Jez","Lewis","'","childhood","friend","be","kill","themselves",".","begin","with","a","personal","quest","for","understanding",",","the","film","move","into","a","year-long","drama","of","human","tragedy","and","redemption","as","principal","character","Cass","come","to","term","with","he","own","mortality","and","attempt","to","lift","himself","out","of","he","cycle","of","self-destruction",".","this","core","narrative","carve","a","upward","arc","through","a","intimate","study","of","a","place","often","describe","as","paradise",",","but","which","harbour","a","undertow","of","lethal","hedonism","and","disillusionment",".","as","people","continue","to","kill","themselves","during","the","making","of","the","film",",","a","maelstrom","of","conflict","value","throw","up","unexpected","truth","about","the","human","condition","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Real-life drama about","drama about why","about why ,","why , in",", in a","in a beautiful","a beautiful and","beautiful and quirky","and quirky rural","quirky rural town","rural town ,","town , film",", film -","film -

{"title":"The Perfect Victim","plot":"For over thirty years, three women have languished in Missouri State prison under unjust sentences for killing their abusive husbands. Denied the opportunity to enter the abuse into evidence, each of the women represents a system broken by outdated and media-sensationalized stereotypes. When a greater understanding of the \"battered\" syndrome change legal practices in 2000, Missouri's Governor crafts a new law demanding the parole board revaluate each woman's case. But nothing comes easy to the women who have been abused twice, first by their husbands and then by the notoriously secretive board who control their fate. Now they must fight back to not be \"The Perfect Victim\".","genres":["Crime","

{"title":"Command Performance","plot":"A Moscow charity concert turns bloody when armed extortionists take the head liner American pop-star Venus and the Russian President with his family hostage. Help is on the way when the drummer of a heavy metal warm-up band, an ex-bad ass biker played by Lundgren, and a young Russian F.S.B. agent team up to fight back. But our two heroes are seriously outnumbered and things aren't as simple as they appear when old ghosts from the Soviet Union appear to haunt the present in this fast paced action piece.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["A","Moscow","chariti","concert","turn","bloodi","when","arm","extortionist","take","the","head","liner","American","pop-star","Venus","and","the","Russian","Presid","with","his","famili","hostag",".","Help","is","on","the","way","when","the","drummer","of","a","heavi","metal","warm-up","band",",","an","ex-bad","ass","biker","play","by","Lundgren",",","and","a","young","Russian","F.S.B.","agent","team","up","to","fight","back",".","But","our","two","hero","are","serious","outnumb","and","thing","are","n't","as","simpl","as","they","appear","when","old","ghost","from","the","Soviet","Union","appear","to","haunt","the","present","in","this","fast","pace","action","piec","."],"lemmas":["a","Moscow","charity","concert","turn","bloody","when","armed","extortionist","take","the","head","liner","american","pop-star","Venus","and","the","Russian","President","with","he","family","hostage",".","help","be","on","the","way","when","the","drummer","of","a","heavy","metal","warm-up","band",",","a","ex-bad","ass","biker","play","by","Lundgren",",","and","a","young","Russian","F.S.B.","agent","team","up","to","fight","back",".","but","we","two","hero","be","seriously","outnumber","and","thing","be","not","as","simple","as","they","appear","when","old","ghost","from","the","Soviet","Union","appear","to","haunt","the","present","in","this","fast","pace","action","piece","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A Moscow charity","Moscow charity concert","charity concert turns","concert turns bloody","turns bloody when","bloody when armed","when armed extortionists","armed extortionists take","extortionists take the","take the head","the head liner","head liner American","liner American pop-star","American pop-star Venus","pop-star Venus and","Venus and the","and the Russian","the Russian President","Russian President with","President with his","with his family","his family hostage","Help is on","is on the","on the way","the way when","way when the","when the drummer","the drummer of","drummer of a","of a heavy","a heavy metal","heavy metal warm-up","metal warm-up band","warm-up band ,","band , an",", an ex-bad","an ex-bad ass","ex-bad ass biker","ass biker played","biker played by","played by Lundgren","by Lundgren ,","Lundgren , and",", and a","and a young","a young Russian","young Russian F.S.B.","Russian F.S.B. agent","F.S.B. agent team","agent team up","team up to","up to fight","to fight back","But our two","our two heroes","two heroes are","heroes are seriously","are seriously outnumbered","seriously outnumbered and","outnumbered and things","and things are","things are n't","are n't as","n't as simple","as simple as","simple as they","as they appear","they appear when","appear when old","when old ghosts","old ghosts from","ghosts from the","from the Soviet","the Soviet Union","Soviet Union appear","Union appear to","appear to haunt","to haunt the","haunt the present","the present in","present in this","in this fast","this fast paced","fast paced action","paced action piece"],"2grams":["A Moscow","Moscow charity","charity concert","concert turns","turns bloody","bloody when","when armed","armed extortionists","extortionists take","take the","the head","head liner","liner American","American pop-star","pop-star Venus","Venus and","and the","the Russian","Russian President","President with","with his","his family","family hostage","Help is","is on","on the","the way","way when","when the","the drummer","drummer of","of a","a heavy","heavy metal","metal warm-up","warm-up band","band ,",", an","an ex-bad","ex-bad ass","ass biker","biker played","played by","by Lundgren","Lundgren ,",", and","and a","a young","young Russian","Russian F.S.B.","F.S.B. agent","agent team","team up","up to","to fight","fight back","But our","our two","two heroes","heroes are","are seriously","seriously outnumbered","outnumbered and","and things","things are","are n't","n't as","as simple","simple as","as they","they appear","appear when","when old","old ghosts","ghosts from","from the","the Soviet","Soviet Union","Union appear","appear to","to haunt","haunt the","the present","present in","in this","this fast","fast paced","paced action","action piece"]}

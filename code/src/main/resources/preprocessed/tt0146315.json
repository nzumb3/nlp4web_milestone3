{"title":"Tom's Midnight Garden","plot":"Young Tom Long is forced to stay with his kindly Aunt and Uncle while his brother recovers from a bout of the measles. At their flat, he is disappointed to find there is no garden to play in; but his disappointment turns to wonder when he discovers a magical garden which only appears at night when an old grandfather clock strikes thirteen. His nightly excursions to this beautiful garden become even more interesting when he realises that the people he meets cannot see him - except one young girl named Hattie.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Family"],"stems":["Young","Tom","Long","is","forc","to","stay","with","his","kind","Aunt","and","Uncle","while","his","brother","recov","from","a","bout","of","the","measl",".","At","their","flat",",","he","is","disappoint","to","find","there","is","no","garden","to","play","in",";","but","his","disappoint","turn","to","wonder","when","he","discov","a","magic","garden","which","onli","appear","at","night","when","an","old","grandfath","clock","strike","thirteen",".","His","night","excurs","to","this","beauti","garden","becom","even","more","interest","when","he","realis","that","the","peopl","he","meet","can","not","see","him","-","except","one","young","girl","name","Hatti","."],"lemmas":["Young","Tom","Long","be","force","to","stay","with","he","kindly","Aunt","and","Uncle","while","he","brother","recover","from","a","bout","of","the","measles",".","at","they","flat",",","he","be","disappoint","to","find","there","be","no","garden","to","play","in",";","but","he","disappointment","turn","to","wonder","when","he","discover","a","magical","garden","which","only","appear","at","night","when","a","old","grandfather","clock","strike","thirteen",".","he","nightly","excursion","to","this","beautiful","garden","become","even","more","interesting","when","he","realise","that","the","people","he","meet","can","not","see","he","-","except","one","young","girl","name","Hattie","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Young Tom Long","Tom Long is","Long is forced","is forced to","forced to stay","to stay with","stay with his","with his kindly","his kindly Aunt","kindly Aunt and","Aunt and Uncle","and Uncle while","Uncle while his","while his brother","his brother recovers","brother recovers from","recovers from a","from a bout","a bout of","bout of the","of the measles","At their flat","their flat ,","flat , he",", he is","he is disappointed","is disappointed to","disappointed to find","to find there","find there is","there is no","is no garden","no garden to","garden to play","to play in","play in ;","in ; but","; but his","but his disappointment","his disappointment turns","disappointment turns to","turns to wonder","to wonder when","wonder when he","when he discovers","he discovers a","discovers a magical","a magical garden","magical garden which","garden which only","which only appears","only appears at","appears at night","at night when","night when an","when an old","an old grandfather","old grandfather clock","grandfather clock strikes","clock strikes thirteen","His nightly excursions","nightly excursions to","excursions to this","to this beautiful","this beautiful garden","beautiful garden become","garden become even","become even more","even more interesting","more interesting when","interesting when he","when he realises","he realises that","realises that the","that the people","the people he","people he meets","he meets can","meets can not","can not see","not see him","see him -","him - except","- except one","except one young","one young girl","young girl named","girl named Hattie"],"2grams":["Young Tom","Tom Long","Long is","is forced","forced to","to stay","stay with","with his","his kindly","kindly Aunt","Aunt and","and Uncle","Uncle while","while his","his brother","brother recovers","recovers from","from a","a bout","bout of","of the","the measles","At their","their flat","flat ,",", he","he is","is disappointed","disappointed to","to find","find there","there is","is no","no garden","garden to","to play","play in","in ;","; but","but his","his disappointment","disappointment turns","turns to","to wonder","wonder when","when he","he discovers","discovers a","a magical","magical garden","garden which","which only","only appears","appears at","at night","night when","when an","an old","old grandfather","grandfather clock","clock strikes","strikes thirteen","His nightly","nightly excursions","excursions to","to this","this beautiful","beautiful garden","garden become","become even","even more","more interesting","interesting when","when he","he realises","realises that","that the","the people","people he","he meets","meets can","can not","not see","see him","him -","- except","except one","one young","young girl","girl named","named Hattie"]}

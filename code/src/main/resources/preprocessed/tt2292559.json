{"title":"All Hallows Evil: Lord of the Harvest","plot":"The sleepy town of Hallowed Hill is known by many as the Halloween capital of the world because of its history, and because of its Pagan origins. People from all around come to visit the town on the night of All Hallows Eve. 200 years ago, on Halloween, a great evil was unleashed on the town by a witch who dabbled in the black arts. After a long night of Halloween Mayhem, brought on by this terrible evil, a select group of towns folk were able to stop the witch, and dispatch the evil back into the darkness from whence it came. An ancient Pagan book was what the witch used to release the evil, and what the townsfolk used to stop it. After that terrible night, the book was hidden away so that it could never again be used to unleash the dark forces upon the town. Now 200 years later a young girl finds the book archived deep in the old cellar of the local library, and with the help of her wicked foster mother the two again rele ase the evil Sam Hain from his Hell bound prison to once again wreak havoc on Halloween night. The question is, can the town once again join together to stop the evil, or will Hallowed Hill be completely devoured by the Lord of the Harvest.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["The","sleepi","town","of","Hallow","Hill","is","known","by","mani","as","the","Halloween","capit","of","the","world","becaus","of","it","histori",",","and","becaus","of","it","Pagan","origin",".","Peopl","from","all","around","come","to","visit","the","town","on","the","night","of","All","Hallow","Eve",".","200","year","ago",",","on","Halloween",",","a","great","evil","was","unleash","on","the","town","by","a","witch","who","dabbl","in","the","black","art",".","After","a","long","night","of","Halloween","Mayhem",",","brought","on","by","this","terribl","evil",",","a","select","group","of","town","folk","were","abl","to","stop","the","witch",",","and","dispatch","the","evil","back","into","the","dark","from","whenc","it","came",".","An","ancient","Pagan","book","was","what","the","witch","use","to","releas","the","evil",",","and","what","the","townsfolk","use","to","stop","it",".","After","that","terribl","night",",","the","book","was","hidden","away","so","that","it","could","never","again","be","use","to","unleash","the","dark","forc","upon","the","town",".","Now","200","year","later","a","young","girl","find","the","book","archiv","deep","in","the","old","cellar","of","the","local","librari",",","and","with","the","help","of","her","wick","foster","mother","the","two","again","rele","ase","the","evil","Sam","Hain","from","his","Hell","bound","prison","to","onc","again","wreak","havoc","on","Halloween","night",".","The","question","is",",","can","the","town","onc","again","join","togeth","to","stop","the","evil",",","or","will","Hallow","Hill","be","complet","devour","by","the","Lord","of","the","Harvest","."],"lemmas":["the","sleepy","town","of","Hallowed","Hill","be","know","by","many","as","the","Halloween","capital","of","the","world","because","of","its","history",",","and","because","of","its","Pagan","origin",".","people","from","all","around","come","to","visit","the","town","on","the","night","of","All","Hallows","Eve",".","200","year","ago",",","on","Halloween",",","a","great","evil","be","unleash","on","the","town","by","a","witch","who","dabble","in","the","black","art",".","after","a","long","night","of","Halloween","Mayhem",",","bring","on","by","this","terrible","evil",",","a","select","group","of","town","folk","be","able","to","stop","the","witch",",","and","dispatch","the","evil","back","into","the","darkness","from","whence","it","come",".","a","ancient","pagan","book","be","what","the","witch","use","to","release","the","evil",",","and","what","the","townsfolk","use","to","stop","it",".","after","that","terrible","night",",","the","book","be","hide","away","so","that","it","could","never","again","be","use","to","unleash","the","dark","force","upon","the","town",".","now","200","year","later","a","young","girl","find","the","book","archive","deep","in","the","old","cellar","of","the","local","library",",","and","with","the","help","of","she","wicked","foster","mother","the","two","again","rele","ase","the","evil","Sam","Hain","from","he","Hell","bind","prison","to","once","again","wreak","havoc","on","Halloween","night",".","the","question","be",",","can","the","town","once","again","join","together","to","stop","the","evil",",","or","will","Hallowed","Hill","be","completely","devour","by","the","Lord","of","the","Harvest","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

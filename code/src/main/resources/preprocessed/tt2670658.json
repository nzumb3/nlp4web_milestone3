{"title":"Women of War","plot":"How many women would join today's military if they knew that most of them would be sexually assaulted by their fellow comrades? 'Women of War' is an in-depth look at one of the best kept secrets in the military; the issue of Military Sexual Trauma or MST. A phrase commonly known in the military but not in the civilian world. We traveled the country interviewing service women and veterans from Vietnam to Iraq and Afghanistan. We were shocked to hear their stories and many were telling their story for the very first time.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["How","mani","women","would","join","today","'s","militari","if","they","knew","that","most","of","them","would","be","sexual","assault","by","their","fellow","comrad","?","'","Women","of","War","'","is","an","in-depth","look","at","one","of","the","best","kept","secret","in","the","militari",";","the","issu","of","Militari","Sexual","Trauma","or","MST",".","A","phrase","common","known","in","the","militari","but","not","in","the","civilian","world",".","We","travel","the","countri","interview","servic","women","and","veteran","from","Vietnam","to","Iraq","and","Afghanistan",".","We","were","shock","to","hear","their","stori","and","mani","were","tell","their","stori","for","the","veri","first","time","."],"lemmas":["how","many","woman","would","join","today","'s","military","if","they","know","that","most","of","they","would","be","sexually","assault","by","they","fellow","comrade","?","'","woman","of","war","'","be","a","in-depth","look","at","one","of","the","best","keep","secret","in","the","military",";","the","issue","of","Military","Sexual","Trauma","or","MST",".","a","phrase","commonly","know","in","the","military","but","not","in","the","civilian","world",".","we","travel","the","country","interview","service","woman","and","veteran","from","Vietnam","to","Iraq","and","Afghanistan",".","we","be","shock","to","hear","they","story","and","many","be","tell","they","story","for","the","very","first","time","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["How many women","many women would","women would join","would join today","join today 's","today 's military","'s military if","military if they","if they knew","they knew that","knew that most","that most of","most of them","of them would","them would be","would be sexually","be sexually assaulted","sexually assaulted by","assaulted by their","by their fellow","their fellow comrades","fellow comrades ?","comrades ?

{"title":"The Lithium Conspiracy","plot":"In the 21th century getting hold of natural resources of emerging countries, is no matter of war--it is a matter of complex financial actions. And the power of governments behind the events has been replaced by the power of holding companies. Nowadays you don't conquer a country. You buy it. \"Short story of long betrayals\" is again set in the Republic of Queimada, where in the \"Salar de Queimada\" (a salt lake) lies 50% of lithium in the whole world. Not surprisingly, there is an international interest in its fate and a breathless fight to seize it.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["In","the","21th","centuri","get","hold","of","natur","resourc","of","emerg","countri",",","is","no","matter","of","war","--","it","is","a","matter","of","complex","financi","action",".","And","the","power","of","govern","behind","the","event","has","been","replac","by","the","power","of","hold","compani",".","Nowaday","you","do","n't","conquer","a","countri",".","You","buy","it",".","\"","Short","stori","of","long","betray","\"","is","again","set","in","the","Republ","of","Queimada",",","where","in","the","\"","Salar","de","Queimada","\"","(","a","salt","lake",")","lie","50","%","of","lithium","in","the","whole","world",".","Not","surpris",",","there","is","an","intern","interest","in","it","fate","and","a","breathless","fight","to","seiz","it","."],"lemmas":["in","the","21th","century","get","hold","of","natural","resource","of","emerge","country",",","be","no","matter","of","war","--","it","be","a","matter","of","complex","financial","action",".","and","the","power","of","government","behind","the","event","have","be","replace","by","the","power","of","hold","company",".","nowadays","you","do","not","conquer","a","country",".","you","buy","it",".","``","short","story","of","long","betrayal","''","be","again","set","in","the","Republic","of","Queimada",",","where","in","the","``","salar","de","queimada","''","-lrb-","a","salt","lake","-rrb-","lie","50","%","of","lithium","in","the","whole","world",".","not","surprisingly",",","there","be","a","international","interest","in","its","fate","and","a","breathless","fight","to","seize","it","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the 21th","the 21th century","21th century getting","century getting hold","getting hold of","hold of natural","of natural resources","natural resources of","resources of emerging","of emerging countries","emerging countries ,","countries , is",", is no","is no matter","no matter of","matter of war","of war --","war -- it","-- it is","it is a","is a matter","a matter of","matter of complex","of complex financial","complex financial actions","And the power","the power of","power of governments","of governments behind","governments behind the","behind the events","the events has","events has been","has been replaced","been replaced by","replaced by the","by the power","the power of","power of holding","of holding companies","Nowadays you do","you do n't","do n't conquer","n't conquer a","conquer a country","You buy it","\" Short story","Short story of","story of long","of long betrayals","long betrayals \"","betrayals \" is","\" is again","is again set","again set in","set in the","in the Republic","the Republic of","Republic of Queimada","of Queimada ,","Queimada , where",", where in","where in the","in the \"","the \" Salar","\" Salar de","Salar de Queimada","de Queimada \"","Queimada \" (","\" ( a","( a salt","a salt lake","salt lake )","lake ) lies",") lies 50","lies 50 %","50 % of","% of lithium","of lithium in","lithium in the","in the whole","the whole world","Not surprisingly ,","surprisingly , there",", there is","there is an","is an international","an international interest","international interest in","interest in its","in its fate","its fate and","fate and a","and a breathless","a breathless fight","breathless fight to","fight to seize","to seize it"],"2grams":["In the","the 21th","21th century","century getting","getting hold","hold of","of natural","natural resources","resources of","of emerging","emerging countries","countries ,",", is","is no","no matter","matter of","of war","war --","-- it","it is","is a","a matter","matter of","of complex","complex financial","financial actions","And the","the power","power of","of governments","governments behind","behind the","the events","events has","has been","been replaced","replaced by","by the","the power","power of","of holding","holding companies","Nowadays you","you do","do n't","n't conquer","conquer a","a country","You buy","buy it","\" Short","Short story","story of","of long","long betrayals","betrayals \"","\" is","is again","again set","set in","in the","the Republic","Republic of","of Queimada","Queimada ,",", where","where in","in the","the \"","\" Salar","Salar de","de Queimada","Queimada \"","\" (","( a","a salt","salt lake","lake )",") lies","lies 50","50 %","% of","of lithium","lithium in","in the","the whole","whole world","Not surprisingly","surprisingly ,",", there","there is","is an","an international","international interest","interest in","in its","its fate","fate and","and a","a breathless","breathless fight","fight to","to seize","seize it"]}

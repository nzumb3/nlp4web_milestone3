{"title":"Final Approach","plot":"Col. Jason Halsey (USAF) has just had a terrible air disaster and can't remember a thing -- even his name. Now he must go head-to-head with the psychiatrist Dr. Gottlieb as his only chance to recover his memory. Col. Halsey is a stealth fighter test pilot in the highly classified project Black Magic. Is Dr. Gottlieb a helping professional or is he a counter-intelligence agent sent to debrief Halsey? This movie draws considerable footage from the Lockheed Corp. documentary \"Blackbird: The Movie\" for its background material on the SR-71 spy plane.","genres":["Sci-Fi"," Thriller"],"stems":["Col.","Jason","Halsey","(","USAF",")","has","just","had","a","terribl","air","disast","and","ca","n't","rememb","a","thing","--","even","his","name",".","Now","he","must","go","head-to-head","with","the","psychiatrist","Dr.","Gottlieb","as","his","onli","chanc","to","recov","his","memori",".","Col.","Halsey","is","a","stealth","fighter","test","pilot","in","the","high","classifi","project","Black","Magic",".","Is","Dr.","Gottlieb","a","help","profession","or","is","he","a","counter-intellig","agent","sent","to","debrief","Halsey","?","This","movi","draw","consider","footag","from","the","Lockhe","Corp.","documentari","\"","Blackbird",":","The","Movi","\"","for","it","background","materi","on","the","SR-71","spi","plane","."],"lemmas":["Col.","Jason","Halsey","-lrb-","USAF","-rrb-","have","just","have","a","terrible","air","disaster","and","can","not","remember","a","thing","--","even","he","name",".","now","he","must","go","head-to-head","with","the","psychiatrist","Dr.","Gottlieb","as","he","only","chance","to","recover","he","memory",".","Col.","Halsey","be","a","stealth","fighter","test","pilot","in","the","highly","classify","project","Black","Magic",".","be","Dr.","Gottlieb","a","help","professional","or","be","he","a","counter-intelligence","agent","send","to","debrief","Halsey","?","this","movie","draw","considerable","footage","from","the","Lockheed","Corp.","documentary","``","Blackbird",":","the","movie","''","for","its","background","material","on","the","sr-71","spy","plane","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Col.

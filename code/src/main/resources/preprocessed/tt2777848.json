{"title":"Kampen mot vekten","plot":"There will be soon 1 million overweight people in Norway, how many will there be in 2020? The documentary film is based on interviews of persons suffering from being overweight, and about the people who have taken a grip on their situation. How does it feel to be bullied because you look different? Why choose an operation instead of a work out? What happens to us when we become overweight? What can we do differently to get the number of overweight to reduce in the future.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["There","will","be","soon","1","million","overweight","peopl","in","Norway",",","how","mani","will","there","be","in","2020","?","The","documentari","film","is","base","on","interview","of","person","suffer","from","be","overweight",",","and","about","the","peopl","who","have","taken","a","grip","on","their","situat",".","How","doe","it","feel","to","be","bulli","becaus","you","look","differ","?","Whi","choos","an","oper","instead","of","a","work","out","?","What","happen","to","us","when","we","becom","overweight","?","What","can","we","do","differ","to","get","the","number","of","overweight","to","reduc","in","the","futur","."],"lemmas":["there","will","be","soon","1","million","overweight","people","in","Norway",",","how","many","will","there","be","in","2020","?","the","documentary","film","be","base","on","interview","of","person","suffer","from","be","overweight",",","and","about","the","people","who","have","take","a","grip","on","they","situation",".","how","do","it","feel","to","be","bully","because","you","look","different","?","why","choose","a","operation","instead","of","a","work","out","?","what","happen","to","we","when","we","become","overweight","?","what","can","we","do","differently","to","get","the","number","of","overweight","to","reduce","in","the","future","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["There will be","will be soon","be soon 1","soon 1 million","1 million overweight","million overweight people","overweight people in","people in Norway","in Norway ,","Norway , how",", how many","how many will","many will there","will there be","there be in","be in 2020","The documentary film","documentary film is","film is based","is based on","based on interviews","on interviews of","interviews of persons","of persons suffering","persons suffering from","suffering from being","from being overweight","being overweight ,","overweight , and",", and about","and about the","about the people","the people who","people who have","who have taken","have taken a","taken a grip","a grip on","grip on their","on their situation","How does it","does it feel","it feel to","feel to be","to be bullied","be bullied because","bullied because you","because you look","you look different","Why choose an","choose an operation","an operation instead","operation instead of","instead of a","of a work","a work out","What happens to","happens to us","to us when","us when we","when we become","we become overweight","What can we","can we do","we do differently","do differently to","differently to get","to get the","get the number","the number of","number of overweight","of overweight to","overweight to reduce","to reduce in","reduce in the","in the future"],"2grams":["There will","will be","be soon","soon 1","1 million","million overweight","overweight people","people in","in Norway","Norway ,",", how","how many","many will","will there","there be","be in","in 2020","The documentary","documentary film","film is","is based","based on","on interviews","interviews of","of persons","persons suffering","suffering from","from being","being overweight","overweight ,",", and","and about","about the","the people","people who","who have","have taken","taken a","a grip","grip on","on their","their situation","How does","does it","it feel","feel to","to be","be bullied","bullied because","because you","you look","look different","Why choose","choose an","an operation","operation instead","instead of","of a","a work","work out","What happens","happens to","to us","us when","when we","we become","become overweight","What can","can we","we do","do differently","differently to","to get","get the","the number","number of","of overweight","overweight to","to reduce","reduce in","in the","the future"]}

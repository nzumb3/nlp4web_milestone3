{"title":"The Girl Who Lived","plot":"The Girl Who Lived is a visually stunning exploration through the lives of five young characters in war-torn Europe. Stylistically unique; the film is inspired by the true account of a young girl's survival in the Gas Chambers of Auschwitz Birkenau. The film uses ritual, mythology and fairy tale to present a dream-like journey through some of the darkest themes of human history. In a series of episodic stories, we are shown a picture of the Holocaust as a collective enterprise of persecution and extermination. The Girl Who Lived is a visceral, confronting, and emotive story, told with great beauty and dreamlike symbolism.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","Girl","Who","Live","is","a","visual","stun","explor","through","the","live","of","five","young","charact","in","war-torn","Europ",".","Stylist","uniqu",";","the","film","is","inspir","by","the","true","account","of","a","young","girl","'s","surviv","in","the","Gas","Chamber","of","Auschwitz","Birkenau",".","The","film","use","ritual",",","mytholog","and","fairi","tale","to","present","a","dream-lik","journey","through","some","of","the","darkest","theme","of","human","histori",".","In","a","seri","of","episod","stori",",","we","are","shown","a","pictur","of","the","Holocaust","as","a","collect","enterpris","of","persecut","and","extermin",".","The","Girl","Who","Live","is","a","viscer",",","confront",",","and","emot","stori",",","told","with","great","beauti","and","dreamlik","symbol","."],"lemmas":["the","Girl","who","live","be","a","visually","stunning","exploration","through","the","life","of","five","young","character","in","war-torn","Europe",".","stylistically","unique",";","the","film","be","inspire","by","the","true","account","of","a","young","girl","'s","survival","in","the","Gas","Chambers","of","Auschwitz","Birkenau",".","the","film","use","ritual",",","mythology","and","fairy","tale","to","present","a","dream-like","journey","through","some","of","the","darkest","theme","of","human","history",".","in","a","series","of","episodic","story",",","we","be","show","a","picture","of","the","Holocaust","as","a","collective","enterprise","of","persecution","and","extermination",".","the","Girl","who","live","be","a","visceral",",","confront",",","and","emotive","story",",","tell","with","great","beauty","and","dreamlike","symbolism","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Girl Who","Girl Who Lived","Who Lived is","Lived is a","is a visually","a visually stunning","visually stunning exploration","stunning exploration through","exploration through the","through the lives","the lives of","lives of five","of five young","five young characters","young characters in","characters in war-torn","in war-torn Europe","Stylistically unique ;","unique ;

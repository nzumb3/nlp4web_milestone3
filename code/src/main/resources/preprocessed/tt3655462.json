{"title":"Fishermen's Conversations","plot":"Fishermen's Conversations is a study of a Mediterranean island, a young woman's ode to her deceased Grandfather and a portrait of a group of men struggling to keep traditional fishing alive in a rapidly changing landscape. Using minimum dialogue and narration, this partly fly-on-the-wall documentary laments the destruction caused by tourism in Croatia and the greed that invites it. Simultaneously, it celebrates the conservation of a way of life that preserves the identity of the island, through journeys with fishermen as they take to the seas to make their living. The result provides the viewer with evidence that not all is lost if we allow time to stay still once in a while.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Fishermen","'s","Convers","is","a","studi","of","a","Mediterranean","island",",","a","young","woman","'s","ode","to","her","deceas","Grandfath","and","a","portrait","of","a","group","of","men","struggl","to","keep","tradit","fish","aliv","in","a","rapid","chang","landscap",".","Using","minimum","dialogu","and","narrat",",","this","part","fly-on-the-wal","documentari","lament","the","destruct","caus","by","tourism","in","Croatia","and","the","greed","that","invit","it",".","Simultan",",","it","celebr","the","conserv","of","a","way","of","life","that","preserv","the","ident","of","the","island",",","through","journey","with","fishermen","as","they","take","to","the","sea","to","make","their","live",".","The","result","provid","the","viewer","with","evid","that","not","all","is","lost","if","we","allow","time","to","stay","still","onc","in","a","while","."],"lemmas":["Fishermen","'s","conversation","be","a","study","of","a","mediterranean","island",",","a","young","woman","'s","ode","to","she","deceased","grandfather","and","a","portrait","of","a","group","of","man","struggle","to","keep","traditional","fishing","alive","in","a","rapidly","change","landscape",".","use","minimum","dialogue","and","narration",",","this","partly","fly-on-the-wall","documentary","lament","the","destruction","cause","by","tourism","in","Croatia","and","the","greed","that","invite","it",".","simultaneously",",","it","celebrate","the","conservation","of","a","way","of","life","that","preserve","the","identity","of","the","island",",","through","journey","with","fisherman","as","they","take","to","the","sea","to","make","they","living",".","the","result","provide","the","viewer","with","evidence","that","not","all","be","lose","if","we","allow","time","to","stay","still","once","in","a","while","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fishermen

{"title":"Some Na Ceremonies","plot":"Some Na Ceremonies, created by Na directors Onci Archei and Ruheng Duoji and produced by Tami Blumenfield, is a montage of five short pieces. Representations of Na people (a.k.a. Moso) usually center on their matrilineal kinship system, overlooking religion, a central aspect in the lives of Na people. This film's directors decided to intervene in this omission, capturing important ceremonies on digital video. Ranging from a film festival, to a pig-sacrifice ceremony, to a three-day funerary ceremony, the ceremonies presented here are rivetingly elaborate and spiritually meaningful. By avoiding interpretation or voice-over narration but using carefully crafted visual images, the film emphasizes the partiality of any representational attempt. The ceremonies presented are but a glimpse of a much larger ceremonial and spiritual world.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Some","Na","Ceremoni",",","creat","by","Na","director","Onci","Archei","and","Ruheng","Duoji","and","produc","by","Tami","Blumenfield",",","is","a","montag","of","five","short","piec",".","Represent","of","Na","peopl","(","a.k.a.","Moso",")","usual","center","on","their","matrilin","kinship","system",",","overlook","religion",",","a","central","aspect","in","the","live","of","Na","peopl",".","This","film","'s","director","decid","to","interven","in","this","omiss",",","captur","import","ceremoni","on","digit","video",".","Rang","from","a","film","festiv",",","to","a","pig-sacrific","ceremoni",",","to","a","three-day","funerari","ceremoni",",","the","ceremoni","present","here","are","rivet","elabor","and","spiritu","meaning",".","By","avoid","interpret","or","voice-ov","narrat","but","use","care","craft","visual","imag",",","the","film","emphas","the","partial","of","ani","represent","attempt",".","The","ceremoni","present","are","but","a","glimps","of","a","much","larger","ceremoni","and","spiritu","world","."],"lemmas":["some","Na","Ceremonies",",","create","by","na","director","Onci","Archei","and","Ruheng","Duoji","and","produce","by","Tami","Blumenfield",",","be","a","montage","of","five","short","piece",".","representation","of","na","people","-lrb-","a.k.a.","Moso","-rrb-","usually","center","on","they","matrilineal","kinship","system",",","overlook","religion",",","a","central","aspect","in","the","life","of","na","people",".","this","film","'s","director","decide","to","intervene","in","this","omission",",","capture","important","ceremony","on","digital","video",".","range","from","a","film","festival",",","to","a","pig-sacrifice","ceremony",",","to","a","three-day","funerary","ceremony",",","the","ceremony","present","here","be","rivetingly","elaborate","and","spiritually","meaningful",".","by","avoid","interpretation","or","voice-over","narration","but","use","carefully","craft","visual","image",",","the","film","emphasize","the","partiality","of","any","representational","attempt",".","the","ceremony","present","be","but","a","glimpse","of","a","much","larger","ceremonial","and","spiritual","world","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Some Na Ceremonies","Na Ceremonies ,","Ceremonies , created",", created by","created by Na","by Na directors","Na directors Onci","directors Onci Archei","Onci Archei and","Archei and Ruheng","and Ruheng Duoji","Ruheng Duoji and","Duoji and produced","and produced by","produced by Tami","by Tami Blumenfield","Tami Blumenfield ,","Blumenfield , is",", is a","is a montage","a montage of","montage of five","of five short","five short pieces","Representations of Na","of Na people","Na people (","people ( a.k.a.","( a.k.a.

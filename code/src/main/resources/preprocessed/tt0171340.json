{"title":"Getting to Know You","plot":"Two teens tell stories about their lives while waiting at a bus stop. Judith and her brother have suffered a nomadic existence with their semi-professional ballroom dancing parents, who are now past their prime. Jimmy tells two tales. One about two women who meet up with a high-roller in Atlantic City. The second is about an infertile woman's marriage to a religious fanatic. The three stories are told in anthology style. Meanwhile, bus station denizens wander in and out. Chief among these are a bag lady and a fat cop.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","teen","tell","stori","about","their","live","while","wait","at","a","bus","stop",".","Judith","and","her","brother","have","suffer","a","nomad","exist","with","their","semi-profession","ballroom","danc","parent",",","who","are","now","past","their","prime",".","Jimmi","tell","two","tale",".","One","about","two","women","who","meet","up","with","a","high-rol","in","Atlantic","Citi",".","The","second","is","about","an","infertil","woman","'s","marriag","to","a","religi","fanat",".","The","three","stori","are","told","in","antholog","style",".","Meanwhil",",","bus","station","denizen","wander","in","and","out",".","Chief","among","these","are","a","bag","ladi","and","a","fat","cop","."],"lemmas":["two","teens","tell","story","about","they","life","while","wait","at","a","bus","stop",".","Judith","and","she","brother","have","suffer","a","nomadic","existence","with","they","semi-professional","ballroom","dancing","parent",",","who","be","now","past","they","prime",".","Jimmy","tell","two","tale",".","one","about","two","woman","who","meet","up","with","a","high-roller","in","Atlantic","City",".","the","second","be","about","a","infertile","woman","'s","marriage","to","a","religious","fanatic",".","the","three","story","be","tell","in","anthology","style",".","meanwhile",",","bus","station","denizen","wander","in","and","out",".","chief","among","these","be","a","bag","lady","and","a","fat","cop","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Two teens tell","teens tell stories","tell stories about","stories about their","about their lives","their lives while","lives while waiting","while waiting at","waiting at a","at a bus","a bus stop","Judith and her","and her brother","her brother have","brother have suffered","have suffered a","suffered a nomadic","a nomadic existence","nomadic existence with","existence with their","with their semi-professional","their semi-professional ballroom","semi-professional ballroom dancing","ballroom dancing parents","dancing parents ,","parents , who",", who are","who are now","are now past","now past their","past their prime","Jimmy tells two","tells two tales","One about two","about two women","two women who","women who meet","who meet up","meet up with","up with a","with a high-roller","a high-roller in","high-roller in Atlantic","in Atlantic City","The second is","second is about","is about an","about an infertile","an infertile woman","infertile woman 's","woman 's marriage","'s marriage to","marriage to a","to a religious","a religious fanatic","The three stories","three stories are","stories are told","are told in","told in anthology","in anthology style","Meanwhile , bus",", bus station","bus station denizens","station denizens wander","denizens wander in","wander in and","in and out","Chief among these","among these are","these are a","are a bag","a bag lady","bag lady and","lady and a","and a fat","a fat cop"],"2grams":["Two teens","teens tell","tell stories","stories about","about their","their lives","lives while","while waiting","waiting at","at a","a bus","bus stop","Judith and","and her","her brother","brother have","have suffered","suffered a","a nomadic","nomadic existence","existence with","with their","their semi-professional","semi-professional ballroom","ballroom dancing","dancing parents","parents ,",", who","who are","are now","now past","past their","their prime","Jimmy tells","tells two","two tales","One about","about two","two women","women who","who meet","meet up","up with","with a","a high-roller","high-roller in","in Atlantic","Atlantic City","The second","second is","is about","about an","an infertile","infertile woman","woman 's","'s marriage","marriage to","to a","a religious","religious fanatic","The three","three stories","stories are","are told","told in","in anthology","anthology style","Meanwhile ,",", bus","bus station","station denizens","denizens wander","wander in","in and","and out","Chief among","among these","these are","are a","a bag","bag lady","lady and","and a","a fat","fat cop"]}

{"title":"The Minion","plot":"New York, Christmas Eve, 1999 - at the dawn of the new millennium - a subway construction crew unearths an eight hundred year old Celtic skeleton and a mysterious key. Archeologist Karen Goodleaf is called in to determine the meaning of the discovery. News of the discovery reaches a Middle East monastery where the warrior monks knowns as the Knights Templer - an ancient sect entrusted with protecting holy relics - choose their best pupil, Lukas (Dolph Lundgren) to face the diabolical threat. As Lukas races to New York, an evil Minion seizes Karen and uses its body like a parasite and host. Lukas arrives just in time to rescue Karen and despatch the Minion. The Minion takes hold of another host - revealing that it is immortal. As it cuts a path of destruction through the city, decimating a parking garage and leaving a trail of death, Karen realizes that the Minion can't be killed - but only delayed from finding a new host.","genres":["Action"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["New","York",",","Christma","Eve",",","1999","-","at","the","dawn","of","the","new","millennium","-","a","subway","construct","crew","unearth","an","eight","hundr","year","old","Celtic","skeleton","and","a","mysteri","key",".","Archeologist","Karen","Goodleaf","is","call","in","to","determin","the","mean","of","the","discoveri",".","New","of","the","discoveri","reach","a","Middl","East","monasteri","where","the","warrior","monk","known","as","the","Knight","Templer","-","an","ancient","sect","entrust","with","protect","holi","relic","-","choos","their","best","pupil",",","Luka","(","Dolph","Lundgren",")","to","face","the","diabol","threat",".","As","Luka","race","to","New","York",",","an","evil","Minion","seiz","Karen","and","use","it","bodi","like","a","parasit","and","host",".","Luka","arriv","just","in","time","to","rescu","Karen","and","despatch","the","Minion",".","The","Minion","take","hold","of","anoth","host","-","reveal","that","it","is","immort",".","As","it","cut","a","path","of","destruct","through","the","citi",",","decim","a","park","garag","and","leav","a","trail","of","death",",","Karen","realiz","that","the","Minion","ca","n't","be","kill","-","but","onli","delay","from","find","a","new","host","."],"lemmas":["New","York",",","Christmas","Eve",",","1999","-","at","the","dawn","of","the","new","millennium","-","a","subway","construction","crew","unearth","a","eight","hundred","year","old","celtic","skeleton","and","a","mysterious","key",".","Archeologist","Karen","Goodleaf","be","call","in","to","determine","the","meaning","of","the","discovery",".","news","of","the","discovery","reach","a","Middle","East","monastery","where","the","warrior","monk","known","as","the","Knights","Templer","-","a","ancient","sect","entrust","with","protect","holy","relic","-","choose","they","best","pupil",",","Lukas","-lrb-","Dolph","Lundgren","-rrb-","to","face","the","diabolical","threat",".","as","Lukas","race","to","New","York",",","a","evil","Minion","seize","Karen","and","use","its","body","like","a","parasite","and","host",".","Lukas","arrive","just","in","time","to","rescue","Karen","and","despatch","the","Minion",".","the","Minion","take","hold","of","another","host","-","reveal","that","it","be","immortal",".","as","it","cut","a","path","of","destruction","through","the","city",",","decimate","a","parking","garage","and","leave","a","trail","of","death",",","Karen","realize","that","the","Minion","can","not","be","kill","-","but","only","delay","from","find","a","new","host","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["New York ,","York , Christmas",", Christmas Eve","Christmas Eve ,","Eve , 1999",", 1999 -","1999 -

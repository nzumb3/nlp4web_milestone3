{"title":"The Smokers","plot":"Looking back a few years later, Jefferson Roth tells the story of the last few weeks of her senior year at a Wisconsin boarding school when she and two girl friends, the naive Lisa and the outrageous Karen, use a pistol to turn the tables on men (boys, really) who make them feel weak, put upon, and desired only as sex objects. They stage a sexual assault on David, who's been hot and cold toward Lisa. Meanwhile, each of the three keeps trying to find love even while Karen wants to attack others: Jefferson falls for a cowboy singer, ignoring a boy she grew up with, Jeremy, who likes her; Lisa tries again to reach David; Karen puts herself at risk with an older man. Can it end well?","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Look","back","a","few","year","later",",","Jefferson","Roth","tell","the","stori","of","the","last","few","week","of","her","senior","year","at","a","Wisconsin","board","school","when","she","and","two","girl","friend",",","the","naiv","Lisa","and","the","outrag","Karen",",","use","a","pistol","to","turn","the","tabl","on","men","(","boy",",","realli",")","who","make","them","feel","weak",",","put","upon",",","and","desir","onli","as","sex","object",".","They","stage","a","sexual","assault","on","David",",","who","'s","been","hot","and","cold","toward","Lisa",".","Meanwhil",",","each","of","the","three","keep","tri","to","find","love","even","while","Karen","want","to","attack","other",":","Jefferson","fall","for","a","cowboy","singer",",","ignor","a","boy","she","grew","up","with",",","Jeremi",",","who","like","her",";","Lisa","tri","again","to","reach","David",";","Karen","put","herself","at","risk","with","an","older","man",".","Can","it","end","well","?"],"lemmas":["look","back","a","few","year","later",",","Jefferson","Roth","tell","the","story","of","the","last","few","week","of","she","senior","year","at","a","Wisconsin","board","school","when","she","and","two","girl","friend",",","the","naive","Lisa","and","the","outrageous","Karen",",","use","a","pistol","to","turn","the","table","on","man","-lrb-","boy",",","really","-rrb-","who","make","they","feel","weak",",","put","upon",",","and","desire","only","as","sex","object",".","they","stage","a","sexual","assault","on","David",",","who","be","be","hot","and","cold","toward","Lisa",".","meanwhile",",","each","of","the","three","keep","try","to","find","love","even","while","Karen","want","to","attack","other",":","Jefferson","fall","for","a","cowboy","singer",",","ignore","a","boy","she","grow","up","with",",","Jeremy",",","who","like","she",";","Lisa","try","again","to","reach","David",";","Karen","put","herself","at","risk","with","a","older","man",".","can","it","end","well","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Looking back a","back a few","a few years","few years later","years later ,","later , Jefferson",", Jefferson Roth","Jefferson Roth tells","Roth tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of the","of the last","the last few","last few weeks","few weeks of","weeks of her","of her senior","her senior year","senior year at","year at a","at a Wisconsin","a Wisconsin boarding","Wisconsin boarding school","boarding school when","school when she","when she and","she and two","and two girl","two girl friends","girl friends ,","friends , the",", the naive","the naive Lisa","naive Lisa and","Lisa and the","and the outrageous","the outrageous Karen","outrageous Karen ,","Karen , use",", use a","use a pistol","a pistol to","pistol to turn","to turn the","turn the tables","the tables on","tables on men","on men (","men ( boys","( boys ,","boys , really",", really )","really ) who",") who make","who make them","make them feel","them feel weak","feel weak ,","weak , put",", put upon","put upon ,","upon , and",", and desired","and desired only","desired only as","only as sex","as sex objects","They stage a","stage a sexual","a sexual assault","sexual assault on","assault on David","on David ,","David , who",", who 's","who 's been","'s been hot","been hot and","hot and cold","and cold toward","cold toward Lisa","Meanwhile , each",", each of","each of the","of the three","the three keeps","three keeps trying","keeps trying to","trying to find","to find love","find love even","love even while","even while Karen","while Karen wants","Karen wants to","wants to attack","to attack others","attack others :","others : Jefferson",": Jefferson falls","Jefferson falls for","falls for a","for a cowboy","a cowboy singer","cowboy singer ,","singer , ignoring",", ignoring a","ignoring a boy","a boy she","boy she grew","she grew up","grew up with","up with ,","with , Jeremy",", Jeremy ,","Jeremy , who",", who likes","who likes her","likes her ;","her ;

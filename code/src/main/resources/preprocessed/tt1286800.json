{"title":"Harvard Beats Yale 29-29","plot":"On November 23, 1968, Yale and Harvard's undefeated football teams met in Cambridge, with Yale heavily favored. Contemporary interviews with 30 men who played that day mix with game footage (with instant replay). Led by Brian Dowling and Calvin Hill, Yale goes up 22-0. With less than one minute to play, Yale leads 29-13. For Harvard, the end is exhilarating; for Yale, supreme confidence gives way to a life lesson and to being a small part of football history. Adding context are comments about the Vietnam War, the sexual revolution, Garry Trudeau's Yale cartoons, and players' friendships with George W. Bush (Yale), Al Gore (Harvard), and Meryl Streep (Vassar).","genres":["Biography"," Sport"," Documentary"],"stems":["On","Novemb","23",",","1968",",","Yale","and","Harvard","'s","undef","footbal","team","met","in","Cambridg",",","with","Yale","heavili","favor",".","Contemporari","interview","with","30","men","who","play","that","day","mix","with","game","footag","(","with","instant","replay",")",".","Led","by","Brian","Dowl","and","Calvin","Hill",",","Yale","goe","up","22-0",".","With","less","than","one","minut","to","play",",","Yale","lead","29-13",".","For","Harvard",",","the","end","is","exhilar",";","for","Yale",",","suprem","confid","give","way","to","a","life","lesson","and","to","be","a","small","part","of","footbal","histori",".","Adding","context","are","comment","about","the","Vietnam","War",",","the","sexual","revolut",",","Garri","Trudeau","'s","Yale","cartoon",",","and","player","'","friendship","with","Georg","W.","Bush","(","Yale",")",",","Al","Gore","(","Harvard",")",",","and","Meryl","Streep","(","Vassar",")","."],"lemmas":["on","November","23",",","1968",",","Yale","and","Harvard","'s","undefeated","football","team","meet","in","Cambridge",",","with","Yale","heavily","favor",".","Contemporary","interview","with","30","man","who","play","that","day","mix","with","game","footage","-lrb-","with","instant","replay","-rrb-",".","lead","by","Brian","Dowling","and","Calvin","Hill",",","Yale","go","up","22-0",".","with","less","than","one","minute","to","play",",","Yale","lead","29-13",".","for","Harvard",",","the","end","be","exhilarating",";","for","Yale",",","supreme","confidence","give","way","to","a","life","lesson","and","to","be","a","small","part","of","football","history",".","add","context","be","comment","about","the","Vietnam","War",",","the","sexual","revolution",",","Garry","Trudeau","'s","Yale","cartoon",",","and","player","'","friendship","with","George","W.","Bush","-lrb-","Yale","-rrb-",",","Al","Gore","-lrb-","Harvard","-rrb-",",","and","Meryl","Streep","-lrb-","Vassar","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["On November 23","November 23 ,","23 , 1968",", 1968 ,","1968 , Yale",", Yale and","Yale and Harvard","and Harvard 's","Harvard 's undefeated","'s undefeated football","undefeated football teams","football teams met","teams met in","met in Cambridge","in Cambridge ,","Cambridge , with",", with Yale","with Yale heavily","Yale heavily favored","Contemporary interviews with","interviews with 30","with 30 men","30 men who","men who played","who played that","played that day","that day mix","day mix with","mix with game","with game footage","game footage (","footage ( with","( with instant","with instant replay","instant replay )","Led by Brian","by Brian Dowling","Brian Dowling and","Dowling and Calvin","and Calvin Hill","Calvin Hill ,","Hill , Yale",", Yale goes","Yale goes up","goes up 22-0","With less than","less than one","than one minute","one minute to","minute to play","to play ,","play , Yale",", Yale leads","Yale leads 29-13","For Harvard ,","Harvard , the",", the end","the end is","end is exhilarating","is exhilarating ;","exhilarating ; for","; for Yale","for Yale ,","Yale , supreme",", supreme confidence","supreme confidence gives","confidence gives way","gives way to","way to a","to a life","a life lesson","life lesson and","lesson and to","and to being","to being a","being a small","a small part","small part of","part of football","of football history","Adding context are","context are comments","are comments about","comments about the","about the Vietnam","the Vietnam War","Vietnam War ,","War , the",", the sexual","the sexual revolution","sexual revolution ,","revolution , Garry",", Garry Trudeau","Garry Trudeau 's","Trudeau 's Yale","'s Yale cartoons","Yale cartoons ,","cartoons , and",", and players","and players '","players ' friendships","' friendships with","friendships with George","with George W.","George W.

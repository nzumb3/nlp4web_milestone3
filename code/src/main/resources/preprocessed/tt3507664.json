{"title":"Sea of Change","plot":"Led by a 24 year old paralyzed woman, Cody Unser, nine veterans living in wheelchairs themselves are finally released from their chairs with no worry of high curbs or large steps. This is a story of freedom through weightless movement and of self-renewal. It is based on an experience the veterans never believed they could have, on a reef 60 feet below the surface of the sea. In the process, this amazing experiment, chronicled by Johns Hopkins doctors and narrated by Montel Williams, may change the lives of anyone with paralysis.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Led","by","a","24","year","old","paralyz","woman",",","Codi","Unser",",","nine","veteran","live","in","wheelchair","themselv","are","final","releas","from","their","chair","with","no","worri","of","high","curb","or","larg","step",".","This","is","a","stori","of","freedom","through","weightless","movement","and","of","self-renew",".","It","is","base","on","an","experi","the","veteran","never","believ","they","could","have",",","on","a","reef","60","feet","below","the","surfac","of","the","sea",".","In","the","process",",","this","amaz","experi",",","chronicl","by","John","Hopkin","doctor","and","narrat","by","Montel","William",",","may","chang","the","live","of","anyon","with","paralysi","."],"lemmas":["lead","by","a","24","year","old","paralyzed","woman",",","Cody","Unser",",","nine","veteran","live","in","wheelchair","themselves","be","finally","release","from","they","chair","with","no","worry","of","high","curb","or","large","step",".","this","be","a","story","of","freedom","through","weightless","movement","and","of","self-renewal",".","it","be","base","on","a","experience","the","veteran","never","believe","they","could","have",",","on","a","reef","60","foot","below","the","surface","of","the","sea",".","in","the","process",",","this","amazing","experiment",",","chronicle","by","Johns","Hopkins","doctor","and","narrate","by","Montel","Williams",",","may","change","the","life","of","anyone","with","paralysis","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Led by a","by a 24","a 24 year","24 year old","year old paralyzed","old paralyzed woman","paralyzed woman ,","woman , Cody",", Cody Unser","Cody Unser ,","Unser , nine",", nine veterans","nine veterans living","veterans living in","living in wheelchairs","in wheelchairs themselves","wheelchairs themselves are","themselves are finally","are finally released","finally released from","released from their","from their chairs","their chairs with","chairs with no","with no worry","no worry of","worry of high","of high curbs","high curbs or","curbs or large","or large steps","This is a","is a story","a story of","story of freedom","of freedom through","freedom through weightless","through weightless movement","weightless movement and","movement and of","and of self-renewal","It is based","is based on","based on an","on an experience","an experience the","experience the veterans","the veterans never","veterans never believed","never believed they","believed they could","they could have","could have ,","have , on",", on a","on a reef","a reef 60","reef 60 feet","60 feet below","feet below the","below the surface","the surface of","surface of the","of the sea","In the process","the process ,","process , this",", this amazing","this amazing experiment","amazing experiment ,","experiment , chronicled",", chronicled by","chronicled by Johns","by Johns Hopkins","Johns Hopkins doctors","Hopkins doctors and","doctors and narrated","and narrated by","narrated by Montel","by Montel Williams","Montel Williams ,","Williams , may",", may change","may change the","change the lives","the lives of","lives of anyone","of anyone with","anyone with paralysis"],"2grams":["Led by","by a","a 24","24 year","year old","old paralyzed","paralyzed woman","woman ,",", Cody","Cody Unser","Unser ,",", nine","nine veterans","veterans living","living in","in wheelchairs","wheelchairs themselves","themselves are","are finally","finally released","released from","from their","their chairs","chairs with","with no","no worry","worry of","of high","high curbs","curbs or","or large","large steps","This is","is a","a story","story of","of freedom","freedom through","through weightless","weightless movement","movement and","and of","of self-renewal","It is","is based","based on","on an","an experience","experience the","the veterans","veterans never","never believed","believed they","they could","could have","have ,",", on","on a","a reef","reef 60","60 feet","feet below","below the","the surface","surface of","of the","the sea","In the","the process","process ,",", this","this amazing","amazing experiment","experiment ,",", chronicled","chronicled by","by Johns","Johns Hopkins","Hopkins doctors","doctors and","and narrated","narrated by","by Montel","Montel Williams","Williams ,",", may","may change","change the","the lives","lives of","of anyone","anyone with","with paralysis"]}

{"title":"Gold and Copper","plot":"A Tehran mullah-in-training struggles to take care of his ailing wife and their children in this profoundly moving melodrama. A film of near-universal appeal, it puts a human face on Iran's Muslim clergy with its unusual tale of a man forced by hardship to become a better husband and father. Seyed Reza has just moved with his family to Tehran so he can study the Koran, and he relies on his lovely wife Zahra to look after their two young children and weave the intricate rugs that earn them a living. But one evening Zahra collapses and is taken to the hospital, where she's diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Scarcely able to process the tragedy, Seyed is left to cook, change diapers, walk his daughter to school and take his toddler son with him to his classes, where peers and elders treat him with scorn. But Seyed eventually learns to cope, his prayers and devotional studies taking on deeper meaning as he attends to the hard nightly work of rug weaving, getting through with a heavy assist from friends, neighbors and kind strangers.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","Tehran","mullah-in-train","struggl","to","take","care","of","his","ail","wife","and","their","children","in","this","profound","move","melodrama",".","A","film","of","near-univers","appeal",",","it","put","a","human","face","on","Iran","'s","Muslim","clergi","with","it","unusu","tale","of","a","man","forc","by","hardship","to","becom","a","better","husband","and","father",".","Sey","Reza","has","just","move","with","his","famili","to","Tehran","so","he","can","studi","the","Koran",",","and","he","reli","on","his","love","wife","Zahra","to","look","after","their","two","young","children","and","weav","the","intric","rug","that","earn","them","a","live",".","But","one","even","Zahra","collaps","and","is","taken","to","the","hospit",",","where","she","'s","diagnos","with","multipl","sclerosi",".","Scarc","abl","to","process","the","tragedi",",","Sey","is","left","to","cook",",","chang","diaper",",","walk","his","daughter","to","school","and","take","his","toddler","son","with","him","to","his","class",",","where","peer","and","elder","treat","him","with","scorn",".","But","Sey","eventu","learn","to","cope",",","his","prayer","and","devot","studi","take","on","deeper","mean","as","he","attend","to","the","hard","night","work","of","rug","weav",",","get","through","with","a","heavi","assist","from","friend",",","neighbor","and","kind","stranger","."],"lemmas":["a","Tehran","mullah-in-training","struggle","to","take","care","of","he","ailing","wife","and","they","child","in","this","profoundly","move","melodrama",".","a","film","of","near-universal","appeal",",","it","put","a","human","face","on","Iran","'s","muslim","clergy","with","its","unusual","tale","of","a","man","force","by","hardship","to","become","a","better","husband","and","father",".","Seyed","Reza","have","just","move","with","he","family","to","Tehran","so","he","can","study","the","Koran",",","and","he","rely","on","he","lovely","wife","Zahra","to","look","after","they","two","young","child","and","weave","the","intricate","rug","that","earn","they","a","living",".","but","one","evening","Zahra","collapse","and","be","take","to","the","hospital",",","where","she","be","diagnose","with","multiple","sclerosis",".","scarcely","able","to","process","the","tragedy",",","Seyed","be","leave","to","cook",",","change","diaper",",","walk","he","daughter","to","school","and","take","he","toddler","son","with","he","to","he","class",",","where","peer","and","elder","treat","he","with","scorn",".","but","Seyed","eventually","learn","to","cope",",","he","prayer","and","devotional","study","take","on","deeper","meaning","as","he","attend","to","the","hard","nightly","work","of","rug","weave",",","get","through","with","a","heavy","assist","from","friend",",","neighbor","and","kind","stranger","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"What to Expect When You're Expecting","plot":"Five couples' intertwined lives are turned upside down by the challenges of impending parenthood. Over the moon about starting a family, TV fitness guru Jules and dance show star Evan find that their high-octane celebrity lives don't stand a chance against the surprise demands of pregnancy. Baby-crazy author and advocate Wendy gets a taste of her own militant mommy advice when pregnancy hormones ravage her body; while Wendy's husband, Gary, struggles not to be outdone by his competitive alpha-Dad, who's expecting twins with his much younger trophy wife, Skyler. Photographer Holly is prepared to travel the globe to adopt a child, but her husband Alex isn't so sure, and tries to quiet his panic by attending a \"dudes\" support group, where new fathers get to tell it like it really is. And rival food truck chefs Rosie and Marco's surprise hook-up results in an unexpected quandary: what to do when your first child comes before your first date?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Five","coupl","'","intertwin","live","are","turn","upsid","down","by","the","challeng","of","impend","parenthood",".","Over","the","moon","about","start","a","famili",",","TV","fit","guru","Jule","and","danc","show","star","Evan","find","that","their","high-octan","celebr","live","do","n't","stand","a","chanc","against","the","surpris","demand","of","pregnanc",".","Baby-crazi","author","and","advoc","Wendi","get","a","tast","of","her","own","milit","mommi","advic","when","pregnanc","hormon","ravag","her","bodi",";","while","Wendi","'s","husband",",","Gari",",","struggl","not","to","be","outdon","by","his","competit","alpha-Dad",",","who","'s","expect","twin","with","his","much","younger","trophi","wife",",","Skyler",".","Photograph","Holli","is","prepar","to","travel","the","globe","to","adopt","a","child",",","but","her","husband","Alex","is","n't","so","sure",",","and","tri","to","quiet","his","panic","by","attend","a","\"","dude","\"","support","group",",","where","new","father","get","to","tell","it","like","it","realli","is",".","And","rival","food","truck","chef","Rosi","and","Marco","'s","surpris","hook-up","result","in","an","unexpect","quandari",":","what","to","do","when","your","first","child","come","befor","your","first","date","?"],"lemmas":["five","couple","'","intertwine","life","be","turn","upside","down","by","the","challenge","of","impending","parenthood",".","over","the","moon","about","start","a","family",",","tv","fitness","guru","Jules","and","dance","show","star","Evan","find","that","they","high-octane","celebrity","life","do","not","stand","a","chance","against","the","surprise","demand","of","pregnancy",".","baby-crazy","author","and","advocate","wendy","get","a","taste","of","she","own","militant","mommy","advice","when","pregnancy","hormone","ravage","she","body",";","while","Wendy","'s","husband",",","Gary",",","struggle","not","to","be","outdo","by","he","competitive","alpha-dad",",","who","be","expect","twin","with","he","much","younger","trophy","wife",",","Skyler",".","Photographer","Holly","be","prepare","to","travel","the","globe","to","adopt","a","child",",","but","she","husband","Alex","be","not","so","sure",",","and","try","to","quiet","he","panic","by","attend","a","``","dudes","''","support","group",",","where","new","father","get","to","tell","it","like","it","really","be",".","and","rival","food","truck","chef","Rosie","and","Marco","'s","surprise","hook-up","result","in","a","unexpected","quandary",":","what","to","do","when","you","first","child","come","before","you","first","date","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Five couples '","couples ' intertwined","' intertwined lives","intertwined lives are","lives are turned","are turned upside","turned upside down","upside down by","down by the","by the challenges","the challenges of","challenges of impending","of impending parenthood","Over the moon","the moon about","moon about starting","about starting a","starting a family","a family ,","family , TV",", TV fitness","TV fitness guru","fitness guru Jules","guru Jules and","Jules and dance","and dance show","dance show star","show star Evan","star Evan find","Evan find that","find that their","that their high-octane","their high-octane celebrity","high-octane celebrity lives","celebrity lives do","lives do n't","do n't stand","n't stand a","stand a chance","a chance against","chance against the","against the surprise","the surprise demands","surprise demands of","demands of pregnancy","Baby-crazy author and","author and advocate","and advocate Wendy","advocate Wendy gets","Wendy gets a","gets a taste","a taste of","taste of her","of her own","her own militant","own militant mommy","militant mommy advice","mommy advice when","advice when pregnancy","when pregnancy hormones","pregnancy hormones ravage","hormones ravage her","ravage her body","her body ;","body ;

{"title":"Jealousy","plot":"Brian Young and Nate Beckman star in this 97 min. drama of friendship and trust, or lack thereof. Having been friends their whole lives, they risk everything by getting into a fight that may never bring them back to see each other again. Envious of each other, they can't help but argue to whatever end. Set in St. Louis, it makes for a scenic drama that turns into somewhat of a nightmare. The loss that the two encounter may never be forgotten, but there is one turnaround that they didn't expect. Maybe a lost friendship can be re-found and perhaps piece their lives back together.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Brian","Young","and","Nate","Beckman","star","in","this","97","min",".","drama","of","friendship","and","trust",",","or","lack","thereof",".","Have","been","friend","their","whole","live",",","they","risk","everyth","by","get","into","a","fight","that","may","never","bring","them","back","to","see","each","other","again",".","Envious","of","each","other",",","they","ca","n't","help","but","argu","to","whatev","end",".","Set","in","St.","Loui",",","it","make","for","a","scenic","drama","that","turn","into","somewhat","of","a","nightmar",".","The","loss","that","the","two","encount","may","never","be","forgotten",",","but","there","is","one","turnaround","that","they","did","n't","expect",".","Mayb","a","lost","friendship","can","be","re-found","and","perhap","piec","their","live","back","togeth","."],"lemmas":["Brian","Young","and","Nate","Beckman","star","in","this","97","min",".","drama","of","friendship","and","trust",",","or","lack","thereof",".","have","be","friend","they","whole","life",",","they","risk","everything","by","get","into","a","fight","that","may","never","bring","they","back","to","see","each","other","again",".","envious","of","each","other",",","they","can","not","help","but","argue","to","whatever","end",".","set","in","St.","Louis",",","it","make","for","a","scenic","drama","that","turn","into","somewhat","of","a","nightmare",".","the","loss","that","the","two","encounter","may","never","be","forget",",","but","there","be","one","turnaround","that","they","do","not","expect",".","maybe","a","lost","friendship","can","be","re-found","and","perhaps","piece","they","life","back","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Brian Young and","Young and Nate","and Nate Beckman","Nate Beckman star","Beckman star in","star in this","in this 97","this 97 min","drama of friendship","of friendship and","friendship and trust","and trust ,","trust , or",", or lack","or lack thereof","Having been friends","been friends their","friends their whole","their whole lives","whole lives ,","lives , they",", they risk","they risk everything","risk everything by","everything by getting","by getting into","getting into a","into a fight","a fight that","fight that may","that may never","may never bring","never bring them","bring them back","them back to","back to see","to see each","see each other","each other again","Envious of each","of each other","each other ,","other , they",", they ca","they ca n't","ca n't help","n't help but","help but argue","but argue to","argue to whatever","to whatever end","Set in St.","in St. Louis","St. Louis ,","Louis , it",", it makes","it makes for","makes for a","for a scenic","a scenic drama","scenic drama that","drama that turns","that turns into","turns into somewhat","into somewhat of","somewhat of a","of a nightmare","The loss that","loss that the","that the two","the two encounter","two encounter may","encounter may never","may never be","never be forgotten","be forgotten ,","forgotten , but",", but there","but there is","there is one","is one turnaround","one turnaround that","turnaround that they","that they did","they did n't","did n't expect","Maybe a lost","a lost friendship","lost friendship can","friendship can be","can be re-found","be re-found and","re-found and perhaps","and perhaps piece","perhaps piece their","piece their lives","their lives back","lives back together"],"2grams":["Brian Young","Young and","and Nate","Nate Beckman","Beckman star","star in","in this","this 97","97 min","drama of","of friendship","friendship and","and trust","trust ,",", or","or lack","lack thereof","Having been","been friends","friends their","their whole","whole lives","lives ,",", they","they risk","risk everything","everything by","by getting","getting into","into a","a fight","fight that","that may","may never","never bring","bring them","them back","back to","to see","see each","each other","other again","Envious of","of each","each other","other ,",", they","they ca","ca n't","n't help","help but","but argue","argue to","to whatever","whatever end","Set in","in St.","St. Louis","Louis ,",", it","it makes","makes for","for a","a scenic","scenic drama","drama that","that turns","turns into","into somewhat","somewhat of","of a","a nightmare","The loss","loss that","that the","the two","two encounter","encounter may","may never","never be","be forgotten","forgotten ,",", but","but there","there is","is one","one turnaround","turnaround that","that they","they did","did n't","n't expect","Maybe a","a lost","lost friendship","friendship can","can be","be re-found","re-found and","and perhaps","perhaps piece","piece their","their lives","lives back","back together"]}

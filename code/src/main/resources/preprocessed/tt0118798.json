{"title":"Bulworth","plot":"Senator Jay Bulworth is facing speculation-induced financial ruin, so he puts out a contract on his own life in order to collect a large, new insurance policy for his family. Living each moment on borrowed time, he suddenly begins spouting raw, unfiltered--and sometimes offensive in word but satirical in spirit -- thoughts to shocked audiences and handlers in the speech of hip-hop music and culture. His newfound uninhibitedness and new relationship with Nina carry him on a journey of political and spiritual renewal.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Senat","Jay","Bulworth","is","face","speculation-induc","financi","ruin",",","so","he","put","out","a","contract","on","his","own","life","in","order","to","collect","a","larg",",","new","insur","polici","for","his","famili",".","Live","each","moment","on","borrow","time",",","he","sudden","begin","spout","raw",",","unfilt","--","and","sometim","offens","in","word","but","satir","in","spirit","--","thought","to","shock","audienc","and","handler","in","the","speech","of","hip-hop","music","and","cultur",".","His","newfound","uninhibited","and","new","relationship","with","Nina","carri","him","on","a","journey","of","polit","and","spiritu","renew","."],"lemmas":["Senator","Jay","Bulworth","be","face","speculation-induced","financial","ruin",",","so","he","put","out","a","contract","on","he","own","life","in","order","to","collect","a","large",",","new","insurance","policy","for","he","family",".","live","each","moment","on","borrow","time",",","he","suddenly","begin","spout","raw",",","unfiltered","--","and","sometimes","offensive","in","word","but","satirical","in","spirit","--","thought","to","shocked","audience","and","handler","in","the","speech","of","hip-hop","music","and","culture",".","he","newfound","uninhibitedness","and","new","relationship","with","Nina","carry","he","on","a","journey","of","political","and","spiritual","renewal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Senator Jay Bulworth","Jay Bulworth is","Bulworth is facing","is facing speculation-induced","facing speculation-induced financial","speculation-induced financial ruin","financial ruin ,","ruin , so",", so he","so he puts","he puts out","puts out a","out a contract","a contract on","contract on his","on his own","his own life","own life in","life in order","in order to","order to collect","to collect a","collect a large","a large ,","large , new",", new insurance","new insurance policy","insurance policy for","policy for his","for his family","Living each moment","each moment on","moment on borrowed","on borrowed time","borrowed time ,","time , he",", he suddenly","he suddenly begins","suddenly begins spouting","begins spouting raw","spouting raw ,","raw , unfiltered",", unfiltered --","unfiltered -- and","-- and sometimes","and sometimes offensive","sometimes offensive in","offensive in word","in word but","word but satirical","but satirical in","satirical in spirit","in spirit --","spirit -- thoughts","-- thoughts to","thoughts to shocked","to shocked audiences","shocked audiences and","audiences and handlers","and handlers in","handlers in the","in the speech","the speech of","speech of hip-hop","of hip-hop music","hip-hop music and","music and culture","His newfound uninhibitedness","newfound uninhibitedness and","uninhibitedness and new","and new relationship","new relationship with","relationship with Nina","with Nina carry","Nina carry him","carry him on","him on a","on a journey","a journey of","journey of political","of political and","political and spiritual","and spiritual renewal"],"2grams":["Senator Jay","Jay Bulworth","Bulworth is","is facing","facing speculation-induced","speculation-induced financial","financial ruin","ruin ,",", so","so he","he puts","puts out","out a","a contract","contract on","on his","his own","own life","life in","in order","order to","to collect","collect a","a large","large ,",", new","new insurance","insurance policy","policy for","for his","his family","Living each","each moment","moment on","on borrowed","borrowed time","time ,",", he","he suddenly","suddenly begins","begins spouting","spouting raw","raw ,",", unfiltered","unfiltered --","-- and","and sometimes","sometimes offensive","offensive in","in word","word but","but satirical","satirical in","in spirit","spirit --","-- thoughts","thoughts to","to shocked","shocked audiences","audiences and","and handlers","handlers in","in the","the speech","speech of","of hip-hop","hip-hop music","music and","and culture","His newfound","newfound uninhibitedness","uninhibitedness and","and new","new relationship","relationship with","with Nina","Nina carry","carry him","him on","on a","a journey","journey of","of political","political and","and spiritual","spiritual renewal"]}

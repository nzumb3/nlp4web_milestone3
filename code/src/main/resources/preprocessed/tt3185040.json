{"title":"Ry√ªsei","plot":"What did the boys wish for that day? Twelve years ago, the three boys Haruhiko, Ryuta and Toru wished on a falling star from the same place. Now, they are all living separate lives. Ryuta is a driver for a Tokyo cabaret. Toru has quit his band and is working in a pub in his hometown. Haruhiko was working in a top-notch company, but went into debt and has now returned to his parents' home to borrow money. The three men live in a very real society in which one can't survive on the fleeting words of hopes and dreams alone. But one day, a small change comes upon them.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["What","did","the","boy","wish","for","that","day","?","Twelv","year","ago",",","the","three","boy","Haruhiko",",","Ryuta","and","Toru","wish","on","a","fall","star","from","the","same","place",".","Now",",","they","are","all","live","separ","live",".","Ryuta","is","a","driver","for","a","Tokyo","cabaret",".","Toru","has","quit","his","band","and","is","work","in","a","pub","in","his","hometown",".","Haruhiko","was","work","in","a","top-notch","compani",",","but","went","into","debt","and","has","now","return","to","his","parent","'","home","to","borrow","money",".","The","three","men","live","in","a","veri","real","societi","in","which","one","ca","n't","surviv","on","the","fleet","word","of","hope","and","dream","alon",".","But","one","day",",","a","small","chang","come","upon","them","."],"lemmas":["what","do","the","boy","wish","for","that","day","?","twelve","year","ago",",","the","three","boy","Haruhiko",",","Ryuta","and","Toru","wish","on","a","fall","star","from","the","same","place",".","now",",","they","be","all","live","separate","life",".","Ryuta","be","a","driver","for","a","Tokyo","cabaret",".","Toru","have","quit","he","band","and","be","work","in","a","pub","in","he","hometown",".","Haruhiko","be","work","in","a","top-notch","company",",","but","go","into","debt","and","have","now","return","to","he","parent","'","home","to","borrow","money",".","the","three","man","live","in","a","very","real","society","in","which","one","can","not","survive","on","the","fleeting","word","of","hope","and","dream","alone",".","but","one","day",",","a","small","change","come","upon","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What did the","did the boys","the boys wish","boys wish for","wish for that","for that day","Twelve years ago","years ago ,","ago , the",", the three","the three boys","three boys Haruhiko","boys Haruhiko ,","Haruhiko , Ryuta",", Ryuta and","Ryuta and Toru","and Toru wished","Toru wished on","wished on a","on a falling","a falling star","falling star from","star from the","from the same","the same place","Now , they",", they are","they are all","are all living","all living separate","living separate lives","Ryuta is a","is a driver","a driver for","driver for a","for a Tokyo","a Tokyo cabaret","Toru has quit","has quit his","quit his band","his band and","band and is","and is working","is working in","working in a","in a pub","a pub in","pub in his","in his hometown","Haruhiko was working","was working in","working in a","in a top-notch","a top-notch company","top-notch company ,","company , but",", but went","but went into","went into debt","into debt and","debt and has","and has now","has now returned","now returned to","returned to his","to his parents","his parents '","parents ' home","' home to","home to borrow","to borrow money","The three men","three men live","men live in","live in a","in a very","a very real","very real society","real society in","society in which","in which one","which one ca","one ca n't","ca n't survive","n't survive on","survive on the","on the fleeting","the fleeting words","fleeting words of","words of hopes","of hopes and","hopes and dreams","and dreams alone","But one day","one day ,","day , a",", a small","a small change","small change comes","change comes upon","comes upon them"],"2grams":["What did","did the","the boys","boys wish","wish for","for that","that day","Twelve years","years ago","ago ,",", the","the three","three boys","boys Haruhiko","Haruhiko ,",", Ryuta","Ryuta and","and Toru","Toru wished","wished on","on a","a falling","falling star","star from","from the","the same","same place","Now ,",", they","they are","are all","all living","living separate","separate lives","Ryuta is","is a","a driver","driver for","for a","a Tokyo","Tokyo cabaret","Toru has","has quit","quit his","his band","band and","and is","is working","working in","in a","a pub","pub in","in his","his hometown","Haruhiko was","was working","working in","in a","a top-notch","top-notch company","company ,",", but","but went","went into","into debt","debt and","and has","has now","now returned","returned to","to his","his parents","parents '","' home","home to","to borrow","borrow money","The three","three men","men live","live in","in a","a very","very real","real society","society in","in which","which one","one ca","ca n't","n't survive","survive on","on the","the fleeting","fleeting words","words of","of hopes","hopes and","and dreams","dreams alone","But one","one day","day ,",", a","a small","small change","change comes","comes upon","upon them"]}

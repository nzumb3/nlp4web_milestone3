{"title":"The Difference","plot":"The perpetual rumbling of wagons on rusty tracks disappearing on desert horizon. The bleating of goats suffering from heat and thirst. Freight cars with Bedouins and cezve of strong mint tea. The train, carrying tankers filled with water and fuel, cuts through the desert landscape of the never-ending horizon of sand. In the mud huts along the tracks, people live humble lives on the edge of poverty. The tank of water and fuel is the basic unit of measure for survival. The train is the main axis of life for the Bedouins catching their breath in the shadows of the heat and the contours of tranquillity.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["The","perpetu","rumbl","of","wagon","on","rusti","track","disappear","on","desert","horizon",".","The","bleat","of","goat","suffer","from","heat","and","thirst",".","Freight","car","with","Bedouin","and","cezv","of","strong","mint","tea",".","The","train",",","carri","tanker","fill","with","water","and","fuel",",","cut","through","the","desert","landscap","of","the","never-end","horizon","of","sand",".","In","the","mud","hut","along","the","track",",","peopl","live","humbl","live","on","the","edg","of","poverti",".","The","tank","of","water","and","fuel","is","the","basic","unit","of","measur","for","surviv",".","The","train","is","the","main","axi","of","life","for","the","Bedouin","catch","their","breath","in","the","shadow","of","the","heat","and","the","contour","of","tranquil","."],"lemmas":["the","perpetual","rumble","of","wagon","on","rusty","track","disappear","on","desert","horizon",".","the","bleating","of","goat","suffer","from","heat","and","thirst",".","freight","car","with","bedouin","and","cezve","of","strong","mint","tea",".","the","train",",","carry","tanker","fill","with","water","and","fuel",",","cut","through","the","desert","landscape","of","the","never-ending","horizon","of","sand",".","in","the","mud","hut","along","the","track",",","people","live","humble","life","on","the","edge","of","poverty",".","the","tank","of","water","and","fuel","be","the","basic","unit","of","measure","for","survival",".","the","train","be","the","main","axis","of","life","for","the","Bedouins","catch","they","breath","in","the","shadow","of","the","heat","and","the","contour","of","tranquillity","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The perpetual rumbling","perpetual rumbling of","rumbling of wagons","of wagons on","wagons on rusty","on rusty tracks","rusty tracks disappearing","tracks disappearing on","disappearing on desert","on desert horizon","The bleating of","bleating of goats","of goats suffering","goats suffering from","suffering from heat","from heat and","heat and thirst","Freight cars with","cars with Bedouins","with Bedouins and","Bedouins and cezve","and cezve of","cezve of strong","of strong mint","strong mint tea","The train ,","train , carrying",", carrying tankers","carrying tankers filled","tankers filled with","filled with water","with water and","water and fuel","and fuel ,","fuel , cuts",", cuts through","cuts through the","through the desert","the desert landscape","desert landscape of","landscape of the","of the never-ending","the never-ending horizon","never-ending horizon of","horizon of sand","In the mud","the mud huts","mud huts along","huts along the","along the tracks","the tracks ,","tracks , people",", people live","people live humble","live humble lives","humble lives on","lives on the","on the edge","the edge of","edge of poverty","The tank of","tank of water","of water and","water and fuel","and fuel is","fuel is the","is the basic","the basic unit","basic unit of","unit of measure","of measure for","measure for survival","The train is","train is the","is the main","the main axis","main axis of","axis of life","of life for","life for the","for the Bedouins","the Bedouins catching","Bedouins catching their","catching their breath","their breath in","breath in the","in the shadows","the shadows of","shadows of the","of the heat","the heat and","heat and the","and the contours","the contours of","contours of tranquillity"],"2grams":["The perpetual","perpetual rumbling","rumbling of","of wagons","wagons on","on rusty","rusty tracks","tracks disappearing","disappearing on","on desert","desert horizon","The bleating","bleating of","of goats","goats suffering","suffering from","from heat","heat and","and thirst","Freight cars","cars with","with Bedouins","Bedouins and","and cezve","cezve of","of strong","strong mint","mint tea","The train","train ,",", carrying","carrying tankers","tankers filled","filled with","with water","water and","and fuel","fuel ,",", cuts","cuts through","through the","the desert","desert landscape","landscape of","of the","the never-ending","never-ending horizon","horizon of","of sand","In the","the mud","mud huts","huts along","along the","the tracks","tracks ,",", people","people live","live humble","humble lives","lives on","on the","the edge","edge of","of poverty","The tank","tank of","of water","water and","and fuel","fuel is","is the","the basic","basic unit","unit of","of measure","measure for","for survival","The train","train is","is the","the main","main axis","axis of","of life","life for","for the","the Bedouins","Bedouins catching","catching their","their breath","breath in","in the","the shadows","shadows of","of the","the heat","heat and","and the","the contours","contours of","of tranquillity"]}

{"title":"The Condor's Shadow","plot":"A year-in-the-life journey through endangered species recovery, this beautifully shot film follows passionate field biologist Joseph Brandt to reveal the realities of bringing the iconic California condor back from the brink of extinction. Filmed in the rugged California habitat of the condor, the film interweaves scenes of the extreme lengths that biologists will take to reestablish a self-sustaining wild condor population with insights from conservations, scientists, zoo keepers and hunters to explore the dilemma of the very first recovery program to be executed after the passage of the Endangered Species Act. It's a mission tasked to biologists but fundamentally wrapped up in public policy - revealing the true challenge of environmental sustainability - that place where human preferences clash with the goal of renewal.","genres":["Adventure"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","year-in-the-lif","journey","through","endang","speci","recoveri",",","this","beauti","shot","film","follow","passion","field","biologist","Joseph","Brandt","to","reveal","the","realiti","of","bring","the","icon","California","condor","back","from","the","brink","of","extinct",".","Film","in","the","rug","California","habitat","of","the","condor",",","the","film","interweav","scene","of","the","extrem","length","that","biologist","will","take","to","reestablish","a","self-sustain","wild","condor","popul","with","insight","from","conserv",",","scientist",",","zoo","keeper","and","hunter","to","explor","the","dilemma","of","the","veri","first","recoveri","program","to","be","execut","after","the","passag","of","the","Endanger","Speci","Act",".","It","'s","a","mission","task","to","biologist","but","fundament","wrap","up","in","public","polici","-","reveal","the","true","challeng","of","environment","sustain","-","that","place","where","human","prefer","clash","with","the","goal","of","renew","."],"lemmas":["a","year-in-the-life","journey","through","endangered","species","recovery",",","this","beautifully","shoot","film","follow","passionate","field","biologist","Joseph","Brandt","to","reveal","the","reality","of","bring","the","iconic","California","condor","back","from","the","brink","of","extinction",".","film","in","the","rugged","California","habitat","of","the","condor",",","the","film","interweave","scene","of","the","extreme","length","that","biologist","will","take","to","reestablish","a","self-sustaining","wild","condor","population","with","insight","from","conservation",",","scientist",",","zoo","keeper","and","hunter","to","explore","the","dilemma","of","the","very","first","recovery","program","to","be","execute","after","the","passage","of","the","Endangered","Species","Act",".","it","be","a","mission","task","to","biologist","but","fundamentally","wrap","up","in","public","policy","-","reveal","the","true","challenge","of","environmental","sustainability","-","that","place","where","human","preference","clash","with","the","goal","of","renewal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A year-in-the-life journey","year-in-the-life journey through","journey through endangered","through endangered species","endangered species recovery","species recovery ,","recovery , this",", this beautifully","this beautifully shot","beautifully shot film","shot film follows","film follows passionate","follows passionate field","passionate field biologist","field biologist Joseph","biologist Joseph Brandt","Joseph Brandt to","Brandt to reveal","to reveal the","reveal the realities","the realities of","realities of bringing","of bringing the","bringing the iconic","the iconic California","iconic California condor","California condor back","condor back from","back from the","from the brink","the brink of","brink of extinction","Filmed in the","in the rugged","the rugged California","rugged California habitat","California habitat of","habitat of the","of the condor","the condor ,","condor , the",", the film","the film interweaves","film interweaves scenes","interweaves scenes of","scenes of the","of the extreme","the extreme lengths","extreme lengths that","lengths that biologists","that biologists will","biologists will take","will take to","take to reestablish","to reestablish a","reestablish a self-sustaining","a self-sustaining wild","self-sustaining wild condor","wild condor population","condor population with","population with insights","with insights from","insights from conservations","from conservations ,","conservations , scientists",", scientists ,","scientists , zoo",", zoo keepers","zoo keepers and","keepers and hunters","and hunters to","hunters to explore","to explore the","explore the dilemma","the dilemma of","dilemma of the","of the very","the very first","very first recovery","first recovery program","recovery program to","program to be","to be executed","be executed after","executed after the","after the passage","the passage of","passage of the","of the Endangered","the Endangered Species","Endangered Species Act","It 's a","'s a mission","a mission tasked","mission tasked to","tasked to biologists","to biologists but","biologists but fundamentally","but fundamentally wrapped","fundamentally wrapped up","wrapped up in","up in public","in public policy","public policy -","policy -

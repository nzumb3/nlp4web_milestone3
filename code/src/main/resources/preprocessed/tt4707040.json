{"title":"Golden Hut","plot":"Thirteen-year-old Emilke lives in his mountain hut in a place called Hidegség in Gyimes, Transylvania. From early spring to the first snowfall he grazes cows, makes cheese from the milk, and only sees his parents when they go up to the mountain pasture and takes the cheese home. These meetings are rare and short. The only companions for the boy are the cows and the dogs. The hours, days, weeks, spring, summer and autumn melt into each other in his solitude.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Thirteen-year-old","Emilk","live","in","his","mountain","hut","in","a","place","call","Hidegség","in","Gyim",",","Transylvania",".","From","earli","spring","to","the","first","snowfal","he","graze","cow",",","make","chees","from","the","milk",",","and","onli","see","his","parent","when","they","go","up","to","the","mountain","pastur","and","take","the","chees","home",".","These","meet","are","rare","and","short",".","The","onli","companion","for","the","boy","are","the","cow","and","the","dog",".","The","hour",",","day",",","week",",","spring",",","summer","and","autumn","melt","into","each","other","in","his","solitud","."],"lemmas":["thirteen-year-old","Emilke","life","in","he","mountain","hut","in","a","place","call","Hidegség","in","Gyimes",",","Transylvania",".","from","early","spring","to","the","first","snowfall","he","graze","cow",",","make","cheese","from","the","milk",",","and","only","see","he","parent","when","they","go","up","to","the","mountain","pasture","and","take","the","cheese","home",".","these","meeting","be","rare","and","short",".","the","only","companion","for","the","boy","be","the","cow","and","the","dog",".","the","hour",",","day",",","week",",","spring",",","summer","and","autumn","melt","into","each","other","in","he","solitude","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Thirteen-year-old Emilke lives","Emilke lives in","lives in his","in his mountain","his mountain hut","mountain hut in","hut in a","in a place","a place called","place called Hidegség","called Hidegség in","Hidegség in Gyimes","in Gyimes ,","Gyimes , Transylvania","From early spring","early spring to","spring to the","to the first","the first snowfall","first snowfall he","snowfall he grazes","he grazes cows","grazes cows ,","cows , makes",", makes cheese","makes cheese from","cheese from the","from the milk","the milk ,","milk , and",", and only","and only sees","only sees his","sees his parents","his parents when","parents when they","when they go","they go up","go up to","up to the","to the mountain","the mountain pasture","mountain pasture and","pasture and takes","and takes the","takes the cheese","the cheese home","These meetings are","meetings are rare","are rare and","rare and short","The only companions","only companions for","companions for the","for the boy","the boy are","boy are the","are the cows","the cows and","cows and the","and the dogs","The hours ,","hours , days",", days ,","days , weeks",", weeks ,","weeks , spring",", spring ,","spring , summer",", summer and","summer and autumn","and autumn melt","autumn melt into","melt into each","into each other","each other in","other in his","in his solitude"],"2grams":["Thirteen-year-old Emilke","Emilke lives","lives in","in his","his mountain","mountain hut","hut in","in a","a place","place called","called Hidegség","Hidegség in","in Gyimes","Gyimes ,",", Transylvania","From early","early spring","spring to","to the","the first","first snowfall","snowfall he","he grazes","grazes cows","cows ,",", makes","makes cheese","cheese from","from the","the milk","milk ,",", and","and only","only sees","sees his","his parents","parents when","when they","they go","go up","up to","to the","the mountain","mountain pasture","pasture and","and takes","takes the","the cheese","cheese home","These meetings","meetings are","are rare","rare and","and short","The only","only companions","companions for","for the","the boy","boy are","are the","the cows","cows and","and the","the dogs","The hours","hours ,",", days","days ,",", weeks","weeks ,",", spring","spring ,",", summer","summer and","and autumn","autumn melt","melt into","into each","each other","other in","in his","his solitude"]}

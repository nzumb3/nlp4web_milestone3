{"title":"Fort Drum the First 100 Years","plot":"Fort Drum: The First 100 Years tells the story of how a dusty cavalry camp in the early 1900s evolved into a modern marvel of training and efficiency for soldiers of the United States Army. Created as a national training site by President Theodore Roosevelt, Pine Camp grew into Camp Drum and ultimately became Fort Drum. Today, the base is home to the 10th Mountain Division, a premier U.S. Army unit whose troops have served in Iraq and Afghanistan. Fort Drum is one of the largest and most well-equipped military installations in the Eastern part of the United States. It is the economic engine of Northern New York and introduced cultural diversity into a previously isolated region. Over the course of a century, soldiers who trained at the legendary base have shaped the history of America and the world.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Fort","Drum",":","The","First","100","Year","tell","the","stori","of","how","a","dusti","cavalri","camp","in","the","earli","1900s","evolv","into","a","modern","marvel","of","train","and","effici","for","soldier","of","the","Unite","State","Armi",".","Creat","as","a","nation","train","site","by","Presid","Theodor","Roosevelt",",","Pine","Camp","grew","into","Camp","Drum","and","ultim","becam","Fort","Drum",".","Today",",","the","base","is","home","to","the","10th","Mountain","Divis",",","a","premier","U.S.","Armi","unit","whose","troop","have","serv","in","Iraq","and","Afghanistan",".","Fort","Drum","is","one","of","the","largest","and","most","well-equip","militari","instal","in","the","Eastern","part","of","the","Unite","State",".","It","is","the","econom","engin","of","Northern","New","York","and","introduc","cultur","divers","into","a","previous","isol","region",".","Over","the","cours","of","a","centuri",",","soldier","who","train","at","the","legendari","base","have","shape","the","histori","of","America","and","the","world","."],"lemmas":["Fort","Drum",":","the","first","100","year","tell","the","story","of","how","a","dusty","cavalry","camp","in","the","early","1900","evolve","into","a","modern","marvel","of","training","and","efficiency","for","soldier","of","the","United","States","Army",".","create","as","a","national","training","site","by","President","Theodore","Roosevelt",",","Pine","Camp","grow","into","Camp","Drum","and","ultimately","become","Fort","Drum",".","today",",","the","base","be","home","to","the","10th","Mountain","Division",",","a","premier","U.S.","Army","unit","whose","troops","have","serve","in","Iraq","and","Afghanistan",".","Fort","Drum","be","one","of","the","largest","and","most","well-equipped","military","installation","in","the","eastern","part","of","the","United","States",".","it","be","the","economic","engine","of","Northern","New","York","and","introduce","cultural","diversity","into","a","previously","isolate","region",".","over","the","course","of","a","century",",","soldier","who","train","at","the","legendary","base","have","shape","the","history","of","America","and","the","world","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fort

{"title":"Medusa","plot":"In this wry retelling of the ancient Medusa myth, strange, clothed statues of men are appearing all over Greece. Only Perseus, a leader of a gang of modern Athenian thieves, with a strange childhood, holds the answer to the mystery--and it has something to do with beautiful, long-haired women in black. One night his group breaks into the house of one such creature. Filled with low-key humor and suspense, Medusa unfolds in a simple and tantalizing way.","genres":["Fantasy"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["In","this","wri","retel","of","the","ancient","Medusa","myth",",","strang",",","cloth","statu","of","men","are","appear","all","over","Greec",".","Onli","Perseus",",","a","leader","of","a","gang","of","modern","Athenian","thiev",",","with","a","strang","childhood",",","hold","the","answer","to","the","mysteri","--","and","it","has","someth","to","do","with","beauti",",","long-hair","women","in","black",".","One","night","his","group","break","into","the","hous","of","one","such","creatur",".","Fill","with","low-key","humor","and","suspens",",","Medusa","unfold","in","a","simpl","and","tantal","way","."],"lemmas":["in","this","wry","retelling","of","the","ancient","Medusa","myth",",","strange",",","clothed","statue","of","man","be","appear","all","over","Greece",".","only","Perseus",",","a","leader","of","a","gang","of","modern","athenian","thief",",","with","a","strange","childhood",",","hold","the","answer","to","the","mystery","--","and","it","have","something","to","do","with","beautiful",",","long-haired","woman","in","black",".","one","night","he","group","break","into","the","house","of","one","such","creature",".","fill","with","low-key","humor","and","suspense",",","Medusa","unfold","in","a","simple","and","tantalizing","way","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In this wry","this wry retelling","wry retelling of","retelling of the","of the ancient","the ancient Medusa","ancient Medusa myth","Medusa myth ,","myth , strange",", strange ,","strange , clothed",", clothed statues","clothed statues of","statues of men","of men are","men are appearing","are appearing all","appearing all over","all over Greece","Only Perseus ,","Perseus , a",", a leader","a leader of","leader of a","of a gang","a gang of","gang of modern","of modern Athenian","modern Athenian thieves","Athenian thieves ,","thieves , with",", with a","with a strange","a strange childhood","strange childhood ,","childhood , holds",", holds the","holds the answer","the answer to","answer to the","to the mystery","the mystery --","mystery -- and","-- and it","and it has","it has something","has something to","something to do","to do with","do with beautiful","with beautiful ,","beautiful , long-haired",", long-haired women","long-haired women in","women in black","One night his","night his group","his group breaks","group breaks into","breaks into the","into the house","the house of","house of one","of one such","one such creature","Filled with low-key","with low-key humor","low-key humor and","humor and suspense","and suspense ,","suspense , Medusa",", Medusa unfolds","Medusa unfolds in","unfolds in a","in a simple","a simple and","simple and tantalizing","and tantalizing way"],"2grams":["In this","this wry","wry retelling","retelling of","of the","the ancient","ancient Medusa","Medusa myth","myth ,",", strange","strange ,",", clothed","clothed statues","statues of","of men","men are","are appearing","appearing all","all over","over Greece","Only Perseus","Perseus ,",", a","a leader","leader of","of a","a gang","gang of","of modern","modern Athenian","Athenian thieves","thieves ,",", with","with a","a strange","strange childhood","childhood ,",", holds","holds the","the answer","answer to","to the","the mystery","mystery --","-- and","and it","it has","has something","something to","to do","do with","with beautiful","beautiful ,",", long-haired","long-haired women","women in","in black","One night","night his","his group","group breaks","breaks into","into the","the house","house of","of one","one such","such creature","Filled with","with low-key","low-key humor","humor and","and suspense","suspense ,",", Medusa","Medusa unfolds","unfolds in","in a","a simple","simple and","and tantalizing","tantalizing way"]}

{"title":"Kosnice","plot":"Thursday morning, Jerusalem. Nira goes to work. Ahmad in London does the same, Ralf in Cologne and a priest in Prague too. Matija, Croat, goes to work as well. Ok, he doesn't, but he acts as if he does. Ahmad is taking his routine red bus journey. Out-of-breath young man comes in and interrupts it. Schoolteacher Nira is also interrupted - her pupil jumps out and performs a love rap song he wrote for her. The priest in Prague doesn't feel like singing today, he is in the mood for (over)sleeping instead. Someone falls asleep, someone else - Ralf - falls in love. All five mentioned above are listening to the top-news about the disappearance of bees. And trying their best, each one of them in his or her own 'hive': Zagreb, Jerusalem, London, Cologne, Prague...","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Thursday","morn",",","Jerusalem",".","Nira","goe","to","work",".","Ahmad","in","London","doe","the","same",",","Ralf","in","Cologn","and","a","priest","in","Pragu","too",".","Matija",",","Croat",",","goe","to","work","as","well",".","Ok",",","he","doe","n't",",","but","he","act","as","if","he","doe",".","Ahmad","is","take","his","routin","red","bus","journey",".","Out-of-breath","young","man","come","in","and","interrupt","it",".","Schoolteach","Nira","is","also","interrupt","-","her","pupil","jump","out","and","perform","a","love","rap","song","he","wrote","for","her",".","The","priest","in","Pragu","doe","n't","feel","like","sing","today",",","he","is","in","the","mood","for","(","over",")","sleep","instead",".","Someon","fall","asleep",",","someon","els","-","Ralf","-","fall","in","love",".","All","five","mention","abov","are","listen","to","the","top-new","about","the","disappear","of","bee",".","And","tri","their","best",",","each","one","of","them","in","his","or","her","own","'","hive","'",":","Zagreb",",","Jerusalem",",","London",",","Cologn",",","Pragu","..."],"lemmas":["Thursday","morning",",","Jerusalem",".","Nira","go","to","work",".","Ahmad","in","London","do","the","same",",","Ralf","in","Cologne","and","a","priest","in","Prague","too",".","Matija",",","Croat",",","go","to","work","as","well",".","ok",",","he","do","not",",","but","he","act","as","if","he","do",".","Ahmad","be","take","he","routine","red","bus","journey",".","out-of-breath","young","man","come","in","and","interrupt","it",".","Schoolteacher","Nira","be","also","interrupt","-","she","pupil","jump","out","and","perform","a","love","rap","song","he","write","for","she",".","the","priest","in","Prague","do","not","feel","like","singing","today",",","he","be","in","the","mood","for","-lrb-","over","-rrb-","sleep","instead",".","someone","fall","asleep",",","someone","else","-","ralf","-","fall","in","love",".","all","five","mention","above","be","listen","to","the","top-news","about","the","disappearance","of","bee",".","and","try","they","best",",","each","one","of","they","in","he","or","she","own","'","hive","'",":","Zagreb",",","Jerusalem",",","London",",","Cologne",",","Prague","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Thursday morning ,","morning , Jerusalem","Nira goes to","goes to work","Ahmad in London","in London does","London does the","does the same","the same ,","same , Ralf",", Ralf in","Ralf in Cologne","in Cologne and","Cologne and a","and a priest","a priest in","priest in Prague","in Prague too","Matija , Croat",", Croat ,","Croat , goes",", goes to","goes to work","to work as","work as well","Ok , he",", he does","he does n't","does n't ,","n't , but",", but he","but he acts","he acts as","acts as if","as if he","if he does","Ahmad is taking","is taking his","taking his routine","his routine red","routine red bus","red bus journey","Out-of-breath young man","young man comes","man comes in","comes in and","in and interrupts","and interrupts it","Schoolteacher Nira is","Nira is also","is also interrupted","also interrupted -","interrupted -

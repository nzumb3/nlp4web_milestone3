{"title":"Sharqiya","plot":"Nobody really respects Camel Najer, the young Bedouin who works as a security guard at the central bus station. Neither his family, nor his colleagues. When the Israeli government threatens to tear down his settlement, he decides to act. Camel comes up with the plan to stage a bomb attack, which he will then prevent from happening, making him the hero of the day, hopefully saving his settlement and earning him the respect he's so desperately yearning for.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Nobodi","realli","respect","Camel","Najer",",","the","young","Bedouin","who","work","as","a","secur","guard","at","the","central","bus","station",".","Neither","his","famili",",","nor","his","colleagu",".","When","the","Israeli","govern","threaten","to","tear","down","his","settlement",",","he","decid","to","act",".","Camel","come","up","with","the","plan","to","stage","a","bomb","attack",",","which","he","will","then","prevent","from","happen",",","make","him","the","hero","of","the","day",",","hope","save","his","settlement","and","earn","him","the","respect","he","'s","so","desper","yearn","for","."],"lemmas":["nobody","really","respect","Camel","Najer",",","the","young","Bedouin","who","work","as","a","security","guard","at","the","central","bus","station",".","neither","he","family",",","nor","he","colleague",".","when","the","israeli","government","threaten","to","tear","down","he","settlement",",","he","decide","to","act",".","Camel","come","up","with","the","plan","to","stage","a","bomb","attack",",","which","he","will","then","prevent","from","happen",",","make","he","the","hero","of","the","day",",","hopefully","save","he","settlement","and","earn","he","the","respect","he","be","so","desperately","yearning","for","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Nobody really respects","really respects Camel","respects Camel Najer","Camel Najer ,","Najer , the",", the young","the young Bedouin","young Bedouin who","Bedouin who works","who works as","works as a","as a security","a security guard","security guard at","guard at the","at the central","the central bus","central bus station","Neither his family","his family ,","family , nor",", nor his","nor his colleagues","When the Israeli","the Israeli government","Israeli government threatens","government threatens to","threatens to tear","to tear down","tear down his","down his settlement","his settlement ,","settlement , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to act","Camel comes up","comes up with","up with the","with the plan","the plan to","plan to stage","to stage a","stage a bomb","a bomb attack","bomb attack ,","attack , which",", which he","which he will","he will then","will then prevent","then prevent from","prevent from happening","from happening ,","happening , making",", making him","making him the","him the hero","the hero of","hero of the","of the day","the day ,","day , hopefully",", hopefully saving","hopefully saving his","saving his settlement","his settlement and","settlement and earning","and earning him","earning him the","him the respect","the respect he","respect he 's","he 's so","'s so desperately","so desperately yearning","desperately yearning for"],"2grams":["Nobody really","really respects","respects Camel","Camel Najer","Najer ,",", the","the young","young Bedouin","Bedouin who","who works","works as","as a","a security","security guard","guard at","at the","the central","central bus","bus station","Neither his","his family","family ,",", nor","nor his","his colleagues","When the","the Israeli","Israeli government","government threatens","threatens to","to tear","tear down","down his","his settlement","settlement ,",", he","he decides","decides to","to act","Camel comes","comes up","up with","with the","the plan","plan to","to stage","stage a","a bomb","bomb attack","attack ,",", which","which he","he will","will then","then prevent","prevent from","from happening","happening ,",", making","making him","him the","the hero","hero of","of the","the day","day ,",", hopefully","hopefully saving","saving his","his settlement","settlement and","and earning","earning him","him the","the respect","respect he","he 's","'s so","so desperately","desperately yearning","yearning for"]}

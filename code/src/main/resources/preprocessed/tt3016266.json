{"title":"Salvation Army","plot":"Abdellah is a young gay man navigating the sexual, racial and political climate of Morocco. Growing up in a large family in a working-class neighborhood, Abdellah is caught between a distant father, an authoritarian mother, an older brother whom he adores and a handful of predatory older men, in a society that denies his homosexuality. As a college student, Abdellah moves to Geneva and while faced with the new possibilities of freedom, he grapples with the loss of his homeland. SALVATION ARMY, the directorial debut for Abdellah Taïa - an acclaimed Moroccan and Arab writer - is adapted from his novel of the same name. Taïa is the first writer of his descent to speak out openly about his homosexuality.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Abdellah","is","a","young","gay","man","navig","the","sexual",",","racial","and","polit","climat","of","Morocco",".","Grow","up","in","a","larg","famili","in","a","working-class","neighborhood",",","Abdellah","is","caught","between","a","distant","father",",","an","authoritarian","mother",",","an","older","brother","whom","he","ador","and","a","hand","of","predatori","older","men",",","in","a","societi","that","deni","his","homosexu",".","As","a","colleg","student",",","Abdellah","move","to","Geneva","and","while","face","with","the","new","possibl","of","freedom",",","he","grappl","with","the","loss","of","his","homeland",".","SALVATION","ARMi",",","the","directori","debut","for","Abdellah","Taïa","-","an","acclaim","Moroccan","and","Arab","writer","-","is","adapt","from","his","novel","of","the","same","name",".","Taïa","is","the","first","writer","of","his","descent","to","speak","out","open","about","his","homosexu","."],"lemmas":["Abdellah","be","a","young","gay","man","navigate","the","sexual",",","racial","and","political","climate","of","Morocco",".","grow","up","in","a","large","family","in","a","working-class","neighborhood",",","Abdellah","be","catch","between","a","distant","father",",","a","authoritarian","mother",",","a","older","brother","whom","he","adore","and","a","handful","of","predatory","older","man",",","in","a","society","that","deny","he","homosexuality",".","as","a","college","student",",","Abdellah","move","to","Geneva","and","while","face","with","the","new","possibility","of","freedom",",","he","grapple","with","the","loss","of","he","homeland",".","SALVATION","ARMY",",","the","directorial","debut","for","Abdellah","Taïa","-","a","acclaimed","Moroccan","and","Arab","writer","-","be","adapt","from","he","novel","of","the","same","name",".","Taïa","be","the","first","writer","of","he","descent","to","speak","out","openly","about","he","homosexuality","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Abdellah is a","is a young","a young gay","young gay man","gay man navigating","man navigating the","navigating the sexual","the sexual ,","sexual , racial",", racial and","racial and political","and political climate","political climate of","climate of Morocco","Growing up in","up in a","in a large","a large family","large family in","family in a","in a working-class","a working-class neighborhood","working-class neighborhood ,","neighborhood , Abdellah",", Abdellah is","Abdellah is caught","is caught between","caught between a","between a distant","a distant father","distant father ,","father , an",", an authoritarian","an authoritarian mother","authoritarian mother ,","mother , an",", an older","an older brother","older brother whom","brother whom he","whom he adores","he adores and","adores and a","and a handful","a handful of","handful of predatory","of predatory older","predatory older men","older men ,","men , in",", in a","in a society","a society that","society that denies","that denies his","denies his homosexuality","As a college","a college student","college student ,","student , Abdellah",", Abdellah moves","Abdellah moves to","moves to Geneva","to Geneva and","Geneva and while","and while faced","while faced with","faced with the","with the new","the new possibilities","new possibilities of","possibilities of freedom","of freedom ,","freedom , he",", he grapples","he grapples with","grapples with the","with the loss","the loss of","loss of his","of his homeland","SALVATION ARMY ,","ARMY , the",", the directorial","the directorial debut","directorial debut for","debut for Abdellah","for Abdellah Taïa","Abdellah Taïa -","Taïa -

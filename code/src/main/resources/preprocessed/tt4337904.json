{"title":"Sistiaga, une histoire basque","plot":"José Antonio Sistiaga is one of the greats in Basque contemporary art. Through lively exchanges begun in 1993 with his Salvadorean friend Manuel Sorto, we plunge into Sistiaga's intellectual intimacy and travel through a Basque history, following the steps of this experimental filmmaker and artist. This nearly two decades-old project is taken up again in 2011, with the filming of the installation of Sistiaga's retrospective exhibition in San Sebastian, Basque Country, Spain.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["José","Antonio","Sistiaga","is","one","of","the","great","in","Basqu","contemporari","art",".","Through","live","exchang","begun","in","1993","with","his","Salvadorean","friend","Manuel","Sorto",",","we","plung","into","Sistiaga","'s","intellectu","intimaci","and","travel","through","a","Basqu","histori",",","follow","the","step","of","this","experiment","filmmak","and","artist",".","This","near","two","decades-old","project","is","taken","up","again","in","2011",",","with","the","film","of","the","instal","of","Sistiaga","'s","retrospect","exhibit","in","San","Sebastian",",","Basqu","Countri",",","Spain","."],"lemmas":["José","Antonio","Sistiaga","be","one","of","the","great","in","basque","contemporary","art",".","through","lively","exchange","begin","in","1993","with","he","salvadorean","friend","Manuel","Sorto",",","we","plunge","into","Sistiaga","'s","intellectual","intimacy","and","travel","through","a","basque","history",",","follow","the","step","of","this","experimental","filmmaker","and","artist",".","this","nearly","two","decades-old","project","be","take","up","again","in","2011",",","with","the","film","of","the","installation","of","Sistiaga","'s","retrospective","exhibition","in","San","Sebastian",",","basque","Country",",","Spain","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["José Antonio Sistiaga","Antonio Sistiaga is","Sistiaga is one","is one of","one of the","of the greats","the greats in","greats in Basque","in Basque contemporary","Basque contemporary art","Through lively exchanges","lively exchanges begun","exchanges begun in","begun in 1993","in 1993 with","1993 with his","with his Salvadorean","his Salvadorean friend","Salvadorean friend Manuel","friend Manuel Sorto","Manuel Sorto ,","Sorto , we",", we plunge","we plunge into","plunge into Sistiaga","into Sistiaga 's","Sistiaga 's intellectual","'s intellectual intimacy","intellectual intimacy and","intimacy and travel","and travel through","travel through a","through a Basque","a Basque history","Basque history ,","history , following",", following the","following the steps","the steps of","steps of this","of this experimental","this experimental filmmaker","experimental filmmaker and","filmmaker and artist","This nearly two","nearly two decades-old","two decades-old project","decades-old project is","project is taken","is taken up","taken up again","up again in","again in 2011","in 2011 ,","2011 , with",", with the","with the filming","the filming of","filming of the","of the installation","the installation of","installation of Sistiaga","of Sistiaga 's","Sistiaga 's retrospective","'s retrospective exhibition","retrospective exhibition in","exhibition in San","in San Sebastian","San Sebastian ,","Sebastian , Basque",", Basque Country","Basque Country ,","Country , Spain"],"2grams":["José Antonio","Antonio Sistiaga","Sistiaga is","is one","one of","of the","the greats","greats in","in Basque","Basque contemporary","contemporary art","Through lively","lively exchanges","exchanges begun","begun in","in 1993","1993 with","with his","his Salvadorean","Salvadorean friend","friend Manuel","Manuel Sorto","Sorto ,",", we","we plunge","plunge into","into Sistiaga","Sistiaga 's","'s intellectual","intellectual intimacy","intimacy and","and travel","travel through","through a","a Basque","Basque history","history ,",", following","following the","the steps","steps of","of this","this experimental","experimental filmmaker","filmmaker and","and artist","This nearly","nearly two","two decades-old","decades-old project","project is","is taken","taken up","up again","again in","in 2011","2011 ,",", with","with the","the filming","filming of","of the","the installation","installation of","of Sistiaga","Sistiaga 's","'s retrospective","retrospective exhibition","exhibition in","in San","San Sebastian","Sebastian ,",", Basque","Basque Country","Country ,",", Spain"]}

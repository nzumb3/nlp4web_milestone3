{"title":"Krishna Leelai","plot":"Whenever evil surfaces, Lord Krishna will be there to destroy it. In the film, Hero plays a modern-age Krishna who fights against problems in the society.\"I had been to Tirupathi, Sabari Mala, Velankanni, Nagercoil recently and observed the devotees who visited the temples, Church and Mosques. Everyone came with their own share of problems. Is the problems solved by the God? This inspired me to make a film focussing on the problems of the society.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Whenev","evil","surfac",",","Lord","Krishna","will","be","there","to","destroy","it",".","In","the","film",",","Hero","play","a","modern-ag","Krishna","who","fight","against","problem","in","the","societi",".","\"","I","had","been","to","Tirupathi",",","Sabari","Mala",",","Velankanni",",","Nagercoil","recent","and","observ","the","devote","who","visit","the","templ",",","Church","and","Mosqu",".","Everyon","came","with","their","own","share","of","problem",".","Is","the","problem","solv","by","the","God","?","This","inspir","me","to","make","a","film","focuss","on","the","problem","of","the","societi","."],"lemmas":["whenever","evil","surface",",","Lord","Krishna","will","be","there","to","destroy","it",".","in","the","film",",","hero","play","a","modern-age","Krishna","who","fight","against","problem","in","the","society",".","``","I","have","be","to","Tirupathi",",","Sabari","Mala",",","Velankanni",",","Nagercoil","recently","and","observe","the","devotee","who","visit","the","temple",",","Church","and","Mosques",".","everyone","come","with","they","own","share","of","problem",".","be","the","problem","solve","by","the","God","?","this","inspire","I","to","make","a","film","focus","on","the","problem","of","the","society","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Whenever evil surfaces","evil surfaces ,","surfaces , Lord",", Lord Krishna","Lord Krishna will","Krishna will be","will be there","be there to","there to destroy","to destroy it","In the film","the film ,","film , Hero",", Hero plays","Hero plays a","plays a modern-age","a modern-age Krishna","modern-age Krishna who","Krishna who fights","who fights against","fights against problems","against problems in","problems in the","in the society","\" I had","I had been","had been to","been to Tirupathi","to Tirupathi ,","Tirupathi , Sabari",", Sabari Mala","Sabari Mala ,","Mala , Velankanni",", Velankanni ,","Velankanni , Nagercoil",", Nagercoil recently","Nagercoil recently and","recently and observed","and observed the","observed the devotees","the devotees who","devotees who visited","who visited the","visited the temples","the temples ,","temples , Church",", Church and","Church and Mosques","Everyone came with","came with their","with their own","their own share","own share of","share of problems","Is the problems","the problems solved","problems solved by","solved by the","by the God","This inspired me","inspired me to","me to make","to make a","make a film","a film focussing","film focussing on","focussing on the","on the problems","the problems of","problems of the","of the society"],"2grams":["Whenever evil","evil surfaces","surfaces ,",", Lord","Lord Krishna","Krishna will","will be","be there","there to","to destroy","destroy it","In the","the film","film ,",", Hero","Hero plays","plays a","a modern-age","modern-age Krishna","Krishna who","who fights","fights against","against problems","problems in","in the","the society","\" I","I had","had been","been to","to Tirupathi","Tirupathi ,",", Sabari","Sabari Mala","Mala ,",", Velankanni","Velankanni ,",", Nagercoil","Nagercoil recently","recently and","and observed","observed the","the devotees","devotees who","who visited","visited the","the temples","temples ,",", Church","Church and","and Mosques","Everyone came","came with","with their","their own","own share","share of","of problems","Is the","the problems","problems solved","solved by","by the","the God","This inspired","inspired me","me to","to make","make a","a film","film focussing","focussing on","on the","the problems","problems of","of the","the society"]}

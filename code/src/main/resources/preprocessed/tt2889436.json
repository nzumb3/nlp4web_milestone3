{"title":"Ammen","plot":"Szatmárcseke is a settlement with 1600 inhabitants in one of the poorest regions of Hungary, on the Ukraine - Romanian - Hungarian border. Due to the extraordinarily high level of unemployment deprivation is an everyday situation; people make their living by taking part in public employment programs or live on social aid. The Roma minority population is increasing year by year. Their current ratio between school-age children has reached fifty percent. Our film documents the period elapsing between 2005 and 2012 examining how the unexpected appearance of an American Baptist pastor transformed the life of the Gypsy population in Cseke.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Szatmárcsek","is","a","settlement","with","1600","inhabit","in","one","of","the","poorest","region","of","Hungari",",","on","the","Ukrain","-","Romanian","-","Hungarian","border",".","Due","to","the","extraordinarili","high","level","of","unemploy","depriv","is","an","everyday","situat",";","peopl","make","their","live","by","take","part","in","public","employ","program","or","live","on","social","aid",".","The","Roma","minor","popul","is","increas","year","by","year",".","Their","current","ratio","between","school-ag","children","has","reach","fifti","percent",".","Our","film","document","the","period","elaps","between","2005","and","2012","examin","how","the","unexpect","appear","of","an","American","Baptist","pastor","transform","the","life","of","the","Gypsi","popul","in","Cseke","."],"lemmas":["Szatmárcseke","be","a","settlement","with","1600","inhabitant","in","one","of","the","poorest","region","of","Hungary",",","on","the","Ukraine","-","romanian","-","hungarian","border",".","due","to","the","extraordinarily","high","level","of","unemployment","deprivation","be","a","everyday","situation",";","people","make","they","living","by","take","part","in","public","employment","program","or","live","on","social","aid",".","the","Roma","minority","population","be","increase","year","by","year",".","they","current","ratio","between","school-age","child","have","reach","fifty","percent",".","we","film","document","the","period","elapse","between","2005","and","2012","examine","how","the","unexpected","appearance","of","a","American","Baptist","pastor","transform","the","life","of","the","gypsy","population","in","Cseke","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Szatmárcseke is a","is a settlement","a settlement with","settlement with 1600","with 1600 inhabitants","1600 inhabitants in","inhabitants in one","in one of","one of the","of the poorest","the poorest regions","poorest regions of","regions of Hungary","of Hungary ,","Hungary , on",", on the","on the Ukraine","the Ukraine -","Ukraine - Romanian","- Romanian -","Romanian - Hungarian","- Hungarian border","Due to the","to the extraordinarily","the extraordinarily high","extraordinarily high level","high level of","level of unemployment","of unemployment deprivation","unemployment deprivation is","deprivation is an","is an everyday","an everyday situation","everyday situation ;","situation ;

The country is thrown into commotion when he announces that he is leaving the police force just before the elections to join the extreme right party, VPV. On his last day as a policeman, he leads an investigation that takes him to Charleroi where a raid on a drug lab sets in motion a series of unforeseeable and fatal events.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Dode","Hoek","(","Blind","Spot",")","is","the","stori","of","Jan","Verbeeck",",","the","uncompromis","commission","of","the","Antwerp","drug","squad",".","Known","as","Mr.","Zero","Toler",",","he","is","huge","popular","with","the","peopl","and","the","media",".","The","countri","is","thrown","into","commot","when","he","announc","that","he","is","leav","the","polic","forc","just","befor","the","elect","to","join","the","extrem","right","parti",",","VPV",".","On","his","last","day","as","a","policeman",",","he","lead","an","investig","that","take","him","to","Charleroi","where","a","raid","on","a","drug","lab","set","in","motion","a","seri","of","unforese","and","fatal","event","."],"lemmas":["Dode","Hoek","-lrb-","Blind","Spot","-rrb-","be","the","story","of","Jan","Verbeeck",",","the","uncompromising","commissioner","of","the","Antwerp","drug","squad",".","know","as","Mr.","Zero","tolerance",",","he","be","hugely","popular","with","the","people","and","the","media",".","the","country","be","throw","into","commotion","when","he","announce","that","he","be","leave","the","police","force","just","before","the","election","to","join","the","extreme","right","party",",","vpv",".","on","he","last","day","as","a","policeman",",","he","lead","a","investigation","that","take","he","to","Charleroi","where","a","raid","on","a","drug","lab","set","in","motion","a","series","of","unforeseeable","and","fatal","event","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Dode Hoek (","Hoek ( Blind","( Blind Spot","Blind Spot )","Spot ) is",") is the","is the story","the story of","story of Jan","of Jan Verbeeck","Jan Verbeeck ,","Verbeeck , the",", the uncompromising","the uncompromising commissioner","uncompromising commissioner of","commissioner of the","of the Antwerp","the Antwerp drug","Antwerp drug squad","Known as Mr.","as Mr. Zero","Mr. Zero Tolerance","Zero Tolerance ,","Tolerance , he",", he is","he is hugely","is hugely popular","hugely popular with","popular with the","with the people","the people and","people and the","and the media","The country is","country is thrown","is thrown into","thrown into commotion","into commotion when","commotion when he","when he announces","he announces that","announces that he","that he is","he is leaving","is leaving the","leaving the police","the police force","police force just","force just before","just before the","before the elections","the elections to","elections to join","to join the","join the extreme","the extreme right","extreme right party","right party ,","party , VPV","On his last","his last day","last day as","day as a","as a policeman","a policeman ,","policeman , he",", he leads","he leads an","leads an investigation","an investigation that","investigation that takes","that takes him","takes him to","him to Charleroi","to Charleroi where","Charleroi where a","where a raid","a raid on","raid on a","on a drug","a drug lab","drug lab sets","lab sets in","sets in motion","in motion a","motion a series","a series of","series of unforeseeable","of unforeseeable and","unforeseeable and fatal","and fatal events"],"2grams":["Dode Hoek","Hoek (","( Blind","Blind Spot","Spot )",") is","is the","the story","story of","of Jan","Jan Verbeeck","Verbeeck ,",", the","the uncompromising","uncompromising commissioner","commissioner of","of the","the Antwerp","Antwerp drug","drug squad","Known as","as Mr.","Mr. Zero","Zero Tolerance","Tolerance ,",", he","he is","is hugely","hugely popular","popular with","with the","the people","people and","and the","the media","The country","country is","is thrown","thrown into","into commotion","commotion when","when he","he announces","announces that","that he","he is","is leaving","leaving the","the police","police force","force just","just before","before the","the elections","elections to","to join","join the","the extreme","extreme right","right party","party ,",", VPV","On his","his last","last day","day as","as a","a policeman","policeman ,",", he","he leads","leads an","an investigation","investigation that","that takes","takes him","him to","to Charleroi","Charleroi where","where a","a raid","raid on","on a","a drug","drug lab","lab sets","sets in","in motion","motion a","a series","series of","of unforeseeable","unforeseeable and","and fatal","fatal events"]}

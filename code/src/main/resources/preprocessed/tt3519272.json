{"title":"Memories","plot":"Romain, 23, is the watchman of a small Paris hotel. He does not know it yet but he is about to become a novelist... Madeleine is six decades older than him.

One day, Madeleine escapes from the nursing home where she has been placed against her will by her sons (one of whom, Michel, is Romain's father). Romain asks his employer for a leave and joins her in Etretat. Both have a wonderful day in the town of Madeleine's youth...","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Romain",",","23",",","is","the","watchman","of","a","small","Pari","hotel",".","He","doe","not","know","it","yet","but","he","is","about","to","becom","a","novelist","...","Madelein","is","six","decad","older","than","him",".","She","is","his","grandmoth",".","Surpris","enough",",","the","age","gap","doe","not","mean","a","thing","for","them",":","they","mesh","like","magic",".","It","look","as","if","they","were","born","the","same","day",".","One","day",",","Madelein","escap","from","the","nurs","home","where","she","has","been","place","against","her","will","by","her","son","(","one","of","whom",",","Michel",",","is","Romain","'s","father",")",".","Romain","ask","his","employ","for","a","leav","and","join","her","in","Etretat",".","Both","have","a","wonder","day","in","the","town","of","Madelein","'s","youth","..."],"lemmas":["Romain",",","23",",","be","the","watchman","of","a","small","Paris","hotel",".","he","do","not","know","it","yet","but","he","be","about","to","become","a","novelist","...","Madeleine","be","six","decade","older","than","he",".","she","be","he","grandmother",".","surprisingly","enough",",","the","age","gap","do","not","mean","a","thing","for","they",":","they","mesh","like","magic",".","it","look","as","if","they","be","bear","the","same","day",".","one","day",",","Madeleine","escape","from","the","nursing","home","where","she","have","be","place","against","she","will","by","she","son","-lrb-","one","of","whom",",","Michel",",","be","Romain","'s","father","-rrb-",".","Romain","ask","he","employer","for","a","leave","and","join","she","in","Etretat",".","both","have","a","wonderful","day","in","the","town","of","Madeleine","'s","youth","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Romain , 23",", 23 ,","23 , is",", is the","is the watchman","the watchman of","watchman of a","of a small","a small Paris","small Paris hotel","He does not","does not know","not know it","know it yet","it yet but","yet but he","but he is","he is about","is about to","about to become","to become a","become a novelist","a novelist ...","novelist ...

{"title":"Watershed","plot":"Watershed is an exploration of the water quality and algae crisis of the Lake Michigan shoreline along Manitowoc and Sheboygan counties. Local residents and experts agree that more action needs to be taken to ensure water quality remains a clean, stable resource for their children and theirs for generations to come. While many quickly point out lack of ambition for the county board and state government to get more involved on contamination problems, others are mindful of basic things all can do to raise awareness and help everyone understand the value of water quality and Lake Michigan.","genres":["Documentary"," News","

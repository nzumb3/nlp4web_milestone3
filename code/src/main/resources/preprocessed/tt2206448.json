{"title":"Wheels of Fortune","plot":"'Wheels of Fortune' takes an in-depth look at the problems associated with disability access lawsuits. The Americans With Disabilities act is an important and groundbreaking piece of U.S. legislation that has improved the lives of many Americans living with disabilities. However, the vague and unregulated nature of the law has lead to a number of complications for businesses, for the legal system, and for the disabled community. Today there is still widespread inaccessibility, and a recent epidemic of serial litigants and opportunistic lawyers with questionable means and motives have exploited the law for personal profit, with often devastating effects. 'Wheels of Fortune' explores this complex issue from all angles though a series of interviews with business owners, lawyers, judges, politicians, and persons with disabilities.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["'","Wheel","of","Fortun","'","take","an","in-depth","look","at","the","problem","associ","with","disabl","access","lawsuit",".","The","American","With","Disabl","act","is","an","import","and","groundbreak","piec","of","U.S.","legisl","that","has","improv","the","live","of","mani","American","live","with","disabl",".","Howev",",","the","vagu","and","unregul","natur","of","the","law","has","lead","to","a","number","of","complic","for","busi",",","for","the","legal","system",",","and","for","the","disabl","communiti",".","Today","there","is","still","widespread","inaccess",",","and","a","recent","epidem","of","serial","litig","and","opportunist","lawyer","with","question","mean","and","motiv","have","exploit","the","law","for","person","profit",",","with","often","devast","effect",".","'","Wheel","of","Fortun","'","explor","this","complex","issu","from","all","angl","though","a","seri","of","interview","with","busi","owner",",","lawyer",",","judg",",","politician",",","and","person","with","disabl","."],"lemmas":["'","Wheels","of","Fortune","'","take","a","in-depth","look","at","the","problem","associate","with","disability","access","lawsuit",".","the","Americans","with","Disabilities","act","be","a","important","and","groundbreaking","piece","of","U.S.","legislation","that","have","improve","the","life","of","many","Americans","live","with","disability",".","however",",","the","vague","and","unregulated","nature","of","the","law","have","lead","to","a","number","of","complication","for","business",",","for","the","legal","system",",","and","for","the","disabled","community",".","today","there","be","still","widespread","inaccessibility",",","and","a","recent","epidemic","of","serial","litigant","and","opportunistic","lawyer","with","questionable","means","and","motive","have","exploit","the","law","for","personal","profit",",","with","often","devastating","effect",".","'","Wheels","of","Fortune","'","explore","this","complex","issue","from","all","angle","though","a","series","of","interview","with","business","owner",",","lawyer",",","judge",",","politician",",","and","person","with","disability","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Wheels of","Wheels of Fortune","of Fortune '","Fortune ' takes","' takes an","takes an in-depth","an in-depth look","in-depth look at","look at the","at the problems","the problems associated","problems associated with","associated with disability","with disability access","disability access lawsuits","The Americans With","Americans With Disabilities","With Disabilities act","Disabilities act is","act is an","is an important","an important and","important and groundbreaking","and groundbreaking piece","groundbreaking piece of","piece of U.S.","of U.S. legislation","U.S. legislation that","legislation that has","that has improved","has improved the","improved the lives","the lives of","lives of many","of many Americans","many Americans living","Americans living with","living with disabilities","However , the",", the vague","the vague and","vague and unregulated","and unregulated nature","unregulated nature of","nature of the","of the law","the law has","law has lead","has lead to","lead to a","to a number","a number of","number of complications","of complications for","complications for businesses","for businesses ,","businesses , for",", for the","for the legal","the legal system","legal system ,","system , and",", and for","and for the","for the disabled","the disabled community","Today there is","there is still","is still widespread","still widespread inaccessibility","widespread inaccessibility ,","inaccessibility , and",", and a","and a recent","a recent epidemic","recent epidemic of","epidemic of serial","of serial litigants","serial litigants and","litigants and opportunistic","and opportunistic lawyers","opportunistic lawyers with","lawyers with questionable","with questionable means","questionable means and","means and motives","and motives have","motives have exploited","have exploited the","exploited the law","the law for","law for personal","for personal profit","personal profit ,","profit , with",", with often","with often devastating","often devastating effects","devastating effects .","effects .

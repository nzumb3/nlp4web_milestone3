{"title":"The Haunting of Sarcnoia Buttercup","plot":"The notorious Marshall House in Savannah, Georgia is well known for being home of a cursed soul that enchants the old bed and breakfast, but the story of the spirit is a terrible one full of greed, lies and murder. In 1851, a young newlywed couple stayed at the newly renovated hotel, but only one of them would leave its premises alive. Albester Buttercup murdered his bride Sarcnoia after receiving an expensive dowry--his only reason for marrying the unsuspecting young girl. Old General Buttercup was driven mad over his life, and some believe the couple's spirits still haunt the old bed and breakfast until this day.","genres":["Mystery"],"stems":["The","notori","Marshal","Hous","in","Savannah",",","Georgia","is","well","known","for","be","home","of","a","curs","soul","that","enchant","the","old","bed","and","breakfast",",","but","the","stori","of","the","spirit","is","a","terribl","one","full","of","greed",",","lie","and","murder",".","In","1851",",","a","young","newlyw","coupl","stay","at","the","newli","renov","hotel",",","but","onli","one","of","them","would","leav","it","premis","aliv",".","Albester","Buttercup","murder","his","bride","Sarcnoia","after","receiv","an","expens","dowri","--","his","onli","reason","for","marri","the","unsuspect","young","girl",".","Old","Gener","Buttercup","was","driven","mad","over","his","life",",","and","some","believ","the","coupl","'s","spirit","still","haunt","the","old","bed","and","breakfast","until","this","day","."],"lemmas":["the","notorious","Marshall","House","in","Savannah",",","Georgia","be","well","know","for","be","home","of","a","cursed","soul","that","enchant","the","old","bed","and","breakfast",",","but","the","story","of","the","spirit","be","a","terrible","one","full","of","greed",",","lie","and","murder",".","in","1851",",","a","young","newlywed","couple","stay","at","the","newly","renovate","hotel",",","but","only","one","of","they","would","leave","its","premise","alive",".","Albester","Buttercup","murder","he","bride","Sarcnoia","after","receive","a","expensive","dowry","--","he","only","reason","for","marry","the","unsuspecting","young","girl",".","Old","General","Buttercup","be","drive","mad","over","he","life",",","and","some","believe","the","couple","'s","spirit","still","haunt","the","old","bed","and","breakfast","until","this","day","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

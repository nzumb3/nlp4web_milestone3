{"title":"The Lesser Evil","plot":"When four young boys decide to go over-board with dealing with two bullies, they believe they can get away with their crime. Years later, new evidence appears and the cops are back on the trail to solve the murders. The four - now the owner of a failing lumber company (Colm Feore), a priest (Arliss Howard), a policeman (Tony Goldwyn), and a lawyer (David Paymer) - gather in a remote cabin to discuss what their future actions should be. Told in harrowing flashbacks and with obvious difference of current points-of-view, the men argue out their circumstances.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["When","four","young","boy","decid","to","go","over-board","with","deal","with","two","bulli",",","they","believ","they","can","get","away","with","their","crime",".","Year","later",",","new","evid","appear","and","the","cop","are","back","on","the","trail","to","solv","the","murder",".","The","four","-","now","the","owner","of","a","fail","lumber","compani","(","Colm","Feor",")",",","a","priest","(","Arliss","Howard",")",",","a","policeman","(","Toni","Goldwyn",")",",","and","a","lawyer","(","David","Paymer",")","-","gather","in","a","remot","cabin","to","discuss","what","their","futur","action","should","be",".","Told","in","harrow","flashback","and","with","obvious","differ","of","current","points-of-view",",","the","men","argu","out","their","circumst","."],"lemmas":["when","four","young","boy","decide","to","go","over-board","with","deal","with","two","bully",",","they","believe","they","can","get","away","with","they","crime",".","year","later",",","new","evidence","appear","and","the","cop","be","back","on","the","trail","to","solve","the","murder",".","the","four","-","now","the","owner","of","a","fail","lumber","company","-lrb-","Colm","Feore","-rrb-",",","a","priest","-lrb-","Arliss","Howard","-rrb-",",","a","policeman","-lrb-","Tony","Goldwyn","-rrb-",",","and","a","lawyer","-lrb-","David","Paymer","-rrb-","-","gather","in","a","remote","cabin","to","discuss","what","they","future","action","should","be",".","tell","in","harrowing","flashback","and","with","obvious","difference","of","current","points-of-view",",","the","man","argue","out","they","circumstance","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When four young","four young boys","young boys decide","boys decide to","decide to go","to go over-board","go over-board with","over-board with dealing","with dealing with","dealing with two","with two bullies","two bullies ,","bullies , they",", they believe","they believe they","believe they can","they can get","can get away","get away with","away with their","with their crime","Years later ,","later , new",", new evidence","new evidence appears","evidence appears and","appears and the","and the cops","the cops are","cops are back","are back on","back on the","on the trail","the trail to","trail to solve","to solve the","solve the murders","The four -","four - now","- now the","now the owner","the owner of","owner of a","of a failing","a failing lumber","failing lumber company","lumber company (","company ( Colm","( Colm Feore","Colm Feore )","Feore ) ,",") , a",", a priest","a priest (","priest ( Arliss","( Arliss Howard","Arliss Howard )","Howard ) ,",") , a",", a policeman","a policeman (","policeman ( Tony","( Tony Goldwyn","Tony Goldwyn )","Goldwyn ) ,",") , and",", and a","and a lawyer","a lawyer (","lawyer ( David","( David Paymer","David Paymer )","Paymer ) -",") - gather","- gather in","gather in a","in a remote","a remote cabin","remote cabin to","cabin to discuss","to discuss what","discuss what their","what their future","their future actions","future actions should","actions should be","Told in harrowing","in harrowing flashbacks","harrowing flashbacks and","flashbacks and with","and with obvious","with obvious difference","obvious difference of","difference of current","of current points-of-view","current points-of-view ,","points-of-view , the",", the men","the men argue","men argue out","argue out their","out their circumstances"],"2grams":["When four","four young","young boys","boys decide","decide to","to go","go over-board","over-board with","with dealing","dealing with","with two","two bullies","bullies ,",", they","they believe","believe they","they can","can get","get away","away with","with their","their crime","Years later","later ,",", new","new evidence","evidence appears","appears and","and the","the cops","cops are","are back","back on","on the","the trail","trail to","to solve","solve the","the murders","The four","four -","- now","now the","the owner","owner of","of a","a failing","failing lumber","lumber company","company (","( Colm","Colm Feore","Feore )",") ,",", a","a priest","priest (","( Arliss","Arliss Howard","Howard )",") ,",", a","a policeman","policeman (","( Tony","Tony Goldwyn","Goldwyn )",") ,",", and","and a","a lawyer","lawyer (","( David","David Paymer","Paymer )",") -","- gather","gather in","in a","a remote","remote cabin","cabin to","to discuss","discuss what","what their","their future","future actions","actions should","should be","Told in","in harrowing","harrowing flashbacks","flashbacks and","and with","with obvious","obvious difference","difference of","of current","current points-of-view","points-of-view ,",", the","the men","men argue","argue out","out their","their circumstances"]}

{"title":"LoveTown","plot":"LoveTown is the pop-musical tale of a dysfunctional bar singer helping three wandering souls find their way back to love. All the while- her time is running out. In the spirit of 'Glee for adults', LoveTown finds its voice in new, original rock songs and an engaging storyline. Originally debuting as a live stage show at OKM International Music Festival, it's the first feature film by husband/wife creative team Jay & Ann-Janette Webster. Their melody is simple: 'Pain shapes us, but it's love that defines us, baby'.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Musical"],"stems":["LoveTown","is","the","pop-mus","tale","of","a","dysfunct","bar","singer","help","three","wander","soul","find","their","way","back","to","love",".","All","the","while","-","her","time","is","run","out",".","In","the","spirit","of","'","Glee","for","adult","'",",","LoveTown","find","it","voic","in","new",",","origin","rock","song","and","an","engag","storylin",".","Origin","debut","as","a","live","stage","show","at","OKM","Internat","Music","Festiv",",","it","'s","the","first","featur","film","by","husband/wif","creativ","team","Jay","&","Ann-Janett","Webster",".","Their","melodi","is","simpl",":","'","Pain","shape","us",",","but","it","'s","love","that","defin","us",",","babi","'","."],"lemmas":["LoveTown","be","the","pop-musical","tale","of","a","dysfunctional","bar","singer","help","three","wander","soul","find","they","way","back","to","love",".","all","the","while","-","she","time","be","run","out",".","in","the","spirit","of","'","glee","for","adult","'",",","LoveTown","find","its","voice","in","new",",","original","rock","song","and","a","engaging","storyline",".","originally","debut","as","a","live","stage","show","at","OKM","International","Music","Festival",",","it","be","the","first","feature","film","by","husband/wife","creative","team","Jay","&","Ann-Janette","Webster",".","they","melody","be","simple",":","'","pain","shape","we",",","but","it","be","love","that","define","we",",","baby","'","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["LoveTown is the","is the pop-musical","the pop-musical tale","pop-musical tale of","tale of a","of a dysfunctional","a dysfunctional bar","dysfunctional bar singer","bar singer helping","singer helping three","helping three wandering","three wandering souls","wandering souls find","souls find their","find their way","their way back","way back to","back to love","All the while","the while -","while - her","- her time","her time is","time is running","is running out","In the spirit","the spirit of","spirit of '","of ' Glee","' Glee for","Glee for adults","for adults '","adults ' ,","' , LoveTown",", LoveTown finds","LoveTown finds its","finds its voice","its voice in","voice in new","in new ,","new , original",", original rock","original rock songs","rock songs and","songs and an","and an engaging","an engaging storyline","Originally debuting as","debuting as a","as a live","a live stage","live stage show","stage show at","show at OKM","at OKM International","OKM International Music","International Music Festival","Music Festival ,","Festival , it",", it 's","it 's the","'s the first","the first feature","first feature film","feature film by","film by husband/wife","by husband/wife creative","husband/wife creative team","creative team Jay","team Jay &","Jay & Ann-Janette","& Ann-Janette Webster","Their melody is","melody is simple","is simple :","simple : '",": ' Pain","' Pain shapes","Pain shapes us","shapes us ,","us , but",", but it","but it 's","it 's love","'s love that","love that defines","that defines us","defines us ,","us , baby",", baby '"],"2grams":["LoveTown is","is the","the pop-musical","pop-musical tale","tale of","of a","a dysfunctional","dysfunctional bar","bar singer","singer helping","helping three","three wandering","wandering souls","souls find","find their","their way","way back","back to","to love","All the","the while","while -","- her","her time","time is","is running","running out","In the","the spirit","spirit of","of '","' Glee","Glee for","for adults","adults '","' ,",", LoveTown","LoveTown finds","finds its","its voice","voice in","in new","new ,",", original","original rock","rock songs","songs and","and an","an engaging","engaging storyline","Originally debuting","debuting as","as a","a live","live stage","stage show","show at","at OKM","OKM International","International Music","Music Festival","Festival ,",", it","it 's","'s the","the first","first feature","feature film","film by","by husband/wife","husband/wife creative","creative team","team Jay","Jay &","& Ann-Janette","Ann-Janette Webster","Their melody","melody is","is simple","simple :",": '","' Pain","Pain shapes","shapes us","us ,",", but","but it","it 's","'s love","love that","that defines","defines us","us ,",", baby","baby '"]}

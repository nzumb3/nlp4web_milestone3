Three families of musicians in the Ozark Mountains of Southwestern Missouri give new meaning to the word \"hillbilly\". Float down the backwaters, soak up some old time religion, savor a washboard duel, and bask in the neon lights of the pseudo-hillbilly showtown Branson. Lean back and merge into hillbilliness.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Hillbilli","have","n't","die","off",";","they","ve","simpli","becom","neo-hillbilli",".","Three","famili","of","musician","in","the","Ozark","Mountain","of","Southwestern","Missouri","give","new","mean","to","the","word","\"","hillbilli","\"",".","Float","down","the","backwat",",","soak","up","some","old","time","religion",",","savor","a","washboard","duel",",","and","bask","in","the","neon","light","of","the","pseudo-hillbilli","showtown","Branson",".","Lean","back","and","merg","into","hillbilli","."],"lemmas":["Hillbillies","have","not","die","off",";","they","have","simply","become","neo-hillbilly",".","three","family","of","musician","in","the","ozark","mountain","of","Southwestern","Missouri","give","new","meaning","to","the","word","``","hillbilly","''",".","float","down","the","backwater",",","soak","up","some","old","time","religion",",","savor","a","washboard","duel",",","and","bask","in","the","neon","light","of","the","pseudo-hillbilly","showtown","Branson",".","lean","back","and","merge","into","hillbilliness","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hillbillies have n't","have n't died","n't died off","died off ;","off ; they","; they 've","they 've simply","'ve simply become","simply become neo-hillbillies","Three families of","families of musicians","of musicians in","musicians in the","in the Ozark","the Ozark Mountains","Ozark Mountains of","Mountains of Southwestern","of Southwestern Missouri","Southwestern Missouri give","Missouri give new","give new meaning","new meaning to","meaning to the","to the word","the word \"","word \" hillbilly","\" hillbilly \"","Float down the","down the backwaters","the backwaters ,","backwaters , soak",", soak up","soak up some","up some old","some old time","old time religion","time religion ,","religion , savor",", savor a","savor a washboard","a washboard duel","washboard duel ,","duel , and",", and bask","and bask in","bask in the","in the neon","the neon lights","neon lights of","lights of the","of the pseudo-hillbilly","the pseudo-hillbilly showtown","pseudo-hillbilly showtown Branson","Lean back and","back and merge","and merge into","merge into hillbilliness"],"2grams":["Hillbillies have","have n't","n't died","died off","off ;","; they","they 've","'ve simply","simply become","become neo-hillbillies","Three families","families of","of musicians","musicians in","in the","the Ozark","Ozark Mountains","Mountains of","of Southwestern","Southwestern Missouri","Missouri give","give new","new meaning","meaning to","to the","the word","word \"","\" hillbilly","hillbilly \"","Float down","down the","the backwaters","backwaters ,",", soak","soak up","up some","some old","old time","time religion","religion ,",", savor","savor a","a washboard","washboard duel","duel ,",", and","and bask","bask in","in the","the neon","neon lights","lights of","of the","the pseudo-hillbilly","pseudo-hillbilly showtown","showtown Branson","Lean back","back and","and merge","merge into","into hillbilliness"]}

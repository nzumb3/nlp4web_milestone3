{"title":"Lawn Dogs","plot":"Newly arrived in an up-market housing development, quiet ten-year-old Devon doesn't quite fit in. Ignoring the urgings of her social-climbing father, Devon chooses the company of Trent, who mows the estate's lawns, rather than of the girls her own age. Their friendship grows during her visits to his trailer home, but although it is completely innocent it is obvious that it would be unacceptable to the residents if they found out.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Newli","arriv","in","an","up-market","hous","develop",",","quiet","ten-year-old","Devon","doe","n't","quit","fit","in",".","Ignore","the","urg","of","her","social-climb","father",",","Devon","choos","the","compani","of","Trent",",","who","mow","the","estat","'s","lawn",",","rather","than","of","the","girl","her","own","age",".","Their","friendship","grow","dure","her","visit","to","his","trailer","home",",","but","although","it","is","complet","innoc","it","is","obvious","that","it","would","be","unaccept","to","the","resid","if","they","found","out","."],"lemmas":["newly","arrive","in","a","up-market","housing","development",",","quiet","ten-year-old","Devon","do","not","quite","fit","in",".","ignore","the","urging","of","she","social-climbing","father",",","Devon","choose","the","company","of","Trent",",","who","mow","the","estate","'s","lawn",",","rather","than","of","the","girl","she","own","age",".","they","friendship","grow","during","she","visit","to","he","trailer","home",",","but","although","it","be","completely","innocent","it","be","obvious","that","it","would","be","unacceptable","to","the","resident","if","they","find","out","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Newly arrived in","arrived in an","in an up-market","an up-market housing","up-market housing development","housing development ,","development , quiet",", quiet ten-year-old","quiet ten-year-old Devon","ten-year-old Devon does","Devon does n't","does n't quite","n't quite fit","quite fit in","Ignoring the urgings","the urgings of","urgings of her","of her social-climbing","her social-climbing father","social-climbing father ,","father , Devon",", Devon chooses","Devon chooses the","chooses the company","the company of","company of Trent","of Trent ,","Trent , who",", who mows","who mows the","mows the estate","the estate 's","estate 's lawns","'s lawns ,","lawns , rather",", rather than","rather than of","than of the","of the girls","the girls her","girls her own","her own age","Their friendship grows","friendship grows during","grows during her","during her visits","her visits to","visits to his","to his trailer","his trailer home","trailer home ,","home , but",", but although","but although it","although it is","it is completely","is completely innocent","completely innocent it","innocent it is","it is obvious","is obvious that","obvious that it","that it would","it would be","would be unacceptable","be unacceptable to","unacceptable to the","to the residents","the residents if","residents if they","if they found","they found out"],"2grams":["Newly arrived","arrived in","in an","an up-market","up-market housing","housing development","development ,",", quiet","quiet ten-year-old","ten-year-old Devon","Devon does","does n't","n't quite","quite fit","fit in","Ignoring the","the urgings","urgings of","of her","her social-climbing","social-climbing father","father ,",", Devon","Devon chooses","chooses the","the company","company of","of Trent","Trent ,",", who","who mows","mows the","the estate","estate 's","'s lawns","lawns ,",", rather","rather than","than of","of the","the girls","girls her","her own","own age","Their friendship","friendship grows","grows during","during her","her visits","visits to","to his","his trailer","trailer home","home ,",", but","but although","although it","it is","is completely","completely innocent","innocent it","it is","is obvious","obvious that","that it","it would","would be","be unacceptable","unacceptable to","to the","the residents","residents if","if they","they found","found out"]}

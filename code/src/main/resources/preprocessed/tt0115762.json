{"title":"Broken Silence","plot":"A Carthusian monk, Fried Adelphi, dedicated to silence and meditation for the last 25 years, tells his story (to priest, Michael Moriarty, in a minor role). His order sends him to Indonesia to request the extension of their cloister's lease. En route to Jakarta, he experiences claustrophobia and de-planes in New Delhi, India. Without contacts or any worldly knowledge, he fortunately is reunited with his fellow passenger, Ashaela, the wallet thief. Unaware of her indiscretion, Fried allows Ashaela to help him find his way to Jakarta.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","Carthusian","monk",",","Fri","Adelphi",",","dedic","to","silenc","and","medit","for","the","last","25","year",",","tell","his","stori","(","to","priest",",","Michael","Moriarti",",","in","a","minor","role",")",".","His","order","send","him","to","Indonesia","to","request","the","extens","of","their","cloister","'s","leas",".","En","rout","to","Jakarta",",","he","experi","claustrophobia","and","de-plan","in","New","Delhi",",","India",".","Without","contact","or","ani","world","knowledg",",","he","fortun","is","reunit","with","his","fellow","passeng",",","Ashaela",",","the","wallet","thief",".","Unawar","of","her","indiscret",",","Fri","allow","Ashaela","to","help","him","find","his","way","to","Jakarta","."],"lemmas":["a","carthusian","monk",",","Fried","Adelphi",",","dedicate","to","silence","and","meditation","for","the","last","25","year",",","tell","he","story","-lrb-","to","priest",",","Michael","Moriarty",",","in","a","minor","role","-rrb-",".","he","order","send","he","to","Indonesia","to","request","the","extension","of","they","cloister","'s","lease",".","en","route","to","Jakarta",",","he","experience","claustrophobia","and","de-plane","in","New","Delhi",",","India",".","without","contact","or","any","worldly","knowledge",",","he","fortunately","be","reunite","with","he","fellow","passenger",",","Ashaela",",","the","wallet","thief",".","unaware","of","she","indiscretion",",","Fried","allow","Ashaela","to","help","he","find","he","way","to","Jakarta","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A Carthusian monk","Carthusian monk ,","monk , Fried",", Fried Adelphi","Fried Adelphi ,","Adelphi , dedicated",", dedicated to","dedicated to silence","to silence and","silence and meditation","and meditation for","meditation for the","for the last","the last 25","last 25 years","25 years ,","years , tells",", tells his","tells his story","his story (","story ( to","( to priest","to priest ,","priest , Michael",", Michael Moriarty","Michael Moriarty ,","Moriarty , in",", in a","in a minor","a minor role","minor role )","His order sends","order sends him","sends him to","him to Indonesia","to Indonesia to","Indonesia to request","to request the","request the extension","the extension of","extension of their","of their cloister","their cloister 's","cloister 's lease","En route to","route to Jakarta","to Jakarta ,","Jakarta , he",", he experiences","he experiences claustrophobia","experiences claustrophobia and","claustrophobia and de-planes","and de-planes in","de-planes in New","in New Delhi","New Delhi ,","Delhi , India","Without contacts or","contacts or any","or any worldly","any worldly knowledge","worldly knowledge ,","knowledge , he",", he fortunately","he fortunately is","fortunately is reunited","is reunited with","reunited with his","with his fellow","his fellow passenger","fellow passenger ,","passenger , Ashaela",", Ashaela ,","Ashaela , the",", the wallet","the wallet thief","Unaware of her","of her indiscretion","her indiscretion ,","indiscretion , Fried",", Fried allows","Fried allows Ashaela","allows Ashaela to","Ashaela to help","to help him","help him find","him find his","find his way","his way to","way to Jakarta"],"2grams":["A Carthusian","Carthusian monk","monk ,",", Fried","Fried Adelphi","Adelphi ,",", dedicated","dedicated to","to silence","silence and","and meditation","meditation for","for the","the last","last 25","25 years","years ,",", tells","tells his","his story","story (","( to","to priest","priest ,",", Michael","Michael Moriarty","Moriarty ,",", in","in a","a minor","minor role","role )","His order","order sends","sends him","him to","to Indonesia","Indonesia to","to request","request the","the extension","extension of","of their","their cloister","cloister 's","'s lease","En route","route to","to Jakarta","Jakarta ,",", he","he experiences","experiences claustrophobia","claustrophobia and","and de-planes","de-planes in","in New","New Delhi","Delhi ,",", India","Without contacts","contacts or","or any","any worldly","worldly knowledge","knowledge ,",", he","he fortunately","fortunately is","is reunited","reunited with","with his","his fellow","fellow passenger","passenger ,",", Ashaela","Ashaela ,",", the","the wallet","wallet thief","Unaware of","of her","her indiscretion","indiscretion ,",", Fried","Fried allows","allows Ashaela","Ashaela to","to help","help him","him find","find his","his way","way to","to Jakarta"]}

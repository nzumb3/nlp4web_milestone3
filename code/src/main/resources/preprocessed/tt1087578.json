{"title":"Still Walking","plot":"Still Walking is a family drama about grown children visiting their elderly parents, which unfolds over one summer day. The aging parents have lived in the family home for decades. Their son and daughter return for a rare family reunion, bringing their own families with them. They have gathered to commemorate the tragic death of the eldest son, who drowned in an accident fifteen years ago. Although the roomy house is as comforting and unchanging as the mother's homemade feast, everyone in the family has subtly changed.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Still","Walk","is","a","famili","drama","about","grown","children","visit","their","elder","parent",",","which","unfold","over","one","summer","day",".","The","age","parent","have","live","in","the","famili","home","for","decad",".","Their","son","and","daughter","return","for","a","rare","famili","reunion",",","bring","their","own","famili","with","them",".","They","have","gather","to","commemor","the","tragic","death","of","the","eldest","son",",","who","drown","in","an","accid","fifteen","year","ago",".","Although","the","roomi","hous","is","as","comfort","and","unchang","as","the","mother","'s","homemad","feast",",","everyon","in","the","famili","has","subt","chang","."],"lemmas":["still","walk","be","a","family","drama","about","grown","child","visit","they","elderly","parent",",","which","unfold","over","one","summer","day",".","the","aging","parent","have","live","in","the","family","home","for","decade",".","they","son","and","daughter","return","for","a","rare","family","reunion",",","bring","they","own","family","with","they",".","they","have","gather","to","commemorate","the","tragic","death","of","the","eldest","son",",","who","drown","in","a","accident","fifteen","year","ago",".","although","the","roomy","house","be","as","comforting","and","unchanging","as","the","mother","'s","homemade","feast",",","everyone","in","the","family","have","subtly","change","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Still Walking is","Walking is a","is a family","a family drama","family drama about","drama about grown","about grown children","grown children visiting","children visiting their","visiting their elderly","their elderly parents","elderly parents ,","parents , which",", which unfolds","which unfolds over","unfolds over one","over one summer","one summer day","The aging parents","aging parents have","parents have lived","have lived in","lived in the","in the family","the family home","family home for","home for decades","Their son and","son and daughter","and daughter return","daughter return for","return for a","for a rare","a rare family","rare family reunion","family reunion ,","reunion , bringing",", bringing their","bringing their own","their own families","own families with","families with them","They have gathered","have gathered to","gathered to commemorate","to commemorate the","commemorate the tragic","the tragic death","tragic death of","death of the","of the eldest","the eldest son","eldest son ,","son , who",", who drowned","who drowned in","drowned in an","in an accident","an accident fifteen","accident fifteen years","fifteen years ago","Although the roomy","the roomy house","roomy house is","house is as","is as comforting","as comforting and","comforting and unchanging","and unchanging as","unchanging as the","as the mother","the mother 's","mother 's homemade","'s homemade feast","homemade feast ,","feast , everyone",", everyone in","everyone in the","in the family","the family has","family has subtly","has subtly changed"],"2grams":["Still Walking","Walking is","is a","a family","family drama","drama about","about grown","grown children","children visiting","visiting their","their elderly","elderly parents","parents ,",", which","which unfolds","unfolds over","over one","one summer","summer day","The aging","aging parents","parents have","have lived","lived in","in the","the family","family home","home for","for decades","Their son","son and","and daughter","daughter return","return for","for a","a rare","rare family","family reunion","reunion ,",", bringing","bringing their","their own","own families","families with","with them","They have","have gathered","gathered to","to commemorate","commemorate the","the tragic","tragic death","death of","of the","the eldest","eldest son","son ,",", who","who drowned","drowned in","in an","an accident","accident fifteen","fifteen years","years ago","Although the","the roomy","roomy house","house is","is as","as comforting","comforting and","and unchanging","unchanging as","as the","the mother","mother 's","'s homemade","homemade feast","feast ,",", everyone","everyone in","in the","the family","family has","has subtly","subtly changed"]}

{"title":"The Swan and the Wanderer","plot":"The film tells the story of two very popular Finnish singer/songwriters: Tapio Rautavaara (Tapio Liinoja) and Repe Helismaa (Martti Suosalo), who worked together until their relationship got frictious for a long time. The film covers the years from 1949 to 1965 (Helismaa's death). Since the film is based on real-life persons it also tells much about the change in Finland during those years and of course much about Finnish popular music.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["The","film","tell","the","stori","of","two","veri","popular","Finnish","singer/songwrit",":","Tapio","Rautavaara","(","Tapio","Liinoja",")","and","Repe","Helismaa","(","Martti","Suosalo",")",",","who","work","togeth","until","their","relationship","got","frictious","for","a","long","time",".","The","film","cover","the","year","from","1949","to","1965","(","Helismaa","'s","death",")",".","Sinc","the","film","is","base","on","real-lif","person","it","also","tell","much","about","the","chang","in","Finland","dure","those","year","and","of","cours","much","about","Finnish","popular","music","."],"lemmas":["the","film","tell","the","story","of","two","very","popular","finnish","singer/songwriters",":","Tapio","Rautavaara","-lrb-","Tapio","Liinoja","-rrb-","and","Repe","Helismaa","-lrb-","Martti","Suosalo","-rrb-",",","who","work","together","until","they","relationship","get","frictious","for","a","long","time",".","the","film","cover","the","year","from","1949","to","1965","-lrb-","Helismaa","'s","death","-rrb-",".","since","the","film","be","base","on","real-life","person","it","also","tell","much","about","the","change","in","Finland","during","those","year","and","of","course","much","about","finnish","popular","music","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film tells","film tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of two","of two very","two very popular","very popular Finnish","popular Finnish singer/songwriters","Finnish singer/songwriters :","singer/songwriters : Tapio",": Tapio Rautavaara","Tapio Rautavaara (","Rautavaara ( Tapio","( Tapio Liinoja","Tapio Liinoja )","Liinoja ) and",") and Repe","and Repe Helismaa","Repe Helismaa (","Helismaa ( Martti","( Martti Suosalo","Martti Suosalo )","Suosalo ) ,",") , who",", who worked","who worked together","worked together until","together until their","until their relationship","their relationship got","relationship got frictious","got frictious for","frictious for a","for a long","a long time","The film covers","film covers the","covers the years","the years from","years from 1949","from 1949 to","1949 to 1965","to 1965 (","1965 ( Helismaa","( Helismaa 's","Helismaa 's death","'s death )","Since the film","the film is","film is based","is based on","based on real-life","on real-life persons","real-life persons it","persons it also","it also tells","also tells much","tells much about","much about the","about the change","the change in","change in Finland","in Finland during","Finland during those","during those years","those years and","years and of","and of course","of course much","course much about","much about Finnish","about Finnish popular","Finnish popular music"],"2grams":["The film","film tells","tells the","the story","story of","of two","two very","very popular","popular Finnish","Finnish singer/songwriters","singer/songwriters :",": Tapio","Tapio Rautavaara","Rautavaara (","( Tapio","Tapio Liinoja","Liinoja )",") and","and Repe","Repe Helismaa","Helismaa (","( Martti","Martti Suosalo","Suosalo )",") ,",", who","who worked","worked together","together until","until their","their relationship","relationship got","got frictious","frictious for","for a","a long","long time","The film","film covers","covers the","the years","years from","from 1949","1949 to","to 1965","1965 (","( Helismaa","Helismaa 's","'s death","death )","Since the","the film","film is","is based","based on","on real-life","real-life persons","persons it","it also","also tells","tells much","much about","about the","the change","change in","in Finland","Finland during","during those","those years","years and","and of","of course","course much","much about","about Finnish","Finnish popular","popular music"]}

{"title":"Cupid's Requiem","plot":"Will Powell rouses himself awake from a deep sleep. He lights a cigarette then slowly meanders into the next room where his ex-girlfriend, Andrea Wilson, is duct taped to a chair. He sits across from her as though this is a completely sane manner in which to explore their recently broken relationship, and he and begins to tell her how much he misses her and wants her back. What follows is a journey into their failed relationship. It is a funny, poignant, visceral retrospective. The verbal war the two wage ultimately reveals two equally flawed and damaged young people whose relationship sadly served only to enhance and magnify their respective imperfections.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Will","Powel","rous","himself","awak","from","a","deep","sleep",".","He","light","a","cigarett","then","slowli","meander","into","the","next","room","where","his","ex-girlfriend",",","Andrea","Wilson",",","is","duct","tape","to","a","chair",".","He","sit","across","from","her","as","though","this","is","a","complet","sane","manner","in","which","to","explor","their","recent","broken","relationship",",","and","he","and","begin","to","tell","her","how","much","he","miss","her","and","want","her","back",".","What","follow","is","a","journey","into","their","fail","relationship",".","It","is","a","funni",",","poignant",",","viscer","retrospect",".","The","verbal","war","the","two","wage","ultim","reveal","two","equal","flaw","and","damag","young","peopl","whose","relationship","sad","serv","onli","to","enhanc","and","magnifi","their","respect","imperfect","."],"lemmas":["Will","Powell","rouse","himself","awake","from","a","deep","sleep",".","he","light","a","cigarette","then","slowly","meander","into","the","next","room","where","he","ex-girlfriend",",","Andrea","Wilson",",","be","duct","tape","to","a","chair",".","he","sit","across","from","she","as","though","this","be","a","completely","sane","manner","in","which","to","explore","they","recently","break","relationship",",","and","he","and","begin","to","tell","she","how","much","he","miss","she","and","want","she","back",".","what","follow","be","a","journey","into","they","failed","relationship",".","it","be","a","funny",",","poignant",",","visceral","retrospective",".","the","verbal","war","the","two","wage","ultimately","reveal","two","equally","flaw","and","damage","young","people","whose","relationship","sadly","serve","only","to","enhance","and","magnify","they","respective","imperfection","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Will

{"title":"Ur: The End of Civilization in 90 Tableaux","plot":"Shot in the south of France on a shoestring budget, Ur: The End of Civilization in 90 Tableaux tells the story of six characters in search of a zombie apocalypse. A searing insight into the decadent lifestyles of the British upper middle class, Ur follows Will, Dennis, Laura and Rosie, who have come to visit Alex and Edward in Bergerac, France. Edward loves Rosie. Alex seduces Rosie. Alex also seduces Laura. Will is having a nervous breakdown. Dennis is trying to put his life back together. Will then gets bitten when out running - and turns into a zombie. Do the others kill him or keep him? The title, Ur, means primitive and the film is shot in the primitive style of cinema's inventors, the Lumiere brothers.","genres":["Drama"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["Shot","in","the","south","of","Franc","on","a","shoestr","budget",",","Ur",":","The","End","of","Civil","in","90","Tableaux","tell","the","stori","of","six","charact","in","search","of","a","zombi","apocalyps",".","A","sear","insight","into","the","decad","lifestyl","of","the","British","upper","middl","class",",","Ur","follow","Will",",","Denni",",","Laura","and","Rosi",",","who","have","come","to","visit","Alex","and","Edward","in","Bergerac",",","Franc",".","Edward","love","Rosi",".","Alex","seduc","Rosi",".","Alex","also","seduc","Laura",".","Will","is","have","a","nervous","breakdown",".","Denni","is","tri","to","put","his","life","back","togeth",".","Will","then","get","bitten","when","out","run","-","and","turn","into","a","zombi",".","Do","the","other","kill","him","or","keep","him","?","The","titl",",","Ur",",","mean","primit","and","the","film","is","shot","in","the","primit","style","of","cinema","'s","inventor",",","the","Lumier","brother","."],"lemmas":["shot","in","the","south","of","France","on","a","shoestring","budget",",","ur",":","the","end","of","civilization","in","90","tableaux","tell","the","story","of","six","character","in","search","of","a","zombie","apocalypse",".","a","searing","insight","into","the","decadent","lifestyle","of","the","british","upper","middle","class",",","ur","follow","Will",",","Dennis",",","Laura","and","Rosie",",","who","have","come","to","visit","Alex","and","Edward","in","Bergerac",",","France",".","Edward","love","Rosie",".","Alex","seduce","Rosie",".","Alex","also","seduce","Laura",".","Will","be","have","a","nervous","breakdown",".","Dennis","be","try","to","put","he","life","back","together",".","will","then","get","bite","when","out","run","-","and","turn","into","a","zombie",".","do","the","other","kill","he","or","keep","he","?","the","title",",","ur",",","mean","primitive","and","the","film","be","shoot","in","the","primitive","style","of","cinema","'s","inventor",",","the","Lumiere","brother","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Shot in the","in the south","the south of","south of France","of France on","France on a","on a shoestring","a shoestring budget","shoestring budget ,","budget , Ur",", Ur :","Ur : The",": The End","The End of","End of Civilization","of Civilization in","Civilization in 90","in 90 Tableaux","90 Tableaux tells","Tableaux tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of six","of six characters","six characters in","characters in search","in search of","search of a","of a zombie","a zombie apocalypse","A searing insight","searing insight into","insight into the","into the decadent","the decadent lifestyles","decadent lifestyles of","lifestyles of the","of the British","the British upper","British upper middle","upper middle class","middle class ,","class , Ur",", Ur follows","Ur follows Will","follows Will ,","Will , Dennis",", Dennis ,","Dennis , Laura",", Laura and","Laura and Rosie","and Rosie ,","Rosie , who",", who have","who have come","have come to","come to visit","to visit Alex","visit Alex and","Alex and Edward","and Edward in","Edward in Bergerac","in Bergerac ,","Bergerac , France","Edward loves Rosie","Alex seduces Rosie","Alex also seduces","also seduces Laura","Will is having","is having a","having a nervous","a nervous breakdown","Dennis is trying","is trying to","trying to put","to put his","put his life","his life back","life back together","Will then gets","then gets bitten","gets bitten when","bitten when out","when out running","out running -","running -

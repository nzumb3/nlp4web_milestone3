{"title":"Please Give","plot":"Two families, sort of neighbors in Manhattan, cross paths as they navigate marriage, parenthood of a teen, ennui, a first date, and end-of-life care. Rebecca and Mary are sisters; their cranky 91-year-old grandmother's neighbors, Kateand Alex, run an upscale retro-furniture business, and will expand into her flat after she dies. Rebecca is quiet, without a boyfriend until a patient at the clinic where she works introduces her grandson. Mary is acerbic, stung by a recent breakup. Kate looks for meaning in her life, wondering if she should volunteer. Alex, too, is at loose ends. Their daughter, Abby, has zits and teenage moods. What does it mean to be good?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","famili",",","sort","of","neighbor","in","Manhattan",",","cross","path","as","they","navig","marriag",",","parenthood","of","a","teen",",","ennui",",","a","first","date",",","and","end-of-lif","care",".","Rebecca","and","Mari","are","sister",";","their","cranki","91-year-old","grandmoth","'s","neighbor",",","Kateand","Alex",",","run","an","upscal","retro-furnitur","busi",",","and","will","expand","into","her","flat","after","she","die",".","Rebecca","is","quiet",",","without","a","boyfriend","until","a","patient","at","the","clinic","where","she","work","introduc","her","grandson",".","Mari","is","acerb",",","stung","by","a","recent","breakup",".","Kate","look","for","mean","in","her","life",",","wonder","if","she","should","volunt",".","Alex",",","too",",","is","at","loos","end",".","Their","daughter",",","Abbi",",","has","zit","and","teenag","mood",".","What","doe","it","mean","to","be","good","?"],"lemmas":["two","family",",","sort","of","neighbor","in","Manhattan",",","cross","path","as","they","navigate","marriage",",","parenthood","of","a","teen",",","ennui",",","a","first","date",",","and","end-of-life","care",".","Rebecca","and","Mary","be","sister",";","they","cranky","91-year-old","grandmother","'s","neighbor",",","Kateand","Alex",",","run","a","upscale","retro-furniture","business",",","and","will","expand","into","she","flat","after","she","die",".","Rebecca","be","quiet",",","without","a","boyfriend","until","a","patient","at","the","clinic","where","she","work","introduce","she","grandson",".","Mary","be","acerbic",",","sting","by","a","recent","breakup",".","Kate","look","for","meaning","in","she","life",",","wonder","if","she","should","volunteer",".","Alex",",","too",",","be","at","loose","end",".","they","daughter",",","Abby",",","have","zit","and","teenage","mood",".","what","do","it","mean","to","be","good","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two families ,","families , sort",", sort of","sort of neighbors","of neighbors in","neighbors in Manhattan","in Manhattan ,","Manhattan , cross",", cross paths","cross paths as","paths as they","as they navigate","they navigate marriage","navigate marriage ,","marriage , parenthood",", parenthood of","parenthood of a","of a teen","a teen ,","teen , ennui",", ennui ,","ennui , a",", a first","a first date","first date ,","date , and",", and end-of-life","and end-of-life care","Rebecca and Mary","and Mary are","Mary are sisters","are sisters ;","sisters ;

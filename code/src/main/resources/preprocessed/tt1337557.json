{"title":"Die Tochter","plot":"A woman in her mid-forties goes on a journey to the country. She visits her mother, whom she hasn't seen for quite a while. Of course, her father, who has been missing for many years, dominates the women's topic of conversation at first. What is said about the father raises questions as the pictures become more and more divergent. The following day she goes to see the manager of the train station café, the place from which her father departed on his forays. The manager is unable to say anything of importance. The woman strolls past the places she knew as a child and arrives at the meadow she was allowed to accompany her father to before he infiltrated the forbidden zone. She then follows the supposed paths her father took.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy","

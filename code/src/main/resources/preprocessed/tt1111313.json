{"title":"The Elephant in the Living Room","plot":"The Elephant in the Living Room takes viewers on a journey deep inside the controversial American subculture of raising the most dangerous animals in the world, as common household pets. Set against the backdrop of a heated national debate, director Michael Webber chronicles the extraordinary story of two men at the heart of the issue - Tim Harrison, an Ohio police officer whose friend was killed by an exotic pet; and Terry Brumfield, a mentally unstable man who struggles to selfishly raise two African lions that he loves like his own family in a small cage in his backyard. He does not understand the controversy over \"owning\" wild animals; the reality is, he keeps them for himself, not because he thinks it puts the lions in a good situation. In the first of many unexpected twists, the lives of these two men collide when Terry's male lion escapes its pen and is found attacking cars on a nearby highway. Winner of 5 Best Documentary Awards, the film courageously exposes the shocking reality behind the multi-billion dollar exotic pet industry with stunning photography, inspiring storytelling and unprecedented access into a world rarely seen, right in our own backyard.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Elephant","in","the","Live","Room","take","viewer","on","a","journey","deep","insid","the","controversi","American","subcultur","of","rais","the","most","danger","anim","in","the","world",",","as","common","household","pet",".","Set","against","the","backdrop","of","a","heat","nation","debat",",","director","Michael","Webber","chronicl","the","extraordinari","stori","of","two","men","at","the","heart","of","the","issu","-","Tim","Harrison",",","an","Ohio","polic","offic","whose","friend","was","kill","by","an","exot","pet",";","and","Terri","Brumfield",",","a","mental","unstabl","man","who","struggl","to","selfish","rais","two","African","lion","that","he","love","like","his","own","famili","in","a","small","cage","in","his","backyard",".","He","doe","not","understand","the","controversi","over","\"","own","\"","wild","anim",";","the","realiti","is",",","he","keep","them","for","himself",",","not","becaus","he","think","it","put","the","lion","in","a","good","situat",".","In","the","first","of","mani","unexpect","twist",",","the","live","of","these","two","men","collid","when","Terri","'s","male","lion","escap","it","pen","and","is","found","attack","car","on","a","nearbi","highway",".","Winner","of","5","Best","Documentari","Award",",","the","film","courag","expos","the","shock","realiti","behind","the","multi-billion","dollar","exot","pet","industri","with","stun","photographi",",","inspir","storytel","and","unpreced","access","into","a","world","rare","seen",",","right","in","our","own","backyard","."],"lemmas":["the","elephant","in","the","live","room","take","viewer","on","a","journey","deep","inside","the","controversial","american","subculture","of","raise","the","most","dangerous","animal","in","the","world",",","as","common","household","pet",".","set","against","the","backdrop","of","a","heated","national","debate",",","director","Michael","Webber","chronicle","the","extraordinary","story","of","two","man","at","the","heart","of","the","issue","-","Tim","Harrison",",","a","Ohio","police","officer","whose","friend","be","kill","by","a","exotic","pet",";","and","Terry","Brumfield",",","a","mentally","unstable","man","who","struggle","to","selfishly","raise","two","african","lion","that","he","love","like","he","own","family","in","a","small","cage","in","he","backyard",".","he","do","not","understand","the","controversy","over","``","own","''","wild","animal",";","the","reality","be",",","he","keep","they","for","himself",",","not","because","he","think","it","put","the","lion","in","a","good","situation",".","in","the","first","of","many","unexpected","twist",",","the","life","of","these","two","man","collide","when","Terry","'s","male","lion","escape","its","pen","and","be","find","attack","car","on","a","nearby","highway",".","winner","of","5","best","documentary","award",",","the","film","courageously","expose","the","shocking","reality","behind","the","multi-billion","dollar","exotic","pet","industry","with","stunning","photography",",","inspiring","storytelling","and","unprecedented","access","into","a","world","rarely","see",",","right","in","we","own","backyard","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Elephant in","Elephant in the","in the Living","the Living Room","Living Room takes","Room takes viewers","takes viewers on","viewers on a","on a journey","a journey deep","journey deep inside","deep inside the","inside the controversial","the controversial American","controversial American subculture","American subculture of","subculture of raising","of raising the","raising the most","the most dangerous","most dangerous animals","dangerous animals in","animals in the","in the world","the world ,","world , as",", as common","as common household","common household pets","Set against the","against the backdrop","the backdrop of","backdrop of a","of a heated","a heated national","heated national debate","national debate ,","debate , director",", director Michael","director Michael Webber","Michael Webber chronicles","Webber chronicles the","chronicles the extraordinary","the extraordinary story","extraordinary story of","story of two","of two men","two men at","men at the","at the heart","the heart of","heart of the","of the issue","the issue -","issue - Tim","- Tim Harrison","Tim Harrison ,","Harrison , an",", an Ohio","an Ohio police","Ohio police officer","police officer whose","officer whose friend","whose friend was","friend was killed","was killed by","killed by an","by an exotic","an exotic pet","exotic pet ;","pet ;

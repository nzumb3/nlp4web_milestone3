{"title":"Punnami Nagu","plot":"In order to acquire more powers for world domination, Mayadevi Bhairavi, a sorceress, holds two shape-shifting snakes in her power but is interrupted by her very own goons. As a result, the male serpent gets killed, and the female escapes. The only way Mayadevi could now acquire powers is first to locate a woman with a unique birthmark who must also be a virgin, and then lure the female serpent. The question remains - how will she find such a female, and even if she does so - how will she lure a now vigilant Nagin?","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["In","order","to","acquir","more","power","for","world","domin",",","Mayadevi","Bhairavi",",","a","sorceress",",","hold","two","shape-shift","snake","in","her","power","but","is","interrupt","by","her","veri","own","goon",".","As","a","result",",","the","male","serpent","get","kill",",","and","the","femal","escap",".","The","onli","way","Mayadevi","could","now","acquir","power","is","first","to","locat","a","woman","with","a","uniqu","birthmark","who","must","also","be","a","virgin",",","and","then","lure","the","femal","serpent",".","The","question","remain","-","how","will","she","find","such","a","femal",",","and","even","if","she","doe","so","-","how","will","she","lure","a","now","vigil","Nagin","?"],"lemmas":["in","order","to","acquire","more","power","for","world","domination",",","Mayadevi","Bhairavi",",","a","sorceress",",","hold","two","shape-shifting","snake","in","she","power","but","be","interrupt","by","she","very","own","goon",".","as","a","result",",","the","male","serpent","get","kill",",","and","the","female","escape",".","the","only","way","Mayadevi","could","now","acquire","power","be","first","to","locate","a","woman","with","a","unique","birthmark","who","must","also","be","a","virgin",",","and","then","lure","the","female","serpent",".","the","question","remain","-","how","will","she","find","such","a","female",",","and","even","if","she","do","so","-","how","will","she","lure","a","now","vigilant","Nagin","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In order to","order to acquire","to acquire more","acquire more powers","more powers for","powers for world","for world domination","world domination ,","domination , Mayadevi",", Mayadevi Bhairavi","Mayadevi Bhairavi ,","Bhairavi , a",", a sorceress","a sorceress ,","sorceress , holds",", holds two","holds two shape-shifting","two shape-shifting snakes","shape-shifting snakes in","snakes in her","in her power","her power but","power but is","but is interrupted","is interrupted by","interrupted by her","by her very","her very own","very own goons","As a result","a result ,","result , the",", the male","the male serpent","male serpent gets","serpent gets killed","gets killed ,","killed , and",", and the","and the female","the female escapes","The only way","only way Mayadevi","way Mayadevi could","Mayadevi could now","could now acquire","now acquire powers","acquire powers is","powers is first","is first to","first to locate","to locate a","locate a woman","a woman with","woman with a","with a unique","a unique birthmark","unique birthmark who","birthmark who must","who must also","must also be","also be a","be a virgin","a virgin ,","virgin , and",", and then","and then lure","then lure the","lure the female","the female serpent","The question remains","question remains -","remains - how","- how will","how will she","will she find","she find such","find such a","such a female","a female ,","female , and",", and even","and even if","even if she","if she does","she does so","does so -","so - how","- how will","how will she","will she lure","she lure a","lure a now","a now vigilant","now vigilant Nagin"],"2grams":["In order","order to","to acquire","acquire more","more powers","powers for","for world","world domination","domination ,",", Mayadevi","Mayadevi Bhairavi","Bhairavi ,",", a","a sorceress","sorceress ,",", holds","holds two","two shape-shifting","shape-shifting snakes","snakes in","in her","her power","power but","but is","is interrupted","interrupted by","by her","her very","very own","own goons","As a","a result","result ,",", the","the male","male serpent","serpent gets","gets killed","killed ,",", and","and the","the female","female escapes","The only","only way","way Mayadevi","Mayadevi could","could now","now acquire","acquire powers","powers is","is first","first to","to locate","locate a","a woman","woman with","with a","a unique","unique birthmark","birthmark who","who must","must also","also be","be a","a virgin","virgin ,",", and","and then","then lure","lure the","the female","female serpent","The question","question remains","remains -","- how","how will","will she","she find","find such","such a","a female","female ,",", and","and even","even if","if she","she does","does so","so -","- how","how will","will she","she lure","lure a","a now","now vigilant","vigilant Nagin"]}

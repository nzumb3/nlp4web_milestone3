{"title":"Land of Joy","plot":"The Veneto is one of Italy's richest industrial areas. But it hasn't always been this way. Forty years ago, its inhabitants were often forced to emigrate in order to survive. Today, the situation is reversed: it has become one of the regions with the highest concentrations of immigrants and it has been politically hegemonized by the Northern League. Various encounters with the many different types of people in this area paint a portrait of a territory in which the tragic and the comic often co-exist.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["The","Veneto","is","one","of","Itali","'s","richest","industri","area",".","But","it","has","n't","alway","been","this","way",".","Forti","year","ago",",","it","inhabit","were","often","forc","to","emigr","in","order","to","surviv",".","Today",",","the","situat","is","revers",":","it","has","becom","one","of","the","region","with","the","highest","concentr","of","immigr","and","it","has","been","polit","hegemon","by","the","Northern","Leagu",".","Various","encount","with","the","mani","differ","type","of","peopl","in","this","area","paint","a","portrait","of","a","territori","in","which","the","tragic","and","the","comic","often","co-exist","."],"lemmas":["the","Veneto","be","one","of","Italy","'s","richest","industrial","area",".","but","it","have","not","always","be","this","way",".","forty","year","ago",",","its","inhabitant","be","often","force","to","emigrate","in","order","to","survive",".","today",",","the","situation","be","reverse",":","it","have","become","one","of","the","region","with","the","highest","concentration","of","immigrant","and","it","have","be","politically","hegemonize","by","the","Northern","League",".","various","encounter","with","the","many","different","type","of","people","in","this","area","paint","a","portrait","of","a","territory","in","which","the","tragic","and","the","comic","often","co-exist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Veneto is","Veneto is one","is one of","one of Italy","of Italy 's","Italy 's richest","'s richest industrial","richest industrial areas","But it has","it has n't","has n't always","n't always been","always been this","been this way","Forty years ago","years ago ,","ago , its",", its inhabitants","its inhabitants were","inhabitants were often","were often forced","often forced to","forced to emigrate","to emigrate in","emigrate in order","in order to","order to survive","Today , the",", the situation","the situation is","situation is reversed","is reversed :","reversed : it",": it has","it has become","has become one","become one of","one of the","of the regions","the regions with","regions with the","with the highest","the highest concentrations","highest concentrations of","concentrations of immigrants","of immigrants and","immigrants and it","and it has","it has been","has been politically","been politically hegemonized","politically hegemonized by","hegemonized by the","by the Northern","the Northern League","Various encounters with","encounters with the","with the many","the many different","many different types","different types of","types of people","of people in","people in this","in this area","this area paint","area paint a","paint a portrait","a portrait of","portrait of a","of a territory","a territory in","territory in which","in which the","which the tragic","the tragic and","tragic and the","and the comic","the comic often","comic often co-exist"],"2grams":["The Veneto","Veneto is","is one","one of","of Italy","Italy 's","'s richest","richest industrial","industrial areas","But it","it has","has n't","n't always","always been","been this","this way","Forty years","years ago","ago ,",", its","its inhabitants","inhabitants were","were often","often forced","forced to","to emigrate","emigrate in","in order","order to","to survive","Today ,",", the","the situation","situation is","is reversed","reversed :",": it","it has","has become","become one","one of","of the","the regions","regions with","with the","the highest","highest concentrations","concentrations of","of immigrants","immigrants and","and it","it has","has been","been politically","politically hegemonized","hegemonized by","by the","the Northern","Northern League","Various encounters","encounters with","with the","the many","many different","different types","types of","of people","people in","in this","this area","area paint","paint a","a portrait","portrait of","of a","a territory","territory in","in which","which the","the tragic","tragic and","and the","the comic","comic often","often co-exist"]}

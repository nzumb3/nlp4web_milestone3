{"title":"Higher Education","plot":"University, the one place in Australia and every country, where people from every kind of culture and challenge connect. This film tells the story of six students, refugees and outsiders surviving state homes, mental illness, rural poverty, war and genocide to achieve their dreams and possibilities. Their backgrounds range from white and Aboriginal Australian to Afghani and one survivor of a genocide of a little known people called Oromians in Ethiopia. Dramatic and daring, their stories are shared with one another - and intimately with the audience. Boldly visual, Higher Education is a film from their own point of view.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["Univers",",","the","one","place","in","Australia","and","everi","countri",",","where","peopl","from","everi","kind","of","cultur","and","challeng","connect",".","This","film","tell","the","stori","of","six","student",",","refuge","and","outsid","surviv","state","home",",","mental","ill",",","rural","poverti",",","war","and","genocid","to","achiev","their","dream","and","possibl",".","Their","background","rang","from","white","and","Aborigin","Australian","to","Afghani","and","one","survivor","of","a","genocid","of","a","littl","known","peopl","call","Oromian","in","Ethiopia",".","Dramat","and","dare",",","their","stori","are","share","with","one","anoth","-","and","intim","with","the","audienc",".","Bold","visual",",","Higher","Educat","is","a","film","from","their","own","point","of","view","."],"lemmas":["University",",","the","one","place","in","Australia","and","every","country",",","where","people","from","every","kind","of","culture","and","challenge","connect",".","this","film","tell","the","story","of","six","student",",","refugee","and","outsider","survive","state","home",",","mental","illness",",","rural","poverty",",","war","and","genocide","to","achieve","they","dream","and","possibility",".","they","background","range","from","white","and","Aboriginal","Australian","to","Afghani","and","one","survivor","of","a","genocide","of","a","little","known","people","call","Oromians","in","Ethiopia",".","dramatic","and","daring",",","they","story","be","share","with","one","another","-","and","intimately","with","the","audience",".","boldly","visual",",","higher","Education","be","a","film","from","they","own","point","of","view","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["University , the",", the one","the one place","one place in","place in Australia","in Australia and","Australia and every","and every country","every country ,","country , where",", where people","where people from","people from every","from every kind","every kind of","kind of culture","of culture and","culture and challenge","and challenge connect","This film tells","film tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of six","of six students","six students ,","students , refugees",", refugees and","refugees and outsiders","and outsiders surviving","outsiders surviving state","surviving state homes","state homes ,","homes , mental",", mental illness","mental illness ,","illness , rural",", rural poverty","rural poverty ,","poverty , war",", war and","war and genocide","and genocide to","genocide to achieve","to achieve their","achieve their dreams","their dreams and","dreams and possibilities","Their backgrounds range","backgrounds range from","range from white","from white and","white and Aboriginal","and Aboriginal Australian","Aboriginal Australian to","Australian to Afghani","to Afghani and","Afghani and one","and one survivor","one survivor of","survivor of a","of a genocide","a genocide of","genocide of a","of a little","a little known","little known people","known people called","people called Oromians","called Oromians in","Oromians in Ethiopia","Dramatic and daring","and daring ,","daring , their",", their stories","their stories are","stories are shared","are shared with","shared with one","with one another","one another -","another -

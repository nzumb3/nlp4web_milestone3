{"title":"Harley","plot":"Harley is a 'troubled teen' from L.A. who is arrested. A progressive social worker has Harley sent to Texas to live with the Nortons, an open-minded, heartful Christian family, and spend two months on their ranch. Surrounded by a town full of doddering hicks, Harley takes on ranch chores, learns to ride horses, and finds love in a local girl while the Nortons try to bring him into the fold. Eventually Harley chooses to release his pain in exchange for a return to faith, culminating in his calling for God's help to save the life of the burglar who framed him.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Harley","is","a","'","troubl","teen","'","from","L.A.","who","is","arrest",".","A","progress","social","worker","has","Harley","sent","to","Texa","to","live","with","the","Norton",",","an","open-mind",",","heart","Christian","famili",",","and","spend","two","month","on","their","ranch",".","Surround","by","a","town","full","of","dodder","hick",",","Harley","take","on","ranch","chore",",","learn","to","ride","hors",",","and","find","love","in","a","local","girl","while","the","Norton","tri","to","bring","him","into","the","fold",".","Eventual","Harley","choos","to","releas","his","pain","in","exchang","for","a","return","to","faith",",","culmin","in","his","call","for","God","'s","help","to","save","the","life","of","the","burglar","who","frame","him","."],"lemmas":["Harley","be","a","'","troubled","teen","'","from","L.A.","who","be","arrest",".","a","progressive","social","worker","have","Harley","send","to","Texas","to","live","with","the","Nortons",",","a","open-minded",",","heartful","Christian","family",",","and","spend","two","month","on","they","ranch",".","surround","by","a","town","full","of","doddering","hick",",","Harley","take","on","ranch","chore",",","learn","to","ride","horse",",","and","find","love","in","a","local","girl","while","the","Nortons","try","to","bring","he","into","the","fold",".","eventually","Harley","choose","to","release","he","pain","in","exchange","for","a","return","to","faith",",","culminate","in","he","calling","for","God","'s","help","to","save","the","life","of","the","burglar","who","frame","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harley is a","is a '","a ' troubled","' troubled teen","troubled teen '","teen ' from","' from L.A.","from L.A. who","L.A. who is","who is arrested","A progressive social","progressive social worker","social worker has","worker has Harley","has Harley sent","Harley sent to","sent to Texas","to Texas to","Texas to live","to live with","live with the","with the Nortons","the Nortons ,","Nortons , an",", an open-minded","an open-minded ,","open-minded , heartful",", heartful Christian","heartful Christian family","Christian family ,","family , and",", and spend","and spend two","spend two months","two months on","months on their","on their ranch","Surrounded by a","by a town","a town full","town full of","full of doddering","of doddering hicks","doddering hicks ,","hicks , Harley",", Harley takes","Harley takes on","takes on ranch","on ranch chores","ranch chores ,","chores , learns",", learns to","learns to ride","to ride horses","ride horses ,","horses , and",", and finds","and finds love","finds love in","love in a","in a local","a local girl","local girl while","girl while the","while the Nortons","the Nortons try","Nortons try to","try to bring","to bring him","bring him into","him into the","into the fold","Eventually Harley chooses","Harley chooses to","chooses to release","to release his","release his pain","his pain in","pain in exchange","in exchange for","exchange for a","for a return","a return to","return to faith","to faith ,","faith , culminating",", culminating in","culminating in his","in his calling","his calling for","calling for God","for God 's","God 's help","'s help to","help to save","to save the","save the life","the life of","life of the","of the burglar","the burglar who","burglar who framed","who framed him"],"2grams":["Harley is","is a","a '","' troubled","troubled teen","teen '","' from","from L.A.","L.A. who","who is","is arrested","A progressive","progressive social","social worker","worker has","has Harley","Harley sent","sent to","to Texas","Texas to","to live","live with","with the","the Nortons","Nortons ,",", an","an open-minded","open-minded ,",", heartful","heartful Christian","Christian family","family ,",", and","and spend","spend two","two months","months on","on their","their ranch","Surrounded by","by a","a town","town full","full of","of doddering","doddering hicks","hicks ,",", Harley","Harley takes","takes on","on ranch","ranch chores","chores ,",", learns","learns to","to ride","ride horses","horses ,",", and","and finds","finds love","love in","in a","a local","local girl","girl while","while the","the Nortons","Nortons try","try to","to bring","bring him","him into","into the","the fold","Eventually Harley","Harley chooses","chooses to","to release","release his","his pain","pain in","in exchange","exchange for","for a","a return","return to","to faith","faith ,",", culminating","culminating in","in his","his calling","calling for","for God","God 's","'s help","help to","to save","save the","the life","life of","of the","the burglar","burglar who","who framed","framed him"]}

{"title":"Kannan Varuvaan","plot":"A comatose matriarch (Manorama) shockingly awakes from her near-death state when caretakers mention the impending return of her long-lost grandson. In a medical miracle of Tamil film proportions, she is back full form, and sends her crony (Goundamani) to fetch the grandson. The grandson (Ranjit) turns out to be a creep, so the crony comes up with a quick plan to appoint a temple architect Kannan (Karthik) as an interim grandson for the unsuspecting matriach. Kannan agrees, and eventually takes his role a bit too seriously. Divya Unni as Kannan's poor lover and Manthara as the grandma-chosen bride add a creamy love triangle to top up the potboiler.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["A","comatos","matriarch","(","Manorama",")","shock","awak","from","her","near-death","state","when","caretak","mention","the","impend","return","of","her","long-lost","grandson",".","In","a","medic","miracl","of","Tamil","film","proport",",","she","is","back","full","form",",","and","send","her","croni","(","Goundamani",")","to","fetch","the","grandson",".","The","grandson","(","Ranjit",")","turn","out","to","be","a","creep",",","so","the","croni","come","up","with","a","quick","plan","to","appoint","a","templ","architect","Kannan","(","Karthik",")","as","an","interim","grandson","for","the","unsuspect","matriach",".","Kannan","agre",",","and","eventu","take","his","role","a","bit","too","serious",".","Divya","Unni","as","Kannan","'s","poor","lover","and","Manthara","as","the","grandma-chosen","bride","add","a","creami","love","triangl","to","top","up","the","potboil","."],"lemmas":["a","comatose","matriarch","-lrb-","manorama","-rrb-","shockingly","awake","from","she","near-death","state","when","caretaker","mention","the","impending","return","of","she","long-lost","grandson",".","in","a","medical","miracle","of","tamil","film","proportion",",","she","be","back","full","form",",","and","send","she","crony","-lrb-","goundamani","-rrb-","to","fetch","the","grandson",".","the","grandson","-lrb-","ranjit","-rrb-","turn","out","to","be","a","creep",",","so","the","crony","come","up","with","a","quick","plan","to","appoint","a","temple","architect","Kannan","-lrb-","Karthik","-rrb-","as","a","interim","grandson","for","the","unsuspecting","matriach",".","Kannan","agree",",","and","eventually","take","he","role","a","bit","too","seriously",".","Divya","Unni","as","Kannan","'s","poor","lover","and","Manthara","as","the","grandma-chosen","bride","add","a","creamy","love","triangle","to","top","up","the","potboiler","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

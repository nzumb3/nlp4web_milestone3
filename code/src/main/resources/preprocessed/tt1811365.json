{"title":"Tro, Håb og Grønland","plot":"Faith, Hope and Greenland is a visual and poetic journey into the very hearts of the people of Greenland. Told in a natural, honest and non-accusative manner, its four main protagonists advise the viewer on the underbelly of colonisation, its effects on an ancient, nomadic culture and on the individual mind. However, the film is built upon hope, and throughout the entire film we get an idea of the intensity and speed with which the people of this remote country, are regaining their self-respect and redefining their collective identity on their own terms.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Faith",",","Hope","and","Greenland","is","a","visual","and","poetic","journey","into","the","veri","heart","of","the","peopl","of","Greenland",".","Told","in","a","natur",",","honest","and","non-accus","manner",",","it","four","main","protagonist","advis","the","viewer","on","the","underbelli","of","colonis",",","it","effect","on","an","ancient",",","nomad","cultur","and","on","the","individu","mind",".","Howev",",","the","film","is","built","upon","hope",",","and","throughout","the","entir","film","we","get","an","idea","of","the","intens","and","speed","with","which","the","peopl","of","this","remot","countri",",","are","regain","their","self-respect","and","redefin","their","collect","ident","on","their","own","term","."],"lemmas":["faith",",","Hope","and","Greenland","be","a","visual","and","poetic","journey","into","the","very","heart","of","the","people","of","Greenland",".","tell","in","a","natural",",","honest","and","non-accusative","manner",",","its","four","main","protagonist","advise","the","viewer","on","the","underbelly","of","colonisation",",","its","effect","on","a","ancient",",","nomadic","culture","and","on","the","individual","mind",".","however",",","the","film","be","build","upon","hope",",","and","throughout","the","entire","film","we","get","a","idea","of","the","intensity","and","speed","with","which","the","people","of","this","remote","country",",","be","regain","they","self-respect","and","redefine","they","collective","identity","on","they","own","term","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Faith , Hope",", Hope and","Hope and Greenland","and Greenland is","Greenland is a","is a visual","a visual and","visual and poetic","and poetic journey","poetic journey into","journey into the","into the very","the very hearts","very hearts of","hearts of the","of the people","the people of","people of Greenland","Told in a","in a natural","a natural ,","natural , honest",", honest and","honest and non-accusative","and non-accusative manner","non-accusative manner ,","manner , its",", its four","its four main","four main protagonists","main protagonists advise","protagonists advise the","advise the viewer","the viewer on","viewer on the","on the underbelly","the underbelly of","underbelly of colonisation","of colonisation ,","colonisation , its",", its effects","its effects on","effects on an","on an ancient","an ancient ,","ancient , nomadic",", nomadic culture","nomadic culture and","culture and on","and on the","on the individual","the individual mind","However , the",", the film","the film is","film is built","is built upon","built upon hope","upon hope ,","hope , and",", and throughout","and throughout the","throughout the entire","the entire film","entire film we","film we get","we get an","get an idea","an idea of","idea of the","of the intensity","the intensity and","intensity and speed","and speed with","speed with which","with which the","which the people","the people of","people of this","of this remote","this remote country","remote country ,","country , are",", are regaining","are regaining their","regaining their self-respect","their self-respect and","self-respect and redefining","and redefining their","redefining their collective","their collective identity","collective identity on","identity on their","on their own","their own terms"],"2grams":["Faith ,",", Hope","Hope and","and Greenland","Greenland is","is a","a visual","visual and","and poetic","poetic journey","journey into","into the","the very","very hearts","hearts of","of the","the people","people of","of Greenland","Told in","in a","a natural","natural ,",", honest","honest and","and non-accusative","non-accusative manner","manner ,",", its","its four","four main","main protagonists","protagonists advise","advise the","the viewer","viewer on","on the","the underbelly","underbelly of","of colonisation","colonisation ,",", its","its effects","effects on","on an","an ancient","ancient ,",", nomadic","nomadic culture","culture and","and on","on the","the individual","individual mind","However ,",", the","the film","film is","is built","built upon","upon hope","hope ,",", and","and throughout","throughout the","the entire","entire film","film we","we get","get an","an idea","idea of","of the","the intensity","intensity and","and speed","speed with","with which","which the","the people","people of","of this","this remote","remote country","country ,",", are","are regaining","regaining their","their self-respect","self-respect and","and redefining","redefining their","their collective","collective identity","identity on","on their","their own","own terms"]}

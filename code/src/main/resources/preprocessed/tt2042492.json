{"title":"Dawn's Highway","plot":"Dawn's Highway traces and seeks to validate Jim Morrison's story about his family encountering a deadly accident in the New Mexico desert when he was a young boy. The story first surfaced on an album of Morrison's poetry, An American Prayer. Frank Lisciandro, who originally recorded the story, recounts his experience of working with Morrison in the short documentary film. Central to the film's presentation is a 1947 newspaper article. The driver of the truck and a witness to the aftermath of the accident are interviewed. Three prominent New Mexico historians share their perspectives. Dawn's Highway attempts to substantiate a rock and roll mystery. Did Jim Morrison invent or embellish his story, or did he actually remember in vivid detail this early childhood event?","genres":["Documentary","

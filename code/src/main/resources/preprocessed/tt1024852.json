{"title":"Meerabai Not Out","plot":"Meera Achrekar lives a middle-classed lifestyle in a Shivaji Park Chawl, along with her widowed mother; brother Manoj, his wife, Neelima, and their son, Mayank. After the passing of their father, Anant, Manoj, who was just 18 at that time, took over the financial reins of this family, while she, herself, got employed as a Maths Teacher with Vishwa-Prem Vidyalaya, and heads the 'Meera XI' cricket team in the colony. Her mother and Manoj are on the look-out for a suitable groom, but her obsession with cricket along with the 'bahenji' bespectacled looks turn to her disadvantage. Things start to look up after she dramatically meets with heart specialist Dr. Arjun Awasthi, who lives in a mansion with his widower dentist father. The two families meet, and decide to get the couple married. On the day of the formal engagement, however, things spiral out of control when Meera does not show up.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Meera","Achrekar","live","a","middle-class","lifestyl","in","a","Shivaji","Park","Chawl",",","along","with","her","widow","mother",";","brother","Manoj",",","his","wife",",","Neelima",",","and","their","son",",","Mayank",".","After","the","pass","of","their","father",",","Anant",",","Manoj",",","who","was","just","18","at","that","time",",","took","over","the","financi","rein","of","this","famili",",","while","she",",","herself",",","got","employ","as","a","Math","Teacher","with","Vishwa-Prem","Vidyalaya",",","and","head","the","'","Meera","XI","'","cricket","team","in","the","coloni",".","Her","mother","and","Manoj","are","on","the","look-out","for","a","suitabl","groom",",","but","her","obsess","with","cricket","along","with","the","'","bahenji","'","bespectacl","look","turn","to","her","disadvantag",".","Thing","start","to","look","up","after","she","dramat","meet","with","heart","specialist","Dr.","Arjun","Awasthi",",","who","live","in","a","mansion","with","his","widow","dentist","father",".","The","two","famili","meet",",","and","decid","to","get","the","coupl","marri",".","On","the","day","of","the","formal","engag",",","howev",",","thing","spiral","out","of","control","when","Meera","doe","not","show","up","."],"lemmas":["Meera","Achrekar","live","a","middle-classed","lifestyle","in","a","Shivaji","Park","Chawl",",","along","with","she","widow","mother",";","brother","Manoj",",","he","wife",",","Neelima",",","and","they","son",",","Mayank",".","after","the","passing","of","they","father",",","Anant",",","Manoj",",","who","be","just","18","at","that","time",",","take","over","the","financial","rein","of","this","family",",","while","she",",","herself",",","get","employ","as","a","Maths","teacher","with","Vishwa-Prem","Vidyalaya",",","and","head","the","'","Meera","XI","'","cricket","team","in","the","colony",".","she","mother","and","Manoj","be","on","the","look-out","for","a","suitable","groom",",","but","she","obsession","with","cricket","along","with","the","'","bahenji","'","bespectacled","look","turn","to","she","disadvantage",".","thing","start","to","look","up","after","she","dramatically","meet","with","heart","specialist","Dr.","Arjun","Awasthi",",","who","live","in","a","mansion","with","he","widower","dentist","father",".","the","two","family","meet",",","and","decide","to","get","the","couple","marry",".","on","the","day","of","the","formal","engagement",",","however",",","thing","spiral","out","of","control","when","Meera","do","not","show","up","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Meera Achrekar lives","Achrekar lives a","lives a middle-classed","a middle-classed lifestyle","middle-classed lifestyle in","lifestyle in a","in a Shivaji","a Shivaji Park","Shivaji Park Chawl","Park Chawl ,","Chawl , along",", along with","along with her","with her widowed","her widowed mother","widowed mother ;","mother ;

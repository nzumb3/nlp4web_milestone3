{"title":"Ungleich","plot":"Young actress Mabelle fails at her last scene. Her growing mental confusion begins to affect the other crew members too, until everybody sees their reality endangered. Many questions arise in Mabelles head, which she can't solve all by herself. But who can answer, where acting ends and real life begins? And is there ever 'off camera' with the constant eye of a camera in the room? She realizes that these thoughts have a strong impact on reality. Nevertheless the crew of five tries to live, love and work together. But suddenly the camera reveals odd things, that change everyone's perception of who they thought to be. The film includes a genre-comprehensive work of documentary and fictional elements, performing art and thinking about film making.","genres":["Fantasy","

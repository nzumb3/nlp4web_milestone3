{"title":"Agganis: The Golden Greek - Excellence to the End","plot":"Harry Agganis was a too good to be true athlete! As the finest high school athlete to ever come out of New England, he had a reputation that extended nationally and well beyond the borders of his hometown of Lynn, Massachusetts. Harry had classical form and an almost surreal talent that made him a natural. Harry Agganis was the force leading the Boston University football team to national prominence. But baseball was his game. Despite being the Cleveland Browns' first round draft choice in the 1952 NFL draft, Harry signed with his hometown Boston Red Sox so he could be close to his widowed mother. The Red Sox were in the thick of the Ted Williams era and Harry was emerging as a star. A humble, modest, handsome hero, he was adored by the Greek community and held in awe by anyone in his presence. As one friend said, \"if you took all the finest pieces of all the great people you knew, and put them into a composite of one man... that was Harry.\" When he died, inexplicably, in the summer of 1955 the shock was seismic. The seemingly indestructible young man was gone at the age of 26. This is the story of how a driven young man from a struggling immigrant family somehow managed to become so extraordinary. Harry Agganis, The Golden Greek, lived a life of excellence to the end.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Harri","Aggani","was","a","too","good","to","be","true","athlet","!","As","the","finest","high","school","athlet","to","ever","come","out","of","New","England",",","he","had","a","reput","that","extend","nation","and","well","beyond","the","border","of","his","hometown","of","Lynn",",","Massachusett",".","Harri","had","classic","form","and","an","almost","surreal","talent","that","made","him","a","natur",".","Harri","Aggani","was","the","forc","lead","the","Boston","Univers","footbal","team","to","nation","promin",".","But","basebal","was","his","game",".","Despit","be","the","Cleveland","Brown","'","first","round","draft","choic","in","the","1952","NFL","draft",",","Harri","sign","with","his","hometown","Boston","Red","Sox","so","he","could","be","close","to","his","widow","mother",".","The","Red","Sox","were","in","the","thick","of","the","Ted","William","era","and","Harri","was","emerg","as","a","star",".","A","humbl",",","modest",",","handsom","hero",",","he","was","ador","by","the","Greek","communiti","and","held","in","awe","by","anyon","in","his","presenc",".","As","one","friend","said",",","\"","if","you","took","all","the","finest","piec","of","all","the","great","peopl","you","knew",",","and","put","them","into","a","composit","of","one","man","...","that","was","Harri",".","\"","When","he","die",",","inexplic",",","in","the","summer","of","1955","the","shock","was","seismic",".","The","seem","indestruct","young","man","was","gone","at","the","age","of","26",".","This","is","the","stori","of","how","a","driven","young","man","from","a","struggl","immigr","famili","somehow","manag","to","becom","so","extraordinari",".","Harri","Aggani",",","The","Golden","Greek",",","live","a","life","of","excel","to","the","end","."],"lemmas":["Harry","Agganis","be","a","too","good","to","be","true","athlete","!","as","the","finest","high","school","athlete","to","ever","come","out","of","New","England",",","he","have","a","reputation","that","extend","nationally","and","well","beyond","the","border","of","he","hometown","of","Lynn",",","Massachusetts",".","Harry","have","classical","form","and","a","almost","surreal","talent","that","make","he","a","natural",".","Harry","Agganis","be","the","force","lead","the","Boston","University","football","team","to","national","prominence",".","but","baseball","be","he","game",".","despite","be","the","Cleveland","Browns","'","first","round","draft","choice","in","the","1952","NFL","draft",",","Harry","sign","with","he","hometown","Boston","Red","Sox","so","he","could","be","close","to","he","widow","mother",".","the","Red","Sox","be","in","the","thick","of","the","Ted","Williams","era","and","Harry","be","emerge","as","a","star",".","a","humble",",","modest",",","handsome","hero",",","he","be","adore","by","the","greek","community","and","hold","in","awe","by","anyone","in","he","presence",".","as","one","friend","say",",","``","if","you","take","all","the","finest","piece","of","all","the","great","people","you","know",",","and","put","they","into","a","composite","of","one","man","...","that","be","Harry",".","''","when","he","die",",","inexplicably",",","in","the","summer","of","1955","the","shock","be","seismic",".","the","seemingly","indestructible","young","man","be","go","at","the","age","of","26",".","this","be","the","story","of","how","a","driven","young","man","from","a","struggle","immigrant","family","somehow","manage","to","become","so","extraordinary",".","Harry","Agganis",",","The","Golden","greek",",","live","a","life","of","excellence","to","the","end","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harry

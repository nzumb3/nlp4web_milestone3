However, he has friends who do more than stand by -- they kidnap the wife's French lover and hold him prisoner so that Colin can restore his manhood with revenge. A kangaroo court takes place and as the situation escalates Loverboy's life hangs in the balance as Colin wrestles with revenge, remorse, grief and self pity, all the while egged on by his motley crew of friends who just want him to get on with it so they can get down the pub.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Colin","is","in","agoni",",","shatter","by","his","wife","'s","infidel",".","Howev",",","he","has","friend","who","do","more","than","stand","by","--","they","kidnap","the","wife","'s","French","lover","and","hold","him","prison","so","that","Colin","can","restor","his","manhood","with","reveng",".","A","kangaroo","court","take","place","and","as","the","situat","escal","Loverboy","'s","life","hang","in","the","balanc","as","Colin","wrestl","with","reveng",",","remors",",","grief","and","self","piti",",","all","the","while","eg","on","by","his","motley","crew","of","friend","who","just","want","him","to","get","on","with","it","so","they","can","get","down","the","pub","."],"lemmas":["Colin","be","in","agony",",","shatter","by","he","wife","'s","infidelity",".","however",",","he","have","friend","who","do","more","than","stand","by","--","they","kidnap","the","wife","'s","french","lover","and","hold","he","prisoner","so","that","Colin","can","restore","he","manhood","with","revenge",".","a","kangaroo","court","take","place","and","as","the","situation","escalate","Loverboy","'s","life","hang","in","the","balance","as","Colin","wrestle","with","revenge",",","remorse",",","grief","and","self","pity",",","all","the","while","egg","on","by","he","motley","crew","of","friend","who","just","want","he","to","get","on","with","it","so","they","can","get","down","the","pub","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Colin is in","is in agony","in agony ,","agony , shattered",", shattered by","shattered by his","by his wife","his wife 's","wife 's infidelity","However , he",", he has","he has friends","has friends who","friends who do","who do more","do more than","more than stand","than stand by","stand by --","by -- they","-- they kidnap","they kidnap the","kidnap the wife","the wife 's","wife 's French","'s French lover","French lover and","lover and hold","and hold him","hold him prisoner","him prisoner so","prisoner so that","so that Colin","that Colin can","Colin can restore","can restore his","restore his manhood","his manhood with","manhood with revenge","A kangaroo court","kangaroo court takes","court takes place","takes place and","place and as","and as the","as the situation","the situation escalates","situation escalates Loverboy","escalates Loverboy 's","Loverboy 's life","'s life hangs","life hangs in","hangs in the","in the balance","the balance as","balance as Colin","as Colin wrestles","Colin wrestles with","wrestles with revenge","with revenge ,","revenge , remorse",", remorse ,","remorse , grief",", grief and","grief and self","and self pity","self pity ,","pity , all",", all the","all the while","the while egged","while egged on","egged on by","on by his","by his motley","his motley crew","motley crew of","crew of friends","of friends who","friends who just","who just want","just want him","want him to","him to get","to get on","get on with","on with it","with it so","it so they","so they can","they can get","can get down","get down the","down the pub"],"2grams":["Colin is","is in","in agony","agony ,",", shattered","shattered by","by his","his wife","wife 's","'s infidelity","However ,",", he","he has","has friends","friends who","who do","do more","more than","than stand","stand by","by --","-- they","they kidnap","kidnap the","the wife","wife 's","'s French","French lover","lover and","and hold","hold him","him prisoner","prisoner so","so that","that Colin","Colin can","can restore","restore his","his manhood","manhood with","with revenge","A kangaroo","kangaroo court","court takes","takes place","place and","and as","as the","the situation","situation escalates","escalates Loverboy","Loverboy 's","'s life","life hangs","hangs in","in the","the balance","balance as","as Colin","Colin wrestles","wrestles with","with revenge","revenge ,",", remorse","remorse ,",", grief","grief and","and self","self pity","pity ,",", all","all the","the while","while egged","egged on","on by","by his","his motley","motley crew","crew of","of friends","friends who","who just","just want","want him","him to","to get","get on","on with","with it","it so","so they","they can","can get","get down","down the","the pub"]}

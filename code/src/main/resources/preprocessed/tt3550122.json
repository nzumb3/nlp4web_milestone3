{"title":"Heritage","plot":"Switzerland, that famous neutral country, is according to recent statistics, the third most armed population on Earth. This is partly due to one of its most popular sports 'Shooting'. In the heart of Switzerland there's a fascinating world of guns, bizarre, interesting characters, different perspectives, controversial ideas and, above all, an exceptional tradition that lives on. Swiss Olympic shooting champions, families of Swiss shooters, politicians and others, tell us why shooting and weapons are, or why they shouldn't be, so popular in Switzerland.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Switzerland",",","that","famous","neutral","countri",",","is","accord","to","recent","statist",",","the","third","most","arm","popul","on","Earth",".","This","is","part","due","to","one","of","it","most","popular","sport","'","Shoot","'",".","In","the","heart","of","Switzerland","there","'s","a","fascin","world","of","gun",",","bizarr",",","interest","charact",",","differ","perspect",",","controversi","idea","and",",","abov","all",",","an","except","tradit","that","live","on",".","Swiss","Olympic","shoot","champion",",","famili","of","Swiss","shooter",",","politician","and","other",",","tell","us","whi","shoot","and","weapon","are",",","or","whi","they","should","n't","be",",","so","popular","in","Switzerland","."],"lemmas":["Switzerland",",","that","famous","neutral","country",",","be","accord","to","recent","statistics",",","the","third","most","armed","population","on","Earth",".","this","be","partly","due","to","one","of","its","most","popular","sport","'","shooting","'",".","in","the","heart","of","Switzerland","there","be","a","fascinating","world","of","gun",",","bizarre",",","interesting","character",",","different","perspective",",","controversial","idea","and",",","above","all",",","a","exceptional","tradition","that","life","on",".","Swiss","Olympic","shooting","champion",",","family","of","swiss","shooter",",","politician","and","other",",","tell","we","why","shooting","and","weapon","be",",","or","why","they","should","not","be",",","so","popular","in","Switzerland","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Switzerland , that",", that famous","that famous neutral","famous neutral country","neutral country ,","country , is",", is according","is according to","according to recent","to recent statistics","recent statistics ,","statistics , the",", the third","the third most","third most armed","most armed population","armed population on","population on Earth","This is partly","is partly due","partly due to","due to one","to one of","one of its","of its most","its most popular","most popular sports","popular sports '","sports ' Shooting","' Shooting '","In the heart","the heart of","heart of Switzerland","of Switzerland there","Switzerland there 's","there 's a","'s a fascinating","a fascinating world","fascinating world of","world of guns","of guns ,","guns , bizarre",", bizarre ,","bizarre , interesting",", interesting characters","interesting characters ,","characters , different",", different perspectives","different perspectives ,","perspectives , controversial",", controversial ideas","controversial ideas and","ideas and ,","and , above",", above all","above all ,","all , an",", an exceptional","an exceptional tradition","exceptional tradition that","tradition that lives","that lives on","Swiss Olympic shooting","Olympic shooting champions","shooting champions ,","champions , families",", families of","families of Swiss","of Swiss shooters","Swiss shooters ,","shooters , politicians",", politicians and","politicians and others","and others ,","others , tell",", tell us","tell us why","us why shooting","why shooting and","shooting and weapons","and weapons are","weapons are ,","are , or",", or why","or why they","why they should","they should n't","should n't be","n't be ,","be , so",", so popular","so popular in","popular in Switzerland"],"2grams":["Switzerland ,",", that","that famous","famous neutral","neutral country","country ,",", is","is according","according to","to recent","recent statistics","statistics ,",", the","the third","third most","most armed","armed population","population on","on Earth","This is","is partly","partly due","due to","to one","one of","of its","its most","most popular","popular sports","sports '","' Shooting","Shooting '","In the","the heart","heart of","of Switzerland","Switzerland there","there 's","'s a","a fascinating","fascinating world","world of","of guns","guns ,",", bizarre","bizarre ,",", interesting","interesting characters","characters ,",", different","different perspectives","perspectives ,",", controversial","controversial ideas","ideas and","and ,",", above","above all","all ,",", an","an exceptional","exceptional tradition","tradition that","that lives","lives on","Swiss Olympic","Olympic shooting","shooting champions","champions ,",", families","families of","of Swiss","Swiss shooters","shooters ,",", politicians","politicians and","and others","others ,",", tell","tell us","us why","why shooting","shooting and","and weapons","weapons are","are ,",", or","or why","why they","they should","should n't","n't be","be ,",", so","so popular","popular in","in Switzerland"]}

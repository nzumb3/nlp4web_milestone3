{"title":"Josh Jarman","plot":"Marcus Graham plays Josh Jarman, a struggling playwright who has written a long, serious play about doomed love, failed relationships and the overall hurt and heartache of falling in love. He is extremely proud of it, and takes it to various producers around the city, hoping to find one that will produce his play. He takes it to Stan Billows, played by Kym Gyngell, who tells him that although the play is good, it is too serious and long-winded to attract wide audience appeal, so he doesn't feel he can fund it. While at Billows' office, Josh meets Sasha, who appears to be another struggluing playwright. The two immediately hit it off, and a relationship develops. Billows is now interested in producing Josh's play, because it turns out Sasha is his daughter. Billows makes it clear that he will only priduce it on the condition that Josh continues to see his daughter. While this is problematic enough, Billows and the director hired want to make changes to the play, to make it more audience friendly, that is, they put song and dance numbers in, and take away all of its dramatic meaning. This leaves Josh with a dilemma - Does he continue to let them produce the play while sacrificing his own artistic integrity, or does he put a stop to it which will leave him once again, as a struggling playwright?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Marcus","Graham","play","Josh","Jarman",",","a","struggl","playwright","who","has","written","a","long",",","serious","play","about","doom","love",",","fail","relationship","and","the","overal","hurt","and","heartach","of","fall","in","love",".","He","is","extrem","proud","of","it",",","and","take","it","to","various","produc","around","the","citi",",","hope","to","find","one","that","will","produc","his","play",".","He","take","it","to","Stan","Billow",",","play","by","Kym","Gyngel",",","who","tell","him","that","although","the","play","is","good",",","it","is","too","serious","and","long-wind","to","attract","wide","audienc","appeal",",","so","he","doe","n't","feel","he","can","fund","it",".","While","at","Billow","'","offic",",","Josh","meet","Sasha",",","who","appear","to","be","anoth","strugglu","playwright",".","The","two","immedi","hit","it","off",",","and","a","relationship","develop",".","Billow","is","now","interest","in","produc","Josh","'s","play",",","becaus","it","turn","out","Sasha","is","his","daughter",".","Billow","make","it","clear","that","he","will","onli","priduc","it","on","the","condit","that","Josh","continu","to","see","his","daughter",".","While","this","is","problemat","enough",",","Billow","and","the","director","hire","want","to","make","chang","to","the","play",",","to","make","it","more","audienc","friend",",","that","is",",","they","put","song","and","danc","number","in",",","and","take","away","all","of","it","dramat","mean",".","This","leav","Josh","with","a","dilemma","-","Doe","he","continu","to","let","them","produc","the","play","while","sacrif","his","own","artist","integr",",","or","doe","he","put","a","stop","to","it","which","will","leav","him","onc","again",",","as","a","struggl","playwright","?"],"lemmas":["Marcus","Graham","play","Josh","Jarman",",","a","struggle","playwright","who","have","write","a","long",",","serious","play","about","doomed","love",",","fail","relationship","and","the","overall","hurt","and","heartache","of","fall","in","love",".","he","be","extremely","proud","of","it",",","and","take","it","to","various","producer","around","the","city",",","hope","to","find","one","that","will","produce","he","play",".","he","take","it","to","Stan","Billows",",","play","by","Kym","Gyngell",",","who","tell","he","that","although","the","play","be","good",",","it","be","too","serious","and","long-winded","to","attract","wide","audience","appeal",",","so","he","do","not","feel","he","can","fund","it",".","while","at","Billows","'","office",",","Josh","meet","Sasha",",","who","appear","to","be","another","strugglue","playwright",".","the","two","immediately","hit","it","off",",","and","a","relationship","develop",".","Billows","be","now","interested","in","produce","Josh","'s","play",",","because","it","turn","out","Sasha","be","he","daughter",".","Billows","make","it","clear","that","he","will","only","priduce","it","on","the","condition","that","Josh","continue","to","see","he","daughter",".","while","this","be","problematic","enough",",","Billows","and","the","director","hire","want","to","make","change","to","the","play",",","to","make","it","more","audience","friendly",",","that","be",",","they","put","song","and","dance","number","in",",","and","take","away","all","of","its","dramatic","meaning",".","this","leave","Josh","with","a","dilemma","-","do","he","continue","to","let","they","produce","the","play","while","sacrifice","he","own","artistic","integrity",",","or","do","he","put","a","stop","to","it","which","will","leave","he","once","again",",","as","a","struggling","playwright","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Marcus

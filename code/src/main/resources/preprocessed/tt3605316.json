{"title":"Love Songs","plot":"Love songs is a melodramatic fragment of several lives, intersected by a trace of their mutual past. The outline of this trace surfaces unobtrusively and incidentally throughout the principal episode of the film: Gabriel, a young man, visits a household he used to know very well at one time. Patient observation of the situation unwinds in shades of melancholy, sadness, but also hilarity and humor.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Love","song","is","a","melodramat","fragment","of","sever","live",",","intersect","by","a","trace","of","their","mutual","past",".","The","outlin","of","this","trace","surfac","unobtrus","and","incident","throughout","the","princip","episod","of","the","film",":","Gabriel",",","a","young","man",",","visit","a","household","he","use","to","know","veri","well","at","one","time",".","Patient","observ","of","the","situat","unwind","in","shade","of","melancholi",",","sad",",","but","also","hilar","and","humor","."],"lemmas":["love","song","be","a","melodramatic","fragment","of","several","life",",","intersect","by","a","trace","of","they","mutual","past",".","the","outline","of","this","trace","surface","unobtrusively","and","incidentally","throughout","the","principal","episode","of","the","film",":","Gabriel",",","a","young","man",",","visit","a","household","he","use","to","know","very","well","at","one","time",".","patient","observation","of","the","situation","unwind","in","shades","of","melancholy",",","sadness",",","but","also","hilarity","and","humor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Love songs is","songs is a","is a melodramatic","a melodramatic fragment","melodramatic fragment of","fragment of several","of several lives","several lives ,","lives , intersected",", intersected by","intersected by a","by a trace","a trace of","trace of their","of their mutual","their mutual past","The outline of","outline of this","of this trace","this trace surfaces","trace surfaces unobtrusively","surfaces unobtrusively and","unobtrusively and incidentally","and incidentally throughout","incidentally throughout the","throughout the principal","the principal episode","principal episode of","episode of the","of the film","the film :","film : Gabriel",": Gabriel ,","Gabriel , a",", a young","a young man","young man ,","man , visits",", visits a","visits a household","a household he","household he used","he used to","used to know","to know very","know very well","very well at","well at one","at one time","Patient observation of","observation of the","of the situation","the situation unwinds","situation unwinds in","unwinds in shades","in shades of","shades of melancholy","of melancholy ,","melancholy , sadness",", sadness ,","sadness , but",", but also","but also hilarity","also hilarity and","hilarity and humor"],"2grams":["Love songs","songs is","is a","a melodramatic","melodramatic fragment","fragment of","of several","several lives","lives ,",", intersected","intersected by","by a","a trace","trace of","of their","their mutual","mutual past","The outline","outline of","of this","this trace","trace surfaces","surfaces unobtrusively","unobtrusively and","and incidentally","incidentally throughout","throughout the","the principal","principal episode","episode of","of the","the film","film :",": Gabriel","Gabriel ,",", a","a young","young man","man ,",", visits","visits a","a household","household he","he used","used to","to know","know very","very well","well at","at one","one time","Patient observation","observation of","of the","the situation","situation unwinds","unwinds in","in shades","shades of","of melancholy","melancholy ,",", sadness","sadness ,",", but","but also","also hilarity","hilarity and","and humor"]}

{"title":"Cost of a Soul","plot":"Wounded in the war, Tommy Donahue and DD Davis return home from Iraq to their North Philadelphia slum neighborhood. Tommy returns home to his wife, Faith, whom he abandoned while she was pregnant. He meets his four-year-old daughter, Hope, for the first time, and she begins to melt his frozen heart. DD faces the pressure to save his younger brother, James, from becoming a victim of the streets. Meanwhile their oldest brother, Darnell, has risen to become the neighborhood kingpin. The two find themselves trapped in the same slums they joined the military to escape from. As they struggle to make their wrongs right, their own families become entangled in a web of crime and corruption so thick, murder becomes their only option.","genres":["Crime","

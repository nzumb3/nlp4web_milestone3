{"title":"Candy","plot":"This story is a narration from an Australian man who falls in love with two kinds of Candy: a woman of the same name and heroin. The narrator changes from a smart-aleck to someone trying to find a vein to inject, while Candy changes from an actress, call girl, streetwalker, and then a madwoman. Starting in Sydney, the two eventually end up in Melbourne to go clean, but they fail. This leads them to turn to finding money and heroin, while other posessions and attachments become unimportant.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["This","stori","is","a","narrat","from","an","Australian","man","who","fall","in","love","with","two","kind","of","Candi",":","a","woman","of","the","same","name","and","heroin",".","The","narrat","chang","from","a","smart-aleck","to","someon","tri","to","find","a","vein","to","inject",",","while","Candi","chang","from","an","actress",",","call","girl",",","streetwalk",",","and","then","a","madwoman",".","Start","in","Sydney",",","the","two","eventu","end","up","in","Melbourn","to","go","clean",",","but","they","fail",".","This","lead","them","to","turn","to","find","money","and","heroin",",","while","other","posess","and","attach","becom","unimport","."],"lemmas":["this","story","be","a","narration","from","a","australian","man","who","fall","in","love","with","two","kind","of","candy",":","a","woman","of","the","same","name","and","heroin",".","the","narrator","change","from","a","smart-aleck","to","someone","try","to","find","a","vein","to","inject",",","while","candy","change","from","a","actress",",","call","girl",",","streetwalker",",","and","then","a","madwoman",".","start","in","Sydney",",","the","two","eventually","end","up","in","Melbourne","to","go","clean",",","but","they","fail",".","this","lead","they","to","turn","to","find","money","and","heroin",",","while","other","posession","and","attachment","become","unimportant","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This story is","story is a","is a narration","a narration from","narration from an","from an Australian","an Australian man","Australian man who","man who falls","who falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with two","with two kinds","two kinds of","kinds of Candy","of Candy :","Candy : a",": a woman","a woman of","woman of the","of the same","the same name","same name and","name and heroin","The narrator changes","narrator changes from","changes from a","from a smart-aleck","a smart-aleck to","smart-aleck to someone","to someone trying","someone trying to","trying to find","to find a","find a vein","a vein to","vein to inject","to inject ,","inject , while",", while Candy","while Candy changes","Candy changes from","changes from an","from an actress","an actress ,","actress , call",", call girl","call girl ,","girl , streetwalker",", streetwalker ,","streetwalker , and",", and then","and then a","then a madwoman","Starting in Sydney","in Sydney ,","Sydney , the",", the two","the two eventually","two eventually end","eventually end up","end up in","up in Melbourne","in Melbourne to","Melbourne to go","to go clean","go clean ,","clean , but",", but they","but they fail","This leads them","leads them to","them to turn","to turn to","turn to finding","to finding money","finding money and","money and heroin","and heroin ,","heroin , while",", while other","while other posessions","other posessions and","posessions and attachments","and attachments become","attachments become unimportant"],"2grams":["This story","story is","is a","a narration","narration from","from an","an Australian","Australian man","man who","who falls","falls in","in love","love with","with two","two kinds","kinds of","of Candy","Candy :",": a","a woman","woman of","of the","the same","same name","name and","and heroin","The narrator","narrator changes","changes from","from a","a smart-aleck","smart-aleck to","to someone","someone trying","trying to","to find","find a","a vein","vein to","to inject","inject ,",", while","while Candy","Candy changes","changes from","from an","an actress","actress ,",", call","call girl","girl ,",", streetwalker","streetwalker ,",", and","and then","then a","a madwoman","Starting in","in Sydney","Sydney ,",", the","the two","two eventually","eventually end","end up","up in","in Melbourne","Melbourne to","to go","go clean","clean ,",", but","but they","they fail","This leads","leads them","them to","to turn","turn to","to finding","finding money","money and","and heroin","heroin ,",", while","while other","other posessions","posessions and","and attachments","attachments become","become unimportant"]}

{"title":"Why Do Fools Fall in Love","plot":"In the mid-1980s, three women (each with an attorney) arrive at the office of New York entertainment manager Morris Levy. One is a singer from Los Angeles, formerly of the Platters; one is a petty thief from Philadelphia; one teaches high school in a small Georgia town. Each claims to be the widow of long-dead doo-wop singer-songwriter Frankie Lyman, and each wants years of royalties due to his estate, money Levy has never shared. During an ensuing civil trial, flashbacks tell the story of each one's life with Lyman, a boyish, high-pitched, dynamic performer, lost to heroin. Slowly, the three widows come together and establish their own bond.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","mid-1980",",","three","women","(","each","with","an","attorney",")","arriv","at","the","offic","of","New","York","entertain","manag","Morri","Levi",".","One","is","a","singer","from","Los","Angele",",","former","of","the","Platter",";","one","is","a","petti","thief","from","Philadelphia",";","one","teach","high","school","in","a","small","Georgia","town",".","Each","claim","to","be","the","widow","of","long-dead","doo-wop","singer-songwrit","Franki","Lyman",",","and","each","want","year","of","royalti","due","to","his","estat",",","money","Levi","has","never","share",".","Dure","an","ensu","civil","trial",",","flashback","tell","the","stori","of","each","one","'s","life","with","Lyman",",","a","boyish",",","high-pitch",",","dynam","perform",",","lost","to","heroin",".","Slowli",",","the","three","widow","come","togeth","and","establish","their","own","bond","."],"lemmas":["in","the","mid-1980",",","three","woman","-lrb-","each","with","a","attorney","-rrb-","arrive","at","the","office","of","New","York","entertainment","manager","Morris","Levy",".","one","be","a","singer","from","Los","Angeles",",","formerly","of","the","Platters",";","one","be","a","petty","thief","from","Philadelphia",";","one","teach","high","school","in","a","small","Georgia","town",".","each","claim","to","be","the","widow","of","long-dead","doo-wop","singer-songwriter","Frankie","Lyman",",","and","each","want","year","of","royalty","due","to","he","estate",",","money","Levy","have","never","share",".","during","a","ensue","civil","trial",",","flashback","tell","the","story","of","each","one","'s","life","with","Lyman",",","a","boyish",",","high-pitched",",","dynamic","performer",",","lose","to","heroin",".","slowly",",","the","three","widow","come","together","and","establish","they","own","bond","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the mid-1980s","the mid-1980s ,","mid-1980s , three",", three women","three women (","women ( each","( each with","each with an","with an attorney","an attorney )","attorney ) arrive",") arrive at","arrive at the","at the office","the office of","office of New","of New York","New York entertainment","York entertainment manager","entertainment manager Morris","manager Morris Levy","One is a","is a singer","a singer from","singer from Los","from Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , formerly",", formerly of","formerly of the","of the Platters","the Platters ;","Platters ;

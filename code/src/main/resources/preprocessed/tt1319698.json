{"title":"All the Years of Trying","plot":"Music documentary about cult 'punk poet' Patrik Fitzgerald (born as Patrick Joseph Fitzgerald in Stratford, London, March 19, 1956) - son of working-class Irish immigrant parents, he began recording and performing during the punk rock movement in 1977. Composer of punk anthem 'Safety Pin Stuck in My Heart', Fitzgerald kicked against the punk orthodoxy by performing waif-like and vulnerably alone with an acoustic guitar and a tattered book of poems at the height of the punk revolution.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Music","documentari","about","cult","'","punk","poet","'","Patrik","Fitzgerald","(","born","as","Patrick","Joseph","Fitzgerald","in","Stratford",",","London",",","March","19",",","1956",")","-","son","of","working-class","Irish","immigr","parent",",","he","began","record","and","perform","dure","the","punk","rock","movement","in","1977",".","Compos","of","punk","anthem","'","Safeti","Pin","Stuck","in","My","Heart","'",",","Fitzgerald","kick","against","the","punk","orthodoxi","by","perform","waif-lik","and","vulner","alon","with","an","acoust","guitar","and","a","tatter","book","of","poem","at","the","height","of","the","punk","revolut","."],"lemmas":["music","documentary","about","cult","'","punk","poet","'","Patrik","Fitzgerald","-lrb-","bear","as","Patrick","Joseph","Fitzgerald","in","Stratford",",","London",",","March","19",",","1956","-rrb-","-","son","of","working-class","irish","immigrant","parent",",","he","begin","record","and","perform","during","the","punk","rock","movement","in","1977",".","composer","of","punk","anthem","'","Safety","Pin","Stuck","in","My","Heart","'",",","Fitzgerald","kick","against","the","punk","orthodoxy","by","perform","waif-like","and","vulnerably","alone","with","a","acoustic","guitar","and","a","tattered","book","of","poem","at","the","height","of","the","punk","revolution","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Music documentary about","documentary about cult","about cult '","cult ' punk","' punk poet","punk poet '","poet ' Patrik","' Patrik Fitzgerald","Patrik Fitzgerald (","Fitzgerald ( born","( born as","born as Patrick","as Patrick Joseph","Patrick Joseph Fitzgerald","Joseph Fitzgerald in","Fitzgerald in Stratford","in Stratford ,","Stratford , London",", London ,","London , March",", March 19","March 19 ,","19 , 1956",", 1956 )","1956 ) -",") - son","- son of","son of working-class","of working-class Irish","working-class Irish immigrant","Irish immigrant parents","immigrant parents ,","parents , he",", he began","he began recording","began recording and","recording and performing","and performing during","performing during the","during the punk","the punk rock","punk rock movement","rock movement in","movement in 1977","Composer of punk","of punk anthem","punk anthem '","anthem ' Safety","' Safety Pin","Safety Pin Stuck","Pin Stuck in","Stuck in My","in My Heart","My Heart '","Heart ' ,","' , Fitzgerald",", Fitzgerald kicked","Fitzgerald kicked against","kicked against the","against the punk","the punk orthodoxy","punk orthodoxy by","orthodoxy by performing","by performing waif-like","performing waif-like and","waif-like and vulnerably","and vulnerably alone","vulnerably alone with","alone with an","with an acoustic","an acoustic guitar","acoustic guitar and","guitar and a","and a tattered","a tattered book","tattered book of","book of poems","of poems at","poems at the","at the height","the height of","height of the","of the punk","the punk revolution"],"2grams":["Music documentary","documentary about","about cult","cult '","' punk","punk poet","poet '","' Patrik","Patrik Fitzgerald","Fitzgerald (","( born","born as","as Patrick","Patrick Joseph","Joseph Fitzgerald","Fitzgerald in","in Stratford","Stratford ,",", London","London ,",", March","March 19","19 ,",", 1956","1956 )",") -","- son","son of","of working-class","working-class Irish","Irish immigrant","immigrant parents","parents ,",", he","he began","began recording","recording and","and performing","performing during","during the","the punk","punk rock","rock movement","movement in","in 1977","Composer of","of punk","punk anthem","anthem '","' Safety","Safety Pin","Pin Stuck","Stuck in","in My","My Heart","Heart '","' ,",", Fitzgerald","Fitzgerald kicked","kicked against","against the","the punk","punk orthodoxy","orthodoxy by","by performing","performing waif-like","waif-like and","and vulnerably","vulnerably alone","alone with","with an","an acoustic","acoustic guitar","guitar and","and a","a tattered","tattered book","book of","of poems","poems at","at the","the height","height of","of the","the punk","punk revolution"]}

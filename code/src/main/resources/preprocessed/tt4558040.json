{"title":"Loserville","plot":"Loserville follows a dorky high school outcast named Chuck as he navigates the wild and confusing days of his senior year. Chuck must face the challenges that he and friends are growing apart; that his mother has decided to date a much younger man who just happens to be the school's gym teacher; and that his dream girl the brilliant, beautiful and popular Melissa Mercer barely acknowledges his existence. His plan to capture Melissa's heart once and for all by befriending her younger sister, Mary, is complicated by the fact that a viral video of Mary is the talk of the school. Featuring an ensemble of funny, flawed, and lovable characters who collide in a romantic, comic cocktail that turns every teen stereotype you think you know on its head.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Loservill","follow","a","dorki","high","school","outcast","name","Chuck","as","he","navig","the","wild","and","confus","day","of","his","senior","year",".","Chuck","must","face","the","challeng","that","he","and","friend","are","grow","apart",";","that","his","mother","has","decid","to","date","a","much","younger","man","who","just","happen","to","be","the","school","'s","gym","teacher",";","and","that","his","dream","girl","the","brilliant",",","beauti","and","popular","Melissa","Mercer","bare","acknowledg","his","exist",".","His","plan","to","captur","Melissa","'s","heart","onc","and","for","all","by","befriend","her","younger","sister",",","Mari",",","is","complic","by","the","fact","that","a","viral","video","of","Mari","is","the","talk","of","the","school",".","Featur","an","ensembl","of","funni",",","flaw",",","and","lovabl","charact","who","collid","in","a","romant",",","comic","cocktail","that","turn","everi","teen","stereotyp","you","think","you","know","on","it","head","."],"lemmas":["Loserville","follow","a","dorky","high","school","outcast","name","Chuck","as","he","navigate","the","wild","and","confusing","day","of","he","senior","year",".","Chuck","must","face","the","challenge","that","he","and","friend","be","grow","apart",";","that","he","mother","have","decide","to","date","a","much","younger","man","who","just","happen","to","be","the","school","'s","gym","teacher",";","and","that","he","dream","girl","the","brilliant",",","beautiful","and","popular","Melissa","Mercer","barely","acknowledge","he","existence",".","he","plan","to","capture","Melissa","'s","heart","once","and","for","all","by","befriend","she","younger","sister",",","Mary",",","be","complicate","by","the","fact","that","a","viral","video","of","Mary","be","the","talk","of","the","school",".","feature","a","ensemble","of","funny",",","flawed",",","and","lovable","character","who","collide","in","a","romantic",",","comic","cocktail","that","turn","every","teen","stereotype","you","think","you","know","on","its","head","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Loserville follows a","follows a dorky","a dorky high","dorky high school","high school outcast","school outcast named","outcast named Chuck","named Chuck as","Chuck as he","as he navigates","he navigates the","navigates the wild","the wild and","wild and confusing","and confusing days","confusing days of","days of his","of his senior","his senior year","Chuck must face","must face the","face the challenges","the challenges that","challenges that he","that he and","he and friends","and friends are","friends are growing","are growing apart","growing apart ;","apart ;

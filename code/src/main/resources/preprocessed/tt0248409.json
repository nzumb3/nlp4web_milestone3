{"title":"No More School","plot":"The last three weeks of school life have begun: After the Abitur, Germany's leaving certificate, the friends and schoolmates of Gymnasium Kerkheim (Kerkheim High) will not see each other again so soon. It is a hard time for Markus and his girl Sandra from a lower grade, as he wants to hang out with his old friends, whereas she wants him to be there for her. It's an even harder time for Dirk, who is to be expelled from school if he fails the math exam that is coming up around midday, and it is the hardest time for Michael, who is a perfect pupil, but has no fun in life at all - and doesn't even know it yet. When Steven calls out a party to celebrate his letter of exemption from the army, they all get together for one of the last real cool events ever.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["The","last","three","week","of","school","life","have","begun",":","After","the","Abitur",",","Germani","'s","leav","certif",",","the","friend","and","schoolmat","of","Gymnasium","Kerkheim","(","Kerkheim","High",")","will","not","see","each","other","again","so","soon",".","It","is","a","hard","time","for","Markus","and","his","girl","Sandra","from","a","lower","grade",",","as","he","want","to","hang","out","with","his","old","friend",",","wherea","she","want","him","to","be","there","for","her",".","It","'s","an","even","harder","time","for","Dirk",",","who","is","to","be","expel","from","school","if","he","fail","the","math","exam","that","is","come","up","around","midday",",","and","it","is","the","hardest","time","for","Michael",",","who","is","a","perfect","pupil",",","but","has","no","fun","in","life","at","all","-","and","doe","n't","even","know","it","yet",".","When","Steven","call","out","a","parti","to","celebr","his","letter","of","exempt","from","the","armi",",","they","all","get","togeth","for","one","of","the","last","real","cool","event","ever","."],"lemmas":["the","last","three","week","of","school","life","have","begin",":","after","the","Abitur",",","Germany","'s","leave","certificate",",","the","friend","and","schoolmate","of","Gymnasium","Kerkheim","-lrb-","Kerkheim","High","-rrb-","will","not","see","each","other","again","so","soon",".","it","be","a","hard","time","for","Markus","and","he","girl","Sandra","from","a","lower","grade",",","as","he","want","to","hang","out","with","he","old","friend",",","whereas","she","want","he","to","be","there","for","she",".","it","be","a","even","harder","time","for","Dirk",",","who","be","to","be","expel","from","school","if","he","fail","the","math","exam","that","be","come","up","around","midday",",","and","it","be","the","hardest","time","for","Michael",",","who","be","a","perfect","pupil",",","but","have","no","fun","in","life","at","all","-","and","do","not","even","know","it","yet",".","when","Steven","call","out","a","party","to","celebrate","he","letter","of","exemption","from","the","army",",","they","all","get","together","for","one","of","the","last","real","cool","event","ever","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The last three","last three weeks","three weeks of","weeks of school","of school life","school life have","life have begun","have begun :","begun : After",": After the","After the Abitur","the Abitur ,","Abitur , Germany",", Germany 's","Germany 's leaving","'s leaving certificate","leaving certificate ,","certificate , the",", the friends","the friends and","friends and schoolmates","and schoolmates of","schoolmates of Gymnasium","of Gymnasium Kerkheim","Gymnasium Kerkheim (","Kerkheim ( Kerkheim","( Kerkheim High","Kerkheim High )","High ) will",") will not","will not see","not see each","see each other","each other again","other again so","again so soon","It is a","is a hard","a hard time","hard time for","time for Markus","for Markus and","Markus and his","and his girl","his girl Sandra","girl Sandra from","Sandra from a","from a lower","a lower grade","lower grade ,","grade , as",", as he","as he wants","he wants to","wants to hang","to hang out","hang out with","out with his","with his old","his old friends","old friends ,","friends , whereas",", whereas she","whereas she wants","she wants him","wants him to","him to be","to be there","be there for","there for her","It 's an","'s an even","an even harder","even harder time","harder time for","time for Dirk","for Dirk ,","Dirk , who",", who is","who is to","is to be","to be expelled","be expelled from","expelled from school","from school if","school if he","if he fails","he fails the","fails the math","the math exam","math exam that","exam that is","that is coming","is coming up","coming up around","up around midday","around midday ,","midday , and",", and it","and it is","it is the","is the hardest","the hardest time","hardest time for","time for Michael","for Michael ,","Michael , who",", who is","who is a","is a perfect","a perfect pupil","perfect pupil ,","pupil , but",", but has","but has no","has no fun","no fun in","fun in life","in life at","life at all","at all -","all -

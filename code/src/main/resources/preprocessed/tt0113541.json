{"title":"Kids of the Round Table","plot":"Eleven-year-old Alex and his fellow homemade heroes are having a backyard blast. Battles rage, knights fight and damsels distress in a cardboard Camelot of dirt-bike steeds, aluminum foil sabres and plastic armor. The summer fun and fantasy soon become a marvelous, mystical reality with the touch of a sword. Malcolm McDowell, Michael Ironside and bright newcomer Johnny Morina star in a modern-day adventure filled with medieval magic. One fateful afternoon, Alex comes across a sword sunk in stone - King Arthur's legendary Excalibur! The sword holds untold powers of strength, magic and wisdom. With one motion, Alex frees the sword, Merlin the Magician appears, and Alex discovers the awesome power he'd always dreamed about. But to misuse Excalibur is to lose Excalibur... as Alex soon discovers. Now with Merlin vanished, Alex must prove himself worthy of the sword to bring back the magic. He'd better act fast - his friends need his power now more than ever!","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Comedy"],"stems":["Eleven-year-old","Alex","and","his","fellow","homemad","hero","are","have","a","backyard","blast",".","Battl","rage",",","knight","fight","and","damsel","distress","in","a","cardboard","Camelot","of","dirt-bik","steed",",","aluminum","foil","sabr","and","plastic","armor",".","The","summer","fun","and","fantasi","soon","becom","a","marvel",",","mystic","realiti","with","the","touch","of","a","sword",".","Malcolm","McDowel",",","Michael","Ironsid","and","bright","newcom","Johnni","Morina","star","in","a","modern-day","adventur","fill","with","mediev","magic",".","One","fate","afternoon",",","Alex","come","across","a","sword","sunk","in","stone","-","King","Arthur","'s","legendari","Excalibur","!","The","sword","hold","untold","power","of","strength",",","magic","and","wisdom",".","With","one","motion",",","Alex","free","the","sword",",","Merlin","the","Magician","appear",",","and","Alex","discov","the","awesom","power","he","'d","alway","dream","about",".","But","to","misus","Excalibur","is","to","lose","Excalibur","...","as","Alex","soon","discov",".","Now","with","Merlin","vanish",",","Alex","must","prove","himself","worthi","of","the","sword","to","bring","back","the","magic",".","He","'d","better","act","fast","-","his","friend","need","his","power","now","more","than","ever","!"],"lemmas":["eleven-year-old","Alex","and","he","fellow","homemade","hero","be","have","a","backyard","blast",".","battle","rage",",","knight","fight","and","damsel","distress","in","a","cardboard","camelot","of","dirt-bike","steed",",","aluminum","foil","sabre","and","plastic","armor",".","the","summer","fun","and","fantasy","soon","become","a","marvelous",",","mystical","reality","with","the","touch","of","a","sword",".","Malcolm","McDowell",",","Michael","Ironside","and","bright","newcomer","Johnny","Morina","star","in","a","modern-day","adventure","fill","with","medieval","magic",".","one","fateful","afternoon",",","Alex","come","across","a","sword","sink","in","stone","-","King","Arthur","'s","legendary","Excalibur","!","the","sword","hold","untold","power","of","strength",",","magic","and","wisdom",".","with","one","motion",",","Alex","free","the","sword",",","Merlin","the","magician","appear",",","and","Alex","discover","the","awesome","power","he","would","always","dream","about",".","but","to","misuse","Excalibur","be","to","lose","Excalibur","...","as","Alex","soon","discover",".","now","with","Merlin","vanish",",","Alex","must","prove","himself","worthy","of","the","sword","to","bring","back","the","magic",".","he","would","better","act","fast","-","he","friend","need","he","power","now","more","than","ever","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Eleven-year-old Alex and","Alex and his","and his fellow","his fellow homemade","fellow homemade heroes","homemade heroes are","heroes are having","are having a","having a backyard","a backyard blast","Battles rage ,","rage , knights",", knights fight","knights fight and","fight and damsels","and damsels distress","damsels distress in","distress in a","in a cardboard","a cardboard Camelot","cardboard Camelot of","Camelot of dirt-bike","of dirt-bike steeds","dirt-bike steeds ,","steeds , aluminum",", aluminum foil","aluminum foil sabres","foil sabres and","sabres and plastic","and plastic armor","The summer fun","summer fun and","fun and fantasy","and fantasy soon","fantasy soon become","soon become a","become a marvelous","a marvelous ,","marvelous , mystical",", mystical reality","mystical reality with","reality with the","with the touch","the touch of","touch of a","of a sword","Malcolm McDowell ,","McDowell , Michael",", Michael Ironside","Michael Ironside and","Ironside and bright","and bright newcomer","bright newcomer Johnny","newcomer Johnny Morina","Johnny Morina star","Morina star in","star in a","in a modern-day","a modern-day adventure","modern-day adventure filled","adventure filled with","filled with medieval","with medieval magic","One fateful afternoon","fateful afternoon ,","afternoon , Alex",", Alex comes","Alex comes across","comes across a","across a sword","a sword sunk","sword sunk in","sunk in stone","in stone -","stone -

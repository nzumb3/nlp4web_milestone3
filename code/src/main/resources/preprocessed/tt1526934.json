{"title":"L'Italia del nostro scontento","plot":"Green, White, Red: three colors for three chapters, each touching a strand of contemporary Italian life. In the first on the environment, Elisa Fuksas recounts the scourge of uncontrolled building that continues to ruin the countryside without any qualms for aesthetics. In the second chapter on young people, Lucrezia Le Moli debunks many commonly held views and caricatures usually used to describe an entire generation. In the final part, Francesca Muci paints a lucid, sincere, impartial and revelatory picture of the Italians' perception of politics. Three small yet great investigations pervaded with a disconcerting wisdom and a mature, competent sense of the cinema of the real.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Green",",","White",",","Red",":","three","color","for","three","chapter",",","each","touch","a","strand","of","contemporari","Italian","life",".","In","the","first","on","the","environ",",","Elisa","Fuksa","recount","the","scourg","of","uncontrol","build","that","continu","to","ruin","the","countrysid","without","ani","qualm","for","aesthet",".","In","the","second","chapter","on","young","peopl",",","Lucrezia","Le","Moli","debunk","mani","common","held","view","and","caricatur","usual","use","to","describ","an","entir","generat",".","In","the","final","part",",","Francesca","Muci","paint","a","lucid",",","sincer",",","imparti","and","revelatori","pictur","of","the","Italian","'","percept","of","polit",".","Three","small","yet","great","investig","pervad","with","a","disconcert","wisdom","and","a","matur",",","compet","sens","of","the","cinema","of","the","real","."],"lemmas":["Green",",","White",",","Red",":","three","color","for","three","chapter",",","each","touch","a","strand","of","contemporary","italian","life",".","in","the","first","on","the","environment",",","Elisa","Fuksas","recount","the","scourge","of","uncontrolled","building","that","continue","to","ruin","the","countryside","without","any","qualm","for","aesthetics",".","in","the","second","chapter","on","young","people",",","Lucrezia","Le","Moli","debunk","many","commonly","hold","view","and","caricature","usually","use","to","describe","a","entire","generation",".","in","the","final","part",",","Francesca","Muci","paint","a","lucid",",","sincere",",","impartial","and","revelatory","picture","of","the","Italians","'","perception","of","politics",".","three","small","yet","great","investigation","pervade","with","a","disconcerting","wisdom","and","a","mature",",","competent","sense","of","the","cinema","of","the","real","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Green

{"title":"Little by Little","plot":"Kicked out of a family at 12, Eliza was left with little choice. Living on the streets and trading her body for protection, Pili had little options. Shuffled from house to house at three, Zai was too little to have a say in her fate. But there's a Tanzanian saying. Little by little; a little becomes a lot. Little by little, these girls find family, hope, and a future. But is it enough to heal their battered pasts? Is there room for another girl, abandoned and neglected? And can she survive long enough to join them?","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Kick","out","of","a","famili","at","12",",","Eliza","was","left","with","littl","choic",".","Live","on","the","street","and","trade","her","bodi","for","protect",",","Pili","had","littl","option",".","Shuffl","from","hous","to","hous","at","three",",","Zai","was","too","littl","to","have","a","say","in","her","fate",".","But","there","'s","a","Tanzanian","say",".","Littl","by","littl",";","a","littl","becom","a","lot",".","Littl","by","littl",",","these","girl","find","famili",",","hope",",","and","a","futur",".","But","is","it","enough","to","heal","their","batter","past","?","Is","there","room","for","anoth","girl",",","abandon","and","neglect","?","And","can","she","surviv","long","enough","to","join","them","?"],"lemmas":["kick","out","of","a","family","at","12",",","Eliza","be","leave","with","little","choice",".","live","on","the","street","and","trade","she","body","for","protection",",","pilus","have","little","option",".","shuffle","from","house","to","house","at","three",",","Zai","be","too","little","to","have","a","say","in","she","fate",".","but","there","be","a","tanzanian","saying",".","little","by","little",";","a","little","become","a","lot",".","little","by","little",",","these","girl","find","family",",","hope",",","and","a","future",".","but","be","it","enough","to","heal","they","battered","past","?","be","there","room","for","another","girl",",","abandon","and","neglect","?","and","can","she","survive","long","enough","to","join","they","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kicked out of","out of a","of a family","a family at","family at 12","at 12 ,","12 , Eliza",", Eliza was","Eliza was left","was left with","left with little","with little choice","Living on the","on the streets","the streets and","streets and trading","and trading her","trading her body","her body for","body for protection","for protection ,","protection , Pili",", Pili had","Pili had little","had little options","Shuffled from house","from house to","house to house","to house at","house at three","at three ,","three , Zai",", Zai was","Zai was too","was too little","too little to","little to have","to have a","have a say","a say in","say in her","in her fate","But there 's","there 's a","'s a Tanzanian","a Tanzanian saying","Little by little","by little ;","little ; a","; a little","a little becomes","little becomes a","becomes a lot","Little by little","by little ,","little , these",", these girls","these girls find","girls find family","find family ,","family , hope",", hope ,","hope , and",", and a","and a future","But is it","is it enough","it enough to","enough to heal","to heal their","heal their battered","their battered pasts","Is there room","there room for","room for another","for another girl","another girl ,","girl , abandoned",", abandoned and","abandoned and neglected","And can she","can she survive","she survive long","survive long enough","long enough to","enough to join","to join them"],"2grams":["Kicked out","out of","of a","a family","family at","at 12","12 ,",", Eliza","Eliza was","was left","left with","with little","little choice","Living on","on the","the streets","streets and","and trading","trading her","her body","body for","for protection","protection ,",", Pili","Pili had","had little","little options","Shuffled from","from house","house to","to house","house at","at three","three ,",", Zai","Zai was","was too","too little","little to","to have","have a","a say","say in","in her","her fate","But there","there 's","'s a","a Tanzanian","Tanzanian saying","Little by","by little","little ;","; a","a little","little becomes","becomes a","a lot","Little by","by little","little ,",", these","these girls","girls find","find family","family ,",", hope","hope ,",", and","and a","a future","But is","is it","it enough","enough to","to heal","heal their","their battered","battered pasts","Is there","there room","room for","for another","another girl","girl ,",", abandoned","abandoned and","and neglected","And can","can she","she survive","survive long","long enough","enough to","to join","join them"]}

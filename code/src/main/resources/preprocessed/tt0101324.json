{"title":"American Friends","plot":"Francis Ashby, a senior Oxford don on holiday alone in the Alps, meets holidaying American Caroline and her companion Elinor, the blossoming Irish-American girl she adopted many years before. Ashby finds he enjoys their company, particularly that of Elinor, and both the women are drawn to him. Back at Oxford he is nevertheless taken aback when they arrive unannounced. Women are not allowed in the College grounds, let alone the rooms. Indeed any liaison, however innocent, is frowned on by the upstanding Fellows.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Franci","Ashbi",",","a","senior","Oxford","don","on","holiday","alon","in","the","Alps",",","meet","holiday","American","Carolin","and","her","companion","Elinor",",","the","blossom","Irish-American","girl","she","adopt","mani","year","befor",".","Ashbi","find","he","enjoy","their","compani",",","particular","that","of","Elinor",",","and","both","the","women","are","drawn","to","him",".","Back","at","Oxford","he","is","nevertheless","taken","aback","when","they","arriv","unannounc",".","Women","are","not","allow","in","the","Colleg","ground",",","let","alon","the","room",".","Indeed","ani","liaison",",","howev","innoc",",","is","frown","on","by","the","upstand","Fellow","."],"lemmas":["Francis","Ashby",",","a","senior","Oxford","don","on","holiday","alone","in","the","Alps",",","meet","holiday","American","Caroline","and","she","companion","Elinor",",","the","blossom","irish-american","girl","she","adopt","many","year","before",".","Ashby","find","he","enjoy","they","company",",","particularly","that","of","Elinor",",","and","both","the","woman","be","draw","to","he",".","back","at","Oxford","he","be","nevertheless","take","aback","when","they","arrive","unannounced",".","woman","be","not","allow","in","the","College","grounds",",","let","alone","the","room",".","indeed","any","liaison",",","however","innocent",",","be","frown","on","by","the","upstand","fellow","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Francis Ashby ,","Ashby , a",", a senior","a senior Oxford","senior Oxford don","Oxford don on","don on holiday","on holiday alone","holiday alone in","alone in the","in the Alps","the Alps ,","Alps , meets",", meets holidaying","meets holidaying American","holidaying American Caroline","American Caroline and","Caroline and her","and her companion","her companion Elinor","companion Elinor ,","Elinor , the",", the blossoming","the blossoming Irish-American","blossoming Irish-American girl","Irish-American girl she","girl she adopted","she adopted many","adopted many years","many years before","Ashby finds he","finds he enjoys","he enjoys their","enjoys their company","their company ,","company , particularly",", particularly that","particularly that of","that of Elinor","of Elinor ,","Elinor , and",", and both","and both the","both the women","the women are","women are drawn","are drawn to","drawn to him","Back at Oxford","at Oxford he","Oxford he is","he is nevertheless","is nevertheless taken","nevertheless taken aback","taken aback when","aback when they","when they arrive","they arrive unannounced","Women are not","are not allowed","not allowed in","allowed in the","in the College","the College grounds","College grounds ,","grounds , let",", let alone","let alone the","alone the rooms","Indeed any liaison","any liaison ,","liaison , however",", however innocent","however innocent ,","innocent , is",", is frowned","is frowned on","frowned on by","on by the","by the upstanding","the upstanding Fellows"],"2grams":["Francis Ashby","Ashby ,",", a","a senior","senior Oxford","Oxford don","don on","on holiday","holiday alone","alone in","in the","the Alps","Alps ,",", meets","meets holidaying","holidaying American","American Caroline","Caroline and","and her","her companion","companion Elinor","Elinor ,",", the","the blossoming","blossoming Irish-American","Irish-American girl","girl she","she adopted","adopted many","many years","years before","Ashby finds","finds he","he enjoys","enjoys their","their company","company ,",", particularly","particularly that","that of","of Elinor","Elinor ,",", and","and both","both the","the women","women are","are drawn","drawn to","to him","Back at","at Oxford","Oxford he","he is","is nevertheless","nevertheless taken","taken aback","aback when","when they","they arrive","arrive unannounced","Women are","are not","not allowed","allowed in","in the","the College","College grounds","grounds ,",", let","let alone","alone the","the rooms","Indeed any","any liaison","liaison ,",", however","however innocent","innocent ,",", is","is frowned","frowned on","on by","by the","the upstanding","upstanding Fellows"]}

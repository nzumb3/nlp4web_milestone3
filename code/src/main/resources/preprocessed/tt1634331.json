{"title":"Jatra: Hyalagaad Re Tyalagaad","plot":"After getting their Mumbai-based underworld boss, Ramdas Mali, is arrested for attempting to abduct Mumbai's DCP Madhav Sakharkhande, Mohan, Siddhu, and their 3 slacker buddies. He is unable to pay rent to their landlord, Shiva Kanhole, and decides to take to crime after watching 'Dhoom', and 'Hera Pheri'. Both capers comically fail, and the duo end up stealing a car, which stalls just about 100 kilometers from Sholapur. Before they could get there, both get abducted by rival residents of Hyalagaad and Tyalagaad, and must compete in the 100th Bhagwan Shri Bhairavnath Jatra - and as per past tradition and custom - only one of them can survive this fierce competition.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["After","get","their","Mumbai-bas","underworld","boss",",","Ramda","Mali",",","is","arrest","for","attempt","to","abduct","Mumbai","'s","DCP","Madhav","Sakharkhand",",","Mohan",",","Siddhu",",","and","their","3","slacker","buddi",".","He","is","unabl","to","pay","rent","to","their","landlord",",","Shiva","Kanhol",",","and","decid","to","take","to","crime","after","watch","'","Dhoom","'",",","and","'","Hera","Pheri","'",".","Both","caper","comic","fail",",","and","the","duo","end","up","steal","a","car",",","which","stall","just","about","100","kilomet","from","Sholapur",".","Befor","they","could","get","there",",","both","get","abduct","by","rival","resid","of","Hyalagaad","and","Tyalagaad",",","and","must","compet","in","the","100th","Bhagwan","Shri","Bhairavnath","Jatra","-","and","as","per","past","tradit","and","custom","-","onli","one","of","them","can","surviv","this","fierc","competit","."],"lemmas":["after","get","they","mumbai-based","underworld","boss",",","Ramdas","Mali",",","be","arrest","for","attempt","to","abduct","Mumbai","'s","DCP","Madhav","Sakharkhande",",","Mohan",",","Siddhu",",","and","they","3","slacker","buddy",".","he","be","unable","to","pay","rent","to","they","landlord",",","shiva","kanhole",",","and","decide","to","take","to","crime","after","watch","'","Dhoom","'",",","and","'","Hera","Pheri","'",".","both","caper","comically","fail",",","and","the","duo","end","up","steal","a","car",",","which","stall","just","about","100","kilometer","from","Sholapur",".","before","they","could","get","there",",","both","get","abducted","by","rival","resident","of","Hyalagaad","and","Tyalagaad",",","and","must","compete","in","the","100th","Bhagwan","Shri","Bhairavnath","Jatra","-","and","as","per","past","tradition","and","custom","-","only","one","of","they","can","survive","this","fierce","competition","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["After getting their","getting their Mumbai-based","their Mumbai-based underworld","Mumbai-based underworld boss","underworld boss ,","boss , Ramdas",", Ramdas Mali","Ramdas Mali ,","Mali , is",", is arrested","is arrested for","arrested for attempting","for attempting to","attempting to abduct","to abduct Mumbai","abduct Mumbai 's","Mumbai 's DCP","'s DCP Madhav","DCP Madhav Sakharkhande","Madhav Sakharkhande ,","Sakharkhande , Mohan",", Mohan ,","Mohan , Siddhu",", Siddhu ,","Siddhu , and",", and their","and their 3","their 3 slacker","3 slacker buddies","He is unable","is unable to","unable to pay","to pay rent","pay rent to","rent to their","to their landlord","their landlord ,","landlord , Shiva",", Shiva Kanhole","Shiva Kanhole ,","Kanhole , and",", and decides","and decides to","decides to take","to take to","take to crime","to crime after","crime after watching","after watching '","watching ' Dhoom","' Dhoom '","Dhoom ' ,","' , and",", and '","and ' Hera","' Hera Pheri","Hera Pheri '","Both capers comically","capers comically fail","comically fail ,","fail , and",", and the","and the duo","the duo end","duo end up","end up stealing","up stealing a","stealing a car","a car ,","car , which",", which stalls","which stalls just","stalls just about","just about 100","about 100 kilometers","100 kilometers from","kilometers from Sholapur","Before they could","they could get","could get there","get there ,","there , both",", both get","both get abducted","get abducted by","abducted by rival","by rival residents","rival residents of","residents of Hyalagaad","of Hyalagaad and","Hyalagaad and Tyalagaad","and Tyalagaad ,","Tyalagaad , and",", and must","and must compete","must compete in","compete in the","in the 100th","the 100th Bhagwan","100th Bhagwan Shri","Bhagwan Shri Bhairavnath","Shri Bhairavnath Jatra","Bhairavnath Jatra -","Jatra -

{"title":"Intensivstation","plot":"The film INTENSIVE CARE depicts the everyday work of doctors and nurses at a Berlin ICU. It allows an insight into the mental and emotional challenges the staff is facing on a daily basis, dealing with decisions that have far reaching consequences for their patients. Often it is the staff of the intensive care unit - the doctors and nurses - that are confronted with difficult ethical questions that their patients haven't yet had to consider. Questions with no easy answers. How do we want to die, and how do we want to live?","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["The","film","INTENSIVE","CARE","depict","the","everyday","work","of","doctor","and","nurs","at","a","Berlin","ICU",".","It","allow","an","insight","into","the","mental","and","emot","challeng","the","staff","is","face","on","a","daili","basi",",","deal","with","decis","that","have","far","reach","consequ","for","their","patient",".","Often","it","is","the","staff","of","the","intens","care","unit","-","the","doctor","and","nurs","-","that","are","confront","with","difficult","ethic","question","that","their","patient","have","n't","yet","had","to","consid",".","Question","with","no","easi","answer",".","How","do","we","want","to","die",",","and","how","do","we","want","to","live","?"],"lemmas":["the","film","intensive","CARE","depict","the","everyday","work","of","doctor","and","nurse","at","a","Berlin","ICU",".","it","allow","a","insight","into","the","mental","and","emotional","challenge","the","staff","be","face","on","a","daily","basis",",","deal","with","decision","that","have","far","reach","consequence","for","they","patient",".","often","it","be","the","staff","of","the","intensive","care","unit","-","the","doctor","and","nurse","-","that","be","confront","with","difficult","ethical","question","that","they","patient","have","not","yet","have","to","consider",".","question","with","no","easy","answer",".","how","do","we","want","to","die",",","and","how","do","we","want","to","live","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film INTENSIVE","film INTENSIVE CARE","INTENSIVE CARE depicts","CARE depicts the","depicts the everyday","the everyday work","everyday work of","work of doctors","of doctors and","doctors and nurses","and nurses at","nurses at a","at a Berlin","a Berlin ICU","It allows an","allows an insight","an insight into","insight into the","into the mental","the mental and","mental and emotional","and emotional challenges","emotional challenges the","challenges the staff","the staff is","staff is facing","is facing on","facing on a","on a daily","a daily basis","daily basis ,","basis , dealing",", dealing with","dealing with decisions","with decisions that","decisions that have","that have far","have far reaching","far reaching consequences","reaching consequences for","consequences for their","for their patients","Often it is","it is the","is the staff","the staff of","staff of the","of the intensive","the intensive care","intensive care unit","care unit -","unit - the","- the doctors","the doctors and","doctors and nurses","and nurses -","nurses - that","- that are","that are confronted","are confronted with","confronted with difficult","with difficult ethical","difficult ethical questions","ethical questions that","questions that their","that their patients","their patients have","patients have n't","have n't yet","n't yet had","yet had to","had to consider","Questions with no","with no easy","no easy answers","How do we","do we want","we want to","want to die","to die ,","die , and",", and how","and how do","how do we","do we want","we want to","want to live"],"2grams":["The film","film INTENSIVE","INTENSIVE CARE","CARE depicts","depicts the","the everyday","everyday work","work of","of doctors","doctors and","and nurses","nurses at","at a","a Berlin","Berlin ICU","It allows","allows an","an insight","insight into","into the","the mental","mental and","and emotional","emotional challenges","challenges the","the staff","staff is","is facing","facing on","on a","a daily","daily basis","basis ,",", dealing","dealing with","with decisions","decisions that","that have","have far","far reaching","reaching consequences","consequences for","for their","their patients","Often it","it is","is the","the staff","staff of","of the","the intensive","intensive care","care unit","unit -","- the","the doctors","doctors and","and nurses","nurses -","- that","that are","are confronted","confronted with","with difficult","difficult ethical","ethical questions","questions that","that their","their patients","patients have","have n't","n't yet","yet had","had to","to consider","Questions with","with no","no easy","easy answers","How do","do we","we want","want to","to die","die ,",", and","and how","how do","do we","we want","want to","to live"]}

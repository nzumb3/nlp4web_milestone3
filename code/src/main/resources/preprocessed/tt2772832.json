{"title":"@home","plot":"Telling the remarkable story of one man's fierce commitment to make the homeless visible. It's why he started InvisiblePeople.TV, a nonprofit that uses social media to document what it's like to be homeless in America, turning common stereotypes of the homeless upside-down. Mark has posted hundreds of raw, unedited video testimonials from the homeless - and these stories have reached millions of people online. He has become the web voice of this cause; his network has given voice to thousands of homeless men and women, and advocacy organizations are taking notice. Few people will share the same dedication Mark shows to eradicating homelessness - because not all of us have been there. But we can learn to step out of our comfort zones and see homeless people for who they really are - our friends, our family, and our neighbors. We can educate ourselves about this issue, and work to end homelessness in our communities. Mark dares us to care as he exposes America's broken safety net, and what its failure means for all of us.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Tell","the","remark","stori","of","one","man","'s","fierc","commit","to","make","the","homeless","visibl",".","It","'s","whi","he","start","InvisiblePeople.TV",",","a","nonprofit","that","use","social","media","to","document","what","it","'s","like","to","be","homeless","in","America",",","turn","common","stereotyp","of","the","homeless","upside-down",".","Mark","has","post","hundr","of","raw",",","unedit","video","testimoni","from","the","homeless","-","and","these","stori","have","reach","million","of","peopl","onlin",".","He","has","becom","the","web","voic","of","this","caus",";","his","network","has","given","voic","to","thousand","of","homeless","men","and","women",",","and","advocaci","organ","are","take","notic",".","Few","peopl","will","share","the","same","dedic","Mark","show","to","erad","homeless","-","becaus","not","all","of","us","have","been","there",".","But","we","can","learn","to","step","out","of","our","comfort","zone","and","see","homeless","peopl","for","who","they","realli","are","-","our","friend",",","our","famili",",","and","our","neighbor",".","We","can","educ","ourselv","about","this","issu",",","and","work","to","end","homeless","in","our","communiti",".","Mark","dare","us","to","care","as","he","expos","America","'s","broken","safeti","net",",","and","what","it","failur","mean","for","all","of","us","."],"lemmas":["tell","the","remarkable","story","of","one","man","'s","fierce","commitment","to","make","the","homeless","visible",".","it","be","why","he","start","InvisiblePeople.TV",",","a","nonprofit","that","use","social","media","to","document","what","it","be","like","to","be","homeless","in","America",",","turn","common","stereotype","of","the","homeless","upside-down",".","Mark","have","post","hundred","of","raw",",","unedited","video","testimonial","from","the","homeless","-","and","these","story","have","reach","million","of","people","online",".","he","have","become","the","web","voice","of","this","cause",";","he","network","have","give","voice","to","thousand","of","homeless","man","and","woman",",","and","advocacy","organization","be","take","notice",".","few","people","will","share","the","same","dedication","Mark","show","to","eradicate","homelessness","-","because","not","all","of","we","have","be","there",".","but","we","can","learn","to","step","out","of","we","comfort","zone","and","see","homeless","people","for","who","they","really","be","-","we","friend",",","we","family",",","and","we","neighbor",".","we","can","educate","ourselves","about","this","issue",",","and","work","to","end","homelessness","in","we","community",".","Mark","dare","we","to","care","as","he","expose","America","'s","broken","safety","net",",","and","what","its","failure","mean","for","all","of","we","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Telling the remarkable","the remarkable story","remarkable story of","story of one","of one man","one man 's","man 's fierce","'s fierce commitment","fierce commitment to","commitment to make","to make the","make the homeless","the homeless visible","It 's why","'s why he","why he started","he started InvisiblePeople.TV","started InvisiblePeople.TV ,","InvisiblePeople.TV , a",", a nonprofit","a nonprofit that","nonprofit that uses","that uses social","uses social media","social media to","media to document","to document what","document what it","what it 's","it 's like","'s like to","like to be","to be homeless","be homeless in","homeless in America","in America ,","America , turning",", turning common","turning common stereotypes","common stereotypes of","stereotypes of the","of the homeless","the homeless upside-down","Mark has posted","has posted hundreds","posted hundreds of","hundreds of raw","of raw ,","raw , unedited",", unedited video","unedited video testimonials","video testimonials from","testimonials from the","from the homeless","the homeless -","homeless - and","- and these","and these stories","these stories have","stories have reached","have reached millions","reached millions of","millions of people","of people online","He has become","has become the","become the web","the web voice","web voice of","voice of this","of this cause","this cause ;","cause ;

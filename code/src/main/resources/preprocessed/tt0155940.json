{"title":"Palmer's Pick-Up","plot":"Two dimwit owners (Robert Carradine, Richard Hillman) of a struggling hauling company are approached about hauling a huge, mysterious box across country at the end of the century. The cargo has religious significance and may be an attempt to release Satan in the Devil's Triangle to start the next century. En route, many step out to try to stop their delivery including Patrick Kilpatrick as a gay ex-con, Talia Shire playing in drag, Morton Downey, Jr. as a tv celebrity, and Rosanna Arquette as a gun-toting sexpot.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Two","dimwit","owner","(","Robert","Carradin",",","Richard","Hillman",")","of","a","struggl","haul","compani","are","approach","about","haul","a","huge",",","mysteri","box","across","countri","at","the","end","of","the","centuri",".","The","cargo","has","religi","signific","and","may","be","an","attempt","to","releas","Satan","in","the","Devil","'s","Triangl","to","start","the","next","centuri",".","En","rout",",","mani","step","out","to","tri","to","stop","their","deliveri","includ","Patrick","Kilpatrick","as","a","gay","ex-con",",","Talia","Shire","play","in","drag",",","Morton","Downey",",","Jr.","as","a","tv","celebr",",","and","Rosanna","Arquett","as","a","gun-tot","sexpot","."],"lemmas":["two","dimwit","owner","-lrb-","Robert","Carradine",",","Richard","Hillman","-rrb-","of","a","struggling","haul","company","be","approach","about","haul","a","huge",",","mysterious","box","across","country","at","the","end","of","the","century",".","the","cargo","have","religious","significance","and","may","be","a","attempt","to","release","Satan","in","the","Devil","'s","Triangle","to","start","the","next","century",".","en","route",",","many","step","out","to","try","to","stop","they","delivery","include","Patrick","Kilpatrick","as","a","gay","ex-con",",","talia","shire","playing","in","drag",",","Morton","Downey",",","Jr.","as","a","tv","celebrity",",","and","Rosanna","Arquette","as","a","gun-toting","sexpot","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two dimwit owners","dimwit owners (","owners ( Robert","( Robert Carradine","Robert Carradine ,","Carradine , Richard",", Richard Hillman","Richard Hillman )","Hillman ) of",") of a","of a struggling","a struggling hauling","struggling hauling company","hauling company are","company are approached","are approached about","approached about hauling","about hauling a","hauling a huge","a huge ,","huge , mysterious",", mysterious box","mysterious box across","box across country","across country at","country at the","at the end","the end of","end of the","of the century","The cargo has","cargo has religious","has religious significance","religious significance and","significance and may","and may be","may be an","be an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to release","to release Satan","release Satan in","Satan in the","in the Devil","the Devil 's","Devil 's Triangle","'s Triangle to","Triangle to start","to start the","start the next","the next century","En route ,","route , many",", many step","many step out","step out to","out to try","to try to","try to stop","to stop their","stop their delivery","their delivery including","delivery including Patrick","including Patrick Kilpatrick","Patrick Kilpatrick as","Kilpatrick as a","as a gay","a gay ex-con","gay ex-con ,","ex-con , Talia",", Talia Shire","Talia Shire playing","Shire playing in","playing in drag","in drag ,","drag , Morton",", Morton Downey","Morton Downey ,","Downey , Jr.",", Jr. as","Jr. as a","as a tv","a tv celebrity","tv celebrity ,","celebrity , and",", and Rosanna","and Rosanna Arquette","Rosanna Arquette as","Arquette as a","as a gun-toting","a gun-toting sexpot"],"2grams":["Two dimwit","dimwit owners","owners (","( Robert","Robert Carradine","Carradine ,",", Richard","Richard Hillman","Hillman )",") of","of a","a struggling","struggling hauling","hauling company","company are","are approached","approached about","about hauling","hauling a","a huge","huge ,",", mysterious","mysterious box","box across","across country","country at","at the","the end","end of","of the","the century","The cargo","cargo has","has religious","religious significance","significance and","and may","may be","be an","an attempt","attempt to","to release","release Satan","Satan in","in the","the Devil","Devil 's","'s Triangle","Triangle to","to start","start the","the next","next century","En route","route ,",", many","many step","step out","out to","to try","try to","to stop","stop their","their delivery","delivery including","including Patrick","Patrick Kilpatrick","Kilpatrick as","as a","a gay","gay ex-con","ex-con ,",", Talia","Talia Shire","Shire playing","playing in","in drag","drag ,",", Morton","Morton Downey","Downey ,",", Jr.","Jr. as","as a","a tv","tv celebrity","celebrity ,",", and","and Rosanna","Rosanna Arquette","Arquette as","as a","a gun-toting","gun-toting sexpot"]}

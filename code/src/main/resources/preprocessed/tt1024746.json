{"title":"Jake's Corner","plot":"The fictional story of an ex-football star, Johnny Dunn, who moves far from the spotlight after a family tragedy to a small, desert town he owns called Jake's Corner. This dramatic comedy is a cross between Kramer vs. Kramer (1979) and Northern Exposure (1990). Set in the real town of Jake's Corner, Arizona, it is a rest stop for travelers making their way through the Arizona desert, but for the people who live there, it's a rest stop for life. Johnny and the eclectic ensemble that live and work in the town occupy trailers behind the Corner Store and Jake's Corner Bar. Through the years, this cast of misfits has become closer than most families - they are kin. The dynamic of the town is changed forever when Johnny's young nephew comes to live with him.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["The","fiction","stori","of","an","ex-footbal","star",",","Johnni","Dunn",",","who","move","far","from","the","spotlight","after","a","famili","tragedi","to","a","small",",","desert","town","he","own","call","Jake","'s","Corner",".","This","dramat","comedi","is","a","cross","between","Kramer","vs.","Kramer","(","1979",")","and","Northern","Exposur","(","1990",")",".","Set","in","the","real","town","of","Jake","'s","Corner",",","Arizona",",","it","is","a","rest","stop","for","travel","make","their","way","through","the","Arizona","desert",",","but","for","the","peopl","who","live","there",",","it","'s","a","rest","stop","for","life",".","Johnni","and","the","eclect","ensembl","that","live","and","work","in","the","town","occupi","trailer","behind","the","Corner","Store","and","Jake","'s","Corner","Bar",".","Through","the","year",",","this","cast","of","misfit","has","becom","closer","than","most","famili","-","they","are","kin",".","The","dynam","of","the","town","is","chang","forev","when","Johnni","'s","young","nephew","come","to","live","with","him","."],"lemmas":["the","fictional","story","of","a","ex-football","star",",","Johnny","Dunn",",","who","move","far","from","the","spotlight","after","a","family","tragedy","to","a","small",",","desert","town","he","own","call","Jake","'s","corner",".","this","dramatic","comedy","be","a","cross","between","Kramer","vs.","Kramer","-lrb-","1979","-rrb-","and","northern","exposure","-lrb-","1990","-rrb-",".","set","in","the","real","town","of","Jake","'s","corner",",","Arizona",",","it","be","a","rest","stop","for","traveler","make","they","way","through","the","Arizona","desert",",","but","for","the","people","who","live","there",",","it","be","a","rest","stop","for","life",".","Johnny","and","the","eclectic","ensemble","that","live","and","work","in","the","town","occupy","trailer","behind","the","corner","Store","and","Jake","'s","corner","bar",".","through","the","year",",","this","cast","of","misfit","have","become","closer","than","most","family","-","they","be","kin",".","the","dynamic","of","the","town","be","change","forever","when","Johnny","'s","young","nephew","come","to","live","with","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The fictional story","fictional story of","story of an","of an ex-football","an ex-football star","ex-football star ,","star , Johnny",", Johnny Dunn","Johnny Dunn ,","Dunn , who",", who moves","who moves far","moves far from","far from the","from the spotlight","the spotlight after","spotlight after a","after a family","a family tragedy","family tragedy to","tragedy to a","to a small","a small ,","small , desert",", desert town","desert town he","town he owns","he owns called","owns called Jake","called Jake 's","Jake 's Corner","This dramatic comedy","dramatic comedy is","comedy is a","is a cross","a cross between","cross between Kramer","between Kramer vs.","Kramer vs. Kramer","vs. Kramer (","Kramer ( 1979","( 1979 )","1979 ) and",") and Northern","and Northern Exposure","Northern Exposure (","Exposure ( 1990","( 1990 )","Set in the","in the real","the real town","real town of","town of Jake","of Jake 's","Jake 's Corner","'s Corner ,","Corner , Arizona",", Arizona ,","Arizona , it",", it is","it is a","is a rest","a rest stop","rest stop for","stop for travelers","for travelers making","travelers making their","making their way","their way through","way through the","through the Arizona","the Arizona desert","Arizona desert ,","desert , but",", but for","but for the","for the people","the people who","people who live","who live there","live there ,","there , it",", it 's","it 's a","'s a rest","a rest stop","rest stop for","stop for life","Johnny and the","and the eclectic","the eclectic ensemble","eclectic ensemble that","ensemble that live","that live and","live and work","and work in","work in the","in the town","the town occupy","town occupy trailers","occupy trailers behind","trailers behind the","behind the Corner","the Corner Store","Corner Store and","Store and Jake","and Jake 's","Jake 's Corner","'s Corner Bar","Through the years","the years ,","years , this",", this cast","this cast of","cast of misfits","of misfits has","misfits has become","has become closer","become closer than","closer than most","than most families","most families -","families -

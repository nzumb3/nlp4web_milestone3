{"title":"Paradise Garden","plot":"Howard Finster, the grandfather of the Southern Folk Art movement, was a pioneer that showed the world that Art can thrive outside of museums and galleries in ordinary places and in everyday objects. He took what others might deem trash or obsolete and turned it into something contemplative. He opened Paradise Garden for the world to enjoy, a true testament that Art comes to life, when people are able to interact with it. Howard Finster showed the world that objects surrounding us can take on a new life, in a sometimes magical way, and communicate messages that can lead to transformation.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Howard","Finster",",","the","grandfath","of","the","Southern","Folk","Art","movement",",","was","a","pioneer","that","show","the","world","that","Art","can","thrive","outsid","of","museum","and","galleri","in","ordinari","place","and","in","everyday","object",".","He","took","what","other","might","deem","trash","or","obsolet","and","turn","it","into","someth","contempl",".","He","open","Paradis","Garden","for","the","world","to","enjoy",",","a","true","testament","that","Art","come","to","life",",","when","peopl","are","abl","to","interact","with","it",".","Howard","Finster","show","the","world","that","object","surround","us","can","take","on","a","new","life",",","in","a","sometim","magic","way",",","and","communic","messag","that","can","lead","to","transform","."],"lemmas":["Howard","Finster",",","the","grandfather","of","the","southern","folk","art","movement",",","be","a","pioneer","that","show","the","world","that","Art","can","thrive","outside","of","museum","and","gallery","in","ordinary","place","and","in","everyday","object",".","he","take","what","other","might","deem","trash","or","obsolete","and","turn","it","into","something","contemplative",".","he","open","Paradise","Garden","for","the","world","to","enjoy",",","a","true","testament","that","Art","come","to","life",",","when","people","be","able","to","interact","with","it",".","Howard","Finster","show","the","world","that","object","surround","we","can","take","on","a","new","life",",","in","a","sometimes","magical","way",",","and","communicate","message","that","can","lead","to","transformation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Howard

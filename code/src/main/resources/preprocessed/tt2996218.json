{"title":"Passive House Revolution","plot":"48% of all CO2 generated and energy used in the US comes from buildings. Passive House: A Building Revolution explains this environmental challenge and opportunity. It shows that it is possible to reduce the primary energy used in buildings by 80-90%, as compared to the 15 to 35% goals currently set by Energy Star, LEED, and the National Association of Homebuilders' Green Building Program. It also introduces the importance of retrofitting our 116 million existing homes. The film describes a rapidly growing movement in Europe and the US aimed towards drastically reducing building energy consumption. It tells the story of America's super-insulated house movement of the 1970s, which led to the German Passiv Haus. Today there are more than 20,000 such buildings in Europe. The film showcase architects, builders and home owners from across the country who9 share their experience of building a Passive House or doing a deep-en3eryg retrofit.","genres":["Documentary","

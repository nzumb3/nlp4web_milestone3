{"title":"The Wolf Mountains","plot":"As night falls, an ethereal mist creeps over a forest cover as old as the world itself. The primeval howl of a wolf echoes across the mountains, followed by another and yet another wolf. Down in the valley, a wisent turns swiftly, a deer runs off a little and a beaver swims into its hiding place. Only a bear waits in anticipation of sponging off the prey of the wolf. This is the story about the rebirth of European wilderness, in which the wolf, the wisent, the bear and other rare animals live as freely as centuries ago.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["As","night","fall",",","an","ether","mist","creep","over","a","forest","cover","as","old","as","the","world","itself",".","The","primev","howl","of","a","wolf","echo","across","the","mountain",",","follow","by","anoth","and","yet","anoth","wolf",".","Down","in","the","valley",",","a","wisent","turn","swift",",","a","deer","run","off","a","littl","and","a","beaver","swim","into","it","hide","place",".","Onli","a","bear","wait","in","anticip","of","spong","off","the","prey","of","the","wolf",".","This","is","the","stori","about","the","rebirth","of","European","wilder",",","in","which","the","wolf",",","the","wisent",",","the","bear","and","other","rare","anim","live","as","freeli","as","centuri","ago","."],"lemmas":["as","night","fall",",","a","ethereal","mist","creep","over","a","forest","cover","as","old","as","the","world","itself",".","the","primeval","howl","of","a","wolf","echo","across","the","mountain",",","follow","by","another","and","yet","another","wolf",".","down","in","the","valley",",","a","wisent","turn","swiftly",",","a","deer","run","off","a","little","and","a","beaver","swim","into","its","hiding","place",".","only","a","bear","wait","in","anticipation","of","sponge","off","the","prey","of","the","wolf",".","this","be","the","story","about","the","rebirth","of","european","wilderness",",","in","which","the","wolf",",","the","wisent",",","the","bear","and","other","rare","animal","live","as","freely","as","century","ago","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["As night falls","night falls ,","falls , an",", an ethereal","an ethereal mist","ethereal mist creeps","mist creeps over","creeps over a","over a forest","a forest cover","forest cover as","cover as old","as old as","old as the","as the world","the world itself","The primeval howl","primeval howl of","howl of a","of a wolf","a wolf echoes","wolf echoes across","echoes across the","across the mountains","the mountains ,","mountains , followed",", followed by","followed by another","by another and","another and yet","and yet another","yet another wolf","Down in the","in the valley","the valley ,","valley , a",", a wisent","a wisent turns","wisent turns swiftly","turns swiftly ,","swiftly , a",", a deer","a deer runs","deer runs off","runs off a","off a little","a little and","little and a","and a beaver","a beaver swims","beaver swims into","swims into its","into its hiding","its hiding place","Only a bear","a bear waits","bear waits in","waits in anticipation","in anticipation of","anticipation of sponging","of sponging off","sponging off the","off the prey","the prey of","prey of the","of the wolf","This is the","is the story","the story about","story about the","about the rebirth","the rebirth of","rebirth of European","of European wilderness","European wilderness ,","wilderness , in",", in which","in which the","which the wolf","the wolf ,","wolf , the",", the wisent","the wisent ,","wisent , the",", the bear","the bear and","bear and other","and other rare","other rare animals","rare animals live","animals live as","live as freely","as freely as","freely as centuries","as centuries ago"],"2grams":["As night","night falls","falls ,",", an","an ethereal","ethereal mist","mist creeps","creeps over","over a","a forest","forest cover","cover as","as old","old as","as the","the world","world itself","The primeval","primeval howl","howl of","of a","a wolf","wolf echoes","echoes across","across the","the mountains","mountains ,",", followed","followed by","by another","another and","and yet","yet another","another wolf","Down in","in the","the valley","valley ,",", a","a wisent","wisent turns","turns swiftly","swiftly ,",", a","a deer","deer runs","runs off","off a","a little","little and","and a","a beaver","beaver swims","swims into","into its","its hiding","hiding place","Only a","a bear","bear waits","waits in","in anticipation","anticipation of","of sponging","sponging off","off the","the prey","prey of","of the","the wolf","This is","is the","the story","story about","about the","the rebirth","rebirth of","of European","European wilderness","wilderness ,",", in","in which","which the","the wolf","wolf ,",", the","the wisent","wisent ,",", the","the bear","bear and","and other","other rare","rare animals","animals live","live as","as freely","freely as","as centuries","centuries ago"]}

{"title":"Rocker","plot":"Victor is a rocker well into his forties, who lives with his son, Alin, in an unsanitary apartment from a notorious neighbourhood from Oradea. Despite Alin's drug addiction, his father would do anything for him, even help him and his friends from the band \"Iguanele\" prepare a live concert. Although Victor is himself a rebel without a cause, he'd like to finally enjoy a peaceful life with his girlfriend, who also has a son. Victor gets along with his girlfriend's son much better than with his own, for whom he sometimes has to engage in detestable activities, such as injecting him with the heroine he's addicted to.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Victor","is","a","rocker","well","into","his","forti",",","who","live","with","his","son",",","Alin",",","in","an","unsanitari","apart","from","a","notori","neighbourhood","from","Oradea",".","Despit","Alin","'s","drug","addict",",","his","father","would","do","anyth","for","him",",","even","help","him","and","his","friend","from","the","band","\"","Iguanel","\"","prepar","a","live","concert",".","Although","Victor","is","himself","a","rebel","without","a","caus",",","he","'d","like","to","final","enjoy","a","peac","life","with","his","girlfriend",",","who","also","has","a","son",".","Victor","get","along","with","his","girlfriend","'s","son","much","better","than","with","his","own",",","for","whom","he","sometim","has","to","engag","in","detest","activ",",","such","as","inject","him","with","the","heroin","he","'s","addict","to","."],"lemmas":["Victor","be","a","rocker","well","into","he","forty",",","who","live","with","he","son",",","Alin",",","in","a","unsanitary","apartment","from","a","notorious","neighbourhood","from","Oradea",".","despite","Alin","'s","drug","addiction",",","he","father","would","do","anything","for","he",",","even","help","he","and","he","friend","from","the","band","``","Iguanele","''","prepare","a","live","concert",".","although","Victor","be","himself","a","rebel","without","a","cause",",","he","would","like","to","finally","enjoy","a","peaceful","life","with","he","girlfriend",",","who","also","have","a","son",".","Victor","get","along","with","he","girlfriend","'s","son","much","better","than","with","he","own",",","for","whom","he","sometimes","have","to","engage","in","detestable","activity",",","such","as","inject","he","with","the","heroine","he","be","addict","to","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Victor

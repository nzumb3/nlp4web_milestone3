{"title":"A Sweet and Vicious Beauty","plot":"In the town of Harbor Bridge, it is said that when someone dies, his last breath stays in his throat. When the head is severed, that last breath can be taken by another, and the recipient becomes stronger. Narcissa Sentinel (Bette Cassatt) has been robbing graves to cure her illness with these last breaths...but soon realizes that perhaps fresher specimens are in order. Shot locally, A SWEET AND VICIOUS BEAUTY is an epic Gothic Victorian movie that shows the journey of Sentinel from a sickly woman to a bloodthirsty mass murderer who terrorizes the town. From spooky old houses to headless zombies, this film has it all!","genres":["Action"," Horror","

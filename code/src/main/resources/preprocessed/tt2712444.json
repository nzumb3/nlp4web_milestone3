{"title":"Nature Kids","plot":"In the not-too-distant past an American childhood was defined by unsupervised time outdoors. It was a time when kids could explore woods, play in creeks, build forts, and stay out until the lights came on. Today the average American spends 90% of their time indoors and the average American child will spend 7 to 10 hours a day in front of a glowing screen. Urbanization, technological advances, the loss of green public spaces and fear have given rise to an indoor and plugged-in generation. In Nature Kids we will not only explore the consequences of an indoor childhood but also witness the transformative power of nature in the lives of children who dare to go outside.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","not-too-dist","past","an","American","childhood","was","defin","by","unsupervis","time","outdoor",".","It","was","a","time","when","kid","could","explor","wood",",","play","in","creek",",","build","fort",",","and","stay","out","until","the","light","came","on",".","Today","the","averag","American","spend","90","%","of","their","time","indoor","and","the","averag","American","child","will","spend","7","to","10","hour","a","day","in","front","of","a","glow","screen",".","Urbaniz",",","technolog","advanc",",","the","loss","of","green","public","space","and","fear","have","given","rise","to","an","indoor","and","plugged-in","generat",".","In","Natur","Kid","we","will","not","onli","explor","the","consequ","of","an","indoor","childhood","but","also","wit","the","transform","power","of","natur","in","the","live","of","children","who","dare","to","go","outsid","."],"lemmas":["in","the","not-too-distant","past","a","american","childhood","be","define","by","unsupervised","time","outdoors",".","it","be","a","time","when","kid","could","explore","wood",",","play","in","creek",",","build","fort",",","and","stay","out","until","the","light","come","on",".","today","the","average","American","spend","90","%","of","they","time","indoors","and","the","average","american","child","will","spend","7","to","10","hour","a","day","in","front","of","a","glowing","screen",".","Urbanization",",","technological","advance",",","the","loss","of","green","public","space","and","fear","have","give","rise","to","a","indoor","and","plugged-in","generation",".","in","Nature","Kids","we","will","not","only","explore","the","consequence","of","a","indoor","childhood","but","also","witness","the","transformative","power","of","nature","in","the","life","of","child","who","dare","to","go","outside","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["In

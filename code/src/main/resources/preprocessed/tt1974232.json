{"title":"Chandrayaan","plot":"The feature film Chandrayaan is based on the glorious story of India's first Lunar Mission. Chandrayaan is a spacecraft, initially designed to be in an orbit 100 kilometers from the moon. It was Dr. Abdul Kalam, the then President of India who proposed that a Moon Impact Probe, MIP, should be included. Indian Space Research Organization accepted this as a challenge and began their toil. At the appointed time PSLV C11 rocket soared into space carrying Chandrayaan. November 14, 2008. Millions of Indians were waiting with bated breath and great expectations. That night at 8.10 the ejected MIP dived to the lunar surface. Seconds punctuated by intense suspense. At last, the MIP landed on the lunar surface and placed the Indian tricolor on the Moon.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi","

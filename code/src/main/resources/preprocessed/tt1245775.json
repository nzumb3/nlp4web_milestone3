{"title":"Knerten","plot":"Lillebror, a mischievous and quick-witted boy, has just moved out of town and not made any new friends yet. One day he discovers a twig - Knerten - in a pile of firewood, and this becomes his imaginary friend. When Lillebror's mother gets a job in a general store and his father is out traveling as an underwear salesman, Lillebror has to manage on his own most of the day. With Knerten in hand, he encounters a new everyday rural life filled with colorful characters and challenges. But can a pine twig be a real friend - and can the family afford to stay in the run-down house?","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Comedy"],"stems":["Lillebror",",","a","mischiev","and","quick-wit","boy",",","has","just","move","out","of","town","and","not","made","ani","new","friend","yet",".","One","day","he","discov","a","twig","-","Knerten","-","in","a","pile","of","firewood",",","and","this","becom","his","imaginari","friend",".","When","Lillebror","'s","mother","get","a","job","in","a","general","store","and","his","father","is","out","travel","as","an","underwear","salesman",",","Lillebror","has","to","manag","on","his","own","most","of","the","day",".","With","Knerten","in","hand",",","he","encount","a","new","everyday","rural","life","fill","with","color","charact","and","challeng",".","But","can","a","pine","twig","be","a","real","friend","-","and","can","the","famili","afford","to","stay","in","the","run-down","hous","?"],"lemmas":["Lillebror",",","a","mischievous","and","quick-witted","boy",",","have","just","move","out","of","town","and","not","make","any","new","friend","yet",".","one","day","he","discover","a","twig","-","knerten","-","in","a","pile","of","firewood",",","and","this","become","he","imaginary","friend",".","when","Lillebror","'s","mother","get","a","job","in","a","general","store","and","he","father","be","out","travel","as","a","underwear","salesman",",","Lillebror","have","to","manage","on","he","own","most","of","the","day",".","with","Knerten","in","hand",",","he","encounter","a","new","everyday","rural","life","fill","with","colorful","character","and","challenge",".","but","can","a","pine","twig","be","a","real","friend","-","and","can","the","family","afford","to","stay","in","the","run-down","house","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lillebror , a",", a mischievous","a mischievous and","mischievous and quick-witted","and quick-witted boy","quick-witted boy ,","boy , has",", has just","has just moved","just moved out","moved out of","out of town","of town and","town and not","and not made","not made any","made any new","any new friends","new friends yet","One day he","day he discovers","he discovers a","discovers a twig","a twig -","twig - Knerten","- Knerten -","Knerten - in","- in a","in a pile","a pile of","pile of firewood","of firewood ,","firewood , and",", and this","and this becomes","this becomes his","becomes his imaginary","his imaginary friend","When Lillebror 's","Lillebror 's mother","'s mother gets","mother gets a","gets a job","a job in","job in a","in a general","a general store","general store and","store and his","and his father","his father is","father is out","is out traveling","out traveling as","traveling as an","as an underwear","an underwear salesman","underwear salesman ,","salesman , Lillebror",", Lillebror has","Lillebror has to","has to manage","to manage on","manage on his","on his own","his own most","own most of","most of the","of the day","With Knerten in","Knerten in hand","in hand ,","hand , he",", he encounters","he encounters a","encounters a new","a new everyday","new everyday rural","everyday rural life","rural life filled","life filled with","filled with colorful","with colorful characters","colorful characters and","characters and challenges","But can a","can a pine","a pine twig","pine twig be","twig be a","be a real","a real friend","real friend -","friend - and","- and can","and can the","can the family","the family afford","family afford to","afford to stay","to stay in","stay in the","in the run-down","the run-down house"],"2grams":["Lillebror ,",", a","a mischievous","mischievous and","and quick-witted","quick-witted boy","boy ,",", has","has just","just moved","moved out","out of","of town","town and","and not","not made","made any","any new","new friends","friends yet","One day","day he","he discovers","discovers a","a twig","twig -","- Knerten","Knerten -","- in","in a","a pile","pile of","of firewood","firewood ,",", and","and this","this becomes","becomes his","his imaginary","imaginary friend","When Lillebror","Lillebror 's","'s mother","mother gets","gets a","a job","job in","in a","a general","general store","store and","and his","his father","father is","is out","out traveling","traveling as","as an","an underwear","underwear salesman","salesman ,",", Lillebror","Lillebror has","has to","to manage","manage on","on his","his own","own most","most of","of the","the day","With Knerten","Knerten in","in hand","hand ,",", he","he encounters","encounters a","a new","new everyday","everyday rural","rural life","life filled","filled with","with colorful","colorful characters","characters and","and challenges","But can","can a","a pine","pine twig","twig be","be a","a real","real friend","friend -","- and","and can","can the","the family","family afford","afford to","to stay","stay in","in the","the run-down","run-down house"]}

The new night crew tandem is faced with quitting employees, Psychotic customers, mutual feelings for the brash and vivacious Constance, keeping their meddling friends at bay, and trying to get a little bit of work done! Nothing the night shift has to offer is more difficult, however, than avoiding the watchful eye of their overbearing manager, Brock. When James and Lee get put together on the \"Night Shift\", they learn one thing that's certain. They have a lot to learn about each other in this comedy that's funny day or night!\"","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["\"","When","'","Office","Time","'","employe",",","Lee",",","volunt","to","switch","over","from","day","to","the","night","shift","with","his","best","friend",",","lazi","but","well-intent","slacker",",","Jame",",","he","find","more","than","he","bargain","for","!","The","new","night","crew","tandem","is","face","with","quit","employe",",","Psychot","custom",",","mutual","feel","for","the","brash","and","vivaci","Constanc",",","keep","their","meddl","friend","at","bay",",","and","tri","to","get","a","littl","bit","of","work","done","!","Noth","the","night","shift","has","to","offer","is","more","difficult",",","howev",",","than","avoid","the","watch","eye","of","their","overbear","manag",",","Brock",".","When","Jame","and","Lee","get","put","togeth","on","the","\"","Night","Shift","\"",",","they","learn","one","thing","that","'s","certain",".","They","have","a","lot","to","learn","about","each","other","in","this","comedi","that","'s","funni","day","or","night","!","\""],"lemmas":["``","when","'","Office","Time","'","employee",",","Lee",",","volunteer","to","switch","over","from","day","to","the","night","shift","with","he","best","friend",",","lazy","but","well-intentioned","slacker",",","James",",","he","find","more","than","he","bargain","for","!","the","new","night","crew","tandem","be","face","with","quit","employee",",","psychotic","customer",",","mutual","feeling","for","the","brash","and","vivacious","Constance",",","keep","they","meddle","friend","at","bay",",","and","try","to","get","a","little","bit","of","work","do","!","nothing","the","night","shift","have","to","offer","be","more","difficult",",","however",",","than","avoid","the","watchful","eye","of","they","overbearing","manager",",","Brock",".","when","James","and","Lee","get","put","together","on","the","``","night","shift","''",",","they","learn","one","thing","that","be","certain",".","they","have","a","lot","to","learn","about","each","other","in","this","comedy","that","be","funny","day","or","night","!","''"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" When '","When ' Office","' Office Time","Office Time '","Time ' employee","' employee ,","employee , Lee",", Lee ,","Lee , volunteers",", volunteers to","volunteers to switch","to switch over","switch over from","over from days","from days to","days to the","to the night","the night shift","night shift with","shift with his","with his best","his best friend","best friend ,","friend , lazy",", lazy but","lazy but well-intentioned","but well-intentioned slacker","well-intentioned slacker ,","slacker , James",", James ,","James , he",", he finds","he finds more","finds more than","more than he","than he bargained","he bargained for","The new night","new night crew","night crew tandem","crew tandem is","tandem is faced","is faced with","faced with quitting","with quitting employees","quitting employees ,","employees , Psychotic",", Psychotic customers","Psychotic customers ,","customers , mutual",", mutual feelings","mutual feelings for","feelings for the","for the brash","the brash and","brash and vivacious","and vivacious Constance","vivacious Constance ,","Constance , keeping",", keeping their","keeping their meddling","their meddling friends","meddling friends at","friends at bay","at bay ,","bay , and",", and trying","and trying to","trying to get","to get a","get a little","a little bit","little bit of","bit of work","of work done","Nothing the night","the night shift","night shift has","shift has to","has to offer","to offer is","offer is more","is more difficult","more difficult ,","difficult , however",", however ,","however , than",", than avoiding","than avoiding the","avoiding the watchful","the watchful eye","watchful eye of","eye of their","of their overbearing","their overbearing manager","overbearing manager ,","manager , Brock","When James and","James and Lee","and Lee get","Lee get put","get put together","put together on","together on the","on the \"","the \" Night","\" Night Shift","Night Shift \"","Shift \" ,","\" , they",", they learn","they learn one","learn one thing","one thing that","thing that 's","that 's certain","They have a","have a lot","a lot to","lot to learn","to learn about","learn about each","about each other","each other in","other in this","in this comedy","this comedy that","comedy that 's","that 's funny","'s funny day","funny day or","day or night","or night !","night !

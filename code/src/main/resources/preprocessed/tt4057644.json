{"title":"We Are Tourists","plot":"Cecile Gamble (O'ar Pali) is shipped off by her editor Harry to write a story on Monteprouve, a French village with the highest lingerie sales per capita in France. Hoping to spice up their relationship, Cecile drags her boyfriend Edward along for the ride. Monteprouve is everything Cecile expected - quaint, frisky and annoyingly French. But a high libido is not the only thing the town is hiding; Monteprouve also has a strangely high tourist suicide rate. It's not long before Cecile suspects that these 'suicides' are actually murders. But with a town full of oddball characters, uncovering the murderer may prove harder than expected.","genres":["Comedy"," Mystery"," Crime"],"stems":["Cecil","Gambl","(","O'ar","Pali",")","is","ship","off","by","her","editor","Harri","to","write","a","stori","on","Monteprouv",",","a","French","villag","with","the","highest","lingeri","sale","per","capita","in","Franc",".","Hope","to","spice","up","their","relationship",",","Cecil","drag","her","boyfriend","Edward","along","for","the","ride",".","Monteprouv","is","everyth","Cecil","expect","-","quaint",",","friski","and","annoy","French",".","But","a","high","libido","is","not","the","onli","thing","the","town","is","hide",";","Monteprouv","also","has","a","strang","high","tourist","suicid","rate",".","It","'s","not","long","befor","Cecil","suspect","that","these","'","suicid","'","are","actual","murder",".","But","with","a","town","full","of","oddbal","charact",",","uncov","the","murder","may","prove","harder","than","expect","."],"lemmas":["Cecile","Gamble","-lrb-","O'ar","Pali","-rrb-","be","ship","off","by","she","editor","Harry","to","write","a","story","on","Monteprouve",",","a","french","village","with","the","highest","lingerie","sale","per","capita","in","France",".","hope","to","spice","up","they","relationship",",","Cecile","drag","she","boyfriend","Edward","along","for","the","ride",".","Monteprouve","be","everything","Cecile","expect","-","quaint",",","frisky","and","annoyingly","french",".","but","a","high","libido","be","not","the","only","thing","the","town","be","hide",";","Monteprouve","also","have","a","strangely","high","tourist","suicide","rate",".","it","be","not","long","before","Cecile","suspect","that","these","'","suicide","'","be","actually","murder",".","but","with","a","town","full","of","oddball","character",",","uncover","the","murderer","may","prove","harder","than","expect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cecile Gamble (","Gamble ( O'ar","( O'ar Pali","O'ar Pali )","Pali ) is",") is shipped","is shipped off","shipped off by","off by her","by her editor","her editor Harry","editor Harry to","Harry to write","to write a","write a story","a story on","story on Monteprouve","on Monteprouve ,","Monteprouve , a",", a French","a French village","French village with","village with the","with the highest","the highest lingerie","highest lingerie sales","lingerie sales per","sales per capita","per capita in","capita in France","Hoping to spice","to spice up","spice up their","up their relationship","their relationship ,","relationship , Cecile",", Cecile drags","Cecile drags her","drags her boyfriend","her boyfriend Edward","boyfriend Edward along","Edward along for","along for the","for the ride","Monteprouve is everything","is everything Cecile","everything Cecile expected","Cecile expected -","expected - quaint","- quaint ,","quaint , frisky",", frisky and","frisky and annoyingly","and annoyingly French","But a high","a high libido","high libido is","libido is not","is not the","not the only","the only thing","only thing the","thing the town","the town is","town is hiding","is hiding ;","hiding ;

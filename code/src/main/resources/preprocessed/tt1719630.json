{"title":"Singing to Save Lives","plot":"The Portsmouth, NH-based women's chorus, Voices from the Heart, uses the international language of music to create cross-cultural connections during their concert tour of Croatia and Slovenia. In an emotional meeting the women of Voices sing for the Croatian villagers in the area surrounded by minefields that the chorus spent two years raising funds to clear. The landmines were cleared in 2009 and now the remaining villagers hope those who fled, including landmine victims, will return to their long abandoned homes. Voices from the Heart is a 200-strong chorus of women from Seacoast New Hampshire and Maine who sing world music and have created an international community by giving back to causes worldwide, through their music, for more than 15 years.","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"People of the Lake","plot":"The Aral Sea, located between Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, was once the fourth-largest lake in the world - an immense body of fresh water covering a surface area of 68,000 square kilometers. But then the Soviet Union decided to boost cotton farming by constructing dams on the two large rivers that flowed into the Aral Sea, the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya rivers. When I met the locals and saw how deeply they had been impacted by the drastic change in the Aral and how organic their relationship was with the lake, I knew that this human story had to be a key element of the film. This had to be the story of the people of the lake.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["The","Aral","Sea",",","locat","between","Uzbekistan","and","Kazakhstan",",","was","onc","the","fourth-largest","lake","in","the","world","-","an","immens","bodi","of","fresh","water","cover","a","surfac","area","of","68,000","squar","kilomet",".","But","then","the","Soviet","Union","decid","to","boost","cotton","farm","by","construct","dam","on","the","two","larg","river","that","flow","into","the","Aral","Sea",",","the","Amu","Darya","and","the","Syr","Darya","river",".","When","I","met","the","local","and","saw","how","deepli","they","had","been","impact","by","the","drastic","chang","in","the","Aral","and","how","organ","their","relationship","was","with","the","lake",",","I","knew","that","this","human","stori","had","to","be","a","key","element","of","the","film",".","This","had","to","be","the","stori","of","the","peopl","of","the","lake","."],"lemmas":["the","Aral","Sea",",","located","between","Uzbekistan","and","Kazakhstan",",","be","once","the","fourth-largest","lake","in","the","world","-","a","immense","body","of","fresh","water","cover","a","surface","area","of","68,000","square","kilometer",".","but","then","the","Soviet","Union","decide","to","boost","cotton","farming","by","construct","dam","on","the","two","large","river","that","flow","into","the","Aral","Sea",",","the","Amu","Darya","and","the","Syr","Darya","river",".","when","I","meet","the","local","and","see","how","deeply","they","have","be","impact","by","the","drastic","change","in","the","Aral","and","how","organic","they","relationship","be","with","the","lake",",","I","know","that","this","human","story","have","to","be","a","key","element","of","the","film",".","this","have","to","be","the","story","of","the","people","of","the","lake","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Aral Sea","Aral Sea ,","Sea , located",", located between","located between Uzbekistan","between Uzbekistan and","Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan","and Kazakhstan ,","Kazakhstan , was",", was once","was once the","once the fourth-largest","the fourth-largest lake","fourth-largest lake in","lake in the","in the world","the world -","world -

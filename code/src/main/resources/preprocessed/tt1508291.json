{"title":"In My Life","plot":"Shirley Templo (Vilma Santos-Recto) is a ruthless woman. Many people deal with her strong attitude only for fear of her cold stare, or her outlash. She works as a librarian in a school, and lives in a compound that is owned by her ex-husband, Benito Salvacion (Tirso Cruz III). Many of the Salvacion family members that live near the compound, even including her eldest daughter, Dang (Dimples Romana), plead with her to sell it so they can make a profit, and she can move to a more suitable living area.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Shirley","Templo","(","Vilma","Santos-Recto",")","is","a","ruthless","woman",".","Mani","peopl","deal","with","her","strong","attitud","onli","for","fear","of","her","cold","stare",",","or","her","outlash",".","She","work","as","a","librarian","in","a","school",",","and","live","in","a","compound","that","is","own","by","her","ex-husband",",","Benito","Salvacion","(","Tirso","Cruz","III",")",".","Mani","of","the","Salvacion","famili","member","that","live","near","the","compound",",","even","includ","her","eldest","daughter",",","Dang","(","Dimpl","Romana",")",",","plead","with","her","to","sell","it","so","they","can","make","a","profit",",","and","she","can","move","to","a","more","suitabl","live","area","."],"lemmas":["Shirley","Templo","-lrb-","Vilma","Santos-Recto","-rrb-","be","a","ruthless","woman",".","many","people","deal","with","she","strong","attitude","only","for","fear","of","she","cold","stare",",","or","she","outlash",".","she","work","as","a","librarian","in","a","school",",","and","live","in","a","compound","that","be","own","by","she","ex-husband",",","Benito","Salvacion","-lrb-","Tirso","Cruz","III","-rrb-",".","many","of","the","Salvacion","family","member","that","live","near","the","compound",",","even","include","she","eldest","daughter",",","Dang","-lrb-","Dimples","Romana","-rrb-",",","plead","with","she","to","sell","it","so","they","can","make","a","profit",",","and","she","can","move","to","a","more","suitable","living","area","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Shirley Templo (","Templo ( Vilma","( Vilma Santos-Recto","Vilma Santos-Recto )","Santos-Recto ) is",") is a","is a ruthless","a ruthless woman","Many people deal","people deal with","deal with her","with her strong","her strong attitude","strong attitude only","attitude only for","only for fear","for fear of","fear of her","of her cold","her cold stare","cold stare ,","stare , or",", or her","or her outlash","She works as","works as a","as a librarian","a librarian in","librarian in a","in a school","a school ,","school , and",", and lives","and lives in","lives in a","in a compound","a compound that","compound that is","that is owned","is owned by","owned by her","by her ex-husband","her ex-husband ,","ex-husband , Benito",", Benito Salvacion","Benito Salvacion (","Salvacion ( Tirso","( Tirso Cruz","Tirso Cruz III","Cruz III )","Many of the","of the Salvacion","the Salvacion family","Salvacion family members","family members that","members that live","that live near","live near the","near the compound","the compound ,","compound , even",", even including","even including her","including her eldest","her eldest daughter","eldest daughter ,","daughter , Dang",", Dang (","Dang ( Dimples","( Dimples Romana","Dimples Romana )","Romana ) ,",") , plead",", plead with","plead with her","with her to","her to sell","to sell it","sell it so","it so they","so they can","they can make","can make a","make a profit","a profit ,","profit , and",", and she","and she can","she can move","can move to","move to a","to a more","a more suitable","more suitable living","suitable living area"],"2grams":["Shirley Templo","Templo (","( Vilma","Vilma Santos-Recto","Santos-Recto )",") is","is a","a ruthless","ruthless woman","Many people","people deal","deal with","with her","her strong","strong attitude","attitude only","only for","for fear","fear of","of her","her cold","cold stare","stare ,",", or","or her","her outlash","She works","works as","as a","a librarian","librarian in","in a","a school","school ,",", and","and lives","lives in","in a","a compound","compound that","that is","is owned","owned by","by her","her ex-husband","ex-husband ,",", Benito","Benito Salvacion","Salvacion (","( Tirso","Tirso Cruz","Cruz III","III )","Many of","of the","the Salvacion","Salvacion family","family members","members that","that live","live near","near the","the compound","compound ,",", even","even including","including her","her eldest","eldest daughter","daughter ,",", Dang","Dang (","( Dimples","Dimples Romana","Romana )",") ,",", plead","plead with","with her","her to","to sell","sell it","it so","so they","they can","can make","make a","a profit","profit ,",", and","and she","she can","can move","move to","to a","a more","more suitable","suitable living","living area"]}

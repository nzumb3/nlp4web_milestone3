{"title":"Les couloirs du temps: Les visiteurs II","plot":"The sequel to The Visitors reunites us with those lovable ruffians from the French Medieval ages who - through magic - are transported into the present, with often drastic consequences. Godefroy de Montmirail travels to today to recover the missing family jewels and a sacred relic, guarantor of his wife-to-be's fertility. The confrontation between Godefroy's repellent servant Jack the Crack and his descendent, the effete Jacquart, present-day owner of the chateau, further complicates the matter.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"],"stems":["The","sequel","to","The","Visitor","reunit","us","with","those","lovabl","ruffian","from","the","French","Mediev","age","who","-","through","magic","-","are","transport","into","the","present",",","with","often","drastic","consequ",".","Godefroy","de","Montmirail","travel","to","today","to","recov","the","miss","famili","jewel","and","a","sacr","relic",",","guarantor","of","his","wife-to-b","'s","fertil",".","The","confront","between","Godefroy","'s","repel","servant","Jack","the","Crack","and","his","descend",",","the","effet","Jacquart",",","present-day","owner","of","the","chateau",",","further","complic","the","matter","."],"lemmas":["the","sequel","to","the","Visitors","reunite","we","with","those","lovable","ruffian","from","the","french","medieval","age","who","-","through","magic","-","be","transport","into","the","present",",","with","often","drastic","consequence",".","Godefroy","de","Montmirail","travel","to","today","to","recover","the","miss","family","jewel","and","a","sacred","relic",",","guarantor","of","he","wife-to-be","'s","fertility",".","the","confrontation","between","Godefroy","'s","repellent","servant","Jack","the","Crack","and","he","descendent",",","the","effete","Jacquart",",","present-day","owner","of","the","chateau",",","further","complicate","the","matter","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The sequel to","sequel to The","to The Visitors","The Visitors reunites","Visitors reunites us","reunites us with","us with those","with those lovable","those lovable ruffians","lovable ruffians from","ruffians from the","from the French","the French Medieval","French Medieval ages","Medieval ages who","ages who -","who - through","- through magic","through magic -","magic - are","- are transported","are transported into","transported into the","into the present","the present ,","present , with",", with often","with often drastic","often drastic consequences","Godefroy de Montmirail","de Montmirail travels","Montmirail travels to","travels to today","to today to","today to recover","to recover the","recover the missing","the missing family","missing family jewels","family jewels and","jewels and a","and a sacred","a sacred relic","sacred relic ,","relic , guarantor",", guarantor of","guarantor of his","of his wife-to-be","his wife-to-be 's","wife-to-be 's fertility","The confrontation between","confrontation between Godefroy","between Godefroy 's","Godefroy 's repellent","'s repellent servant","repellent servant Jack","servant Jack the","Jack the Crack","the Crack and","Crack and his","and his descendent","his descendent ,","descendent , the",", the effete","the effete Jacquart","effete Jacquart ,","Jacquart , present-day",", present-day owner","present-day owner of","owner of the","of the chateau","the chateau ,","chateau , further",", further complicates","further complicates the","complicates the matter"],"2grams":["The sequel","sequel to","to The","The Visitors","Visitors reunites","reunites us","us with","with those","those lovable","lovable ruffians","ruffians from","from the","the French","French Medieval","Medieval ages","ages who","who -","- through","through magic","magic -","- are","are transported","transported into","into the","the present","present ,",", with","with often","often drastic","drastic consequences","Godefroy de","de Montmirail","Montmirail travels","travels to","to today","today to","to recover","recover the","the missing","missing family","family jewels","jewels and","and a","a sacred","sacred relic","relic ,",", guarantor","guarantor of","of his","his wife-to-be","wife-to-be 's","'s fertility","The confrontation","confrontation between","between Godefroy","Godefroy 's","'s repellent","repellent servant","servant Jack","Jack the","the Crack","Crack and","and his","his descendent","descendent ,",", the","the effete","effete Jacquart","Jacquart ,",", present-day","present-day owner","owner of","of the","the chateau","chateau ,",", further","further complicates","complicates the","the matter"]}

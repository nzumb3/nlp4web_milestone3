{"title":"The Prosecution of an American President","plot":"Famed Charles Manson prosecutor and New York Times bestselling author Vincent Bugliosi makes the most powerful, explosive, and thought-provoking argument of his storied career. In \"The Prosecution of an American President\", Bugliosi presents a meticulously researched legal case that proves George W. Bush took our nation to war in Iraq under false pretenses and is therefore, under the law, guilty of murder for the deaths of 4,500 young American soldiers who fought and died there. Bush's unlawful war also cost the United States over a trillion dollars; alienated many of our allies; caused the deaths of over 100,000 innocent Iraqi men, women, and children; and pushed a previously tranquil nation into unending civil war, atrocities and chaos. As a prosecutor dedicated to seeking justice, Bugliosi delivers a non-partisan argument based on hard facts and pure objectivity. This searing indictment also outlines a legally credible pathway to holding our highest government officials accountable for their actions, thereby creating a framework for future occupants of the Oval Office. Ultimately, Bugliosi calls for the United States to return to the great nation it once was.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Fame","Charl","Manson","prosecutor","and","New","York","Time","bestsel","author","Vincent","Bugliosi","make","the","most","power",",","explos",",","and","thought-provok","argument","of","his","stori","career",".","In","\"","The","Prosecut","of","an","American","Presid","\"",",","Bugliosi","present","a","meticul","research","legal","case","that","prove","Georg","W.","Bush","took","our","nation","to","war","in","Iraq","under","fals","pretens","and","is","therefor",",","under","the","law",",","guilti","of","murder","for","the","death","of","4,500","young","American","soldier","who","fought","and","die","there",".","Bush","'s","unlaw","war","also","cost","the","Unite","State","over","a","trillion","dollar",";","alien","mani","of","our","alli",";","caus","the","death","of","over","100,000","innoc","Iraqi","men",",","women",",","and","children",";","and","push","a","previous","tranquil","nation","into","unend","civil","war",",","atroc","and","chao",".","As","a","prosecutor","dedic","to","seek","justic",",","Bugliosi","deliv","a","non-partisan","argument","base","on","hard","fact","and","pure","object",".","This","sear","indict","also","outlin","a","legal","credibl","pathway","to","hold","our","highest","govern","offici","account","for","their","action",",","therebi","creat","a","framework","for","futur","occup","of","the","Oval","Office",".","Ultimat",",","Bugliosi","call","for","the","Unite","State","to","return","to","the","great","nation","it","onc","was","."],"lemmas":["Famed","Charles","Manson","prosecutor","and","New","York","Times","bestsell","author","Vincent","Bugliosi","make","the","most","powerful",",","explosive",",","and","thought-provoking","argument","of","he","storied","career",".","in","``","the","prosecution","of","a","american","president","''",",","Bugliosi","present","a","meticulously","research","legal","case","that","prove","George","W.","Bush","take","we","nation","to","war","in","Iraq","under","false","pretens","and","be","therefore",",","under","the","law",",","guilty","of","murder","for","the","death","of","4,500","young","american","soldier","who","fight","and","die","there",".","Bush","'s","unlawful","war","also","cost","the","United","States","over","a","trillion","dollar",";","alienate","many","of","we","ally",";","cause","the","death","of","over","100,000","innocent","iraqi","man",",","woman",",","and","child",";","and","push","a","previously","tranquil","nation","into","unending","civil","war",",","atrocity","and","chaos",".","as","a","prosecutor","dedicate","to","seek","justice",",","Bugliosi","deliver","a","non-partisan","argument","base","on","hard","fact","and","pure","objectivity",".","this","searing","indictment","also","outline","a","legally","credible","pathway","to","hold","we","highest","government","official","accountable","for","they","action",",","thereby","create","a","framework","for","future","occupant","of","the","Oval","Office",".","ultimately",",","Bugliosi","call","for","the","United","States","to","return","to","the","great","nation","it","once","be","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Famed Charles Manson","Charles Manson prosecutor","Manson prosecutor and","prosecutor and New","and New York","New York Times","York Times bestselling","Times bestselling author","bestselling author Vincent","author Vincent Bugliosi","Vincent Bugliosi makes","Bugliosi makes the","makes the most","the most powerful","most powerful ,","powerful , explosive",", explosive ,","explosive , and",", and thought-provoking","and thought-provoking argument","thought-provoking argument of","argument of his","of his storied","his storied career","In \" The","\" The Prosecution","The Prosecution of","Prosecution of an","of an American","an American President","American President \"","President \" ,","\" , Bugliosi",", Bugliosi presents","Bugliosi presents a","presents a meticulously","a meticulously researched","meticulously researched legal","researched legal case","legal case that","case that proves","that proves George","proves George W.","George W.

{"title":"Io/Tu - Il futuro Ã¨ dei ragazzi","plot":"A unique multi-voiced discourse implemented through a particular mode of interview. Throughout the process, two classes of kids have ventured on both sides of the camera, trying to capture and show, without any mask, who they actually are, what their hopes, fears, how to enjoy the life that grows ever more pressing and urgent: love, death, the future. An exploration, through careful listening to each other and with the intention to get to know each other deeply, but also to tell anyone who wants to lend eyes and ears themselves, honestly, in a full search of truth.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","uniqu","multi-vo","discours","implement","through","a","particular","mode","of","interview",".","Throughout","the","process",",","two","class","of","kid","have","ventur","on","both","side","of","the","camera",",","tri","to","captur","and","show",",","without","ani","mask",",","who","they","actual","are",",","what","their","hope",",","fear",",","how","to","enjoy","the","life","that","grow","ever","more","press","and","urgent",":","love",",","death",",","the","futur",".","An","explor",",","through","care","listen","to","each","other","and","with","the","intent","to","get","to","know","each","other","deepli",",","but","also","to","tell","anyon","who","want","to","lend","eye","and","ear","themselv",",","honest",",","in","a","full","search","of","truth","."],"lemmas":["a","unique","multi-voiced","discourse","implement","through","a","particular","mode","of","interview",".","throughout","the","process",",","two","class","of","kid","have","venture","on","both","side","of","the","camera",",","try","to","capture","and","show",",","without","any","mask",",","who","they","actually","be",",","what","they","hope",",","fear",",","how","to","enjoy","the","life","that","grow","ever","more","pressing","and","urgent",":","love",",","death",",","the","future",".","a","exploration",",","through","careful","listening","to","each","other","and","with","the","intention","to","get","to","know","each","other","deeply",",","but","also","to","tell","anyone","who","want","to","lend","eye","and","ear","themselves",",","honestly",",","in","a","full","search","of","truth","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A

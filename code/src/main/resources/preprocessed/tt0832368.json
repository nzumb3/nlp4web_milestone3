In San Francisco, he quickly became a fan favorite, which led to animosity with legend and fellow team member Willie Mays. He garnered many awards including Rookie of the Year, MVP, and won the World Series with the St. Louis Cardinals. After his retirement, he was arrested for drug smuggling and sentenced to a year in jail. He then turned his life around and became a Buddhist. In 1999, he was bestowed the greatest achievement any baseball player can receive -- induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","biographi","of","Puerto","Rican","basebal","star","Orlando","Cepeda",",","who","start","his","career","in","the","60","'s","and","had","to","contend","with","racism","insid","and","outsid","the","ballpark",".","In","San","Francisco",",","he","quick","becam","a","fan","favorit",",","which","led","to","animos","with","legend","and","fellow","team","member","Willi","May",".","He","garner","mani","award","includ","Rooki","of","the","Year",",","MVP",",","and","won","the","World","Seri","with","the","St.","Loui","Cardin",".","After","his","retir",",","he","was","arrest","for","drug","smuggl","and","sentenc","to","a","year","in","jail",".","He","then","turn","his","life","around","and","becam","a","Buddhist",".","In","1999",",","he","was","bestow","the","greatest","achiev","ani","basebal","player","can","receiv","--","induct","into","the","Basebal","Hall","of","Fame","."],"lemmas":["a","biography","of","Puerto","Rican","baseball","star","Orlando","Cepeda",",","who","start","he","career","in","the","60","'s","and","have","to","contend","with","racism","inside","and","outside","the","ballpark",".","in","San","Francisco",",","he","quickly","become","a","fan","favorite",",","which","lead","to","animosity","with","legend","and","fellow","team","member","Willie","Mays",".","he","garner","many","award","include","rookie","of","the","year",",","mvp",",","and","win","the","World","Series","with","the","St.","Louis","Cardinals",".","after","he","retirement",",","he","be","arrest","for","drug","smuggling","and","sentence","to","a","year","in","jail",".","he","then","turn","he","life","around","and","become","a","Buddhist",".","in","1999",",","he","be","bestow","the","greatest","achievement","any","baseball","player","can","receive","--","induction","into","the","Baseball","Hall","of","Fame","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A

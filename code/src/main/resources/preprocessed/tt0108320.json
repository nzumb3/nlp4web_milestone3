{"title":"There Goes My Baby","plot":"In the final few days of Pop's Paradise - a hamburger joint that's been a second home to Westwood High's senior class - and a group of friends must face the biggest decisions of their lives. There's Stick, a surfer headed for Vietnam, Pirate, who wants to discover America along Route 66, and Michael, whose political activism may destroy his Harvard-bound future. Little do any of them realize that their final carefree days will also mark the end of their - and all of America's - innocence.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","final","few","day","of","Pop","'s","Paradis","-","a","hamburg","joint","that","'s","been","a","second","home","to","Westwood","High","'s","senior","class","-","and","a","group","of","friend","must","face","the","biggest","decis","of","their","live",".","There","'s","Stick",",","a","surfer","head","for","Vietnam",",","Pirat",",","who","want","to","discov","America","along","Rout","66",",","and","Michael",",","whose","polit","activ","may","destroy","his","Harvard-bound","futur",".","Littl","do","ani","of","them","realiz","that","their","final","carefre","day","will","also","mark","the","end","of","their","-","and","all","of","America","'s","-","innoc","."],"lemmas":["in","the","final","few","day","of","pop","'s","Paradise","-","a","hamburger","joint","that","be","be","a","second","home","to","Westwood","High","'s","senior","class","-","and","a","group","of","friend","must","face","the","biggest","decision","of","they","life",".","there","'s","Stick",",","a","surfer","head","for","Vietnam",",","Pirate",",","who","want","to","discover","America","along","Route","66",",","and","Michael",",","whose","political","activism","may","destroy","he","harvard-bound","future",".","little","do","any","of","they","realize","that","they","final","carefree","day","will","also","mark","the","end","of","they","-","and","all","of","America","'s","-","innocence","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the final","the final few","final few days","few days of","days of Pop","of Pop 's","Pop 's Paradise","'s Paradise -","Paradise - a","- a hamburger","a hamburger joint","hamburger joint that","joint that 's","that 's been","'s been a","been a second","a second home","second home to","home to Westwood","to Westwood High","Westwood High 's","High 's senior","'s senior class","senior class -","class - and","- and a","and a group","a group of","group of friends","of friends must","friends must face","must face the","face the biggest","the biggest decisions","biggest decisions of","decisions of their","of their lives","There 's Stick","'s Stick ,","Stick , a",", a surfer","a surfer headed","surfer headed for","headed for Vietnam","for Vietnam ,","Vietnam , Pirate",", Pirate ,","Pirate , who",", who wants","who wants to","wants to discover","to discover America","discover America along","America along Route","along Route 66","Route 66 ,","66 , and",", and Michael","and Michael ,","Michael , whose",", whose political","whose political activism","political activism may","activism may destroy","may destroy his","destroy his Harvard-bound","his Harvard-bound future","Little do any","do any of","any of them","of them realize","them realize that","realize that their","that their final","their final carefree","final carefree days","carefree days will","days will also","will also mark","also mark the","mark the end","the end of","end of their","of their -","their - and","- and all","and all of","all of America","of America 's","America 's -","'s - innocence"],"2grams":["In the","the final","final few","few days","days of","of Pop","Pop 's","'s Paradise","Paradise -","- a","a hamburger","hamburger joint","joint that","that 's","'s been","been a","a second","second home","home to","to Westwood","Westwood High","High 's","'s senior","senior class","class -","- and","and a","a group","group of","of friends","friends must","must face","face the","the biggest","biggest decisions","decisions of","of their","their lives","There 's","'s Stick","Stick ,",", a","a surfer","surfer headed","headed for","for Vietnam","Vietnam ,",", Pirate","Pirate ,",", who","who wants","wants to","to discover","discover America","America along","along Route","Route 66","66 ,",", and","and Michael","Michael ,",", whose","whose political","political activism","activism may","may destroy","destroy his","his Harvard-bound","Harvard-bound future","Little do","do any","any of","of them","them realize","realize that","that their","their final","final carefree","carefree days","days will","will also","also mark","mark the","the end","end of","of their","their -","- and","and all","all of","of America","America 's","'s -","- innocence"]}

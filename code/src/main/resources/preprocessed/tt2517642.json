{"title":"Millionen","plot":"Torsten wasn't looking for anything. He just bought the lottery ticket to keep the peace with his lotto-enthusiastic co-workers. Eventually, he's forced to think about what to do with such a big win, when his ticket hits the jackpot. And he soon realizes, that he is the only one not having an answer to that question. His wife Susanne already knows what to do with their new found wealth. His son Lutz also makes plans. The shock-wave of this \"lottobomb\" tears Torsten's orderly world apart and leaves him with the question of who he really is.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Torsten","was","n't","look","for","anyth",".","He","just","bought","the","lotteri","ticket","to","keep","the","peac","with","his","lotto-enthusiast","co-work",".","Eventual",",","he","'s","forc","to","think","about","what","to","do","with","such","a","big","win",",","when","his","ticket","hit","the","jackpot",".","And","he","soon","realiz",",","that","he","is","the","onli","one","not","have","an","answer","to","that","question",".","His","wife","Susann","alreadi","know","what","to","do","with","their","new","found","wealth",".","His","son","Lutz","also","make","plan",".","The","shock-wav","of","this","\"","lottobomb","\"","tear","Torsten","'s","order","world","apart","and","leav","him","with","the","question","of","who","he","realli","is","."],"lemmas":["Torsten","be","not","look","for","anything",".","he","just","buy","the","lottery","ticket","to","keep","the","peace","with","he","lotto-enthusiastic","co-worker",".","eventually",",","he","be","force","to","think","about","what","to","do","with","such","a","big","win",",","when","he","ticket","hit","the","jackpot",".","and","he","soon","realize",",","that","he","be","the","only","one","not","have","a","answer","to","that","question",".","he","wife","Susanne","already","know","what","to","do","with","they","new","find","wealth",".","he","son","Lutz","also","make","plan",".","the","shock-wave","of","this","``","lottobomb","''","tear","Torsten","'s","orderly","world","apart","and","leave","he","with","the","question","of","who","he","really","be","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Torsten was n't","was n't looking","n't looking for","looking for anything","He just bought","just bought the","bought the lottery","the lottery ticket","lottery ticket to","ticket to keep","to keep the","keep the peace","the peace with","peace with his","with his lotto-enthusiastic","his lotto-enthusiastic co-workers","Eventually , he",", he 's","he 's forced","'s forced to","forced to think","to think about","think about what","about what to","what to do","to do with","do with such","with such a","such a big","a big win","big win ,","win , when",", when his","when his ticket","his ticket hits","ticket hits the","hits the jackpot","And he soon","he soon realizes","soon realizes ,","realizes , that",", that he","that he is","he is the","is the only","the only one","only one not","one not having","not having an","having an answer","an answer to","answer to that","to that question","His wife Susanne","wife Susanne already","Susanne already knows","already knows what","knows what to","what to do","to do with","do with their","with their new","their new found","new found wealth","His son Lutz","son Lutz also","Lutz also makes","also makes plans","The shock-wave of","shock-wave of this","of this \"","this \" lottobomb","\" lottobomb \"","lottobomb \" tears","\" tears Torsten","tears Torsten 's","Torsten 's orderly","'s orderly world","orderly world apart","world apart and","apart and leaves","and leaves him","leaves him with","him with the","with the question","the question of","question of who","of who he","who he really","he really is"],"2grams":["Torsten was","was n't","n't looking","looking for","for anything","He just","just bought","bought the","the lottery","lottery ticket","ticket to","to keep","keep the","the peace","peace with","with his","his lotto-enthusiastic","lotto-enthusiastic co-workers","Eventually ,",", he","he 's","'s forced","forced to","to think","think about","about what","what to","to do","do with","with such","such a","a big","big win","win ,",", when","when his","his ticket","ticket hits","hits the","the jackpot","And he","he soon","soon realizes","realizes ,",", that","that he","he is","is the","the only","only one","one not","not having","having an","an answer","answer to","to that","that question","His wife","wife Susanne","Susanne already","already knows","knows what","what to","to do","do with","with their","their new","new found","found wealth","His son","son Lutz","Lutz also","also makes","makes plans","The shock-wave","shock-wave of","of this","this \"","\" lottobomb","lottobomb \"","\" tears","tears Torsten","Torsten 's","'s orderly","orderly world","world apart","apart and","and leaves","leaves him","him with","with the","the question","question of","of who","who he","he really","really is"]}

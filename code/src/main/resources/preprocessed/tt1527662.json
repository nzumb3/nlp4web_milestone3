{"title":"Mar de Dentro","plot":"Old fishermen appeal to their affective memory to tell their stories of adventure and love. In a setting where time seems to have stopped to listen to them, they recall the time they lived in and on the sea. Accompanying their daily lives, the testimonials of the characters mingle together in the course of the film to become one speech. As if the stories were able to create a unique memory line, so strong and present as the sea itself in the lives of each one of them.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Old","fishermen","appeal","to","their","affect","memori","to","tell","their","stori","of","adventur","and","love",".","In","a","set","where","time","seem","to","have","stop","to","listen","to","them",",","they","recal","the","time","they","live","in","and","on","the","sea",".","Accompani","their","daili","live",",","the","testimoni","of","the","charact","mingl","togeth","in","the","cours","of","the","film","to","becom","one","speech",".","As","if","the","stori","were","abl","to","creat","a","uniqu","memori","line",",","so","strong","and","present","as","the","sea","itself","in","the","live","of","each","one","of","them","."],"lemmas":["old","fisherman","appeal","to","they","affective","memory","to","tell","they","story","of","adventure","and","love",".","in","a","setting","where","time","seem","to","have","stop","to","listen","to","they",",","they","recall","the","time","they","live","in","and","on","the","sea",".","accompany","they","daily","life",",","the","testimonial","of","the","character","mingle","together","in","the","course","of","the","film","to","become","one","speech",".","as","if","the","story","be","able","to","create","a","unique","memory","line",",","so","strong","and","present","as","the","sea","itself","in","the","life","of","each","one","of","they","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Old fishermen appeal","fishermen appeal to","appeal to their","to their affective","their affective memory","affective memory to","memory to tell","to tell their","tell their stories","their stories of","stories of adventure","of adventure and","adventure and love","In a setting","a setting where","setting where time","where time seems","time seems to","seems to have","to have stopped","have stopped to","stopped to listen","to listen to","listen to them","to them ,","them , they",", they recall","they recall the","recall the time","the time they","time they lived","they lived in","lived in and","in and on","and on the","on the sea","Accompanying their daily","their daily lives","daily lives ,","lives , the",", the testimonials","the testimonials of","testimonials of the","of the characters","the characters mingle","characters mingle together","mingle together in","together in the","in the course","the course of","course of the","of the film","the film to","film to become","to become one","become one speech","As if the","if the stories","the stories were","stories were able","were able to","able to create","to create a","create a unique","a unique memory","unique memory line","memory line ,","line , so",", so strong","so strong and","strong and present","and present as","present as the","as the sea","the sea itself","sea itself in","itself in the","in the lives","the lives of","lives of each","of each one","each one of","one of them"],"2grams":["Old fishermen","fishermen appeal","appeal to","to their","their affective","affective memory","memory to","to tell","tell their","their stories","stories of","of adventure","adventure and","and love","In a","a setting","setting where","where time","time seems","seems to","to have","have stopped","stopped to","to listen","listen to","to them","them ,",", they","they recall","recall the","the time","time they","they lived","lived in","in and","and on","on the","the sea","Accompanying their","their daily","daily lives","lives ,",", the","the testimonials","testimonials of","of the","the characters","characters mingle","mingle together","together in","in the","the course","course of","of the","the film","film to","to become","become one","one speech","As if","if the","the stories","stories were","were able","able to","to create","create a","a unique","unique memory","memory line","line ,",", so","so strong","strong and","and present","present as","as the","the sea","sea itself","itself in","in the","the lives","lives of","of each","each one","one of","of them"]}

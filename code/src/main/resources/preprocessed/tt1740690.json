{"title":"Tackling Peace","plot":"Narrated by Hugo Weaving, Tackling Peace is the inspirational story of Israeli and Palestinian youths who unite over the game of Australian football. Tackling Peace goes behind the scenes as young men from different sides of a bloody political war set aside a lifetime of prejudice and hostility to compete as a team in the Australian Football League's International Cup. Few of the aspirant players had ever heard of the game and none imagined befriending teammates from across the political divide.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Narrat","by","Hugo","Weav",",","Tackl","Peac","is","the","inspir","stori","of","Israeli","and","Palestinian","youth","who","unit","over","the","game","of","Australian","footbal",".","Tackl","Peac","goe","behind","the","scene","as","young","men","from","differ","side","of","a","bloodi","polit","war","set","asid","a","lifetim","of","prejudic","and","hostil","to","compet","as","a","team","in","the","Australian","Footbal","Leagu","'s","Internat","Cup",".","Few","of","the","aspir","player","had","ever","heard","of","the","game","and","none","imagin","befriend","teammat","from","across","the","polit","divid","."],"lemmas":["narrate","by","Hugo","Weaving",",","Tackling","Peace","be","the","inspirational","story","of","Israeli","and","Palestinian","youth","who","unite","over","the","game","of","australian","football",".","Tackling","Peace","go","behind","the","scene","as","young","man","from","different","side","of","a","bloody","political","war","set","aside","a","lifetime","of","prejudice","and","hostility","to","compete","as","a","team","in","the","Australian","Football","League","'s","International","Cup",".","few","of","the","aspirant","player","have","ever","hear","of","the","game","and","none","imagine","befriend","teammate","from","across","the","political","divide","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Narrated by Hugo","by Hugo Weaving","Hugo Weaving ,","Weaving , Tackling",", Tackling Peace","Tackling Peace is","Peace is the","is the inspirational","the inspirational story","inspirational story of","story of Israeli","of Israeli and","Israeli and Palestinian","and Palestinian youths","Palestinian youths who","youths who unite","who unite over","unite over the","over the game","the game of","game of Australian","of Australian football","Tackling Peace goes","Peace goes behind","goes behind the","behind the scenes","the scenes as","scenes as young","as young men","young men from","men from different","from different sides","different sides of","sides of a","of a bloody","a bloody political","bloody political war","political war set","war set aside","set aside a","aside a lifetime","a lifetime of","lifetime of prejudice","of prejudice and","prejudice and hostility","and hostility to","hostility to compete","to compete as","compete as a","as a team","a team in","team in the","in the Australian","the Australian Football","Australian Football League","Football League 's","League 's International","'s International Cup","Few of the","of the aspirant","the aspirant players","aspirant players had","players had ever","had ever heard","ever heard of","heard of the","of the game","the game and","game and none","and none imagined","none imagined befriending","imagined befriending teammates","befriending teammates from","teammates from across","from across the","across the political","the political divide"],"2grams":["Narrated by","by Hugo","Hugo Weaving","Weaving ,",", Tackling","Tackling Peace","Peace is","is the","the inspirational","inspirational story","story of","of Israeli","Israeli and","and Palestinian","Palestinian youths","youths who","who unite","unite over","over the","the game","game of","of Australian","Australian football","Tackling Peace","Peace goes","goes behind","behind the","the scenes","scenes as","as young","young men","men from","from different","different sides","sides of","of a","a bloody","bloody political","political war","war set","set aside","aside a","a lifetime","lifetime of","of prejudice","prejudice and","and hostility","hostility to","to compete","compete as","as a","a team","team in","in the","the Australian","Australian Football","Football League","League 's","'s International","International Cup","Few of","of the","the aspirant","aspirant players","players had","had ever","ever heard","heard of","of the","the game","game and","and none","none imagined","imagined befriending","befriending teammates","teammates from","from across","across the","the political","political divide"]}

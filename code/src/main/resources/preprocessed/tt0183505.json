{"title":"Me, Myself & Irene","plot":"Charlie is a Rhode Island state trooper with a multiple personalities. He is otherwise mild-mannered and non confrontational until somebody or something pushes him a little too far. That's when his maniacal alter-ego, Hank, takes over. Charlie is assigned on a routine mission to return alleged fugitive Irene back to upstate New York, but they wind up on the run from corrupt police officers. And their escape would be a lot simpler on everybody involved if Hank didn't keep stepping in at the most inopportune times....","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Charli","is","a","Rhode","Island","state","trooper","with","a","multipl","person",".","He","is","otherwis","mild-mann","and","non","confront","until","somebodi","or","someth","push","him","a","littl","too","far",".","That","'s","when","his","maniac","alter-ego",",","Hank",",","take","over",".","Charli","is","assign","on","a","routin","mission","to","return","alleg","fugit","Irene","back","to","upstat","New","York",",","but","they","wind","up","on","the","run","from","corrupt","polic","offic",".","And","their","escap","would","be","a","lot","simpler","on","everybodi","involv","if","Hank","did","n't","keep","step","in","at","the","most","inopportun","time","...."],"lemmas":["Charlie","be","a","Rhode","Island","state","trooper","with","a","multiple","personality",".","he","be","otherwise","mild-mannered","and","non","confrontational","until","somebody","or","something","push","he","a","little","too","far",".","that","be","when","he","maniacal","alter-ego",",","Hank",",","take","over",".","Charlie","be","assign","on","a","routine","mission","to","return","allege","fugitive","Irene","back","to","upstate","New","York",",","but","they","wind","up","on","the","run","from","corrupt","police","officer",".","and","they","escape","would","be","a","lot","simpler","on","everybody","involve","if","Hank","do","not","keep","step","in","at","the","most","inopportune","time","...."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Charlie is a","is a Rhode","a Rhode Island","Rhode Island state","Island state trooper","state trooper with","trooper with a","with a multiple","a multiple personalities","He is otherwise","is otherwise mild-mannered","otherwise mild-mannered and","mild-mannered and non","and non confrontational","non confrontational until","confrontational until somebody","until somebody or","somebody or something","or something pushes","something pushes him","pushes him a","him a little","a little too","little too far","That 's when","'s when his","when his maniacal","his maniacal alter-ego","maniacal alter-ego ,","alter-ego , Hank",", Hank ,","Hank , takes",", takes over","Charlie is assigned","is assigned on","assigned on a","on a routine","a routine mission","routine mission to","mission to return","to return alleged","return alleged fugitive","alleged fugitive Irene","fugitive Irene back","Irene back to","back to upstate","to upstate New","upstate New York","New York ,","York , but",", but they","but they wind","they wind up","wind up on","up on the","on the run","the run from","run from corrupt","from corrupt police","corrupt police officers","And their escape","their escape would","escape would be","would be a","be a lot","a lot simpler","lot simpler on","simpler on everybody","on everybody involved","everybody involved if","involved if Hank","if Hank did","Hank did n't","did n't keep","n't keep stepping","keep stepping in","stepping in at","in at the","at the most","the most inopportune","most inopportune times","inopportune times ...."],"2grams":["Charlie is","is a","a Rhode","Rhode Island","Island state","state trooper","trooper with","with a","a multiple","multiple personalities","He is","is otherwise","otherwise mild-mannered","mild-mannered and","and non","non confrontational","confrontational until","until somebody","somebody or","or something","something pushes","pushes him","him a","a little","little too","too far","That 's","'s when","when his","his maniacal","maniacal alter-ego","alter-ego ,",", Hank","Hank ,",", takes","takes over","Charlie is","is assigned","assigned on","on a","a routine","routine mission","mission to","to return","return alleged","alleged fugitive","fugitive Irene","Irene back","back to","to upstate","upstate New","New York","York ,",", but","but they","they wind","wind up","up on","on the","the run","run from","from corrupt","corrupt police","police officers","And their","their escape","escape would","would be","be a","a lot","lot simpler","simpler on","on everybody","everybody involved","involved if","if Hank","Hank did","did n't","n't keep","keep stepping","stepping in","in at","at the","the most","most inopportune","inopportune times","times ...."]}

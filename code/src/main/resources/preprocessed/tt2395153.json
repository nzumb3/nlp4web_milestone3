{"title":"Benjamin Wolf","plot":"Wolf, Carlos and Dum Dum join the same gang, but have no idea of each others existence, until they are classified together for an assassination. An unfortunate turn of luck ensures that the mission fails and their leader gives the men, out of frustration, an impossible last-change task to prove their loyalty to him. In the meantime, a rival gang has hired a professional hitman to kill the men before completing the task, and also has a personal feud with one of them.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Comedy"],"stems":["Wolf",",","Carlo","and","Dum","Dum","join","the","same","gang",",","but","have","no","idea","of","each","other","exist",",","until","they","are","classifi","togeth","for","an","assassin",".","An","unfortun","turn","of","luck","ensur","that","the","mission","fail","and","their","leader","give","the","men",",","out","of","frustrat",",","an","imposs","last-chang","task","to","prove","their","loyalti","to","him",".","In","the","meantim",",","a","rival","gang","has","hire","a","profession","hitman","to","kill","the","men","befor","complet","the","task",",","and","also","has","a","person","feud","with","one","of","them","."],"lemmas":["Wolf",",","Carlos","and","Dum","Dum","join","the","same","gang",",","but","have","no","idea","of","each","other","existence",",","until","they","be","classify","together","for","a","assassination",".","a","unfortunate","turn","of","luck","ensure","that","the","mission","fail","and","they","leader","give","the","man",",","out","of","frustration",",","a","impossible","last-change","task","to","prove","they","loyalty","to","he",".","in","the","meantime",",","a","rival","gang","have","hire","a","professional","hitman","to","kill","the","man","before","complete","the","task",",","and","also","have","a","personal","feud","with","one","of","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wolf , Carlos",", Carlos and","Carlos and Dum","and Dum Dum","Dum Dum join","Dum join the","join the same","the same gang","same gang ,","gang , but",", but have","but have no","have no idea","no idea of","idea of each","of each others","each others existence","others existence ,","existence , until",", until they","until they are","they are classified","are classified together","classified together for","together for an","for an assassination","An unfortunate turn","unfortunate turn of","turn of luck","of luck ensures","luck ensures that","ensures that the","that the mission","the mission fails","mission fails and","fails and their","and their leader","their leader gives","leader gives the","gives the men","the men ,","men , out",", out of","out of frustration","of frustration ,","frustration , an",", an impossible","an impossible last-change","impossible last-change task","last-change task to","task to prove","to prove their","prove their loyalty","their loyalty to","loyalty to him","In the meantime","the meantime ,","meantime , a",", a rival","a rival gang","rival gang has","gang has hired","has hired a","hired a professional","a professional hitman","professional hitman to","hitman to kill","to kill the","kill the men","the men before","men before completing","before completing the","completing the task","the task ,","task , and",", and also","and also has","also has a","has a personal","a personal feud","personal feud with","feud with one","with one of","one of them"],"2grams":["Wolf ,",", Carlos","Carlos and","and Dum","Dum Dum","Dum join","join the","the same","same gang","gang ,",", but","but have","have no","no idea","idea of","of each","each others","others existence","existence ,",", until","until they","they are","are classified","classified together","together for","for an","an assassination","An unfortunate","unfortunate turn","turn of","of luck","luck ensures","ensures that","that the","the mission","mission fails","fails and","and their","their leader","leader gives","gives the","the men","men ,",", out","out of","of frustration","frustration ,",", an","an impossible","impossible last-change","last-change task","task to","to prove","prove their","their loyalty","loyalty to","to him","In the","the meantime","meantime ,",", a","a rival","rival gang","gang has","has hired","hired a","a professional","professional hitman","hitman to","to kill","kill the","the men","men before","before completing","completing the","the task","task ,",", and","and also","also has","has a","a personal","personal feud","feud with","with one","one of","of them"]}

{"title":"Sexual Secrets","plot":"During a rare Speck family reunion, domineering patriarch Vincent Speck announces the arranged marriage of his son Aldo to a woman whom Aldo has never met. Soon after the wedding Vincent and Alma's eldest son, Edward, is found dead in his bedroom, setting off a destructive series of events and revelations on a par with epic Greek tragedy. Philip Glass' music and Mark Edlitz's highly stylized direction and dialogue further intensify the drama in this darkly comic gothic thriller. Sexual Secrets stars Justin Kirk, recipient of Emmy and SAG nominations for Mike Nichols' Angels in America and star of the Showtime hit Weeds. Also staring is Jenna Stern from the Bruce Willis thriller 16 Blocks, the Will Smith comedy Hitch and as Tony Soprano's son's sultry psychologist in the last episode of The Sopranos. Emmy winner cult favorite Zohra Lampert of Splendor in the Grass (opposite Warren Beatty) and John Cassavetes' Opening Night gives a chilling performance.The film features a haunting soundtrack by Academy Award nominated composer Philip Glass.","genres":["Drama"," Romance","

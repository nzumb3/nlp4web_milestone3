{"title":"The Clean Bin Project","plot":"The Clean Bin Project is about a regular couple and their quest to answer the question 'is it possible to live completely waste free?' Partners Jen and Grant go head to head in a comedic battle to see who can swear off consumerism and produce the least amount of garbage in an entire year. Their light-hearted competition is set against a compelling examination of the sobering problem of waste in our 'throw-away' society. Featuring interviews with renowned artist and TED lecturer, Chris Jordan and marine pollution expert, Captain Charles Moore, The Clean Bin Project presents the serious topic of waste reduction with optimism, humor, and inspiration for individual action.","genres":["Comedy"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Clean","Bin","Project","is","about","a","regular","coupl","and","their","quest","to","answer","the","question","'","is","it","possibl","to","live","complet","wast","free","?","'","Partner","Jen","and","Grant","go","head","to","head","in","a","comed","battl","to","see","who","can","swear","off","consumer","and","produc","the","least","amount","of","garbag","in","an","entir","year",".","Their","light-heart","competit","is","set","against","a","compel","examin","of","the","sober","problem","of","wast","in","our","'","throw-away","'","societi",".","Featur","interview","with","renown","artist","and","TED","lectur",",","Chris","Jordan","and","marin","pollut","expert",",","Captain","Charl","Moor",",","The","Clean","Bin","Project","present","the","serious","topic","of","wast","reduct","with","optim",",","humor",",","and","inspir","for","individu","action","."],"lemmas":["the","Clean","Bin","Project","be","about","a","regular","couple","and","they","quest","to","answer","the","question","'","be","it","possible","to","live","completely","waste","free","?","'","Partners","Jen","and","Grant","go","head","to","head","in","a","comedic","battle","to","see","who","can","swear","off","consumerism","and","produce","the","least","amount","of","garbage","in","a","entire","year",".","they","light-hearted","competition","be","set","against","a","compelling","examination","of","the","sobering","problem","of","waste","in","we","'","throw-away","'","society",".","feature","interview","with","renowned","artist","and","TED","lecturer",",","Chris","Jordan","and","marine","pollution","expert",",","Captain","Charles","Moore",",","The","Clean","Bin","Project","present","the","serious","topic","of","waste","reduction","with","optimism",",","humor",",","and","inspiration","for","individual","action","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Clean Bin","Clean Bin Project","Bin Project is","Project is about","is about a","about a regular","a regular couple","regular couple and","couple and their","and their quest","their quest to","quest to answer","to answer the","answer the question","the question '","question ' is","' is it","is it possible","it possible to","possible to live","to live completely","live completely waste","completely waste free","waste free ?","free ?

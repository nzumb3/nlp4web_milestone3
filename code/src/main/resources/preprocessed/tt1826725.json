{"title":"Le retour du fils","plot":"Fifteen years after having been kidnapped by his European mother and taken to Europe, Mehdi, now in his early twenties, determines to return to Morocco without informing her. The decision to go back is provoked not only by the desire to visit his Moroccan father chez lui and see the country where he spent the first five years of his life, but to fill in the empty spaces in his own identity: two parents, two countries, two very different cultures.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Fifteen","year","after","have","been","kidnap","by","his","European","mother","and","taken","to","Europ",",","Mehdi",",","now","in","his","earli","twenti",",","determin","to","return","to","Morocco","without","inform","her",".","The","decis","to","go","back","is","provok","not","onli","by","the","desir","to","visit","his","Moroccan","father","chez","lui","and","see","the","countri","where","he","spent","the","first","five","year","of","his","life",",","but","to","fill","in","the","empti","space","in","his","own","ident",":","two","parent",",","two","countri",",","two","veri","differ","cultur","."],"lemmas":["fifteen","year","after","have","be","kidnap","by","he","european","mother","and","take","to","Europe",",","Mehdi",",","now","in","he","early","twenty",",","determine","to","return","to","Morocco","without","inform","she",".","the","decision","to","go","back","be","provoke","not","only","by","the","desire","to","visit","he","moroccan","father","chez","lui","and","see","the","country","where","he","spend","the","first","five","year","of","he","life",",","but","to","fill","in","the","empty","space","in","he","own","identity",":","two","parent",",","two","country",",","two","very","different","culture","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fifteen years after","years after having","after having been","having been kidnapped","been kidnapped by","kidnapped by his","by his European","his European mother","European mother and","mother and taken","and taken to","taken to Europe","to Europe ,","Europe , Mehdi",", Mehdi ,","Mehdi , now",", now in","now in his","in his early","his early twenties","early twenties ,","twenties , determines",", determines to","determines to return","to return to","return to Morocco","to Morocco without","Morocco without informing","without informing her","The decision to","decision to go","to go back","go back is","back is provoked","is provoked not","provoked not only","not only by","only by the","by the desire","the desire to","desire to visit","to visit his","visit his Moroccan","his Moroccan father","Moroccan father chez","father chez lui","chez lui and","lui and see","and see the","see the country","the country where","country where he","where he spent","he spent the","spent the first","the first five","first five years","five years of","years of his","of his life","his life ,","life , but",", but to","but to fill","to fill in","fill in the","in the empty","the empty spaces","empty spaces in","spaces in his","in his own","his own identity","own identity :","identity : two",": two parents","two parents ,","parents , two",", two countries","two countries ,","countries , two",", two very","two very different","very different cultures"],"2grams":["Fifteen years","years after","after having","having been","been kidnapped","kidnapped by","by his","his European","European mother","mother and","and taken","taken to","to Europe","Europe ,",", Mehdi","Mehdi ,",", now","now in","in his","his early","early twenties","twenties ,",", determines","determines to","to return","return to","to Morocco","Morocco without","without informing","informing her","The decision","decision to","to go","go back","back is","is provoked","provoked not","not only","only by","by the","the desire","desire to","to visit","visit his","his Moroccan","Moroccan father","father chez","chez lui","lui and","and see","see the","the country","country where","where he","he spent","spent the","the first","first five","five years","years of","of his","his life","life ,",", but","but to","to fill","fill in","in the","the empty","empty spaces","spaces in","in his","his own","own identity","identity :",": two","two parents","parents ,",", two","two countries","countries ,",", two","two very","very different","different cultures"]}

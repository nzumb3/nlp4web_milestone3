{"title":"Sacred Rage: The Hellbent Vision of Richard Williams","plot":"Follows the existential angst of a humble, wildly creative artist with Gothic sensibilities struggling to find his place in the modern world, while coping with the suicides of several of his closest friends. Ethereal beings, phantoms, and unsettling creatures inhabit Richard's inner vision, brought to life within the forests, haunted swamps, and supernatural landscapes of Cape Cod. Richard's compulsive need to make art has evolved into a sacred ritual giving his life meaning, even when all hope seems lost.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["Follow","the","existenti","angst","of","a","humbl",",","wild","creativ","artist","with","Gothic","sensibl","struggl","to","find","his","place","in","the","modern","world",",","while","cope","with","the","suicid","of","sever","of","his","closest","friend",".","Ethereal","be",",","phantom",",","and","unsettl","creatur","inhabit","Richard","'s","inner","vision",",","brought","to","life","within","the","forest",",","haunt","swamp",",","and","supernatur","landscap","of","Cape","Cod",".","Richard","'s","compuls","need","to","make","art","has","evolv","into","a","sacr","ritual","give","his","life","mean",",","even","when","all","hope","seem","lost","."],"lemmas":["follow","the","existential","angst","of","a","humble",",","wildly","creative","artist","with","gothic","sensibility","struggle","to","find","he","place","in","the","modern","world",",","while","cope","with","the","suicide","of","several","of","he","closest","friend",".","ethereal","being",",","phantom",",","and","unsettling","creature","inhabit","Richard","'s","inner","vision",",","bring","to","life","within","the","forest",",","haunted","swamp",",","and","supernatural","landscape","of","Cape","Cod",".","Richard","'s","compulsive","need","to","make","art","have","evolve","into","a","sacred","ritual","give","he","life","meaning",",","even","when","all","hope","seem","lose","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Follows the existential","the existential angst","existential angst of","angst of a","of a humble","a humble ,","humble , wildly",", wildly creative","wildly creative artist","creative artist with","artist with Gothic","with Gothic sensibilities","Gothic sensibilities struggling","sensibilities struggling to","struggling to find","to find his","find his place","his place in","place in the","in the modern","the modern world","modern world ,","world , while",", while coping","while coping with","coping with the","with the suicides","the suicides of","suicides of several","of several of","several of his","of his closest","his closest friends","Ethereal beings ,","beings , phantoms",", phantoms ,","phantoms , and",", and unsettling","and unsettling creatures","unsettling creatures inhabit","creatures inhabit Richard","inhabit Richard 's","Richard 's inner","'s inner vision","inner vision ,","vision , brought",", brought to","brought to life","to life within","life within the","within the forests","the forests ,","forests , haunted",", haunted swamps","haunted swamps ,","swamps , and",", and supernatural","and supernatural landscapes","supernatural landscapes of","landscapes of Cape","of Cape Cod","Richard 's compulsive","'s compulsive need","compulsive need to","need to make","to make art","make art has","art has evolved","has evolved into","evolved into a","into a sacred","a sacred ritual","sacred ritual giving","ritual giving his","giving his life","his life meaning","life meaning ,","meaning , even",", even when","even when all","when all hope","all hope seems","hope seems lost"],"2grams":["Follows the","the existential","existential angst","angst of","of a","a humble","humble ,",", wildly","wildly creative","creative artist","artist with","with Gothic","Gothic sensibilities","sensibilities struggling","struggling to","to find","find his","his place","place in","in the","the modern","modern world","world ,",", while","while coping","coping with","with the","the suicides","suicides of","of several","several of","of his","his closest","closest friends","Ethereal beings","beings ,",", phantoms","phantoms ,",", and","and unsettling","unsettling creatures","creatures inhabit","inhabit Richard","Richard 's","'s inner","inner vision","vision ,",", brought","brought to","to life","life within","within the","the forests","forests ,",", haunted","haunted swamps","swamps ,",", and","and supernatural","supernatural landscapes","landscapes of","of Cape","Cape Cod","Richard 's","'s compulsive","compulsive need","need to","to make","make art","art has","has evolved","evolved into","into a","a sacred","sacred ritual","ritual giving","giving his","his life","life meaning","meaning ,",", even","even when","when all","all hope","hope seems","seems lost"]}

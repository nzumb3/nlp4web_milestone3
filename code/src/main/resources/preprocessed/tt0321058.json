{"title":"90 Miles","plot":"Having grown up within the Cuban Revolution, in 1980, Juan Carlos Zaldívar was a 13-year-old \"pioneer\" jeering in the streets at the thousands of \"Marielitos\" leaving the island by boat for the United States. Within weeks, he was a Marielito himself, headed with the rest of his family for a new life in Miami. Now a U.S.-based filmmaker, Zaldívar recounts the strange twist of fate that took him across one of the world's most treacherous stretches of water in 90 Miles, a new documentary having its broadcast premiere on PBS's acclaimed P.O.V. series in the summer of 2003. As related by Zaldívar in the intensely personal and evocative 90 Miles, arrival in South Florida is only the beginning of the family's struggles to comprehend the full meaning of their passage into exile. What follows is an intimate and uneasy accounting of the historical forces that have split the Cuban national family in two, and which shape the passage of values from one generation to the next.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Have","grown","up","within","the","Cuban","Revolut",",","in","1980",",","Juan","Carlo","Zaldívar","was","a","13-year-old","\"","pioneer","\"","jeer","in","the","street","at","the","thousand","of","\"","Marielito","\"","leav","the","island","by","boat","for","the","Unite","State",".","Within","week",",","he","was","a","Marielito","himself",",","head","with","the","rest","of","his","famili","for","a","new","life","in","Miami",".","Now","a","U.S.-base","filmmak",",","Zaldívar","recount","the","strang","twist","of","fate","that","took","him","across","one","of","the","world","'s","most","treacher","stretch","of","water","in","90","Mile",",","a","new","documentari","have","it","broadcast","premier","on","PBS","'s","acclaim","P.O.V.","seri","in","the","summer","of","2003",".","As","relat","by","Zaldívar","in","the","intens","person","and","evoc","90","Mile",",","arriv","in","South","Florida","is","onli","the","begin","of","the","famili","'s","struggl","to","comprehend","the","full","mean","of","their","passag","into","exil",".","What","follow","is","an","intim","and","uneasi","account","of","the","histor","forc","that","have","split","the","Cuban","nation","famili","in","two",",","and","which","shape","the","passag","of","valu","from","one","generat","to","the","next","."],"lemmas":["have","grow","up","within","the","Cuban","Revolution",",","in","1980",",","Juan","Carlos","Zaldívar","be","a","13-year-old","``","pioneer","''","jeer","in","the","street","at","the","thousand","of","``","Marielitos","''","leave","the","island","by","boat","for","the","United","States",".","within","week",",","he","be","a","Marielito","himself",",","head","with","the","rest","of","he","family","for","a","new","life","in","Miami",".","now","a","u.s.-based","filmmaker",",","Zaldívar","recount","the","strange","twist","of","fate","that","take","he","across","one","of","the","world","'s","most","treacherous","stretch","of","water","in","90","Miles",",","a","new","documentary","have","its","broadcast","premiere","on","PBS","'s","acclaimed","P.O.V.","series","in","the","summer","of","2003",".","as","relate","by","Zaldívar","in","the","intensely","personal","and","evocative","90","Miles",",","arrival","in","South","Florida","be","only","the","beginning","of","the","family","'s","struggle","to","comprehend","the","full","meaning","of","they","passage","into","exile",".","what","follow","be","a","intimate","and","uneasy","accounting","of","the","historical","force","that","have","split","the","cuban","national","family","in","two",",","and","which","shape","the","passage","of","value","from","one","generation","to","the","next","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Having

{"title":"Não se pode viver sem amor","plot":"December 23rd. A series of random encounters will radically change the lives of various persons. Ten-year-old Gabriel and thirty-year-old Roseli arrive in Rio De Janeiro in search of the boy's father who left them years before. João is an unemployed young lawyer who is deeply in love and desperately seeks a way to improve his life. Pedro is a university researcher who lives with his father and is going thorough a period of drastic changes within his family. Gilda is a nightclub dancer willing to leave the city behind, but who is still held back by the happiness she once let slip through her fingers. All of them are living through borderline situations heightened by the imminent arrival of Christmas. However, it is from these unexpected encounters that they regain some hope as well as the feeling that it is not possible to live without love.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Decemb","23rd",".","A","seri","of","random","encount","will","radic","chang","the","live","of","various","person",".","Ten-year-old","Gabriel","and","thirty-year-old","Rose","arriv","in","Rio","De","Janeiro","in","search","of","the","boy","'s","father","who","left","them","year","befor",".","João","is","an","unemploy","young","lawyer","who","is","deepli","in","love","and","desper","seek","a","way","to","improv","his","life",".","Pedro","is","a","univers","research","who","live","with","his","father","and","is","go","thorough","a","period","of","drastic","chang","within","his","famili",".","Gilda","is","a","nightclub","dancer","will","to","leav","the","citi","behind",",","but","who","is","still","held","back","by","the","happi","she","onc","let","slip","through","her","finger",".","All","of","them","are","live","through","borderlin","situat","heighten","by","the","immin","arriv","of","Christma",".","Howev",",","it","is","from","these","unexpect","encount","that","they","regain","some","hope","as","well","as","the","feel","that","it","is","not","possibl","to","live","without","love","."],"lemmas":["December","23rd",".","a","series","of","random","encounter","will","radically","change","the","life","of","various","person",".","ten-year-old","Gabriel","and","thirty-year-old","roselus","arrive","in","Rio","De","Janeiro","in","search","of","the","boy","'s","father","who","leave","they","year","before",".","João","be","a","unemployed","young","lawyer","who","be","deeply","in","love","and","desperately","seek","a","way","to","improve","he","life",".","Pedro","be","a","university","researcher","who","live","with","he","father","and","be","go","thorough","a","period","of","drastic","change","within","he","family",".","Gilda","be","a","nightclub","dancer","willing","to","leave","the","city","behind",",","but","who","be","still","hold","back","by","the","happiness","she","once","let","slip","through","she","finger",".","all","of","they","be","live","through","borderline","situation","heighten","by","the","imminent","arrival","of","Christmas",".","however",",","it","be","from","these","unexpected","encounter","that","they","regain","some","hope","as","well","as","the","feeling","that","it","be","not","possible","to","live","without","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

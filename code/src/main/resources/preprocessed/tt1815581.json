{"title":"Air Transport Auxiliary","plot":"The Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was a British World War II civilian organisation that ferried new, repaired and damaged military aircraft between UK factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, Maintenance Units (MU), scrap yards, and active service squadrons and airfields-but not to aircraft carriers. It also flew service personnel on urgent duty from one place to another and performed air ambulance work. The documentary tells this remarkable but unknown story, through interviews with surviving ATA members, ATA historians, archive footage and re-enactments.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Air","Transport","Auxiliari","(","ATA",")","was","a","British","World","War","II","civilian","organis","that","ferri","new",",","repair","and","damag","militari","aircraft","between","UK","factori",",","assembl","plant",",","transatlant","deliveri","point",",","Mainten","Unit","(","MU",")",",","scrap","yard",",","and","activ","servic","squadron","and","airfields-but","not","to","aircraft","carrier",".","It","also","flew","servic","personnel","on","urgent","duti","from","one","place","to","anoth","and","perform","air","ambul","work",".","The","documentari","tell","this","remark","but","unknown","stori",",","through","interview","with","surviv","ATA","member",",","ATA","historian",",","archiv","footag","and","re-enact","."],"lemmas":["the","Air","Transport","Auxiliary","-lrb-","ata","-rrb-","be","a","british","world","war","ii","civilian","organisation","that","ferry","new",",","repair","and","damage","military","aircraft","between","UK","factory",",","assembly","plant",",","transatlantic","delivery","point",",","maintenance","unit","-lrb-","mu","-rrb-",",","scrap","yard",",","and","active","service","squadron","and","airfields-but","not","to","aircraft","carrier",".","it","also","fly","service","personnel","on","urgent","duty","from","one","place","to","another","and","perform","air","ambulance","work",".","the","documentary","tell","this","remarkable","but","unknown","story",",","through","interview","with","survive","ata","member",",","ata","historian",",","archive","footage","and","re-enactment","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Air Transport","Air Transport Auxiliary","Transport Auxiliary (","Auxiliary ( ATA","( ATA )","ATA ) was",") was a","was a British","a British World","British World War","World War II","War II civilian","II civilian organisation","civilian organisation that","organisation that ferried","that ferried new","ferried new ,","new , repaired",", repaired and","repaired and damaged","and damaged military","damaged military aircraft","military aircraft between","aircraft between UK","between UK factories","UK factories ,","factories , assembly",", assembly plants","assembly plants ,","plants , transatlantic",", transatlantic delivery","transatlantic delivery points","delivery points ,","points , Maintenance",", Maintenance Units","Maintenance Units (","Units ( MU","( MU )","MU ) ,",") , scrap",", scrap yards","scrap yards ,","yards , and",", and active","and active service","active service squadrons","service squadrons and","squadrons and airfields-but","and airfields-but not","airfields-but not to","not to aircraft","to aircraft carriers","It also flew","also flew service","flew service personnel","service personnel on","personnel on urgent","on urgent duty","urgent duty from","duty from one","from one place","one place to","place to another","to another and","another and performed","and performed air","performed air ambulance","air ambulance work","The documentary tells","documentary tells this","tells this remarkable","this remarkable but","remarkable but unknown","but unknown story","unknown story ,","story , through",", through interviews","through interviews with","interviews with surviving","with surviving ATA","surviving ATA members","ATA members ,","members , ATA",", ATA historians","ATA historians ,","historians , archive",", archive footage","archive footage and","footage and re-enactments"],"2grams":["The Air","Air Transport","Transport Auxiliary","Auxiliary (","( ATA","ATA )",") was","was a","a British","British World","World War","War II","II civilian","civilian organisation","organisation that","that ferried","ferried new","new ,",", repaired","repaired and","and damaged","damaged military","military aircraft","aircraft between","between UK","UK factories","factories ,",", assembly","assembly plants","plants ,",", transatlantic","transatlantic delivery","delivery points","points ,",", Maintenance","Maintenance Units","Units (","( MU","MU )",") ,",", scrap","scrap yards","yards ,",", and","and active","active service","service squadrons","squadrons and","and airfields-but","airfields-but not","not to","to aircraft","aircraft carriers","It also","also flew","flew service","service personnel","personnel on","on urgent","urgent duty","duty from","from one","one place","place to","to another","another and","and performed","performed air","air ambulance","ambulance work","The documentary","documentary tells","tells this","this remarkable","remarkable but","but unknown","unknown story","story ,",", through","through interviews","interviews with","with surviving","surviving ATA","ATA members","members ,",", ATA","ATA historians","historians ,",", archive","archive footage","footage and","and re-enactments"]}

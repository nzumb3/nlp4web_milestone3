{"title":"The Banned Woman","plot":"This movie is foremost distinguished by the use of a subjective camera, and nearly 100 % of the time consists of close-up of Isabelle Carré's face. She is capable of changing her facial mimic so much that she never looks artificial or inappropriate. 39-year-old François meets 22-year-old Muriel, who is a virgin. Several times he invites her to fine restaurants. She agrees that on a certain day they will meet at a hotel and he will see her naked. He promises not to sleep with her at that occasion. He does not keep his promise. She is happy that he didn't. Both continue to be eager for sex. While waiting for the first dish on a luxury restaurant she goes to the men's room and dresses starch naked, while he follows after a few minutes. However, she eventually gets a young boyfriend. She tells him everything. He calls François's wife, who immediately demands a divorce. When François and Muriel meet accidentally in the street, it becomes clear that she feels neither any intent to harm him, nor any regret that he is indeed harmed. It is simply none of her business.","genres":["Drama","

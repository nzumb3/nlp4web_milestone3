{"title":"The Conflict Zone","plot":"The Soviet Union has collapsed. Civil and ethnic wars have broken out in Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia, three republics in the Caucasus. The post-Soviet Caucasus have turned into one large conflict zone. Two radically different people with different ideals, problems, and goals are united by the conflict zone. Gogliko, a Tbilisi street boy, and Spartak, a Sukhumi sniper, are forced to solve problems of the street and problems of the state together. For one, the goal is to get back the money he lost gambling; for the other, it is to carry out a general's absurd military mission. In spite of it all, their paths cross and their lives are changed forever.","genres":["Drama"," War"],"stems":["The","Soviet","Union","has","collaps",".","Civil","and","ethnic","war","have","broken","out","in","Georgia",",","Azerbaijan",",","and","Armenia",",","three","republ","in","the","Caucasus",".","The","post-Soviet","Caucasus","have","turn","into","one","larg","conflict","zone",".","Two","radic","differ","peopl","with","differ","ideal",",","problem",",","and","goal","are","unit","by","the","conflict","zone",".","Gogliko",",","a","Tbilisi","street","boy",",","and","Spartak",",","a","Sukhumi","sniper",",","are","forc","to","solv","problem","of","the","street","and","problem","of","the","state","togeth",".","For","one",",","the","goal","is","to","get","back","the","money","he","lost","gambl",";","for","the","other",",","it","is","to","carri","out","a","general","'s","absurd","militari","mission",".","In","spite","of","it","all",",","their","path","cross","and","their","live","are","chang","forev","."],"lemmas":["the","Soviet","Union","have","collapse",".","civil","and","ethnic","war","have","break","out","in","Georgia",",","Azerbaijan",",","and","Armenia",",","three","republic","in","the","Caucasus",".","the","post-Soviet","Caucasus","have","turn","into","one","large","conflict","zone",".","two","radically","different","people","with","different","ideal",",","problem",",","and","goal","be","unite","by","the","conflict","zone",".","Gogliko",",","a","Tbilisi","street","boy",",","and","Spartak",",","a","Sukhumi","sniper",",","be","force","to","solve","problem","of","the","street","and","problem","of","the","state","together",".","for","one",",","the","goal","be","to","get","back","the","money","he","lose","gambling",";","for","the","other",",","it","be","to","carry","out","a","general","'s","absurd","military","mission",".","in","spite","of","it","all",",","they","path","cross","and","they","life","be","change","forever","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Soviet Union","Soviet Union has","Union has collapsed","Civil and ethnic","and ethnic wars","ethnic wars have","wars have broken","have broken out","broken out in","out in Georgia","in Georgia ,","Georgia , Azerbaijan",", Azerbaijan ,","Azerbaijan , and",", and Armenia","and Armenia ,","Armenia , three",", three republics","three republics in","republics in the","in the Caucasus","The post-Soviet Caucasus","post-Soviet Caucasus have","Caucasus have turned","have turned into","turned into one","into one large","one large conflict","large conflict zone","Two radically different","radically different people","different people with","people with different","with different ideals","different ideals ,","ideals , problems",", problems ,","problems , and",", and goals","and goals are","goals are united","are united by","united by the","by the conflict","the conflict zone","Gogliko , a",", a Tbilisi","a Tbilisi street","Tbilisi street boy","street boy ,","boy , and",", and Spartak","and Spartak ,","Spartak , a",", a Sukhumi","a Sukhumi sniper","Sukhumi sniper ,","sniper , are",", are forced","are forced to","forced to solve","to solve problems","solve problems of","problems of the","of the street","the street and","street and problems","and problems of","problems of the","of the state","the state together","For one ,","one , the",", the goal","the goal is","goal is to","is to get","to get back","get back the","back the money","the money he","money he lost","he lost gambling","lost gambling ;","gambling ;

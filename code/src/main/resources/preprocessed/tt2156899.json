{"title":"Naa Ishtam","plot":"Gani (Rana) is a Telugu youth who lives and works in Malaysia and he is an extremely selfish person. He always thinks about himself and his benefits first. Into his routine life comes Krishnaveni (Genelia) unexpectedly and everything gets disturbed. Krishnaveni loves Kishore (Harshavardhan Rane) and she elopes from home as her dad Naidu (Nasser) does not approve of her choice. But Kishore doesn't turn up and she feels cheated. Gani's selfish nature gets him to lie to Krishnaveni and he takes her home to Naidu in the hope of making some money. But Gani realises his mistake once he sees Naidu and family and he gets Krishnaveni back to Malaysia. As a cheated Krishnaveni begins rebuilding her life with Gani's support, love blossoms between the two. Into this situation walks in Kishore and he is desperate to win back Krishnaveni's love. Meanwhile, Naidu is furious about the whole episode and he engages the services of Malaysia Don Salim Bhai (Shawar Ali) to trap Gani. Gani uses all his guile to thwart Salim Bhai and throw Kishore off the track, but is he successful? Who will Krishnaveni accept in the end? That forms the story.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Gani","(","Rana",")","is","a","Telugu","youth","who","live","and","work","in","Malaysia","and","he","is","an","extrem","selfish","person",".","He","alway","think","about","himself","and","his","benefit","first",".","Into","his","routin","life","come","Krishnaveni","(","Genelia",")","unexpect","and","everyth","get","disturb",".","Krishnaveni","love","Kishor","(","Harshavardhan","Rane",")","and","she","elop","from","home","as","her","dad","Naidu","(","Nasser",")","doe","not","approv","of","her","choic",".","But","Kishor","doe","n't","turn","up","and","she","feel","cheat",".","Gani","'s","selfish","natur","get","him","to","lie","to","Krishnaveni","and","he","take","her","home","to","Naidu","in","the","hope","of","make","some","money",".","But","Gani","realis","his","mistak","onc","he","see","Naidu","and","famili","and","he","get","Krishnaveni","back","to","Malaysia",".","As","a","cheat","Krishnaveni","begin","rebuild","her","life","with","Gani","'s","support",",","love","blossom","between","the","two",".","Into","this","situat","walk","in","Kishor","and","he","is","desper","to","win","back","Krishnaveni","'s","love",".","Meanwhil",",","Naidu","is","furious","about","the","whole","episod","and","he","engag","the","servic","of","Malaysia","Don","Salim","Bhai","(","Shawar","Ali",")","to","trap","Gani",".","Gani","use","all","his","guil","to","thwart","Salim","Bhai","and","throw","Kishor","off","the","track",",","but","is","he","success","?","Who","will","Krishnaveni","accept","in","the","end","?","That","form","the","stori","."],"lemmas":["Gani","-lrb-","Rana","-rrb-","be","a","Telugu","youth","who","live","and","work","in","Malaysia","and","he","be","a","extremely","selfish","person",".","he","always","think","about","himself","and","he","benefit","first",".","Into","he","routine","life","come","Krishnaveni","-lrb-","Genelia","-rrb-","unexpectedly","and","everything","get","disturbed",".","Krishnaveni","love","Kishore","-lrb-","Harshavardhan","Rane","-rrb-","and","she","elope","from","home","as","she","dad","Naidu","-lrb-","Nasser","-rrb-","do","not","approve","of","she","choice",".","but","Kishore","do","not","turn","up","and","she","feel","cheat",".","Gani","'s","selfish","nature","get","he","to","lie","to","Krishnaveni","and","he","take","she","home","to","Naidu","in","the","hope","of","make","some","money",".","but","Gani","realise","he","mistake","once","he","see","Naidu","and","family","and","he","get","Krishnaveni","back","to","Malaysia",".","as","a","cheat","Krishnaveni","begin","rebuild","she","life","with","Gani","'s","support",",","love","blossom","between","the","two",".","Into","this","situation","walk","in","Kishore","and","he","be","desperate","to","win","back","Krishnaveni","'s","love",".","meanwhile",",","Naidu","be","furious","about","the","whole","episode","and","he","engage","the","service","of","Malaysia","Don","Salim","Bhai","-lrb-","Shawar","Ali","-rrb-","to","trap","Gani",".","Gani","use","all","he","guile","to","thwart","Salim","Bhai","and","throw","Kishore","off","the","track",",","but","be","he","successful","?","who","will","Krishnaveni","accept","in","the","end","?","that","form","the","story","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gani

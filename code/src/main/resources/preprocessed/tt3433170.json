{"title":"The King of the Streets","plot":"Yue Feng (Yue Song) is a young thug with exceptional streetfighting abilities. He will stop at nothing to defeat all challengers - until, in an tragic accident, he kills a fellow competitor and is sent to prison. Eight years later, Yue Feng emerges a changed man. He no longer fights, and is looking for a new life of peace and fulfillment. But it's brutal on the streets, and redemption doesn't come easy. His brotherhood is destroyed, family members murdered, and a loved one humiliated - a deadly chain reaction that leaves him no choice but to unleash his power in the name of justice. The King of the Streets, China's first street-fighting movie, pits real-life martial artist Yue Song against more than 10 of the world's top contenders in MMA, Jiu-jitsu, Jeet Kune Do, Sanda, and Muay Thai boxing.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Yue","Feng","(","Yue","Song",")","is","a","young","thug","with","except","streetfight","abil",".","He","will","stop","at","noth","to","defeat","all","challeng","-","until",",","in","an","tragic","accid",",","he","kill","a","fellow","competitor","and","is","sent","to","prison",".","Eight","year","later",",","Yue","Feng","emerg","a","chang","man",".","He","no","longer","fight",",","and","is","look","for","a","new","life","of","peac","and","fulfil",".","But","it","'s","brutal","on","the","street",",","and","redempt","doe","n't","come","easi",".","His","brotherhood","is","destroy",",","famili","member","murder",",","and","a","love","one","humili","-","a","dead","chain","reaction","that","leav","him","no","choic","but","to","unleash","his","power","in","the","name","of","justic",".","The","King","of","the","Street",",","China","'s","first","street-fight","movi",",","pit","real-lif","martial","artist","Yue","Song","against","more","than","10","of","the","world","'s","top","contend","in","MMA",",","Jiu-jitsu",",","Jeet","Kune","Do",",","Sanda",",","and","Muay","Thai","box","."],"lemmas":["yue","feng","-lrb-","yue","song","-rrb-","be","a","young","thug","with","exceptional","streetfight","ability",".","he","will","stop","at","nothing","to","defeat","all","challenger","-","until",",","in","a","tragic","accident",",","he","kill","a","fellow","competitor","and","be","send","to","prison",".","eight","year","later",",","Yue","Feng","emerge","a","changed","man",".","he","no","longer","fight",",","and","be","look","for","a","new","life","of","peace","and","fulfillment",".","but","it","be","brutal","on","the","street",",","and","redemption","do","not","come","easy",".","he","brotherhood","be","destroy",",","family","member","murder",",","and","a","love","one","humiliate","-","a","deadly","chain","reaction","that","leave","he","no","choice","but","to","unleash","he","power","in","the","name","of","justice",".","the","King","of","the","Streets",",","China","'s","first","street-fighting","movie",",","pit","real-life","martial","artist","yue","song","against","more","than","10","of","the","world","'s","top","contender","in","MMA",",","Jiu-jitsu",",","Jeet","Kune","Do",",","Sanda",",","and","Muay","Thai","boxing","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Yue Feng (","Feng ( Yue","( Yue Song","Yue Song )","Song ) is",") is a","is a young","a young thug","young thug with","thug with exceptional","with exceptional streetfighting","exceptional streetfighting abilities","He will stop","will stop at","stop at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to defeat","to defeat all","defeat all challengers","all challengers -","challengers -

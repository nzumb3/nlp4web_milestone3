{"title":"Lun√°tico","plot":"Eduardo and Rosario are 84 years old and they've been married for over 70 years. The love between them is the result of a lifetime of peaceful coexistence full of esteem: a once-in-a-lifetime love. When rosario becomes sick, Eduardo starts acting strangely: He is gone in the afternoons and does odd experiments at night. At his age, fear of the impossible does not seem to exist. His grandson Edu decides to investigate what's happening and it doesn't take him long to discover the truth.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Eduardo","and","Rosario","are","84","year","old","and","they","ve","been","marri","for","over","70","year",".","The","love","between","them","is","the","result","of","a","lifetim","of","peac","coexist","full","of","esteem",":","a","once-in-a-lifetim","love",".","When","rosario","becom","sick",",","Eduardo","start","act","strang",":","He","is","gone","in","the","afternoon","and","doe","odd","experi","at","night",".","At","his","age",",","fear","of","the","imposs","doe","not","seem","to","exist",".","His","grandson","Edu","decid","to","investig","what","'s","happen","and","it","doe","n't","take","him","long","to","discov","the","truth","."],"lemmas":["Eduardo","and","Rosario","be","84","year","old","and","they","have","be","marry","for","over","70","year",".","the","love","between","they","be","the","result","of","a","lifetime","of","peaceful","coexistence","full","of","esteem",":","a","once-in-a-lifetime","love",".","when","rosario","become","sick",",","Eduardo","start","act","strangely",":","he","be","go","in","the","afternoon","and","do","odd","experiment","at","night",".","at","he","age",",","fear","of","the","impossible","do","not","seem","to","exist",".","he","grandson","Edu","decide","to","investigate","what","be","happen","and","it","do","not","take","he","long","to","discover","the","truth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Eduardo and Rosario","and Rosario are","Rosario are 84","are 84 years","84 years old","years old and","old and they","and they 've","they 've been","'ve been married","been married for","married for over","for over 70","over 70 years","The love between","love between them","between them is","them is the","is the result","the result of","result of a","of a lifetime","a lifetime of","lifetime of peaceful","of peaceful coexistence","peaceful coexistence full","coexistence full of","full of esteem","of esteem :","esteem : a",": a once-in-a-lifetime","a once-in-a-lifetime love","When rosario becomes","rosario becomes sick","becomes sick ,","sick , Eduardo",", Eduardo starts","Eduardo starts acting","starts acting strangely","acting strangely :","strangely : He",": He is","He is gone","is gone in","gone in the","in the afternoons","the afternoons and","afternoons and does","and does odd","does odd experiments","odd experiments at","experiments at night","At his age","his age ,","age , fear",", fear of","fear of the","of the impossible","the impossible does","impossible does not","does not seem","not seem to","seem to exist","His grandson Edu","grandson Edu decides","Edu decides to","decides to investigate","to investigate what","investigate what 's","what 's happening","'s happening and","happening and it","and it does","it does n't","does n't take","n't take him","take him long","him long to","long to discover","to discover the","discover the truth"],"2grams":["Eduardo and","and Rosario","Rosario are","are 84","84 years","years old","old and","and they","they 've","'ve been","been married","married for","for over","over 70","70 years","The love","love between","between them","them is","is the","the result","result of","of a","a lifetime","lifetime of","of peaceful","peaceful coexistence","coexistence full","full of","of esteem","esteem :",": a","a once-in-a-lifetime","once-in-a-lifetime love","When rosario","rosario becomes","becomes sick","sick ,",", Eduardo","Eduardo starts","starts acting","acting strangely","strangely :",": He","He is","is gone","gone in","in the","the afternoons","afternoons and","and does","does odd","odd experiments","experiments at","at night","At his","his age","age ,",", fear","fear of","of the","the impossible","impossible does","does not","not seem","seem to","to exist","His grandson","grandson Edu","Edu decides","decides to","to investigate","investigate what","what 's","'s happening","happening and","and it","it does","does n't","n't take","take him","him long","long to","to discover","discover the","the truth"]}

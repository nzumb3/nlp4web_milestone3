{"title":"East","plot":"Sometimes, life takes the most unexpected of turns. When their parents are killed in a tragic accident, Elva and Sammy run away from home; heading East to find a better life. But things don't go to plan and all too soon they're in need of help. Then they meet Tristant, a French man on a journey of his own, who takes them under his wing. In the short time that they have together, an extraordinary bond begins to grow between them in a story which reminds us that life is about the journey, not the destination, and that love is more beautiful, more delicate and sometimes more unexpected than we can ever describe.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Sometim",",","life","take","the","most","unexpect","of","turn",".","When","their","parent","are","kill","in","a","tragic","accid",",","Elva","and","Sammi","run","away","from","home",";","head","East","to","find","a","better","life",".","But","thing","do","n't","go","to","plan","and","all","too","soon","they","re","in","need","of","help",".","Then","they","meet","Tristant",",","a","French","man","on","a","journey","of","his","own",",","who","take","them","under","his","wing",".","In","the","short","time","that","they","have","togeth",",","an","extraordinari","bond","begin","to","grow","between","them","in","a","stori","which","remind","us","that","life","is","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destin",",","and","that","love","is","more","beauti",",","more","delic","and","sometim","more","unexpect","than","we","can","ever","describ","."],"lemmas":["sometimes",",","life","take","the","most","unexpected","of","turn",".","when","they","parent","be","kill","in","a","tragic","accident",",","Elva","and","Sammy","run","away","from","home",";","head","East","to","find","a","better","life",".","but","thing","do","not","go","to","plan","and","all","too","soon","they","be","in","need","of","help",".","then","they","meet","Tristant",",","a","french","man","on","a","journey","of","he","own",",","who","take","they","under","he","wing",".","in","the","short","time","that","they","have","together",",","a","extraordinary","bond","begin","to","grow","between","they","in","a","story","which","remind","we","that","life","be","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destination",",","and","that","love","be","more","beautiful",",","more","delicate","and","sometimes","more","unexpected","than","we","can","ever","describe","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sometimes , life",", life takes","life takes the","takes the most","the most unexpected","most unexpected of","unexpected of turns","When their parents","their parents are","parents are killed","are killed in","killed in a","in a tragic","a tragic accident","tragic accident ,","accident , Elva",", Elva and","Elva and Sammy","and Sammy run","Sammy run away","run away from","away from home","from home ;","home ;

{"title":"Glass City","plot":"Mike Stegman is turning 30, living in Toledo and going nowhere. He's worked at the same Laundromat for 10 years, he has few friends to speak of, his relationship with his family is on the rocks, and the book he never finished lies dormant on his computer desk. At the request of his estranged sister Sarah, Mike hesitantly joins up with an amateur theatre company for their summer production of Death of a Salesman. Over the course of the summer, Mike is transformed, coming out of his emotional shell and developing new friendships and a relationship with the young, spunky tech director Emma Swanson, a girl nine years his junior. The film follows Mike on a summer journey of self-discovery and forgiveness, as he realizes that the city and people he's come to loathe may just save him in ways he never could have expected.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Mike","Stegman","is","turn","30",",","live","in","Toledo","and","go","nowher",".","He","'s","work","at","the","same","Laundromat","for","10","year",",","he","has","few","friend","to","speak","of",",","his","relationship","with","his","famili","is","on","the","rock",",","and","the","book","he","never","finish","lie","dormant","on","his","comput","desk",".","At","the","request","of","his","estrang","sister","Sarah",",","Mike","hesit","join","up","with","an","amateur","theatr","compani","for","their","summer","product","of","Death","of","a","Salesman",".","Over","the","cours","of","the","summer",",","Mike","is","transform",",","come","out","of","his","emot","shell","and","develop","new","friendship","and","a","relationship","with","the","young",",","spunki","tech","director","Emma","Swanson",",","a","girl","nine","year","his","junior",".","The","film","follow","Mike","on","a","summer","journey","of","self-discoveri","and","forgiv",",","as","he","realiz","that","the","citi","and","peopl","he","'s","come","to","loath","may","just","save","him","in","way","he","never","could","have","expect","."],"lemmas":["Mike","Stegman","be","turn","30",",","live","in","Toledo","and","go","nowhere",".","he","be","work","at","the","same","laundromat","for","10","year",",","he","have","few","friend","to","speak","of",",","he","relationship","with","he","family","be","on","the","rock",",","and","the","book","he","never","finish","lie","dormant","on","he","computer","desk",".","at","the","request","of","he","estrange","sister","Sarah",",","Mike","hesitantly","join","up","with","a","amateur","theatre","company","for","they","summer","production","of","death","of","a","salesman",".","over","the","course","of","the","summer",",","Mike","be","transform",",","come","out","of","he","emotional","shell","and","develop","new","friendship","and","a","relationship","with","the","young",",","spunky","tech","director","Emma","Swanson",",","a","girl","nine","year","he","junior",".","the","film","follow","Mike","on","a","summer","journey","of","self-discovery","and","forgiveness",",","as","he","realize","that","the","city","and","people","he","be","come","to","loathe","may","just","save","he","in","way","he","never","could","have","expect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mike

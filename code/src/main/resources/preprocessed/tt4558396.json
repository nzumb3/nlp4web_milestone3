{"title":"Egon Schiele: Death and the Maiden","plot":"At the beginning of the 20th Century Egon Schiele is one of the most provocative artists in Vienna. His life and work are driven by beautiful women and an era that is coming to an end. Two women will have a lasting impact on him - his sister and first muse Gerti, and 17 year old Wally, arguably Schiele's one true love, immortalized in his famous painting 'Death and the Maiden'. Schiele's radical paintings scandalize Viennese society while daring artists like Gustav Klimt and art agents alike are sensing the exceptional. But Egon Schiele is also prepared to go beyond his own pain and to sacrifice Love and Life for his Art. Art that inspires us up to this day.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["At","the","begin","of","the","20th","Centuri","Egon","Schiel","is","one","of","the","most","provoc","artist","in","Vienna",".","His","life","and","work","are","driven","by","beauti","women","and","an","era","that","is","come","to","an","end",".","Two","women","will","have","a","last","impact","on","him","-","his","sister","and","first","muse","Gerti",",","and","17","year","old","Walli",",","arguabl","Schiel","'s","one","true","love",",","immort","in","his","famous","paint","'","Death","and","the","Maiden","'",".","Schiel","'s","radic","paint","scandal","Viennes","societi","while","dare","artist","like","Gustav","Klimt","and","art","agent","alik","are","sens","the","except",".","But","Egon","Schiel","is","also","prepar","to","go","beyond","his","own","pain","and","to","sacrific","Love","and","Life","for","his","Art",".","Art","that","inspir","us","up","to","this","day","."],"lemmas":["at","the","beginning","of","the","20th","Century","Egon","Schiele","be","one","of","the","most","provocative","artist","in","Vienna",".","he","life","and","work","be","drive","by","beautiful","woman","and","a","era","that","be","come","to","a","end",".","two","woman","will","have","a","lasting","impact","on","he","-","he","sister","and","first","muse","Gerti",",","and","17","year","old","Wally",",","arguably","Schiele","'s","one","true","love",",","immortalize","in","he","famous","painting","'","death","and","the","Maiden","'",".","Schiele","'s","radical","painting","scandalize","viennese","society","while","daring","artist","like","Gustav","Klimt","and","art","agent","alike","be","sense","the","exceptional",".","but","Egon","Schiele","be","also","prepare","to","go","beyond","he","own","pain","and","to","sacrifice","Love","and","Life","for","he","art",".","art","that","inspire","we","up","to","this","day","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["At the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of the","of the 20th","the 20th Century","20th Century Egon","Century Egon Schiele","Egon Schiele is","Schiele is one","is one of","one of the","of the most","the most provocative","most provocative artists","provocative artists in","artists in Vienna","His life and","life and work","and work are","work are driven","are driven by","driven by beautiful","by beautiful women","beautiful women and","women and an","and an era","an era that","era that is","that is coming","is coming to","coming to an","to an end","Two women will","women will have","will have a","have a lasting","a lasting impact","lasting impact on","impact on him","on him -","him -

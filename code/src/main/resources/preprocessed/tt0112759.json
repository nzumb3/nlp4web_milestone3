{"title":"Curtis's Charm","plot":"This film, based on a Jim Carroll short story, recounts the tale of Curtis and his encounter with voodoo. Curtis is a drug addict who has become paranoid, thinking that his wife's mother has cast evil spells on him. He meets his friend Jim and asks him for help in counteracting her black magic. Jim tries to reason with his friend, but when that fails, he decides to play along and make him a talisman. Drawing a snake on a scrap of paper and mumbling an incantation, Jim gives him this charm. This immediately solves Curtis's problems...or does it?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["This","film",",","base","on","a","Jim","Carrol","short","stori",",","recount","the","tale","of","Curti","and","his","encount","with","voodoo",".","Curti","is","a","drug","addict","who","has","becom","paranoid",",","think","that","his","wife","'s","mother","has","cast","evil","spell","on","him",".","He","meet","his","friend","Jim","and","ask","him","for","help","in","counteract","her","black","magic",".","Jim","tri","to","reason","with","his","friend",",","but","when","that","fail",",","he","decid","to","play","along","and","make","him","a","talisman",".","Draw","a","snake","on","a","scrap","of","paper","and","mumbl","an","incant",",","Jim","give","him","this","charm",".","This","immedi","solv","Curti","'s","problem","...","or","doe","it","?"],"lemmas":["this","film",",","base","on","a","Jim","Carroll","short","story",",","recount","the","tale","of","Curtis","and","he","encounter","with","voodoo",".","Curtis","be","a","drug","addict","who","have","become","paranoid",",","think","that","he","wife","'s","mother","have","cast","evil","spell","on","he",".","he","meet","he","friend","Jim","and","ask","he","for","help","in","counteract","she","black","magic",".","Jim","try","to","reason","with","he","friend",",","but","when","that","fail",",","he","decide","to","play","along","and","make","he","a","talisman",".","draw","a","snake","on","a","scrap","of","paper","and","mumble","a","incantation",",","Jim","give","he","this","charm",".","this","immediately","solve","Curtis","'s","problem","...","or","do","it","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film ,","film , based",", based on","based on a","on a Jim","a Jim Carroll","Jim Carroll short","Carroll short story","short story ,","story , recounts",", recounts the","recounts the tale","the tale of","tale of Curtis","of Curtis and","Curtis and his","and his encounter","his encounter with","encounter with voodoo","Curtis is a","is a drug","a drug addict","drug addict who","addict who has","who has become","has become paranoid","become paranoid ,","paranoid , thinking",", thinking that","thinking that his","that his wife","his wife 's","wife 's mother","'s mother has","mother has cast","has cast evil","cast evil spells","evil spells on","spells on him","He meets his","meets his friend","his friend Jim","friend Jim and","Jim and asks","and asks him","asks him for","him for help","for help in","help in counteracting","in counteracting her","counteracting her black","her black magic","Jim tries to","tries to reason","to reason with","reason with his","with his friend","his friend ,","friend , but",", but when","but when that","when that fails","that fails ,","fails , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to play","to play along","play along and","along and make","and make him","make him a","him a talisman","Drawing a snake","a snake on","snake on a","on a scrap","a scrap of","scrap of paper","of paper and","paper and mumbling","and mumbling an","mumbling an incantation","an incantation ,","incantation , Jim",", Jim gives","Jim gives him","gives him this","him this charm","This immediately solves","immediately solves Curtis","solves Curtis 's","Curtis 's problems","'s problems ...","problems ... or","... or does","or does it"],"2grams":["This film","film ,",", based","based on","on a","a Jim","Jim Carroll","Carroll short","short story","story ,",", recounts","recounts the","the tale","tale of","of Curtis","Curtis and","and his","his encounter","encounter with","with voodoo","Curtis is","is a","a drug","drug addict","addict who","who has","has become","become paranoid","paranoid ,",", thinking","thinking that","that his","his wife","wife 's","'s mother","mother has","has cast","cast evil","evil spells","spells on","on him","He meets","meets his","his friend","friend Jim","Jim and","and asks","asks him","him for","for help","help in","in counteracting","counteracting her","her black","black magic","Jim tries","tries to","to reason","reason with","with his","his friend","friend ,",", but","but when","when that","that fails","fails ,",", he","he decides","decides to","to play","play along","along and","and make","make him","him a","a talisman","Drawing a","a snake","snake on","on a","a scrap","scrap of","of paper","paper and","and mumbling","mumbling an","an incantation","incantation ,",", Jim","Jim gives","gives him","him this","this charm","This immediately","immediately solves","solves Curtis","Curtis 's","'s problems","problems ...","... or","or does","does it"]}

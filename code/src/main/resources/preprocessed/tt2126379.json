{"title":"The Magic Life","plot":"\"The Magic Life\" chronicles the journey of three magician hopefuls: a 17-year-old from Beijing who travels to the U.S. to attend magic school, a 25-year-old trying to make rent by performing on Hollywood Blvd for tips, and a 32-year-old New York University MBA graduate who moves to Los Angeles to perform at the world famous Magic Castle. The film depicts the challenges of following an unconventional career path. Forget about parents, family, or friends who may not understand or support your choices - there's almost an invisible societal pressure in terms of what types of jobs are acceptable. \"The Magic Life\" is about those who are willing to risk everything to take the road not normally taken. Sometimes the risk pays off, sometimes it doesn't.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["\"","The","Magic","Life","\"","chronicl","the","journey","of","three","magician","hope",":","a","17-year-old","from","Beij","who","travel","to","the","U.S.","to","attend","magic","school",",","a","25-year-old","tri","to","make","rent","by","perform","on","Hollywood","Blvd","for","tip",",","and","a","32-year-old","New","York","Univers","MBA","graduat","who","move","to","Los","Angele","to","perform","at","the","world","famous","Magic","Castl",".","The","film","depict","the","challeng","of","follow","an","unconvent","career","path",".","Forget","about","parent",",","famili",",","or","friend","who","may","not","understand","or","support","your","choic","-","there","'s","almost","an","invis","societ","pressur","in","term","of","what","type","of","job","are","accept",".","\"","The","Magic","Life","\"","is","about","those","who","are","will","to","risk","everyth","to","take","the","road","not","normal","taken",".","Sometim","the","risk","pay","off",",","sometim","it","doe","n't","."],"lemmas":["``","the","Magic","Life","''","chronicle","the","journey","of","three","magician","hopeful",":","a","17-year-old","from","Beijing","who","travel","to","the","U.S.","to","attend","magic","school",",","a","25-year-old","try","to","make","rent","by","perform","on","Hollywood","Blvd","for","tip",",","and","a","32-year-old","New","York","University","MBA","graduate","who","move","to","Los","Angeles","to","perform","at","the","world","famous","Magic","Castle",".","the","film","depict","the","challenge","of","follow","a","unconventional","career","path",".","forget","about","parent",",","family",",","or","friend","who","may","not","understand","or","support","you","choice","-","there","be","almost","a","invisible","societal","pressure","in","term","of","what","type","of","job","be","acceptable",".","``","the","Magic","Life","''","be","about","those","who","be","willing","to","risk","everything","to","take","the","road","not","normally","take",".","sometimes","the","risk","pay","off",",","sometimes","it","do","not","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" The Magic","The Magic Life","Magic Life \"","Life \" chronicles","\" chronicles the","chronicles the journey","the journey of","journey of three","of three magician","three magician hopefuls","magician hopefuls :","hopefuls : a",": a 17-year-old","a 17-year-old from","17-year-old from Beijing","from Beijing who","Beijing who travels","who travels to","travels to the","to the U.S.","the U.S. to","U.S. to attend","to attend magic","attend magic school","magic school ,","school , a",", a 25-year-old","a 25-year-old trying","25-year-old trying to","trying to make","to make rent","make rent by","rent by performing","by performing on","performing on Hollywood","on Hollywood Blvd","Hollywood Blvd for","Blvd for tips","for tips ,","tips , and",", and a","and a 32-year-old","a 32-year-old New","32-year-old New York","New York University","York University MBA","University MBA graduate","MBA graduate who","graduate who moves","who moves to","moves to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles to","Angeles to perform","to perform at","perform at the","at the world","the world famous","world famous Magic","famous Magic Castle","The film depicts","film depicts the","depicts the challenges","the challenges of","challenges of following","of following an","following an unconventional","an unconventional career","unconventional career path","Forget about parents","about parents ,","parents , family",", family ,","family , or",", or friends","or friends who","friends who may","who may not","may not understand","not understand or","understand or support","or support your","support your choices","your choices -","choices -

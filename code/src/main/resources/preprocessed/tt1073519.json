{"title":"Troubadours","plot":"On the surface it seems that everything is fine with Calvin. He's your average twenty-one-year-old who hangs out with his friends and goes out looking for girls. However, beneath the surface, Calvin still hasn't learned how to deal with his father's death, or even muster the courage to move out of his mother's house, and his only means of dealing with any of this is by drinking. Forced to see a \"life specialist,\" Calvin remains steadfast in his ways until the one thing comes along that makes him want to change for the better: a beautiful girl.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["On","the","surfac","it","seem","that","everyth","is","fine","with","Calvin",".","He","'s","your","averag","twenty-one-year-old","who","hang","out","with","his","friend","and","goe","out","look","for","girl",".","Howev",",","beneath","the","surfac",",","Calvin","still","has","n't","learn","how","to","deal","with","his","father","'s","death",",","or","even","muster","the","courag","to","move","out","of","his","mother","'s","hous",",","and","his","onli","mean","of","deal","with","ani","of","this","is","by","drink",".","Forc","to","see","a","\"","life","specialist",",","\"","Calvin","remain","steadfast","in","his","way","until","the","one","thing","come","along","that","make","him","want","to","chang","for","the","better",":","a","beauti","girl","."],"lemmas":["on","the","surface","it","seem","that","everything","be","fine","with","Calvin",".","he","be","you","average","twenty-one-year-old","who","hang","out","with","he","friend","and","go","out","look","for","girl",".","however",",","beneath","the","surface",",","Calvin","still","have","not","learn","how","to","deal","with","he","father","'s","death",",","or","even","muster","the","courage","to","move","out","of","he","mother","'s","house",",","and","he","only","means","of","deal","with","any","of","this","be","by","drinking",".","force","to","see","a","``","life","specialist",",","''","Calvin","remain","steadfast","in","he","way","until","the","one","thing","come","along","that","make","he","want","to","change","for","the","better",":","a","beautiful","girl","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On the surface","the surface it","surface it seems","it seems that","seems that everything","that everything is","everything is fine","is fine with","fine with Calvin","He 's your","'s your average","your average twenty-one-year-old","average twenty-one-year-old who","twenty-one-year-old who hangs","who hangs out","hangs out with","out with his","with his friends","his friends and","friends and goes","and goes out","goes out looking","out looking for","looking for girls","However , beneath",", beneath the","beneath the surface","the surface ,","surface , Calvin",", Calvin still","Calvin still has","still has n't","has n't learned","n't learned how","learned how to","how to deal","to deal with","deal with his","with his father","his father 's","father 's death","'s death ,","death , or",", or even","or even muster","even muster the","muster the courage","the courage to","courage to move","to move out","move out of","out of his","of his mother","his mother 's","mother 's house","'s house ,","house , and",", and his","and his only","his only means","only means of","means of dealing","of dealing with","dealing with any","with any of","any of this","of this is","this is by","is by drinking","Forced to see","to see a","see a \"","a \" life","\" life specialist","life specialist ,","specialist , \"",", \" Calvin","\" Calvin remains","Calvin remains steadfast","remains steadfast in","steadfast in his","in his ways","his ways until","ways until the","until the one","the one thing","one thing comes","thing comes along","comes along that","along that makes","that makes him","makes him want","him want to","want to change","to change for","change for the","for the better","the better :","better : a",": a beautiful","a beautiful girl"],"2grams":["On the","the surface","surface it","it seems","seems that","that everything","everything is","is fine","fine with","with Calvin","He 's","'s your","your average","average twenty-one-year-old","twenty-one-year-old who","who hangs","hangs out","out with","with his","his friends","friends and","and goes","goes out","out looking","looking for","for girls","However ,",", beneath","beneath the","the surface","surface ,",", Calvin","Calvin still","still has","has n't","n't learned","learned how","how to","to deal","deal with","with his","his father","father 's","'s death","death ,",", or","or even","even muster","muster the","the courage","courage to","to move","move out","out of","of his","his mother","mother 's","'s house","house ,",", and","and his","his only","only means","means of","of dealing","dealing with","with any","any of","of this","this is","is by","by drinking","Forced to","to see","see a","a \"","\" life","life specialist","specialist ,",", \"","\" Calvin","Calvin remains","remains steadfast","steadfast in","in his","his ways","ways until","until the","the one","one thing","thing comes","comes along","along that","that makes","makes him","him want","want to","to change","change for","for the","the better","better :",": a","a beautiful","beautiful girl"]}

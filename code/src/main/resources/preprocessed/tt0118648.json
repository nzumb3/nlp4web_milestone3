{"title":"The Assistant","plot":"It's the turn of the century and jobs are hard to find. A young man assigns himself the job of a store clerk, without pay... only a place to sleep and eat... after he was manipulated by a hoodlum friend into robbing the man's store. Soon he falls in love with the very pragmatic store owner's daughter who hesitates in giving her heart... or body. Nonetheless, the young man perseveres, much to the chagrin of her extremely Jewish mother who doesn't want her daughter marrying other than Jewish.","genres":["Crime"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["It","'s","the","turn","of","the","centuri","and","job","are","hard","to","find",".","A","young","man","assign","himself","the","job","of","a","store","clerk",",","without","pay","...","onli","a","place","to","sleep","and","eat","...","after","he","was","manipul","by","a","hoodlum","friend","into","rob","the","man","'s","store",".","Soon","he","fall","in","love","with","the","veri","pragmat","store","owner","'s","daughter","who","hesit","in","give","her","heart","...","or","bodi",".","Nonetheless",",","the","young","man","persever",",","much","to","the","chagrin","of","her","extrem","Jewish","mother","who","doe","n't","want","her","daughter","marri","other","than","Jewish","."],"lemmas":["it","be","the","turn","of","the","century","and","job","be","hard","to","find",".","a","young","man","assign","himself","the","job","of","a","store","clerk",",","without","pay","...","only","a","place","to","sleep","and","eat","...","after","he","be","manipulate","by","a","hoodlum","friend","into","rob","the","man","'s","store",".","soon","he","fall","in","love","with","the","very","pragmatic","store","owner","'s","daughter","who","hesitate","in","give","she","heart","...","or","body",".","nonetheless",",","the","young","man","persevere",",","much","to","the","chagrin","of","she","extremely","jewish","mother","who","do","not","want","she","daughter","marry","other","than","Jewish","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["It 's the","'s the turn","the turn of","turn of the","of the century","the century and","century and jobs","and jobs are","jobs are hard","are hard to","hard to find","A young man","young man assigns","man assigns himself","assigns himself the","himself the job","the job of","job of a","of a store","a store clerk","store clerk ,","clerk , without",", without pay","without pay ...","pay ... only","... only a","only a place","a place to","place to sleep","to sleep and","sleep and eat","and eat ...","eat ... after","... after he","after he was","he was manipulated","was manipulated by","manipulated by a","by a hoodlum","a hoodlum friend","hoodlum friend into","friend into robbing","into robbing the","robbing the man","the man 's","man 's store","Soon he falls","he falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with the","with the very","the very pragmatic","very pragmatic store","pragmatic store owner","store owner 's","owner 's daughter","'s daughter who","daughter who hesitates","who hesitates in","hesitates in giving","in giving her","giving her heart","her heart ...","heart ... or","... or body","Nonetheless , the",", the young","the young man","young man perseveres","man perseveres ,","perseveres , much",", much to","much to the","to the chagrin","the chagrin of","chagrin of her","of her extremely","her extremely Jewish","extremely Jewish mother","Jewish mother who","mother who does","who does n't","does n't want","n't want her","want her daughter","her daughter marrying","daughter marrying other","marrying other than","other than Jewish"],"2grams":["It 's","'s the","the turn","turn of","of the","the century","century and","and jobs","jobs are","are hard","hard to","to find","A young","young man","man assigns","assigns himself","himself the","the job","job of","of a","a store","store clerk","clerk ,",", without","without pay","pay ...","... only","only a","a place","place to","to sleep","sleep and","and eat","eat ...","... after","after he","he was","was manipulated","manipulated by","by a","a hoodlum","hoodlum friend","friend into","into robbing","robbing the","the man","man 's","'s store","Soon he","he falls","falls in","in love","love with","with the","the very","very pragmatic","pragmatic store","store owner","owner 's","'s daughter","daughter who","who hesitates","hesitates in","in giving","giving her","her heart","heart ...","... or","or body","Nonetheless ,",", the","the young","young man","man perseveres","perseveres ,",", much","much to","to the","the chagrin","chagrin of","of her","her extremely","extremely Jewish","Jewish mother","mother who","who does","does n't","n't want","want her","her daughter","daughter marrying","marrying other","other than","than Jewish"]}

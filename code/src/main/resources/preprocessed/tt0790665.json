{"title":"Flood","plot":"Timely yet terrifying, The Flood predicts the unthinkable. When a raging storm coincides with high seas it unleashes a colossal tidal surge, which travels mercilessly down England's East Coast and into the Thames Estuary. Overwhelming the Barrier, torrents of water pour into the city. The lives of millions of Londoners are at stake. Top marine engineers and barrier experts Rob, his ex-wife Sam and his father Leonard Morrison, have only a few hours to save the city from total devastation. A real probability in a real location. It is not a question of if, but when London floods.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["Time","yet","terrifi",",","The","Flood","predict","the","unthink",".","When","a","rage","storm","coincid","with","high","sea","it","unleash","a","coloss","tidal","surg",",","which","travel","merciless","down","England","'s","East","Coast","and","into","the","Thame","Estuari",".","Overwhelm","the","Barrier",",","torrent","of","water","pour","into","the","citi",".","The","live","of","million","of","London","are","at","stake",".","Top","marin","engin","and","barrier","expert","Rob",",","his","ex-wif","Sam","and","his","father","Leonard","Morrison",",","have","onli","a","few","hour","to","save","the","citi","from","total","devast",".","A","real","probabl","in","a","real","locat",".","It","is","not","a","question","of","if",",","but","when","London","flood","."],"lemmas":["timely","yet","terrifying",",","the","Flood","predict","the","unthinkable",".","when","a","rage","storm","coincide","with","high","sea","it","unleash","a","colossal","tidal","surge",",","which","travel","mercilessly","down","England","'s","East","Coast","and","into","the","Thames","Estuary",".","overwhelm","the","barrier",",","torrent","of","water","pour","into","the","city",".","the","life","of","million","of","Londoners","be","at","stake",".","top","marine","engineer","and","barrier","expert","Rob",",","he","ex-wife","Sam","and","he","father","Leonard","Morrison",",","have","only","a","few","hour","to","save","the","city","from","total","devastation",".","a","real","probability","in","a","real","location",".","it","be","not","a","question","of","if",",","but","when","London","flood","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Timely yet terrifying","yet terrifying ,","terrifying , The",", The Flood","The Flood predicts","Flood predicts the","predicts the unthinkable","When a raging","a raging storm","raging storm coincides","storm coincides with","coincides with high","with high seas","high seas it","seas it unleashes","it unleashes a","unleashes a colossal","a colossal tidal","colossal tidal surge","tidal surge ,","surge , which",", which travels","which travels mercilessly","travels mercilessly down","mercilessly down England","down England 's","England 's East","'s East Coast","East Coast and","Coast and into","and into the","into the Thames","the Thames Estuary","Overwhelming the Barrier","the Barrier ,","Barrier , torrents",", torrents of","torrents of water","of water pour","water pour into","pour into the","into the city","The lives of","lives of millions","of millions of","millions of Londoners","of Londoners are","Londoners are at","are at stake","Top marine engineers","marine engineers and","engineers and barrier","and barrier experts","barrier experts Rob","experts Rob ,","Rob , his",", his ex-wife","his ex-wife Sam","ex-wife Sam and","Sam and his","and his father","his father Leonard","father Leonard Morrison","Leonard Morrison ,","Morrison , have",", have only","have only a","only a few","a few hours","few hours to","hours to save","to save the","save the city","the city from","city from total","from total devastation","A real probability","real probability in","probability in a","in a real","a real location","It is not","is not a","not a question","a question of","question of if","of if ,","if , but",", but when","but when London","when London floods"],"2grams":["Timely yet","yet terrifying","terrifying ,",", The","The Flood","Flood predicts","predicts the","the unthinkable","When a","a raging","raging storm","storm coincides","coincides with","with high","high seas","seas it","it unleashes","unleashes a","a colossal","colossal tidal","tidal surge","surge ,",", which","which travels","travels mercilessly","mercilessly down","down England","England 's","'s East","East Coast","Coast and","and into","into the","the Thames","Thames Estuary","Overwhelming the","the Barrier","Barrier ,",", torrents","torrents of","of water","water pour","pour into","into the","the city","The lives","lives of","of millions","millions of","of Londoners","Londoners are","are at","at stake","Top marine","marine engineers","engineers and","and barrier","barrier experts","experts Rob","Rob ,",", his","his ex-wife","ex-wife Sam","Sam and","and his","his father","father Leonard","Leonard Morrison","Morrison ,",", have","have only","only a","a few","few hours","hours to","to save","save the","the city","city from","from total","total devastation","A real","real probability","probability in","in a","a real","real location","It is","is not","not a","a question","question of","of if","if ,",", but","but when","when London","London floods"]}

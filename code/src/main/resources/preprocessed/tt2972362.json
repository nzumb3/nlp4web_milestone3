{"title":"Hwayi: A Monster Boy","plot":"Hwayi is a boy living in a farm village, who was raised by 5 fathers who were famous criminals. One day, the group is commissioned to kill a man named Lim and his wife. While the rest of the group feel something odd about this particular contact, Suk-tae is adamant to carry out this job with Hwayi in tow. During the job Hwayi discovers a photograph of a child in Lim's house. Eventually, Suk-tae hands his gun to Hwayi and he is forced to pull the trigger. He becomes ill after committing his first kill and realizes that the boy in the photograph looks uncannily familiar.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["Hwayi","is","a","boy","live","in","a","farm","villag",",","who","was","rais","by","5","father","who","were","famous","crimin",".","One","day",",","the","group","is","commiss","to","kill","a","man","name","Lim","and","his","wife",".","While","the","rest","of","the","group","feel","someth","odd","about","this","particular","contact",",","Suk-ta","is","adam","to","carri","out","this","job","with","Hwayi","in","tow",".","Dure","the","job","Hwayi","discov","a","photograph","of","a","child","in","Lim","'s","hous",".","Eventual",",","Suk-ta","hand","his","gun","to","Hwayi","and","he","is","forc","to","pull","the","trigger",".","He","becom","ill","after","commit","his","first","kill","and","realiz","that","the","boy","in","the","photograph","look","uncannili","familiar","."],"lemmas":["Hwayi","be","a","boy","live","in","a","farm","village",",","who","be","raise","by","5","father","who","be","famous","criminal",".","one","day",",","the","group","be","commission","to","kill","a","man","name","Lim","and","he","wife",".","while","the","rest","of","the","group","feel","something","odd","about","this","particular","contact",",","suk-tae","be","adamant","to","carry","out","this","job","with","hwayi","in","tow",".","during","the","job","Hwayi","discover","a","photograph","of","a","child","in","Lim","'s","house",".","eventually",",","suk-tae","hand","he","gun","to","Hwayi","and","he","be","force","to","pull","the","trigger",".","he","become","ill","after","commit","he","first","kill","and","realize","that","the","boy","in","the","photograph","look","uncannily","familiar","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hwayi is a","is a boy","a boy living","boy living in","living in a","in a farm","a farm village","farm village ,","village , who",", who was","who was raised","was raised by","raised by 5","by 5 fathers","5 fathers who","fathers who were","who were famous","were famous criminals","One day ,","day , the",", the group","the group is","group is commissioned","is commissioned to","commissioned to kill","to kill a","kill a man","a man named","man named Lim","named Lim and","Lim and his","and his wife","While the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the group","the group feel","group feel something","feel something odd","something odd about","odd about this","about this particular","this particular contact","particular contact ,","contact , Suk-tae",", Suk-tae is","Suk-tae is adamant","is adamant to","adamant to carry","to carry out","carry out this","out this job","this job with","job with Hwayi","with Hwayi in","Hwayi in tow","During the job","the job Hwayi","job Hwayi discovers","Hwayi discovers a","discovers a photograph","a photograph of","photograph of a","of a child","a child in","child in Lim","in Lim 's","Lim 's house","Eventually , Suk-tae",", Suk-tae hands","Suk-tae hands his","hands his gun","his gun to","gun to Hwayi","to Hwayi and","Hwayi and he","and he is","he is forced","is forced to","forced to pull","to pull the","pull the trigger","He becomes ill","becomes ill after","ill after committing","after committing his","committing his first","his first kill","first kill and","kill and realizes","and realizes that","realizes that the","that the boy","the boy in","boy in the","in the photograph","the photograph looks","photograph looks uncannily","looks uncannily familiar"],"2grams":["Hwayi is","is a","a boy","boy living","living in","in a","a farm","farm village","village ,",", who","who was","was raised","raised by","by 5","5 fathers","fathers who","who were","were famous","famous criminals","One day","day ,",", the","the group","group is","is commissioned","commissioned to","to kill","kill a","a man","man named","named Lim","Lim and","and his","his wife","While the","the rest","rest of","of the","the group","group feel","feel something","something odd","odd about","about this","this particular","particular contact","contact ,",", Suk-tae","Suk-tae is","is adamant","adamant to","to carry","carry out","out this","this job","job with","with Hwayi","Hwayi in","in tow","During the","the job","job Hwayi","Hwayi discovers","discovers a","a photograph","photograph of","of a","a child","child in","in Lim","Lim 's","'s house","Eventually ,",", Suk-tae","Suk-tae hands","hands his","his gun","gun to","to Hwayi","Hwayi and","and he","he is","is forced","forced to","to pull","pull the","the trigger","He becomes","becomes ill","ill after","after committing","committing his","his first","first kill","kill and","and realizes","realizes that","that the","the boy","boy in","in the","the photograph","photograph looks","looks uncannily","uncannily familiar"]}

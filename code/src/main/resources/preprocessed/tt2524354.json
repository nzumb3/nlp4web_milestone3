{"title":"Von heute auf morgen","plot":"'From One Day To The Next' follows four elderly people through their everyday lives, observing how they cope with a gradual loss of autonomy. Even as they become increasingly dependent on outside help they insist on staying at home. But it seems inevitable that sooner or later they will have to move to a nursing home. In the meantime, their most important contacts to the outside world are the employees of the Visiting Nurse Service. But it's not always easy for the nurses to reconcile their human feelings of compassion with the professional, economic and bureaucratic demands of their job.","genres":["Documentary","

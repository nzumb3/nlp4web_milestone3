{"title":"Saynatakuna Masks and Transfigurations in Paukartambo","plot":"Saynatakuna is an ethnographic film. It tells the story of the mask makers and dancers during the festival of the Virgen del Carmen in Paukartambo, Cuzco. The dancers reinterpret their history and socio-political forces that drive them to perform their rituals of magic and resistance. The 18 dance troupes reenact and satirize the different ethnic groups that passed through Paukartambo since the beginning of time. They connect and tell a story of the past, the present, and the future wearing hand-made colorful masks and intricate beaded costumes.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Saynatakuna","is","an","ethnograph","film",".","It","tell","the","stori","of","the","mask","maker","and","dancer","dure","the","festiv","of","the","Virgen","del","Carmen","in","Paukartambo",",","Cuzco",".","The","dancer","reinterpret","their","histori","and","socio-polit","forc","that","drive","them","to","perform","their","ritual","of","magic","and","resist",".","The","18","danc","troup","reenact","and","satir","the","differ","ethnic","group","that","pass","through","Paukartambo","sinc","the","begin","of","time",".","They","connect","and","tell","a","stori","of","the","past",",","the","present",",","and","the","futur","wear","hand-mad","color","mask","and","intric","bead","costum","."],"lemmas":["Saynatakuna","be","a","ethnographic","film",".","it","tell","the","story","of","the","mask","maker","and","dancer","during","the","festival","of","the","Virgen","del","Carmen","in","Paukartambo",",","Cuzco",".","the","dancer","reinterpret","they","history","and","socio-political","force","that","drive","they","to","perform","they","ritual","of","magic","and","resistance",".","the","18","dance","troupe","reenact","and","satirize","the","different","ethnic","group","that","pass","through","Paukartambo","since","the","beginning","of","time",".","they","connect","and","tell","a","story","of","the","past",",","the","present",",","and","the","future","wear","hand-made","colorful","mask","and","intricate","beaded","costume","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Saynatakuna is an","is an ethnographic","an ethnographic film","It tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of the","of the mask","the mask makers","mask makers and","makers and dancers","and dancers during","dancers during the","during the festival","the festival of","festival of the","of the Virgen","the Virgen del","Virgen del Carmen","del Carmen in","Carmen in Paukartambo","in Paukartambo ,","Paukartambo , Cuzco","The dancers reinterpret","dancers reinterpret their","reinterpret their history","their history and","history and socio-political","and socio-political forces","socio-political forces that","forces that drive","that drive them","drive them to","them to perform","to perform their","perform their rituals","their rituals of","rituals of magic","of magic and","magic and resistance","The 18 dance","18 dance troupes","dance troupes reenact","troupes reenact and","reenact and satirize","and satirize the","satirize the different","the different ethnic","different ethnic groups","ethnic groups that","groups that passed","that passed through","passed through Paukartambo","through Paukartambo since","Paukartambo since the","since the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of time","They connect and","connect and tell","and tell a","tell a story","a story of","story of the","of the past","the past ,","past , the",", the present","the present ,","present , and",", and the","and the future","the future wearing","future wearing hand-made","wearing hand-made colorful","hand-made colorful masks","colorful masks and","masks and intricate","and intricate beaded","intricate beaded costumes"],"2grams":["Saynatakuna is","is an","an ethnographic","ethnographic film","It tells","tells the","the story","story of","of the","the mask","mask makers","makers and","and dancers","dancers during","during the","the festival","festival of","of the","the Virgen","Virgen del","del Carmen","Carmen in","in Paukartambo","Paukartambo ,",", Cuzco","The dancers","dancers reinterpret","reinterpret their","their history","history and","and socio-political","socio-political forces","forces that","that drive","drive them","them to","to perform","perform their","their rituals","rituals of","of magic","magic and","and resistance","The 18","18 dance","dance troupes","troupes reenact","reenact and","and satirize","satirize the","the different","different ethnic","ethnic groups","groups that","that passed","passed through","through Paukartambo","Paukartambo since","since the","the beginning","beginning of","of time","They connect","connect and","and tell","tell a","a story","story of","of the","the past","past ,",", the","the present","present ,",", and","and the","the future","future wearing","wearing hand-made","hand-made colorful","colorful masks","masks and","and intricate","intricate beaded","beaded costumes"]}

{"title":"Snowflake, the White Gorilla","plot":"Snowflake (Ariana Grande) is special-she's the only white gorilla in the world, and the zoo's main attraction. Children love her, but the other gorillas-Petunia (Jennette McCurdy), Elvis (Nathan Kress) and Anvil (Keith David)-don't because she's different. With the help of an eccentric red panda named Jenga (David Spade), Snowflake plans a secret mission to sneak out of the zoo and venture into the dangerous city to find the witch at the circus who can help her become a \"normal\" gorilla. Will Snowflake find the cure she's looking for, or realize that there's something more important than fitting in-being true to yourself?","genres":["Adventure"," Comedy"," Animation"],"stems":["Snowflak","(","Ariana","Grand",")","is","special-sh","'s","the","onli","white","gorilla","in","the","world",",","and","the","zoo","'s","main","attract",".","Children","love","her",",","but","the","other","gorillas-Petunia","(","Jennett","McCurdi",")",",","Elvis","(","Nathan","Kress",")","and","Anvil","(","Keith","David",")","-","do","n't","becaus","she","'s","differ",".","With","the","help","of","an","eccentr","red","panda","name","Jenga","(","David","Spade",")",",","Snowflak","plan","a","secret","mission","to","sneak","out","of","the","zoo","and","ventur","into","the","danger","citi","to","find","the","witch","at","the","circus","who","can","help","her","becom","a","\"","normal","\"","gorilla",".","Will","Snowflak","find","the","cure","she","'s","look","for",",","or","realiz","that","there","'s","someth","more","import","than","fit","in-b","true","to","yourself","?"],"lemmas":["Snowflake","-lrb-","Ariana","Grande","-rrb-","be","special-she","'s","the","only","white","gorilla","in","the","world",",","and","the","zoo","'s","main","attraction",".","child","love","she",",","but","the","other","gorillas-petunia","-lrb-","Jennette","McCurdy","-rrb-",",","Elvis","-lrb-","Nathan","Kress","-rrb-","and","Anvil","-lrb-","Keith","David","-rrb-","-","do","not","because","she","be","different",".","with","the","help","of","a","eccentric","red","panda","name","Jenga","-lrb-","David","Spade","-rrb-",",","Snowflake","plan","a","secret","mission","to","sneak","out","of","the","zoo","and","venture","into","the","dangerous","city","to","find","the","witch","at","the","circus","who","can","help","she","become","a","``","normal","''","gorilla",".","Will","Snowflake","find","the","cure","she","be","look","for",",","or","realize","that","there","be","something","more","important","than","fitting","in-being","true","to","yourself","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Snowflake ( Ariana","( Ariana Grande","Ariana Grande )","Grande ) is",") is special-she","is special-she 's","special-she 's the","'s the only","the only white","only white gorilla","white gorilla in","gorilla in the","in the world","the world ,","world , and",", and the","and the zoo","the zoo 's","zoo 's main","'s main attraction","Children love her","love her ,","her , but",", but the","but the other","the other gorillas-Petunia","other gorillas-Petunia (","gorillas-Petunia ( Jennette","( Jennette McCurdy","Jennette McCurdy )","McCurdy ) ,",") , Elvis",", Elvis (","Elvis ( Nathan","( Nathan Kress","Nathan Kress )","Kress ) and",") and Anvil","and Anvil (","Anvil ( Keith","( Keith David","Keith David )","David ) -",") -

{"title":"Nippu","plot":"The story begins with Surya (Ravi Teja) who owns a gym center and he also has a good friend Sriram (Srikanth). Surya is in love with his friend's sister Meghna (Deeksha Seth) and after some cat and mouse games, she also falls in love. After a while, Sri goes to Saudi for a job and there he falls in love with Vaishnavi (Bhavana). The story takes a turn when Surya goes to Saudi to celebrate the birthday of Sri and is shocked when the Saudi police arrest Sriram on charges of murdering Vaishnavi. He is sentenced to death. The only thing Surya can do is to get the signature from Vaishnavi's parents to acquit Sriram. But her father is Raja Goud (Pradeep Rawat), the bad guy whom Surya has been fighting all along. What happens from there forms the rest of the story.","genres":["Action"," Drama","

{"title":"From the Front to the West Coast: The Recollections of the Finnish War Veterans in Vancouver","plot":"From the Front to the West Coast: the Recollections of the Finnish War Veterans in Vancouver is a documentary about the Finnish Second World War Veterans, who, at a very young age, first fought the Russians and then the Germans. Yet, after the war, they left the country they so fiercely defended to start a new life in Canada. The documentary depicts the significance of home during childhood and youth, and the significance of wartime experiences. Wars ruin young lives, and the documentary is of interest to the young and the old, and everyone in between, looking for an answer as to why the veterans left Finland. Was it because of the war? Even though the subject matter is war, humour has not been forgotten.","genres":["Biography"," History","

{"title":"The Whirl","plot":"As former Yugoslavia was falling apart, so did the financial and social stability of Serbia. Social extremes were visible everywhere, especially among the youths. War, inflation, physical isolation and sanctions all contributed to Serbia becoming a type of ghetto. This was most visible in Serbia's capital Belgrade, which had a steep downfall in all aspects of life. In this isolation, the young were creating their own worlds. The film is set in the second half of the 1990s in Belgrade, seen from the perspectives of young adults, and about their efforts to find themselves while circumstances were pulling them to the bottom of a chaotic whirlpool. The film follows the three main characters: Bogdan, Kale and Count, in three separate stories, but all of them are intertwined. It follows their lives for 48 hours which is enough to change them completely.","genres":["Action"," Fantasy","

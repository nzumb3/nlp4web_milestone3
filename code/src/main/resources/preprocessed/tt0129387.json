{"title":"There's Something About Mary","plot":"Ted was a geek in high school, who was going to go to the prom with one of the most popular girls in school, Mary. The prom date never happened, because Ted had a very unusual accident. Thirteen years later he realizes he is still in love with Mary, so he hires a private investigator to track her down. That investigator discovers he too may be in love with Mary, so he gives Ted some false information to keep him away from her. But soon Ted finds himself back into Mary's life, as we watch one funny scene after another.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Ted","was","a","geek","in","high","school",",","who","was","go","to","go","to","the","prom","with","one","of","the","most","popular","girl","in","school",",","Mari",".","The","prom","date","never","happen",",","becaus","Ted","had","a","veri","unusu","accid",".","Thirteen","year","later","he","realiz","he","is","still","in","love","with","Mari",",","so","he","hire","a","privat","investig","to","track","her","down",".","That","investig","discov","he","too","may","be","in","love","with","Mari",",","so","he","give","Ted","some","fals","inform","to","keep","him","away","from","her",".","But","soon","Ted","find","himself","back","into","Mari","'s","life",",","as","we","watch","one","funni","scene","after","anoth","."],"lemmas":["Ted","be","a","geek","in","high","school",",","who","be","go","to","go","to","the","prom","with","one","of","the","most","popular","girl","in","school",",","Mary",".","the","prom","date","never","happen",",","because","Ted","have","a","very","unusual","accident",".","thirteen","year","later","he","realize","he","be","still","in","love","with","Mary",",","so","he","hire","a","private","investigator","to","track","she","down",".","that","investigator","discover","he","too","may","be","in","love","with","Mary",",","so","he","give","Ted","some","false","information","to","keep","he","away","from","she",".","but","soon","Ted","find","himself","back","into","Mary","'s","life",",","as","we","watch","one","funny","scene","after","another","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ted was a","was a geek","a geek in","geek in high","in high school","high school ,","school , who",", who was","who was going","was going to","going to go","to go to","go to the","to the prom","the prom with","prom with one","with one of","one of the","of the most","the most popular","most popular girls","popular girls in","girls in school","in school ,","school , Mary","The prom date","prom date never","date never happened","never happened ,","happened , because",", because Ted","because Ted had","Ted had a","had a very","a very unusual","very unusual accident","Thirteen years later","years later he","later he realizes","he realizes he","realizes he is","he is still","is still in","still in love","in love with","love with Mary","with Mary ,","Mary , so",", so he","so he hires","he hires a","hires a private","a private investigator","private investigator to","investigator to track","to track her","track her down","That investigator discovers","investigator discovers he","discovers he too","he too may","too may be","may be in","be in love","in love with","love with Mary","with Mary ,","Mary , so",", so he","so he gives","he gives Ted","gives Ted some","Ted some false","some false information","false information to","information to keep","to keep him","keep him away","him away from","away from her","But soon Ted","soon Ted finds","Ted finds himself","finds himself back","himself back into","back into Mary","into Mary 's","Mary 's life","'s life ,","life , as",", as we","as we watch","we watch one","watch one funny","one funny scene","funny scene after","scene after another"],"2grams":["Ted was","was a","a geek","geek in","in high","high school","school ,",", who","who was","was going","going to","to go","go to","to the","the prom","prom with","with one","one of","of the","the most","most popular","popular girls","girls in","in school","school ,",", Mary","The prom","prom date","date never","never happened","happened ,",", because","because Ted","Ted had","had a","a very","very unusual","unusual accident","Thirteen years","years later","later he","he realizes","realizes he","he is","is still","still in","in love","love with","with Mary","Mary ,",", so","so he","he hires","hires a","a private","private investigator","investigator to","to track","track her","her down","That investigator","investigator discovers","discovers he","he too","too may","may be","be in","in love","love with","with Mary","Mary ,",", so","so he","he gives","gives Ted","Ted some","some false","false information","information to","to keep","keep him","him away","away from","from her","But soon","soon Ted","Ted finds","finds himself","himself back","back into","into Mary","Mary 's","'s life","life ,",", as","as we","we watch","watch one","one funny","funny scene","scene after","after another"]}

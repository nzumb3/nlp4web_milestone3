Gerardo, a seventeen boy, let the days go by while rehearsing with his rock band, wandering the streets looking for someone to get lost with, and avoiding the inevitable confession of his love for Andrea, trying not to get his house, a place that is no longer a home. Because, as everywhere, there is no one outside and nothing is happening here.","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["A","film","about","the","teenag","angst",".","Gerardo",",","a","seventeen","boy",",","let","the","day","go","by","while","rehears","with","his","rock","band",",","wander","the","street","look","for","someon","to","get","lost","with",",","and","avoid","the","inevit","confess","of","his","love","for","Andrea",",","tri","not","to","get","his","hous",",","a","place","that","is","no","longer","a","home",".","Becaus",",","as","everywher",",","there","is","no","one","outsid","and","noth","is","happen","here","."],"lemmas":["a","film","about","the","teenage","angst",".","Gerardo",",","a","seventeen","boy",",","let","the","day","go","by","while","rehearse","with","he","rock","band",",","wander","the","street","look","for","someone","to","get","lose","with",",","and","avoid","the","inevitable","confession","of","he","love","for","Andrea",",","try","not","to","get","he","house",",","a","place","that","be","no","longer","a","home",".","because",",","as","everywhere",",","there","be","no","one","outside","and","nothing","be","happen","here","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A film about","film about the","about the teenage","the teenage angst","Gerardo , a",", a seventeen","a seventeen boy","seventeen boy ,","boy , let",", let the","let the days","the days go","days go by","go by while","by while rehearsing","while rehearsing with","rehearsing with his","with his rock","his rock band","rock band ,","band , wandering",", wandering the","wandering the streets","the streets looking","streets looking for","looking for someone","for someone to","someone to get","to get lost","get lost with","lost with ,","with , and",", and avoiding","and avoiding the","avoiding the inevitable","the inevitable confession","inevitable confession of","confession of his","of his love","his love for","love for Andrea","for Andrea ,","Andrea , trying",", trying not","trying not to","not to get","to get his","get his house","his house ,","house , a",", a place","a place that","place that is","that is no","is no longer","no longer a","longer a home","Because , as",", as everywhere","as everywhere ,","everywhere , there",", there is","there is no","is no one","no one outside","one outside and","outside and nothing","and nothing is","nothing is happening","is happening here"],"2grams":["A film","film about","about the","the teenage","teenage angst","Gerardo ,",", a","a seventeen","seventeen boy","boy ,",", let","let the","the days","days go","go by","by while","while rehearsing","rehearsing with","with his","his rock","rock band","band ,",", wandering","wandering the","the streets","streets looking","looking for","for someone","someone to","to get","get lost","lost with","with ,",", and","and avoiding","avoiding the","the inevitable","inevitable confession","confession of","of his","his love","love for","for Andrea","Andrea ,",", trying","trying not","not to","to get","get his","his house","house ,",", a","a place","place that","that is","is no","no longer","longer a","a home","Because ,",", as","as everywhere","everywhere ,",", there","there is","is no","no one","one outside","outside and","and nothing","nothing is","is happening","happening here"]}

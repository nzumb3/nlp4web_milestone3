{"title":"Torrente, el brazo tonto de la ley","plot":"Torrente is a lazy, rude, drunkard, sexist, racist, extreme-right-wing Madrid cop; a despicable character who only cares about himself. He lives in a decrepit slum with his wheelchair-bound father, whom he treats quite badly. One day, a new family of neighbours move in, and the sexy younger daughter, Amparito, catches his eye, so he becomes a friend of Rafi, her nerdy brother, to get closer to her. At the same time, he discovers that a band of drug traffickers are operating in a nearby chinese restaurant; he knows that if he cracks this case, it could make him regain the status he lost within the police department; but the only people he can count on to help him are Rafi and his equally nerdy friends.","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["Torrent","is","a","lazi",",","rude",",","drunkard",",","sexist",",","racist",",","extreme-right-w","Madrid","cop",";","a","despic","charact","who","onli","care","about","himself",".","He","live","in","a","decrepit","slum","with","his","wheelchair-bound","father",",","whom","he","treat","quit","bad",".","One","day",",","a","new","famili","of","neighbour","move","in",",","and","the","sexi","younger","daughter",",","Amparito",",","catch","his","eye",",","so","he","becom","a","friend","of","Rafi",",","her","nerdi","brother",",","to","get","closer","to","her",".","At","the","same","time",",","he","discov","that","a","band","of","drug","traffick","are","oper","in","a","nearbi","chines","restaur",";","he","know","that","if","he","crack","this","case",",","it","could","make","him","regain","the","status","he","lost","within","the","polic","depart",";","but","the","onli","peopl","he","can","count","on","to","help","him","are","Rafi","and","his","equal","nerdi","friend","."],"lemmas":["Torrente","be","a","lazy",",","rude",",","drunkard",",","sexist",",","racist",",","extreme-right-wing","Madrid","cop",";","a","despicable","character","who","only","care","about","himself",".","he","live","in","a","decrepit","slum","with","he","wheelchair-bound","father",",","whom","he","treat","quite","badly",".","one","day",",","a","new","family","of","neighbour","move","in",",","and","the","sexy","younger","daughter",",","Amparito",",","catch","he","eye",",","so","he","become","a","friend","of","Rafi",",","she","nerdy","brother",",","to","get","closer","to","she",".","at","the","same","time",",","he","discover","that","a","band","of","drug","trafficker","be","operate","in","a","nearby","chinese","restaurant",";","he","know","that","if","he","crack","this","case",",","it","could","make","he","regain","the","status","he","lose","within","the","police","department",";","but","the","only","people","he","can","count","on","to","help","he","be","Rafi","and","he","equally","nerdy","friend","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Torrente is a","is a lazy","a lazy ,","lazy , rude",", rude ,","rude , drunkard",", drunkard ,","drunkard , sexist",", sexist ,","sexist , racist",", racist ,","racist , extreme-right-wing",", extreme-right-wing Madrid","extreme-right-wing Madrid cop","Madrid cop ;","cop ;

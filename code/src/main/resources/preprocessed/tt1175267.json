{"title":"We Were Marked with a Big A","plot":"This deeply moving film reminds the world of the forgotten history of gay survivors of Nazi Germany. As many as 15,000 gay men were sent to concentration camps, targeted by the Nazis as subversives. In this powerful documentary, three gay survivors share their stories. The \"A\" (which stood for \"Arschficker\"/\"Assfucker\") refers to a symbol (which pre-dated the pink triangle) that gay prisoners were forced to wear.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["This","deepli","move","film","remind","the","world","of","the","forgotten","histori","of","gay","survivor","of","Nazi","Germani",".","As","mani","as","15,000","gay","men","were","sent","to","concentr","camp",",","target","by","the","Nazi","as","subvers",".","In","this","power","documentari",",","three","gay","survivor","share","their","stori",".","The","\"","A","\"","(","which","stood","for","\"","Arschficker","\"","/","\"","Assfucker","\"",")","refer","to","a","symbol","(","which","pre-dat","the","pink","triangl",")","that","gay","prison","were","forc","to","wear","."],"lemmas":["this","deeply","move","film","remind","the","world","of","the","forget","history","of","gay","survivor","of","Nazi","Germany",".","as","many","as","15,000","gay","man","be","send","to","concentration","camp",",","target","by","the","Nazis","as","subversive",".","in","this","powerful","documentary",",","three","gay","survivor","share","they","story",".","the","``","a","''","-lrb-","which","stand","for","``","Arschficker","''","/","``","Assfucker","''","-rrb-","refer","to","a","symbol","-lrb-","which","pre-date","the","pink","triangle","-rrb-","that","gay","prisoner","be","force","to","wear","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This deeply moving","deeply moving film","moving film reminds","film reminds the","reminds the world","the world of","world of the","of the forgotten","the forgotten history","forgotten history of","history of gay","of gay survivors","gay survivors of","survivors of Nazi","of Nazi Germany","As many as","many as 15,000","as 15,000 gay","15,000 gay men","gay men were","men were sent","were sent to","sent to concentration","to concentration camps","concentration camps ,","camps , targeted",", targeted by","targeted by the","by the Nazis","the Nazis as","Nazis as subversives","In this powerful","this powerful documentary","powerful documentary ,","documentary , three",", three gay","three gay survivors","gay survivors share","survivors share their","share their stories","The \" A","\" A \"","A \" (","\" ( which","( which stood","which stood for","stood for \"","for \" Arschficker","\" Arschficker \"","Arschficker \" /","\" / \"","/ \" Assfucker","\" Assfucker \"","Assfucker \" )","\" ) refers",") refers to","refers to a","to a symbol","a symbol (","symbol ( which","( which pre-dated","which pre-dated the","pre-dated the pink","the pink triangle","pink triangle )","triangle ) that",") that gay","that gay prisoners","gay prisoners were","prisoners were forced","were forced to","forced to wear"],"2grams":["This deeply","deeply moving","moving film","film reminds","reminds the","the world","world of","of the","the forgotten","forgotten history","history of","of gay","gay survivors","survivors of","of Nazi","Nazi Germany","As many","many as","as 15,000","15,000 gay","gay men","men were","were sent","sent to","to concentration","concentration camps","camps ,",", targeted","targeted by","by the","the Nazis","Nazis as","as subversives","In this","this powerful","powerful documentary","documentary ,",", three","three gay","gay survivors","survivors share","share their","their stories","The \"","\" A","A \"","\" (","( which","which stood","stood for","for \"","\" Arschficker","Arschficker \"","\" /","/ \"","\" Assfucker","Assfucker \"","\" )",") refers","refers to","to a","a symbol","symbol (","( which","which pre-dated","pre-dated the","the pink","pink triangle","triangle )",") that","that gay","gay prisoners","prisoners were","were forced","forced to","to wear"]}

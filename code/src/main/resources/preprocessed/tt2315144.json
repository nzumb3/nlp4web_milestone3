{"title":"Bullets for Jesus","plot":"BULLETS FOR JESUS is a tense nonstop roller-coaster ride through the distorted mind of Sly Stone (played by THOMAS DANIEL of... TRUE CRIME (NBC), YOUNGER NOW, BACKWATER, THOSE PEOPLE, PARANORMAL PROOF AND ALIEN OPPONENT ) a sadistic and brutal killer who distorts the scriptures to suit his own self serving madness. He's teamed up with a run-away drifter Annie Parker (played by TABETHA RAY of... THE CEMETERY, CAVEAT and BLACK HAT) who bows to his every command... both for love and for fear of her own life. \" I have the Bullets For Jesus \" is Slys motto, and NO ONE is safe from his twisted pulpit. And tonight, he's taken a hostage named David Caine (played by TERRY SASAKI of FRACTURED, A FIRST GOODBYE, CONSEQUENCE and THE MARK) But David just happens to harbor his own secret demons, and has no fear of facing the Reaper. Could this new stranger open Sly's eyes...or will he just end up like the rest, and be baptized by lead?","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Adventure"],"stems":["BULLETS","FOR","JESUS","is","a","tens","nonstop","roller-coast","ride","through","the","distort","mind","of","Sli","Stone","(","play","by","THOMAS","DANIEL","of","...","TRUE","CRIME","(","NBC",")",",","YOUNGER","NOW",",","BACKWATER",",","THOSE","PEOPLE",",","PARANORMAL","PROOF","AND","ALIEN","OPPONENT",")","a","sadist","and","brutal","killer","who","distort","the","scriptur","to","suit","his","own","self","serv","mad",".","He","'s","team","up","with","a","run-away","drifter","Annie","Parker","(","play","by","TABETHA","RAi","of","...","THE","CEMETERi",",","CAVEAT","and","BLACK","HAT",")","who","bow","to","his","everi","command","...","both","for","love","and","for","fear","of","her","own","life",".","\"","I","have","the","Bullet","For","Jesus","\"","is","Slys","motto",",","and","NO","ONE","is","safe","from","his","twist","pulpit",".","And","tonight",",","he","'s","taken","a","hostag","name","David","Cain","(","play","by","TERRi","SASAKI","of","FRACTURED",",","A","FIRST","GOODBYE",",","CONSEQUENCE","and","THE","MARK",")","But","David","just","happen","to","harbor","his","own","secret","demon",",","and","has","no","fear","of","face","the","Reaper",".","Could","this","new","stranger","open","Sli","'s","eye","...","or","will","he","just","end","up","like","the","rest",",","and","be","baptiz","by","lead","?"],"lemmas":["bullet","for","jesus","be","a","tense","nonstop","roller-coaster","ride","through","the","distorted","mind","of","Sly","Stone","-lrb-","play","by","THOMAS","DANIEL","of","...","true","crime","-lrb-","NBC","-rrb-",",","YOUNGER","NOW",",","BACKWATER",",","those","people",",","paranormal","proof","and","alien","opponent","-rrb-","a","sadistic","and","brutal","killer","who","distort","the","scripture","to","suit","he","own","self","serve","madness",".","he","be","team","up","with","a","run-away","drifter","Annie","Parker","-lrb-","play","by","TABETHA","RAY","of","...","the","cemetery",",","caveat","and","black","hat","-rrb-","who","bow","to","he","every","command","...","both","for","love","and","for","fear","of","she","own","life",".","``","I","have","the","Bullets","for","Jesus","''","be","Slys","motto",",","and","no","one","be","safe","from","he","twisted","pulpit",".","and","tonight",",","he","be","take","a","hostage","name","David","Caine","-lrb-","play","by","TERRY","SASAKI","of","FRACTURED",",","A","FIRST","GOODBYE",",","CONSEQUENCE","and","the","MARK","-rrb-","But","David","just","happen","to","harbor","he","own","secret","demon",",","and","have","no","fear","of","face","the","Reaper",".","could","this","new","stranger","open","Sly","'s","eye","...","or","will","he","just","end","up","like","the","rest",",","and","be","baptize","by","lead","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["BULLETS FOR JESUS","FOR JESUS is","JESUS is a","is a tense","a tense nonstop","tense nonstop roller-coaster","nonstop roller-coaster ride","roller-coaster ride through","ride through the","through the distorted","the distorted mind","distorted mind of","mind of Sly","of Sly Stone","Sly Stone (","Stone ( played","( played by","played by THOMAS","by THOMAS DANIEL","THOMAS DANIEL of","DANIEL of ...","of ...

{"title":"Canyonlands: Edward Abbey and the Great American Desert","plot":"'Cabyonlands' is a documentary film that shows how one writer's love for the American desert and anger over its destruction shaped a generation of environmentalist activists. In books such as A Desert Solitaire and The Monkey Wrench Gang, Edward Abbey (1927-1989) warned about the perils of industrial tourism, road-building and dam construction -- most notably the building of Glen Canyon Dam that plugged the Colorado River at one of its most stunning locations. This documentary returns to locations Abbey talked about, setting his visionary texts and new interviews against evocative recordings of a world under transformation.","genres":["Biography","

{"title":"The Biggest Story Problem","plot":"The Biggest Story Problem is an independent documentary film that explores a previously unexplained phenomenon: why students in the United States perform well in math in their elementary years, score above average until 8th grade, and then precipitously drop to the bottom tier in the world by 10th grade. With highlights from top-scoring Finland to an exploration of the largest textbooks in the world and how they affect students in our country, this is not a story of failure, but one of hope. From the perspective of one teacher-turned-game designer, Scott Laidlaw, you will meet the teachers, students and schools on the frontlines, taking charge in changing our nation's story of math education.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Biggest","Stori","Problem","is","an","independ","documentari","film","that","explor","a","previous","unexplain","phenomenon",":","whi","student","in","the","Unite","State","perform","well","in","math","in","their","elementari","year",",","score","abov","averag","until","8th","grade",",","and","then","precipit","drop","to","the","bottom","tier","in","the","world","by","10th","grade",".","With","highlight","from","top-scor","Finland","to","an","explor","of","the","largest","textbook","in","the","world","and","how","they","affect","student","in","our","countri",",","this","is","not","a","stori","of","failur",",","but","one","of","hope",".","From","the","perspect","of","one","teacher-turned-gam","design",",","Scott","Laidlaw",",","you","will","meet","the","teacher",",","student","and","school","on","the","frontlin",",","take","charg","in","chang","our","nation","'s","stori","of","math","educ","."],"lemmas":["the","biggest","Story","Problem","be","a","independent","documentary","film","that","explore","a","previously","unexplained","phenomenon",":","why","student","in","the","United","States","perform","well","in","math","in","they","elementary","year",",","score","above","average","until","8th","grade",",","and","then","precipitously","drop","to","the","bottom","tier","in","the","world","by","10th","grade",".","with","highlight","from","top-scoring","Finland","to","a","exploration","of","the","largest","textbook","in","the","world","and","how","they","affect","student","in","we","country",",","this","be","not","a","story","of","failure",",","but","one","of","hope",".","from","the","perspective","of","one","teacher-turned-game","designer",",","Scott","Laidlaw",",","you","will","meet","the","teacher",",","student","and","school","on","the","frontline",",","take","charge","in","change","we","nation","'s","story","of","math","education","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

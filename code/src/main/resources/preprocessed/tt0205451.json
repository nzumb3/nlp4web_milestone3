{"title":"Tenchi Forever!: The Movie","plot":"This film takes a more serious turn from the Tenchi TV series and movies. One day, Tenchi disappears in the forest near his house. Six months later, Ayeka and Ryoko locate Tenchi living in a city, but with a mysterious woman. What's more, Tenchi appears to have aged several years. Whenever Ayeka and Ryoko catch up to him, he disappears into thin air, apparently existing in a fabricated alternate dimension where he has no knowledge of his past. An attempt to rescue Tenchi from the mysterious woman is mounted by Ayeka, Ryoko, Washu and the others.","genres":["Adventure"," Comedy"," Animation"],"stems":["This","film","take","a","more","serious","turn","from","the","Tenchi","TV","seri","and","movi",".","One","day",",","Tenchi","disappear","in","the","forest","near","his","hous",".","Six","month","later",",","Ayeka","and","Ryoko","locat","Tenchi","live","in","a","citi",",","but","with","a","mysteri","woman",".","What","'s","more",",","Tenchi","appear","to","have","age","sever","year",".","Whenev","Ayeka","and","Ryoko","catch","up","to","him",",","he","disappear","into","thin","air",",","appar","exist","in","a","fabric","altern","dimens","where","he","has","no","knowledg","of","his","past",".","An","attempt","to","rescu","Tenchi","from","the","mysteri","woman","is","mount","by","Ayeka",",","Ryoko",",","Washu","and","the","other","."],"lemmas":["this","film","take","a","more","serious","turn","from","the","Tenchi","tv","series","and","movie",".","one","day",",","Tenchi","disappear","in","the","forest","near","he","house",".","six","month","later",",","Ayeka","and","Ryoko","locate","Tenchi","live","in","a","city",",","but","with","a","mysterious","woman",".","what","be","more",",","Tenchi","appear","to","have","age","several","year",".","Whenever","Ayeka","and","Ryoko","catch","up","to","he",",","he","disappear","into","thin","air",",","apparently","exist","in","a","fabricate","alternate","dimension","where","he","have","no","knowledge","of","he","past",".","a","attempt","to","rescue","Tenchi","from","the","mysterious","woman","be","mount","by","Ayeka",",","Ryoko",",","Washu","and","the","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film takes","film takes a","takes a more","a more serious","more serious turn","serious turn from","turn from the","from the Tenchi","the Tenchi TV","Tenchi TV series","TV series and","series and movies","One day ,","day , Tenchi",", Tenchi disappears","Tenchi disappears in","disappears in the","in the forest","the forest near","forest near his","near his house","Six months later","months later ,","later , Ayeka",", Ayeka and","Ayeka and Ryoko","and Ryoko locate","Ryoko locate Tenchi","locate Tenchi living","Tenchi living in","living in a","in a city","a city ,","city , but",", but with","but with a","with a mysterious","a mysterious woman","What 's more","'s more ,","more , Tenchi",", Tenchi appears","Tenchi appears to","appears to have","to have aged","have aged several","aged several years","Whenever Ayeka and","Ayeka and Ryoko","and Ryoko catch","Ryoko catch up","catch up to","up to him","to him ,","him , he",", he disappears","he disappears into","disappears into thin","into thin air","thin air ,","air , apparently",", apparently existing","apparently existing in","existing in a","in a fabricated","a fabricated alternate","fabricated alternate dimension","alternate dimension where","dimension where he","where he has","he has no","has no knowledge","no knowledge of","knowledge of his","of his past","An attempt to","attempt to rescue","to rescue Tenchi","rescue Tenchi from","Tenchi from the","from the mysterious","the mysterious woman","mysterious woman is","woman is mounted","is mounted by","mounted by Ayeka","by Ayeka ,","Ayeka , Ryoko",", Ryoko ,","Ryoko , Washu",", Washu and","Washu and the","and the others"],"2grams":["This film","film takes","takes a","a more","more serious","serious turn","turn from","from the","the Tenchi","Tenchi TV","TV series","series and","and movies","One day","day ,",", Tenchi","Tenchi disappears","disappears in","in the","the forest","forest near","near his","his house","Six months","months later","later ,",", Ayeka","Ayeka and","and Ryoko","Ryoko locate","locate Tenchi","Tenchi living","living in","in a","a city","city ,",", but","but with","with a","a mysterious","mysterious woman","What 's","'s more","more ,",", Tenchi","Tenchi appears","appears to","to have","have aged","aged several","several years","Whenever Ayeka","Ayeka and","and Ryoko","Ryoko catch","catch up","up to","to him","him ,",", he","he disappears","disappears into","into thin","thin air","air ,",", apparently","apparently existing","existing in","in a","a fabricated","fabricated alternate","alternate dimension","dimension where","where he","he has","has no","no knowledge","knowledge of","of his","his past","An attempt","attempt to","to rescue","rescue Tenchi","Tenchi from","from the","the mysterious","mysterious woman","woman is","is mounted","mounted by","by Ayeka","Ayeka ,",", Ryoko","Ryoko ,",", Washu","Washu and","and the","the others"]}

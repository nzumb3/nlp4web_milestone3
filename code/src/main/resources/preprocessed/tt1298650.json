{"title":"Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides","plot":"Captain Jack Sparrow (Depp) crosses paths with a woman from his past (Cruz), and he's not sure if it's love -- or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the Queen Anne's Revenge, the ship of the formidable pirate Blackbeard (McShane), Jack finds himself on an unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know who to fear more: Blackbeard or the woman from his past.","genres":["Action"," Fantasy"," Adventure"],"stems":["Captain","Jack","Sparrow","(","Depp",")","cross","path","with","a","woman","from","his","past","(","Cruz",")",",","and","he","'s","not","sure","if","it","'s","love","--","or","if","she","'s","a","ruthless","con","artist","who","'s","use","him","to","find","the","fabl","Fountain","of","Youth",".","When","she","forc","him","aboard","the","Queen","Anne","'s","Reveng",",","the","ship","of","the","formid","pirat","Blackbeard","(","McShane",")",",","Jack","find","himself","on","an","unexpect","adventur","in","which","he","doe","n't","know","who","to","fear","more",":","Blackbeard","or","the","woman","from","his","past","."],"lemmas":["Captain","Jack","Sparrow","-lrb-","Depp","-rrb-","cross","path","with","a","woman","from","he","past","-lrb-","Cruz","-rrb-",",","and","he","be","not","sure","if","it","be","love","--","or","if","she","be","a","ruthless","con","artist","who","be","use","he","to","find","the","fabled","Fountain","of","Youth",".","when","she","force","he","aboard","the","Queen","Anne","'s","revenge",",","the","ship","of","the","formidable","pirate","Blackbeard","-lrb-","McShane","-rrb-",",","Jack","find","himself","on","a","unexpected","adventure","in","which","he","do","not","know","who","to","fear","more",":","Blackbeard","or","the","woman","from","he","past","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Captain Jack Sparrow","Jack Sparrow (","Sparrow ( Depp","( Depp )","Depp ) crosses",") crosses paths","crosses paths with","paths with a","with a woman","a woman from","woman from his","from his past","his past (","past ( Cruz","( Cruz )","Cruz ) ,",") , and",", and he","and he 's","he 's not","'s not sure","not sure if","sure if it","if it 's","it 's love","'s love --","love -- or","-- or if","or if she","if she 's","she 's a","'s a ruthless","a ruthless con","ruthless con artist","con artist who","artist who 's","who 's using","'s using him","using him to","him to find","to find the","find the fabled","the fabled Fountain","fabled Fountain of","Fountain of Youth","When she forces","she forces him","forces him aboard","him aboard the","aboard the Queen","the Queen Anne","Queen Anne 's","Anne 's Revenge","'s Revenge ,","Revenge , the",", the ship","the ship of","ship of the","of the formidable","the formidable pirate","formidable pirate Blackbeard","pirate Blackbeard (","Blackbeard ( McShane","( McShane )","McShane ) ,",") , Jack",", Jack finds","Jack finds himself","finds himself on","himself on an","on an unexpected","an unexpected adventure","unexpected adventure in","adventure in which","in which he","which he does","he does n't","does n't know","n't know who","know who to","who to fear","to fear more","fear more :","more : Blackbeard",": Blackbeard or","Blackbeard or the","or the woman","the woman from","woman from his","from his past"],"2grams":["Captain Jack","Jack Sparrow","Sparrow (","( Depp","Depp )",") crosses","crosses paths","paths with","with a","a woman","woman from","from his","his past","past (","( Cruz","Cruz )",") ,",", and","and he","he 's","'s not","not sure","sure if","if it","it 's","'s love","love --","-- or","or if","if she","she 's","'s a","a ruthless","ruthless con","con artist","artist who","who 's","'s using","using him","him to","to find","find the","the fabled","fabled Fountain","Fountain of","of Youth","When she","she forces","forces him","him aboard","aboard the","the Queen","Queen Anne","Anne 's","'s Revenge","Revenge ,",", the","the ship","ship of","of the","the formidable","formidable pirate","pirate Blackbeard","Blackbeard (","( McShane","McShane )",") ,",", Jack","Jack finds","finds himself","himself on","on an","an unexpected","unexpected adventure","adventure in","in which","which he","he does","does n't","n't know","know who","who to","to fear","fear more","more :",": Blackbeard","Blackbeard or","or the","the woman","woman from","from his","his past"]}

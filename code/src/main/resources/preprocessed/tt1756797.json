{"title":"The Class Project: Social Class in American Pop Culture","plot":"What is more powerful than 'the media?' What has more influence over your life than popular culture? YOUR SOCIAL CLASS! Directly, and indirectly, your social class impacts your beliefs, your attitudes, the number of children you are likely to have, how long you will live, and even the people you will choose as friends, lovers, or spouses. The Class Project examines the role of popular culture in shaping Americans' beliefs and attitudes about social class as it relates to spending patterns, emotional disorders, beauty, romantic love, mate-selection, narcissism, and consumerism. Director Ed Laury teams up with Sociologist Lynn Navarette to take you on a joyride through the twists and turns of the American Class System.

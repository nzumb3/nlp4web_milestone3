{"title":"Heritages","plot":"When director Philippe Aractingi is forced to leave his motherland for the third time, the realisation dawns on him: his ancestors have been fleeing wars for five generations.

Experimenting with a radical new film-making style, he interlaces directed scenes and archive images with video-filmed personal diaries, family photos and super 8 reels.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"],"stems":["When","director","Philipp","Aractingi","is","forc","to","leav","his","motherland","for","the","third","time",",","the","realis","dawn","on","him",":","his","ancestor","have","been","flee","war","for","five","generat",".","Explore","his","root",",","Aractingi","goe","back","to","the","fall","of","the","Ottoman","Empire",",","the","creation","of","Israel","and","the","Lebanes","Civil","War",".","Experiment","with","a","radic","new","film-mak","style",",","he","interlac","direct","scene","and","archiv","imag","with","video-film","person","diari",",","famili","photo","and","super","8","reel","."],"lemmas":["when","director","Philippe","Aractingi","be","force","to","leave","he","motherland","for","the","third","time",",","the","realisation","dawn","on","he",":","he","ancestor","have","be","flee","war","for","five","generation",".","explore","he","root",",","Aractingi","go","back","to","the","fall","of","the","Ottoman","Empire",",","the","creation","of","Israel","and","the","Lebanese","Civil","War",".","experiment","with","a","radical","new","film-making","style",",","he","interlace","directed","scene","and","archive","image","with","video-filmed","personal","diary",",","family","photo","and","super","8","reel","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["When director Philippe","director Philippe Aractingi","Philippe Aractingi is","Aractingi is forced","is forced to","forced to leave","to leave his","leave his motherland","his motherland for","motherland for the","for the third","the third time","third time ,","time , the",", the realisation","the realisation dawns","realisation dawns on","dawns on him","on him :","him : his",": his ancestors","his ancestors have","ancestors have been","have been fleeing","been fleeing wars","fleeing wars for","wars for five","for five generations","Exploring his roots","his roots ,","roots , Aractingi",", Aractingi goes","Aractingi goes back","goes back to","back to the","to the fall","the fall of","fall of the","of the Ottoman","the Ottoman Empire","Ottoman Empire ,","Empire , the",", the creation","the creation of","creation of Israel","of Israel and","Israel and the","and the Lebanese","the Lebanese Civil","Lebanese Civil War","Experimenting with a","with a radical","a radical new","radical new film-making","new film-making style","film-making style ,","style , he",", he interlaces","he interlaces directed","interlaces directed scenes","directed scenes and","scenes and archive","and archive images","archive images with","images with video-filmed","with video-filmed personal","video-filmed personal diaries","personal diaries ,","diaries , family",", family photos","family photos and","photos and super","and super 8","super 8 reels"],"2grams":["When director","director Philippe","Philippe Aractingi","Aractingi is","is forced","forced to","to leave","leave his","his motherland","motherland for","for the","the third","third time","time ,",", the","the realisation","realisation dawns","dawns on","on him","him :",": his","his ancestors","ancestors have","have been","been fleeing","fleeing wars","wars for","for five","five generations","Exploring his","his roots","roots ,",", Aractingi","Aractingi goes","goes back","back to","to the","the fall","fall of","of the","the Ottoman","Ottoman Empire","Empire ,",", the","the creation","creation of","of Israel","Israel and","and the","the Lebanese","Lebanese Civil","Civil War","Experimenting with","with a","a radical","radical new","new film-making","film-making style","style ,",", he","he interlaces","interlaces directed","directed scenes","scenes and","and archive","archive images","images with","with video-filmed","video-filmed personal","personal diaries","diaries ,",", family","family photos","photos and","and super","super 8","8 reels"]}

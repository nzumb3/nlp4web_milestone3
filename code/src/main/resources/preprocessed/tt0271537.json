{"title":"Happy Here and Now","plot":"In New Orleans, a young woman named Muriel goes missing. Her sister, Amelia, arrives to look for her. Aided by her aunt's lover, an ex-CIA agent named Bill, Amelia finds evidence on Muriel's computer of conversations with a mysterious and philosophical man. Bill and Amelia's search for him is fitful, but we learn that he's Eddie, a local exterminator who wants to produce and direct a movie about Nicholas Tesla. We follow Eddie, full of schemes, and we meet his brother, Tom, a firefighter who may know something about the death of a man whose widow, Hannah, seeks him out. What has happened to Muriel? Is this a world where anything can be known?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","New","Orlean",",","a","young","woman","name","Muriel","goe","miss",".","Her","sister",",","Amelia",",","arriv","to","look","for","her",".","Aide","by","her","aunt","'s","lover",",","an","ex-CIA","agent","name","Bill",",","Amelia","find","evid","on","Muriel","'s","comput","of","convers","with","a","mysteri","and","philosoph","man",".","Bill","and","Amelia","'s","search","for","him","is","fit",",","but","we","learn","that","he","'s","Eddie",",","a","local","extermin","who","want","to","produc","and","direct","a","movi","about","Nichola","Tesla",".","We","follow","Eddie",",","full","of","scheme",",","and","we","meet","his","brother",",","Tom",",","a","firefight","who","may","know","someth","about","the","death","of","a","man","whose","widow",",","Hannah",",","seek","him","out",".","What","has","happen","to","Muriel","?","Is","this","a","world","where","anyth","can","be","known","?"],"lemmas":["in","New","Orleans",",","a","young","woman","name","Muriel","go","miss",".","she","sister",",","Amelia",",","arrive","to","look","for","she",".","aid","by","she","aunt","'s","lover",",","a","ex-cia","agent","name","Bill",",","Amelia","find","evidence","on","Muriel","'s","computer","of","conversation","with","a","mysterious","and","philosophical","man",".","Bill","and","Amelia","'s","search","for","he","be","fitful",",","but","we","learn","that","he","be","Eddie",",","a","local","exterminator","who","want","to","produce","and","direct","a","movie","about","Nicholas","Tesla",".","we","follow","Eddie",",","full","of","scheme",",","and","we","meet","he","brother",",","Tom",",","a","firefighter","who","may","know","something","about","the","death","of","a","man","whose","widow",",","Hannah",",","seek","he","out",".","what","have","happen","to","Muriel","?","be","this","a","world","where","anything","can","be","know","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

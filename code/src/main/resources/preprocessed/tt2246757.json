{"title":"In the Third Person","plot":"The personal journey of Arthur Yakobov, an Israeli-Bukhari artist and painter, into the depths of his own family, a family from which he was expelled as a little child and never got to know. In an attempt to piece together the shreds of painful memories, Arthur exposes his family - a Bukhari immigrant family, conflicted and divided, that preserves the dynamics of violence, jealousy, and cruelty between its men, women and children as they struggle and fail to adjust to Israeli life. With open eyes, and out of a desire to reassemble the missing memory of his family, the reality that's revealed by the film works in direct opposition to this desire, disassembling the idea of \"the family\" so essential and central to Jewish tradition, as well as to the Bukhari Jews and to Israel as a whole in the year 2010.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","person","journey","of","Arthur","Yakobov",",","an","Israeli-Bukhari","artist","and","painter",",","into","the","depth","of","his","own","famili",",","a","famili","from","which","he","was","expel","as","a","littl","child","and","never","got","to","know",".","In","an","attempt","to","piec","togeth","the","shred","of","pain","memori",",","Arthur","expos","his","famili","-","a","Bukhari","immigr","famili",",","conflict","and","divid",",","that","preserv","the","dynam","of","violenc",",","jealousi",",","and","cruelti","between","it","men",",","women","and","children","as","they","struggl","and","fail","to","adjust","to","Israeli","life",".","With","open","eye",",","and","out","of","a","desir","to","reassembl","the","miss","memori","of","his","famili",",","the","realiti","that","'s","reveal","by","the","film","work","in","direct","opposit","to","this","desir",",","disassembl","the","idea","of","\"","the","famili","\"","so","essenti","and","central","to","Jewish","tradit",",","as","well","as","to","the","Bukhari","Jew","and","to","Israel","as","a","whole","in","the","year","2010","."],"lemmas":["the","personal","journey","of","Arthur","Yakobov",",","a","israeli-bukhari","artist","and","painter",",","into","the","depths","of","he","own","family",",","a","family","from","which","he","be","expel","as","a","little","child","and","never","get","to","know",".","in","a","attempt","to","piece","together","the","shred","of","painful","memory",",","Arthur","expose","he","family","-","a","Bukhari","immigrant","family",",","conflict","and","divide",",","that","preserve","the","dynamics","of","violence",",","jealousy",",","and","cruelty","between","its","man",",","woman","and","child","as","they","struggle","and","fail","to","adjust","to","israeli","life",".","with","open","eye",",","and","out","of","a","desire","to","reassemble","the","miss","memory","of","he","family",",","the","reality","that","be","reveal","by","the","film","work","in","direct","opposition","to","this","desire",",","disassemble","the","idea","of","``","the","family","''","so","essential","and","central","to","jewish","tradition",",","as","well","as","to","the","Bukhari","Jews","and","to","Israel","as","a","whole","in","the","year","2010","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The personal journey","personal journey of","journey of Arthur","of Arthur Yakobov","Arthur Yakobov ,","Yakobov , an",", an Israeli-Bukhari","an Israeli-Bukhari artist","Israeli-Bukhari artist and","artist and painter","and painter ,","painter , into",", into the","into the depths","the depths of","depths of his","of his own","his own family","own family ,","family , a",", a family","a family from","family from which","from which he","which he was","he was expelled","was expelled as","expelled as a","as a little","a little child","little child and","child and never","and never got","never got to","got to know","In an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to piece","to piece together","piece together the","together the shreds","the shreds of","shreds of painful","of painful memories","painful memories ,","memories , Arthur",", Arthur exposes","Arthur exposes his","exposes his family","his family -","family -

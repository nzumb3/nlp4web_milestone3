{"title":"Unseen Evil","plot":"A group of hikers led by a college professor are searching the woods for an ancient Indian burial mound. When they discover a likely site, three members of the group reveal themselves to be grave looters, and tie up the others so they can keep the valuable artefacts for themselves. In the course of ransacking the mound, one of them stumbles across a cursed crown that unleashes the mound's guardian: an invisible monster that begins attacking everyone it finds. Will anyone make it back to civilization alive?","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["A","group","of","hiker","led","by","a","colleg","professor","are","search","the","wood","for","an","ancient","Indian","burial","mound",".","When","they","discov","a","like","site",",","three","member","of","the","group","reveal","themselv","to","be","grave","looter",",","and","tie","up","the","other","so","they","can","keep","the","valuabl","artefact","for","themselv",".","In","the","cours","of","ransack","the","mound",",","one","of","them","stumbl","across","a","curs","crown","that","unleash","the","mound","'s","guardian",":","an","invis","monster","that","begin","attack","everyon","it","find",".","Will","anyon","make","it","back","to","civil","aliv","?"],"lemmas":["a","group","of","hiker","lead","by","a","college","professor","be","search","the","wood","for","a","ancient","indian","burial","mound",".","when","they","discover","a","likely","site",",","three","member","of","the","group","reveal","themselves","to","be","grave","looter",",","and","tie","up","the","other","so","they","can","keep","the","valuable","artefact","for","themselves",".","in","the","course","of","ransack","the","mound",",","one","of","they","stumble","across","a","cursed","crown","that","unleash","the","mound","'s","guardian",":","a","invisible","monster","that","begin","attack","everyone","it","find",".","will","anyone","make","it","back","to","civilization","alive","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A group of","group of hikers","of hikers led","hikers led by","led by a","by a college","a college professor","college professor are","professor are searching","are searching the","searching the woods","the woods for","woods for an","for an ancient","an ancient Indian","ancient Indian burial","Indian burial mound","When they discover","they discover a","discover a likely","a likely site","likely site ,","site , three",", three members","three members of","members of the","of the group","the group reveal","group reveal themselves","reveal themselves to","themselves to be","to be grave","be grave looters","grave looters ,","looters , and",", and tie","and tie up","tie up the","up the others","the others so","others so they","so they can","they can keep","can keep the","keep the valuable","the valuable artefacts","valuable artefacts for","artefacts for themselves","In the course","the course of","course of ransacking","of ransacking the","ransacking the mound","the mound ,","mound , one",", one of","one of them","of them stumbles","them stumbles across","stumbles across a","across a cursed","a cursed crown","cursed crown that","crown that unleashes","that unleashes the","unleashes the mound","the mound 's","mound 's guardian","'s guardian :","guardian : an",": an invisible","an invisible monster","invisible monster that","monster that begins","that begins attacking","begins attacking everyone","attacking everyone it","everyone it finds","Will anyone make","anyone make it","make it back","it back to","back to civilization","to civilization alive"],"2grams":["A group","group of","of hikers","hikers led","led by","by a","a college","college professor","professor are","are searching","searching the","the woods","woods for","for an","an ancient","ancient Indian","Indian burial","burial mound","When they","they discover","discover a","a likely","likely site","site ,",", three","three members","members of","of the","the group","group reveal","reveal themselves","themselves to","to be","be grave","grave looters","looters ,",", and","and tie","tie up","up the","the others","others so","so they","they can","can keep","keep the","the valuable","valuable artefacts","artefacts for","for themselves","In the","the course","course of","of ransacking","ransacking the","the mound","mound ,",", one","one of","of them","them stumbles","stumbles across","across a","a cursed","cursed crown","crown that","that unleashes","unleashes the","the mound","mound 's","'s guardian","guardian :",": an","an invisible","invisible monster","monster that","that begins","begins attacking","attacking everyone","everyone it","it finds","Will anyone","anyone make","make it","it back","back to","to civilization","civilization alive"]}

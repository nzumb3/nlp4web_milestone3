{"title":"O Poeta","plot":"O POETA Marco Nicoletti's synopsis Junior would like to be a poet full-time, but he did not publish big thing, and is not really recognized in the Sao Paulo's poetry crowd. To contribute to maintain his small family (his wife Helena with whom he has an one-year-old baby girl, Aurora), he spends time showing apartments to customers who avoid them. As a matter of fact he's as much \"successful\" in the real estate as he is in the poetry... But the life in Sao Paulo is expensive, and his wife begin to worry about the incapacity of her husband to face reality... One day Junior purchases a ticket of the national lottery, and hide it in the shelves of the living room. Few days later, when he discovers that he eventually won the lottery, the ticket is lost... The Poet describes junior's increasing obsession for the lottery ticket, and its descent in the sheer madness. He eventually looks for the promised ticket in the dump of Sao Paulo (one of the largest on western world), and writes to the president Dilma, to get back the money he deserves. His desperate search allows us to make also an investigation on the emergent artists of contemporary Sao Paulo.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["O","POETA","Marco","Nicoletti","'s","synopsi","Junior","would","like","to","be","a","poet","full-tim",",","but","he","did","not","publish","big","thing",",","and","is","not","realli","recogn","in","the","Sao","Paulo","'s","poetri","crowd",".","To","contribut","to","maintain","his","small","famili","(","his","wife","Helena","with","whom","he","has","an","one-year-old","babi","girl",",","Aurora",")",",","he","spend","time","show","apart","to","custom","who","avoid","them",".","As","a","matter","of","fact","he","'s","as","much","\"","success","\"","in","the","real","estat","as","he","is","in","the","poetri","...","But","the","life","in","Sao","Paulo","is","expens",",","and","his","wife","begin","to","worri","about","the","incapac","of","her","husband","to","face","realiti","...","One","day","Junior","purchas","a","ticket","of","the","nation","lotteri",",","and","hide","it","in","the","shelv","of","the","live","room",".","Few","day","later",",","when","he","discov","that","he","eventu","won","the","lotteri",",","the","ticket","is","lost","...","The","Poet","describ","junior","'s","increas","obsess","for","the","lotteri","ticket",",","and","it","descent","in","the","sheer","mad",".","He","eventu","look","for","the","promis","ticket","in","the","dump","of","Sao","Paulo","(","one","of","the","largest","on","western","world",")",",","and","write","to","the","presid","Dilma",",","to","get","back","the","money","he","deserv",".","His","desper","search","allow","us","to","make","also","an","investig","on","the","emerg","artist","of","contemporari","Sao","Paulo","."],"lemmas":["O","POETA","Marco","nicoletti","'s","synopsis","Junior","would","like","to","be","a","poet","full-time",",","but","he","do","not","publish","big","thing",",","and","be","not","really","recognize","in","the","Sao","Paulo","'s","poetry","crowd",".","to","contribute","to","maintain","he","small","family","-lrb-","he","wife","Helena","with","whom","he","have","a","one-year-old","baby","girl",",","Aurora","-rrb-",",","he","spend","time","show","apartment","to","customer","who","avoid","they",".","as","a","matter","of","fact","he","be","as","much","``","successful","''","in","the","real","estate","as","he","be","in","the","poetry","...","but","the","life","in","Sao","Paulo","be","expensive",",","and","he","wife","begin","to","worry","about","the","incapacity","of","she","husband","to","face","reality","...","one","day","Junior","purchase","a","ticket","of","the","national","lottery",",","and","hide","it","in","the","shelf","of","the","living","room",".","few","day","later",",","when","he","discover","that","he","eventually","win","the","lottery",",","the","ticket","be","lose","...","the","Poet","describe","junior","'s","increase","obsession","for","the","lottery","ticket",",","and","its","descent","in","the","sheer","madness",".","he","eventually","look","for","the","promised","ticket","in","the","dump","of","Sao","Paulo","-lrb-","one","of","the","largest","on","western","world","-rrb-",",","and","write","to","the","president","Dilma",",","to","get","back","the","money","he","deserve",".","he","desperate","search","allow","we","to","make","also","a","investigation","on","the","emergent","artist","of","contemporary","Sao","Paulo","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["O POETA Marco","POETA Marco Nicoletti","Marco Nicoletti 's","Nicoletti 's synopsis","'s synopsis Junior","synopsis Junior would","Junior would like","would like to","like to be","to be a","be a poet","a poet full-time","poet full-time ,","full-time , but",", but he","but he did","he did not","did not publish","not publish big","publish big thing","big thing ,","thing , and",", and is","and is not","is not really","not really recognized","really recognized in","recognized in the","in the Sao","the Sao Paulo","Sao Paulo 's","Paulo 's poetry","'s poetry crowd","To contribute to","contribute to maintain","to maintain his","maintain his small","his small family","small family (","family ( his","( his wife","his wife Helena","wife Helena with","Helena with whom","with whom he","whom he has","he has an","has an one-year-old","an one-year-old baby","one-year-old baby girl","baby girl ,","girl , Aurora",", Aurora )","Aurora ) ,",") , he",", he spends","he spends time","spends time showing","time showing apartments","showing apartments to","apartments to customers","to customers who","customers who avoid","who avoid them","As a matter","a matter of","matter of fact","of fact he","fact he 's","he 's as","'s as much","as much \"","much \" successful","\" successful \"","successful \" in","\" in the","in the real","the real estate","real estate as","estate as he","as he is","he is in","is in the","in the poetry","the poetry ...","poetry ...

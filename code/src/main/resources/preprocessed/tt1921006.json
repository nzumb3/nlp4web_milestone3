{"title":"Luther's Magic Weed","plot":"Craig, acid-dealing punk and aspiring chemist, pours a batch of failed speed on his brother Brock's marijuana, creating a drug that induces orgiastic funk parties. This makes Craig popular at school and allows Brock to exact revenge upon his emasculating ex-girlfriend, but it also damages Craig's budding relationship with a girl he may really like. Luther, a homicidal 70s-style drug kingpin, wants the formula, and comes to get it at GrooveTaco, the play-within-the-movie, an homage to lesbian assassin hookers written by Craig's psuedo-freudian drama teacher.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Craig",",","acid-d","punk","and","aspir","chemist",",","pour","a","batch","of","fail","speed","on","his","brother","Brock","'s","marijuana",",","creat","a","drug","that","induc","orgiast","funk","parti",".","This","make","Craig","popular","at","school","and","allow","Brock","to","exact","reveng","upon","his","emascul","ex-girlfriend",",","but","it","also","damag","Craig","'s","bud","relationship","with","a","girl","he","may","realli","like",".","Luther",",","a","homicid","70s-style","drug","kingpin",",","want","the","formula",",","and","come","to","get","it","at","GrooveTaco",",","the","play-within-the-movi",",","an","homag","to","lesbian","assassin","hooker","written","by","Craig","'s","psuedo-freudian","drama","teacher","."],"lemmas":["Craig",",","acid-dealing","punk","and","aspire","chemist",",","pour","a","batch","of","failed","speed","on","he","brother","Brock","'s","marijuana",",","create","a","drug","that","induce","orgiastic","funk","party",".","this","make","Craig","popular","at","school","and","allow","Brock","to","exact","revenge","upon","he","emasculate","ex-girlfriend",",","but","it","also","damage","Craig","'s","budding","relationship","with","a","girl","he","may","really","like",".","Luther",",","a","homicidal","70s-style","drug","kingpin",",","want","the","formula",",","and","come","to","get","it","at","GrooveTaco",",","the","play-within-the-movie",",","a","homage","to","lesbian","assassin","hooker","write","by","Craig","'s","psuedo-freudian","drama","teacher","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Craig , acid-dealing",", acid-dealing punk","acid-dealing punk and","punk and aspiring","and aspiring chemist","aspiring chemist ,","chemist , pours",", pours a","pours a batch","a batch of","batch of failed","of failed speed","failed speed on","speed on his","on his brother","his brother Brock","brother Brock 's","Brock 's marijuana","'s marijuana ,","marijuana , creating",", creating a","creating a drug","a drug that","drug that induces","that induces orgiastic","induces orgiastic funk","orgiastic funk parties","This makes Craig","makes Craig popular","Craig popular at","popular at school","at school and","school and allows","and allows Brock","allows Brock to","Brock to exact","to exact revenge","exact revenge upon","revenge upon his","upon his emasculating","his emasculating ex-girlfriend","emasculating ex-girlfriend ,","ex-girlfriend , but",", but it","but it also","it also damages","also damages Craig","damages Craig 's","Craig 's budding","'s budding relationship","budding relationship with","relationship with a","with a girl","a girl he","girl he may","he may really","may really like","Luther , a",", a homicidal","a homicidal 70s-style","homicidal 70s-style drug","70s-style drug kingpin","drug kingpin ,","kingpin , wants",", wants the","wants the formula","the formula ,","formula , and",", and comes","and comes to","comes to get","to get it","get it at","it at GrooveTaco","at GrooveTaco ,","GrooveTaco , the",", the play-within-the-movie","the play-within-the-movie ,","play-within-the-movie , an",", an homage","an homage to","homage to lesbian","to lesbian assassin","lesbian assassin hookers","assassin hookers written","hookers written by","written by Craig","by Craig 's","Craig 's psuedo-freudian","'s psuedo-freudian drama","psuedo-freudian drama teacher"],"2grams":["Craig ,",", acid-dealing","acid-dealing punk","punk and","and aspiring","aspiring chemist","chemist ,",", pours","pours a","a batch","batch of","of failed","failed speed","speed on","on his","his brother","brother Brock","Brock 's","'s marijuana","marijuana ,",", creating","creating a","a drug","drug that","that induces","induces orgiastic","orgiastic funk","funk parties","This makes","makes Craig","Craig popular","popular at","at school","school and","and allows","allows Brock","Brock to","to exact","exact revenge","revenge upon","upon his","his emasculating","emasculating ex-girlfriend","ex-girlfriend ,",", but","but it","it also","also damages","damages Craig","Craig 's","'s budding","budding relationship","relationship with","with a","a girl","girl he","he may","may really","really like","Luther ,",", a","a homicidal","homicidal 70s-style","70s-style drug","drug kingpin","kingpin ,",", wants","wants the","the formula","formula ,",", and","and comes","comes to","to get","get it","it at","at GrooveTaco","GrooveTaco ,",", the","the play-within-the-movie","play-within-the-movie ,",", an","an homage","homage to","to lesbian","lesbian assassin","assassin hookers","hookers written","written by","by Craig","Craig 's","'s psuedo-freudian","psuedo-freudian drama","drama teacher"]}

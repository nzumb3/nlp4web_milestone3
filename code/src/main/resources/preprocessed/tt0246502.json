{"title":"Closed Country","plot":"Many years after World War II, evidence showing a connection between Swiss policy and the deportation and murder of Charles and Sabine Sonabend's parents at Auschwitz fall into Charles's hands. This startling film documents the journey of the brother and sister back to Switzerland, where they confront people from their past, including a former government border official and a nun from a monastery where the children briefly were hidden. The insensitive and intolerant attitude of these Swiss people is shocking.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Mani","year","after","World","War","II",",","evid","show","a","connect","between","Swiss","polici","and","the","deport","and","murder","of","Charl","and","Sabin","Sonabend","'s","parent","at","Auschwitz","fall","into","Charl","'s","hand",".","This","startl","film","document","the","journey","of","the","brother","and","sister","back","to","Switzerland",",","where","they","confront","peopl","from","their","past",",","includ","a","former","govern","border","offici","and","a","nun","from","a","monasteri","where","the","children","briefli","were","hidden",".","The","insensit","and","intoler","attitud","of","these","Swiss","peopl","is","shock","."],"lemmas":["many","year","after","World","War","II",",","evidence","show","a","connection","between","swiss","policy","and","the","deportation","and","murder","of","Charles","and","Sabine","Sonabend","'s","parent","at","Auschwitz","fall","into","Charles","'s","hand",".","this","startling","film","document","the","journey","of","the","brother","and","sister","back","to","Switzerland",",","where","they","confront","people","from","they","past",",","include","a","former","government","border","official","and","a","nun","from","a","monastery","where","the","child","briefly","be","hide",".","the","insensitive","and","intolerant","attitude","of","these","swiss","people","be","shocking","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Many years after","years after World","after World War","World War II","War II ,","II , evidence",", evidence showing","evidence showing a","showing a connection","a connection between","connection between Swiss","between Swiss policy","Swiss policy and","policy and the","and the deportation","the deportation and","deportation and murder","and murder of","murder of Charles","of Charles and","Charles and Sabine","and Sabine Sonabend","Sabine Sonabend 's","Sonabend 's parents","'s parents at","parents at Auschwitz","at Auschwitz fall","Auschwitz fall into","fall into Charles","into Charles 's","Charles 's hands","This startling film","startling film documents","film documents the","documents the journey","the journey of","journey of the","of the brother","the brother and","brother and sister","and sister back","sister back to","back to Switzerland","to Switzerland ,","Switzerland , where",", where they","where they confront","they confront people","confront people from","people from their","from their past","their past ,","past , including",", including a","including a former","a former government","former government border","government border official","border official and","official and a","and a nun","a nun from","nun from a","from a monastery","a monastery where","monastery where the","where the children","the children briefly","children briefly were","briefly were hidden","The insensitive and","insensitive and intolerant","and intolerant attitude","intolerant attitude of","attitude of these","of these Swiss","these Swiss people","Swiss people is","people is shocking"],"2grams":["Many years","years after","after World","World War","War II","II ,",", evidence","evidence showing","showing a","a connection","connection between","between Swiss","Swiss policy","policy and","and the","the deportation","deportation and","and murder","murder of","of Charles","Charles and","and Sabine","Sabine Sonabend","Sonabend 's","'s parents","parents at","at Auschwitz","Auschwitz fall","fall into","into Charles","Charles 's","'s hands","This startling","startling film","film documents","documents the","the journey","journey of","of the","the brother","brother and","and sister","sister back","back to","to Switzerland","Switzerland ,",", where","where they","they confront","confront people","people from","from their","their past","past ,",", including","including a","a former","former government","government border","border official","official and","and a","a nun","nun from","from a","a monastery","monastery where","where the","the children","children briefly","briefly were","were hidden","The insensitive","insensitive and","and intolerant","intolerant attitude","attitude of","of these","these Swiss","Swiss people","people is","is shocking"]}

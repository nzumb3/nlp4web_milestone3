{"title":"Frammenti Della Vita: Jefferson Rubin","plot":"Filmed in Italy and Colorado, this documentary, produced by CPT12PBS, reveals the fascinating life story of neo-classical sculptor Jefferson Rubin. Jefferson named the male and female torsos that he created Frammenti. His work was at once classical and contemporary. Jefferson D. Rubin was a brilliant young artist whose humanistic and classical art embraced the poetry of sculpture that descends from ancient and Renaissance antecedents. A Colorado native, he studied and worked in the United States and Italy, and was founder, director, and principal teacher of La Scuola Classical Sculpture School in Denver. Rubin exhibited in galleries and museums across the country and abroad, and his rare pieces are prized in many private collections. He died in a tragic mountain accident in August 1995 at the age of 36.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Film","in","Itali","and","Colorado",",","this","documentari",",","produc","by","CPT12PBS",",","reveal","the","fascin","life","stori","of","neo-class","sculptor","Jefferson","Rubin",".","Jefferson","name","the","male","and","femal","torso","that","he","creat","Frammenti",".","His","work","was","at","onc","classic","and","contemporari",".","Jefferson","D.","Rubin","was","a","brilliant","young","artist","whose","humanist","and","classic","art","embrac","the","poetri","of","sculptur","that","descend","from","ancient","and","Renaiss","anteced",".","A","Colorado","nativ",",","he","studi","and","work","in","the","Unite","State","and","Itali",",","and","was","founder",",","director",",","and","princip","teacher","of","La","Scuola","Classic","Sculptur","School","in","Denver",".","Rubin","exhibit","in","galleri","and","museum","across","the","countri","and","abroad",",","and","his","rare","piec","are","prize","in","mani","privat","collect",".","He","die","in","a","tragic","mountain","accid","in","August","1995","at","the","age","of","36","."],"lemmas":["film","in","Italy","and","Colorado",",","this","documentary",",","produce","by","cpt12pbs",",","reveal","the","fascinating","life","story","of","neo-classical","sculptor","Jefferson","Rubin",".","Jefferson","name","the","male","and","female","torso","that","he","create","Frammenti",".","he","work","be","at","once","classical","and","contemporary",".","Jefferson","D.","Rubin","be","a","brilliant","young","artist","whose","humanistic","and","classical","art","embrace","the","poetry","of","sculpture","that","descend","from","ancient","and","Renaissance","antecedent",".","a","Colorado","native",",","he","study","and","work","in","the","United","States","and","Italy",",","and","be","founder",",","director",",","and","principal","teacher","of","La","Scuola","Classical","Sculpture","School","in","Denver",".","Rubin","exhibit","in","gallery","and","museum","across","the","country","and","abroad",",","and","he","rare","piece","be","prize","in","many","private","collection",".","he","die","in","a","tragic","mountain","accident","in","August","1995","at","the","age","of","36","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Filmed in Italy","in Italy and","Italy and Colorado","and Colorado ,","Colorado , this",", this documentary","this documentary ,","documentary , produced",", produced by","produced by CPT12PBS","by CPT12PBS ,","CPT12PBS , reveals",", reveals the","reveals the fascinating","the fascinating life","fascinating life story","life story of","story of neo-classical","of neo-classical sculptor","neo-classical sculptor Jefferson","sculptor Jefferson Rubin","Jefferson named the","named the male","the male and","male and female","and female torsos","female torsos that","torsos that he","that he created","he created Frammenti","His work was","work was at","was at once","at once classical","once classical and","classical and contemporary","Jefferson D.

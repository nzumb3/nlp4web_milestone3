{"title":"Desperate Cowboys","plot":"A terminally ill attorney, Burch, is in need of a hear transplant which he cannot afford. When an opportunity arises that could pay for the operation he calls on his wayward son Ferris, who is out on bail, to help him perform a simple task. Things turn south quickly when Ferris botches the task requested of him and he and his father end up with a large amount of cocaine in their possession. Soon after, a ruthless cowboy connected with the drug cartel out of Texas comes searching for his missing drugs. While also in the hunt is the tenacious bail bondsman, Val, who is determined to track down Ferris at all costs. The paths of all these men will intersect as they each stop at nothing to come out ahead no matter how desperate things may get.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller","

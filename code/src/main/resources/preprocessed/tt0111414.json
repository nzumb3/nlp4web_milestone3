{"title":"A Thin Life","plot":"A lonely man on the run is trapped inside a house. He reflects on the mistakes in his life as he awaits his certain end. Paranoia has driven him to distrust everything, including himself. As he toys with his history and rewrites aspects that he didn't want to own up to, those that mean to do him harm slowly close-in. Or do they? Is it really himself that he is afraid of and everybody else has long forgotten him and moved on?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","lone","man","on","the","run","is","trap","insid","a","hous",".","He","reflect","on","the","mistak","in","his","life","as","he","await","his","certain","end",".","Paranoia","has","driven","him","to","distrust","everyth",",","includ","himself",".","As","he","toy","with","his","histori","and","rewrit","aspect","that","he","did","n't","want","to","own","up","to",",","those","that","mean","to","do","him","harm","slowli","close-in",".","Or","do","they","?","Is","it","realli","himself","that","he","is","afraid","of","and","everybodi","els","has","long","forgotten","him","and","move","on","?"],"lemmas":["a","lonely","man","on","the","run","be","trap","inside","a","house",".","he","reflect","on","the","mistake","in","he","life","as","he","await","he","certain","end",".","paranoia","have","drive","he","to","distrust","everything",",","include","himself",".","as","he","toy","with","he","history","and","rewrite","aspect","that","he","do","not","want","to","own","up","to",",","those","that","mean","to","do","he","harm","slowly","close-in",".","or","do","they","?","be","it","really","himself","that","he","be","afraid","of","and","everybody","else","have","long","forget","he","and","move","on","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A lonely man","lonely man on","man on the","on the run","the run is","run is trapped","is trapped inside","trapped inside a","inside a house","He reflects on","reflects on the","on the mistakes","the mistakes in","mistakes in his","in his life","his life as","life as he","as he awaits","he awaits his","awaits his certain","his certain end","Paranoia has driven","has driven him","driven him to","him to distrust","to distrust everything","distrust everything ,","everything , including",", including himself","As he toys","he toys with","toys with his","with his history","his history and","history and rewrites","and rewrites aspects","rewrites aspects that","aspects that he","that he did","he did n't","did n't want","n't want to","want to own","to own up","own up to","up to ,","to , those",", those that","those that mean","that mean to","mean to do","to do him","do him harm","him harm slowly","harm slowly close-in","Or do they","Is it really","it really himself","really himself that","himself that he","that he is","he is afraid","is afraid of","afraid of and","of and everybody","and everybody else","everybody else has","else has long","has long forgotten","long forgotten him","forgotten him and","him and moved","and moved on"],"2grams":["A lonely","lonely man","man on","on the","the run","run is","is trapped","trapped inside","inside a","a house","He reflects","reflects on","on the","the mistakes","mistakes in","in his","his life","life as","as he","he awaits","awaits his","his certain","certain end","Paranoia has","has driven","driven him","him to","to distrust","distrust everything","everything ,",", including","including himself","As he","he toys","toys with","with his","his history","history and","and rewrites","rewrites aspects","aspects that","that he","he did","did n't","n't want","want to","to own","own up","up to","to ,",", those","those that","that mean","mean to","to do","do him","him harm","harm slowly","slowly close-in","Or do","do they","Is it","it really","really himself","himself that","that he","he is","is afraid","afraid of","of and","and everybody","everybody else","else has","has long","long forgotten","forgotten him","him and","and moved","moved on"]}

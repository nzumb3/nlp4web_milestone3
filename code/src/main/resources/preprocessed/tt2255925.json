{"title":"Pursuit the Movie","plot":"Two graduate students, Rose and Jacob, set out to find a new mineral. When they arrive, Jacob becomes infected by the substance, which somehow increases his strength, but also drives him insane. His girlfriend, Rose, fights to survive as she is hunted through the wilderness. Columbia College Chicago's student based Team Havik Films launch their first major film project, Pursuit. It is a Sci-Fi Thriller based on the screenplay by Andrew Havlik (Adero's Lovely Breakup Note, Comcast and MTV networks, Jan Verner's Imagination, and creator of Team Havik Films), Miles Robinson (Adero's Lovely Breakup Note, Director/Writer), Rory Cunningham, and Laura Martino. Success has become this production's second name. \"All coverage we were planning on capturing took place, even though some shortcuts and compromises had to be made, just as on any major production with a tight budget and schedule,\" says Andrew Havlik, the Director of Photography and one of the Producers of the film.","genres":["Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Two","graduat","student",",","Rose","and","Jacob",",","set","out","to","find","a","new","miner",".","When","they","arriv",",","Jacob","becom","infect","by","the","substanc",",","which","somehow","increas","his","strength",",","but","also","drive","him","insan",".","His","girlfriend",",","Rose",",","fight","to","surviv","as","she","is","hunt","through","the","wilder",".","Columbia","Colleg","Chicago","'s","student","base","Team","Havik","Film","launch","their","first","major","film","project",",","Pursuit",".","It","is","a","Sci-Fi","Thriller","base","on","the","screenplay","by","Andrew","Havlik","(","Adero","'s","Love","Breakup","Note",",","Comcast","and","MTV","network",",","Jan","Verner","'s","Imagin",",","and","creator","of","Team","Havik","Film",")",",","Mile","Robinson","(","Adero","'s","Love","Breakup","Note",",","Director/Writ",")",",","Rori","Cunningham",",","and","Laura","Martino",".","Success","has","becom","this","product","'s","second","name",".","\"","All","coverag","we","were","plan","on","captur","took","place",",","even","though","some","shortcut","and","compromis","had","to","be","made",",","just","as","on","ani","major","product","with","a","tight","budget","and","schedul",",","\"","say","Andrew","Havlik",",","the","Director","of","Photographi","and","one","of","the","Produc","of","the","film","."],"lemmas":["two","graduate","student",",","Rose","and","Jacob",",","set","out","to","find","a","new","mineral",".","when","they","arrive",",","Jacob","become","infect","by","the","substance",",","which","somehow","increase","he","strength",",","but","also","drive","he","insane",".","he","girlfriend",",","Rose",",","fight","to","survive","as","she","be","hunt","through","the","wilderness",".","Columbia","College","Chicago","'s","student","base","Team","Havik","film","launch","they","first","major","film","project",",","pursuit",".","it","be","a","Sci-Fi","Thriller","base","on","the","screenplay","by","Andrew","Havlik","-lrb-","Adero","'s","lovely","breakup","note",",","Comcast","and","MTV","network",",","Jan","Verner","'s","imagination",",","and","creator","of","Team","Havik","film","-rrb-",",","Miles","Robinson","-lrb-","Adero","'s","Lovely","Breakup","note",",","director/writer","-rrb-",",","Rory","Cunningham",",","and","Laura","Martino",".","success","have","become","this","production","'s","second","name",".","``","all","coverage","we","be","plan","on","capture","take","place",",","even","though","some","shortcut","and","compromise","have","to","be","make",",","just","as","on","any","major","production","with","a","tight","budget","and","schedule",",","''","say","Andrew","Havlik",",","the","Director","of","Photography","and","one","of","the","Producers","of","the","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two

{"title":"Bandit Queen","plot":"The movie tells the story of the bandit queen Phoolan Devi who was sent to prison in 1983 and got free in 1994. During five years she was prosecuted by the Indian police and turned into a legend (like a modern Robin Hood) by the Indian press. Although the press tended to make her the optimal hero with blue eyes, dark hair, being tall and beautiful she was in reality an average Indian which makes it hard for the movie to fulfill the expectations of the audience and tell the truth at the same time. Later in her life,She entered into the politics and was assassinated in 2001.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["The","movi","tell","the","stori","of","the","bandit","queen","Phoolan","Devi","who","was","sent","to","prison","in","1983","and","got","free","in","1994",".","Dure","five","year","she","was","prosecut","by","the","Indian","polic","and","turn","into","a","legend","(","like","a","modern","Robin","Hood",")","by","the","Indian","press",".","Although","the","press","tend","to","make","her","the","optim","hero","with","blue","eye",",","dark","hair",",","be","tall","and","beauti","she","was","in","realiti","an","averag","Indian","which","make","it","hard","for","the","movi","to","fulfil","the","expect","of","the","audienc","and","tell","the","truth","at","the","same","time",".","Later","in","her","life",",","She","enter","into","the","polit","and","was","assassin","in","2001","."],"lemmas":["the","movie","tell","the","story","of","the","bandit","queen","Phoolan","Devi","who","be","send","to","prison","in","1983","and","get","free","in","1994",".","during","five","year","she","be","prosecute","by","the","indian","police","and","turn","into","a","legend","-lrb-","like","a","modern","Robin","Hood","-rrb-","by","the","indian","press",".","although","the","press","tend","to","make","she","the","optimal","hero","with","blue","eye",",","dark","hair",",","be","tall","and","beautiful","she","be","in","reality","a","average","Indian","which","make","it","hard","for","the","movie","to","fulfill","the","expectation","of","the","audience","and","tell","the","truth","at","the","same","time",".","later","in","she","life",",","she","enter","into","the","politics","and","be","assassinate","in","2001","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The movie tells","movie tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of the","of the bandit","the bandit queen","bandit queen Phoolan","queen Phoolan Devi","Phoolan Devi who","Devi who was","who was sent","was sent to","sent to prison","to prison in","prison in 1983","in 1983 and","1983 and got","and got free","got free in","free in 1994","During five years","five years she","years she was","she was prosecuted","was prosecuted by","prosecuted by the","by the Indian","the Indian police","Indian police and","police and turned","and turned into","turned into a","into a legend","a legend (","legend ( like","( like a","like a modern","a modern Robin","modern Robin Hood","Robin Hood )","Hood ) by",") by the","by the Indian","the Indian press","Although the press","the press tended","press tended to","tended to make","to make her","make her the","her the optimal","the optimal hero","optimal hero with","hero with blue","with blue eyes","blue eyes ,","eyes , dark",", dark hair","dark hair ,","hair , being",", being tall","being tall and","tall and beautiful","and beautiful she","beautiful she was","she was in","was in reality","in reality an","reality an average","an average Indian","average Indian which","Indian which makes","which makes it","makes it hard","it hard for","hard for the","for the movie","the movie to","movie to fulfill","to fulfill the","fulfill the expectations","the expectations of","expectations of the","of the audience","the audience and","audience and tell","and tell the","tell the truth","the truth at","truth at the","at the same","the same time","Later in her","in her life","her life ,","life , She",", She entered","She entered into","entered into the","into the politics","the politics and","politics and was","and was assassinated","was assassinated in","assassinated in 2001"],"2grams":["The movie","movie tells","tells the","the story","story of","of the","the bandit","bandit queen","queen Phoolan","Phoolan Devi","Devi who","who was","was sent","sent to","to prison","prison in","in 1983","1983 and","and got","got free","free in","in 1994","During five","five years","years she","she was","was prosecuted","prosecuted by","by the","the Indian","Indian police","police and","and turned","turned into","into a","a legend","legend (","( like","like a","a modern","modern Robin","Robin Hood","Hood )",") by","by the","the Indian","Indian press","Although the","the press","press tended","tended to","to make","make her","her the","the optimal","optimal hero","hero with","with blue","blue eyes","eyes ,",", dark","dark hair","hair ,",", being","being tall","tall and","and beautiful","beautiful she","she was","was in","in reality","reality an","an average","average Indian","Indian which","which makes","makes it","it hard","hard for","for the","the movie","movie to","to fulfill","fulfill the","the expectations","expectations of","of the","the audience","audience and","and tell","tell the","the truth","truth at","at the","the same","same time","Later in","in her","her life","life ,",", She","She entered","entered into","into the","the politics","politics and","and was","was assassinated","assassinated in","in 2001"]}

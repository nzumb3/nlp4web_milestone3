{"title":"The Garden","plot":"The 14 acre community garden in South Central Los Angeles was the largest of it's kind in the United States. It was started as a form of healing after the devastating L.A. riots in 1992. Since that time, the South Central Farmers have created a miracle in one of the country's most blighted neighborhoods. Growing their own food. Feeding their families. Creating a community. But now bulldozers threaten their oasis. The Garden is an unflinching look at the struggle between these urban farmers and the City of Los Angeles and a powerful developer who want to evict them and build warehouses.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","14","acr","communiti","garden","in","South","Central","Los","Angele","was","the","largest","of","it","'s","kind","in","the","Unite","State",".","It","was","start","as","a","form","of","heal","after","the","devast","L.A.","riot","in","1992",".","Sinc","that","time",",","the","South","Central","Farmer","have","creat","a","miracl","in","one","of","the","countri","'s","most","blight","neighborhood",".","Grow","their","own","food",".","Feed","their","famili",".","Creat","a","communiti",".","But","now","bulldoz","threaten","their","oasi",".","The","Garden","is","an","unflinch","look","at","the","struggl","between","these","urban","farmer","and","the","Citi","of","Los","Angele","and","a","power","develop","who","want","to","evict","them","and","build","warehous","."],"lemmas":["the","14","acre","community","garden","in","South","Central","Los","Angeles","be","the","largest","of","it","be","kind","in","the","United","States",".","it","be","start","as","a","form","of","healing","after","the","devastating","L.A.","riot","in","1992",".","since","that","time",",","the","South","Central","Farmers","have","create","a","miracle","in","one","of","the","country","'s","most","blighted","neighborhood",".","grow","they","own","food",".","Feeding","they","family",".","create","a","community",".","but","now","bulldozer","threaten","they","oasis",".","the","Garden","be","a","unflinching","look","at","the","struggle","between","these","urban","farmer","and","the","City","of","Los","Angeles","and","a","powerful","developer","who","want","to","evict","they","and","build","warehouse","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The 14 acre","14 acre community","acre community garden","community garden in","garden in South","in South Central","South Central Los","Central Los Angeles","Los Angeles was","Angeles was the","was the largest","the largest of","largest of it","of it 's","it 's kind","'s kind in","kind in the","in the United","the United States","It was started","was started as","started as a","as a form","a form of","form of healing","of healing after","healing after the","after the devastating","the devastating L.A.","devastating L.A. riots","L.A. riots in","riots in 1992","Since that time","that time ,","time , the",", the South","the South Central","South Central Farmers","Central Farmers have","Farmers have created","have created a","created a miracle","a miracle in","miracle in one","in one of","one of the","of the country","the country 's","country 's most","'s most blighted","most blighted neighborhoods","Growing their own","their own food","Feeding their families","Creating a community","But now bulldozers","now bulldozers threaten","bulldozers threaten their","threaten their oasis","The Garden is","Garden is an","is an unflinching","an unflinching look","unflinching look at","look at the","at the struggle","the struggle between","struggle between these","between these urban","these urban farmers","urban farmers and","farmers and the","and the City","the City of","City of Los","of Los Angeles","Los Angeles and","Angeles and a","and a powerful","a powerful developer","powerful developer who","developer who want","who want to","want to evict","to evict them","evict them and","them and build","and build warehouses"],"2grams":["The 14","14 acre","acre community","community garden","garden in","in South","South Central","Central Los","Los Angeles","Angeles was","was the","the largest","largest of","of it","it 's","'s kind","kind in","in the","the United","United States","It was","was started","started as","as a","a form","form of","of healing","healing after","after the","the devastating","devastating L.A.","L.A. riots","riots in","in 1992","Since that","that time","time ,",", the","the South","South Central","Central Farmers","Farmers have","have created","created a","a miracle","miracle in","in one","one of","of the","the country","country 's","'s most","most blighted","blighted neighborhoods","Growing their","their own","own food","Feeding their","their families","Creating a","a community","But now","now bulldozers","bulldozers threaten","threaten their","their oasis","The Garden","Garden is","is an","an unflinching","unflinching look","look at","at the","the struggle","struggle between","between these","these urban","urban farmers","farmers and","and the","the City","City of","of Los","Los Angeles","Angeles and","and a","a powerful","powerful developer","developer who","who want","want to","to evict","evict them","them and","and build","build warehouses"]}

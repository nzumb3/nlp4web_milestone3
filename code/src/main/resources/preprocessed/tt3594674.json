{"title":"Traffik Jam","plot":"In this dark comedy we are put inside the head of the confused loner Edmund Valentine, as he battles depression and desperately tries to find appreciation and a sense of self worth. Completely filmed in a first-person narrative, we begin as the character contemplates his suicide, and continue through his life watching many half finished projects, failed human connections, docu-style observations, and misguided trains of thought. Filmed through out the boroughs of New York City, TRAFFIC JAM is the story of artistic integrity and a disillusioned search for honor.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","this","dark","comedi","we","are","put","insid","the","head","of","the","confus","loner","Edmund","Valentin",",","as","he","battl","depress","and","desper","tri","to","find","appreci","and","a","sens","of","self","worth",".","Complet","film","in","a","first-person","narrat",",","we","begin","as","the","charact","contempl","his","suicid",",","and","continu","through","his","life","watch","mani","half","finish","project",",","fail","human","connect",",","docu-styl","observ",",","and","misguid","train","of","thought",".","Film","through","out","the","borough","of","New","York","Citi",",","TRAFFIC","JAM","is","the","stori","of","artist","integr","and","a","disillus","search","for","honor","."],"lemmas":["in","this","dark","comedy","we","be","put","inside","the","head","of","the","confused","loner","Edmund","Valentine",",","as","he","battle","depression","and","desperately","try","to","find","appreciation","and","a","sense","of","self","worth",".","completely","film","in","a","first-person","narrative",",","we","begin","as","the","character","contemplate","he","suicide",",","and","continue","through","he","life","watch","many","half","finished","project",",","fail","human","connection",",","docu-style","observation",",","and","misguided","train","of","thought",".","film","through","out","the","borough","of","New","York","City",",","traffic","jam","be","the","story","of","artistic","integrity","and","a","disillusioned","search","for","honor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In this dark","this dark comedy","dark comedy we","comedy we are","we are put","are put inside","put inside the","inside the head","the head of","head of the","of the confused","the confused loner","confused loner Edmund","loner Edmund Valentine","Edmund Valentine ,","Valentine , as",", as he","as he battles","he battles depression","battles depression and","depression and desperately","and desperately tries","desperately tries to","tries to find","to find appreciation","find appreciation and","appreciation and a","and a sense","a sense of","sense of self","of self worth","Completely filmed in","filmed in a","in a first-person","a first-person narrative","first-person narrative ,","narrative , we",", we begin","we begin as","begin as the","as the character","the character contemplates","character contemplates his","contemplates his suicide","his suicide ,","suicide , and",", and continue","and continue through","continue through his","through his life","his life watching","life watching many","watching many half","many half finished","half finished projects","finished projects ,","projects , failed",", failed human","failed human connections","human connections ,","connections , docu-style",", docu-style observations","docu-style observations ,","observations , and",", and misguided","and misguided trains","misguided trains of","trains of thought","Filmed through out","through out the","out the boroughs","the boroughs of","boroughs of New","of New York","New York City","York City ,","City , TRAFFIC",", TRAFFIC JAM","TRAFFIC JAM is","JAM is the","is the story","the story of","story of artistic","of artistic integrity","artistic integrity and","integrity and a","and a disillusioned","a disillusioned search","disillusioned search for","search for honor"],"2grams":["In this","this dark","dark comedy","comedy we","we are","are put","put inside","inside the","the head","head of","of the","the confused","confused loner","loner Edmund","Edmund Valentine","Valentine ,",", as","as he","he battles","battles depression","depression and","and desperately","desperately tries","tries to","to find","find appreciation","appreciation and","and a","a sense","sense of","of self","self worth","Completely filmed","filmed in","in a","a first-person","first-person narrative","narrative ,",", we","we begin","begin as","as the","the character","character contemplates","contemplates his","his suicide","suicide ,",", and","and continue","continue through","through his","his life","life watching","watching many","many half","half finished","finished projects","projects ,",", failed","failed human","human connections","connections ,",", docu-style","docu-style observations","observations ,",", and","and misguided","misguided trains","trains of","of thought","Filmed through","through out","out the","the boroughs","boroughs of","of New","New York","York City","City ,",", TRAFFIC","TRAFFIC JAM","JAM is","is the","the story","story of","of artistic","artistic integrity","integrity and","and a","a disillusioned","disillusioned search","search for","for honor"]}

{"title":"Thomas in Love","plot":"Thomas is a young agoraphobic man; he's afraid of coming to any kind of contact with other people, so he lives totally isolated in his apartment. The story takes place in the near future where everything can be done through computers, so Thomas hasn't left his apartment for eight straight years. However, although his life seems complete, he misses human contact, so his psychoanalyst consults him to meet a woman through some on-line service. Is it possible for Thomas to fall in love with a woman? And if so, is he going to get out of his apartment for that woman?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Thoma","is","a","young","agoraphob","man",";","he","'s","afraid","of","come","to","ani","kind","of","contact","with","other","peopl",",","so","he","live","total","isol","in","his","apart",".","The","stori","take","place","in","the","near","futur","where","everyth","can","be","done","through","comput",",","so","Thoma","has","n't","left","his","apart","for","eight","straight","year",".","Howev",",","although","his","life","seem","complet",",","he","miss","human","contact",",","so","his","psychoanalyst","consult","him","to","meet","a","woman","through","some","on-lin","servic",".","Is","it","possibl","for","Thoma","to","fall","in","love","with","a","woman","?","And","if","so",",","is","he","go","to","get","out","of","his","apart","for","that","woman","?"],"lemmas":["Thomas","be","a","young","agoraphobic","man",";","he","be","afraid","of","come","to","any","kind","of","contact","with","other","people",",","so","he","live","totally","isolate","in","he","apartment",".","the","story","take","place","in","the","near","future","where","everything","can","be","do","through","computer",",","so","Thomas","have","not","leave","he","apartment","for","eight","straight","year",".","however",",","although","he","life","seem","complete",",","he","miss","human","contact",",","so","he","psychoanalyst","consult","he","to","meet","a","woman","through","some","on-line","service",".","be","it","possible","for","Thomas","to","fall","in","love","with","a","woman","?","and","if","so",",","be","he","go","to","get","out","of","he","apartment","for","that","woman","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Thomas is a","is a young","a young agoraphobic","young agoraphobic man","agoraphobic man ;","man ; he","; he 's","he 's afraid","'s afraid of","afraid of coming","of coming to","coming to any","to any kind","any kind of","kind of contact","of contact with","contact with other","with other people","other people ,","people , so",", so he","so he lives","he lives totally","lives totally isolated","totally isolated in","isolated in his","in his apartment","The story takes","story takes place","takes place in","place in the","in the near","the near future","near future where","future where everything","where everything can","everything can be","can be done","be done through","done through computers","through computers ,","computers , so",", so Thomas","so Thomas has","Thomas has n't","has n't left","n't left his","left his apartment","his apartment for","apartment for eight","for eight straight","eight straight years","However , although",", although his","although his life","his life seems","life seems complete","seems complete ,","complete , he",", he misses","he misses human","misses human contact","human contact ,","contact , so",", so his","so his psychoanalyst","his psychoanalyst consults","psychoanalyst consults him","consults him to","him to meet","to meet a","meet a woman","a woman through","woman through some","through some on-line","some on-line service","Is it possible","it possible for","possible for Thomas","for Thomas to","Thomas to fall","to fall in","fall in love","in love with","love with a","with a woman","And if so","if so ,","so , is",", is he","is he going","he going to","going to get","to get out","get out of","out of his","of his apartment","his apartment for","apartment for that","for that woman"],"2grams":["Thomas is","is a","a young","young agoraphobic","agoraphobic man","man ;","; he","he 's","'s afraid","afraid of","of coming","coming to","to any","any kind","kind of","of contact","contact with","with other","other people","people ,",", so","so he","he lives","lives totally","totally isolated","isolated in","in his","his apartment","The story","story takes","takes place","place in","in the","the near","near future","future where","where everything","everything can","can be","be done","done through","through computers","computers ,",", so","so Thomas","Thomas has","has n't","n't left","left his","his apartment","apartment for","for eight","eight straight","straight years","However ,",", although","although his","his life","life seems","seems complete","complete ,",", he","he misses","misses human","human contact","contact ,",", so","so his","his psychoanalyst","psychoanalyst consults","consults him","him to","to meet","meet a","a woman","woman through","through some","some on-line","on-line service","Is it","it possible","possible for","for Thomas","Thomas to","to fall","fall in","in love","love with","with a","a woman","And if","if so","so ,",", is","is he","he going","going to","to get","get out","out of","of his","his apartment","apartment for","for that","that woman"]}

Still active within the movement is Pedro, a political prisoner who is willing to die for the cause. He secretly assigns a key operative, Cesar, to Reynaldo's son, in an effort to lure Reynaldo back into the movement. Reynaldo must come to peace with his past as he attempts to avenge his son's death and save his family from ruin.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Reynaldo","Pedro","Ferrer",",","a","former","terrorist","involv","in","the","independ","movement","for","Puerto","Rico",",","must","confront","his","past","after","the","murder","of","his","eldest","son",".","His","father",",","Popo",",","a","high","level","member","of","the","movement",",","is","pose","as","a","doubl","agent","in","order","to","protect","his","famili","and","still","preserv","the","group","'s","quest","for","freedom",".","Still","activ","within","the","movement","is","Pedro",",","a","polit","prison","who","is","will","to","die","for","the","caus",".","He","secret","assign","a","key","oper",",","Cesar",",","to","Reynaldo","'s","son",",","in","an","effort","to","lure","Reynaldo","back","into","the","movement",".","Reynaldo","must","come","to","peac","with","his","past","as","he","attempt","to","aveng","his","son","'s","death","and","save","his","famili","from","ruin","."],"lemmas":["Reynaldo","Pedro","Ferrer",",","a","former","terrorist","involve","in","the","independence","movement","for","Puerto","Rico",",","must","confront","he","past","after","the","murder","of","he","eldest","son",".","he","father",",","Popo",",","a","high","level","member","of","the","movement",",","be","pose","as","a","double","agent","in","order","to","protect","he","family","and","still","preserve","the","group","'s","quest","for","freedom",".","still","active","within","the","movement","be","Pedro",",","a","political","prisoner","who","be","willing","to","die","for","the","cause",".","he","secretly","assign","a","key","operative",",","Cesar",",","to","Reynaldo","'s","son",",","in","a","effort","to","lure","Reynaldo","back","into","the","movement",".","Reynaldo","must","come","to","peace","with","he","past","as","he","attempt","to","avenge","he","son","'s","death","and","save","he","family","from","ruin","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Reynaldo

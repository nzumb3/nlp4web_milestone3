{"title":"Double Role","plot":"A surgeon and a scientist have been secretly trying to transplant the brain from one hog into another. Soon after their first success, they have a golden opportunity to save a human: a 70-year old professor of history is mortally injured in a car accident, but her brain is unhurt; a 25-year-old has severe head trauma, but is otherwise unscratched. The professor, Louisa, awakes in hospital inside the body of Yvette, the youth. She realizes immediately that the scientists have not thought through what her life will be like, but she valiantly tries to adapt. Louisa, as Yvette, is alternately in danger, lonely, resolute, and delighted, and she's always perceptive.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["A","surgeon","and","a","scientist","have","been","secret","tri","to","transplant","the","brain","from","one","hog","into","anoth",".","Soon","after","their","first","success",",","they","have","a","golden","opportun","to","save","a","human",":","a","70-year","old","professor","of","histori","is","mortal","injur","in","a","car","accid",",","but","her","brain","is","unhurt",";","a","25-year-old","has","sever","head","trauma",",","but","is","otherwis","unscratch",".","The","professor",",","Louisa",",","awak","in","hospit","insid","the","bodi","of","Yvett",",","the","youth",".","She","realiz","immedi","that","the","scientist","have","not","thought","through","what","her","life","will","be","like",",","but","she","valiant","tri","to","adapt",".","Louisa",",","as","Yvett",",","is","altern","in","danger",",","lone",",","resolut",",","and","delight",",","and","she","'s","alway","percept","."],"lemmas":["a","surgeon","and","a","scientist","have","be","secretly","try","to","transplant","the","brain","from","one","hog","into","another",".","soon","after","they","first","success",",","they","have","a","golden","opportunity","to","save","a","human",":","a","70-year","old","professor","of","history","be","mortally","injure","in","a","car","accident",",","but","she","brain","be","unhurt",";","a","25-year-old","have","severe","head","trauma",",","but","be","otherwise","unscratched",".","the","professor",",","Louisa",",","awake","in","hospital","inside","the","body","of","Yvette",",","the","youth",".","she","realize","immediately","that","the","scientist","have","not","think","through","what","she","life","will","be","like",",","but","she","valiantly","try","to","adapt",".","Louisa",",","as","Yvette",",","be","alternately","in","danger",",","lonely",",","resolute",",","and","delighted",",","and","she","be","always","perceptive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A surgeon and","surgeon and a","and a scientist","a scientist have","scientist have been","have been secretly","been secretly trying","secretly trying to","trying to transplant","to transplant the","transplant the brain","the brain from","brain from one","from one hog","one hog into","hog into another","Soon after their","after their first","their first success","first success ,","success , they",", they have","they have a","have a golden","a golden opportunity","golden opportunity to","opportunity to save","to save a","save a human","a human :","human : a",": a 70-year","a 70-year old","70-year old professor","old professor of","professor of history","of history is","history is mortally","is mortally injured","mortally injured in","injured in a","in a car","a car accident","car accident ,","accident , but",", but her","but her brain","her brain is","brain is unhurt","is unhurt ;","unhurt ;

{"title":"Kallappadam","plot":"Vadivel and his friends specialize in different aspects of film making and decided to make their first movie as one team. Vadivel wants his first film to be his story based on Tamil folklore that is also close to his heart since his father was a performer of the dying rural art form -'Koothu'. But every producer he meets, reject his story on grounds of absence of elements that would make it commercially viable and deem it too risky an option for a debut. Driven to the limits of desperation and not wanting to jeopardize the careers of his friends, he puts forth a plan to fund the movie by executing a heist. The turn of events once the team agrees to the plan is detailed to form the rest of the movie.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Vadivel","and","his","friend","special","in","differ","aspect","of","film","make","and","decid","to","make","their","first","movi","as","one","team",".","Vadivel","want","his","first","film","to","be","his","stori","base","on","Tamil","folklor","that","is","also","close","to","his","heart","sinc","his","father","was","a","perform","of","the","die","rural","art","form","-","'","Koothu","'",".","But","everi","produc","he","meet",",","reject","his","stori","on","ground","of","absenc","of","element","that","would","make","it","commerci","viabl","and","deem","it","too","riski","an","option","for","a","debut",".","Driven","to","the","limit","of","desper","and","not","want","to","jeopard","the","career","of","his","friend",",","he","put","forth","a","plan","to","fund","the","movi","by","execut","a","heist",".","The","turn","of","event","onc","the","team","agre","to","the","plan","is","detail","to","form","the","rest","of","the","movi","."],"lemmas":["Vadivel","and","he","friend","specialize","in","different","aspect","of","film","making","and","decide","to","make","they","first","movie","as","one","team",".","Vadivel","want","he","first","film","to","be","he","story","base","on","Tamil","folklore","that","be","also","close","to","he","heart","since","he","father","be","a","performer","of","the","die","rural","art","form","-","'","Koothu","'",".","but","every","producer","he","meet",",","reject","he","story","on","grounds","of","absence","of","element","that","would","make","it","commercially","viable","and","deem","it","too","risky","a","option","for","a","debut",".","drive","to","the","limit","of","desperation","and","not","want","to","jeopardize","the","career","of","he","friend",",","he","put","forth","a","plan","to","fund","the","movie","by","execute","a","heist",".","the","turn","of","event","once","the","team","agree","to","the","plan","be","detail","to","form","the","rest","of","the","movie","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Vadivel and his","and his friends","his friends specialize","friends specialize in","specialize in different","in different aspects","different aspects of","aspects of film","of film making","film making and","making and decided","and decided to","decided to make","to make their","make their first","their first movie","first movie as","movie as one","as one team","Vadivel wants his","wants his first","his first film","first film to","film to be","to be his","be his story","his story based","story based on","based on Tamil","on Tamil folklore","Tamil folklore that","folklore that is","that is also","is also close","also close to","close to his","to his heart","his heart since","heart since his","since his father","his father was","father was a","was a performer","a performer of","performer of the","of the dying","the dying rural","dying rural art","rural art form","art form -","form -

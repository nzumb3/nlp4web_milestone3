{"title":"Something Wicked This Way Comes","plot":"SOMETHING WICKED THIS WAY COMES is an exploration into New England horror. The film dissects popular conventions within the genre and identifies how they're driven by the history, eerie settings, and social issues of the area. And through the stories of local actors and filmmakers, as well as discussions with genre luminaries, horror fans, and New England natives, it will also help us to discover if the area's history and passion are strong enough to help grow an independent film industry.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["SOMETHING","WICKED","THIS","WAi","COMES","is","an","explor","into","New","England","horror",".","The","film","dissect","popular","convent","within","the","genr","and","identifi","how","they","re","driven","by","the","histori",",","eeri","set",",","and","social","issu","of","the","area",".","And","through","the","stori","of","local","actor","and","filmmak",",","as","well","as","discuss","with","genr","luminari",",","horror","fan",",","and","New","England","nativ",",","it","will","also","help","us","to","discov","if","the","area","'s","histori","and","passion","are","strong","enough","to","help","grow","an","independ","film","industri","."],"lemmas":["SOMETHING","WICKED","THIS","WAY","COMES","be","a","exploration","into","New","England","horror",".","the","film","dissect","popular","convention","within","the","genre","and","identify","how","they","be","drive","by","the","history",",","eerie","setting",",","and","social","issue","of","the","area",".","and","through","the","story","of","local","actor","and","filmmaker",",","as","well","as","discussion","with","genre","luminary",",","horror","fan",",","and","New","England","native",",","it","will","also","help","we","to","discover","if","the","area","'s","history","and","passion","be","strong","enough","to","help","grow","a","independent","film","industry","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["SOMETHING WICKED THIS","WICKED THIS WAY","THIS WAY COMES","WAY COMES is","COMES is an","is an exploration","an exploration into","exploration into New","into New England","New England horror","The film dissects","film dissects popular","dissects popular conventions","popular conventions within","conventions within the","within the genre","the genre and","genre and identifies","and identifies how","identifies how they","how they 're","they 're driven","'re driven by","driven by the","by the history","the history ,","history , eerie",", eerie settings","eerie settings ,","settings , and",", and social","and social issues","social issues of","issues of the","of the area","And through the","through the stories","the stories of","stories of local","of local actors","local actors and","actors and filmmakers","and filmmakers ,","filmmakers , as",", as well","as well as","well as discussions","as discussions with","discussions with genre","with genre luminaries","genre luminaries ,","luminaries , horror",", horror fans","horror fans ,","fans , and",", and New","and New England","New England natives","England natives ,","natives , it",", it will","it will also","will also help","also help us","help us to","us to discover","to discover if","discover if the","if the area","the area 's","area 's history","'s history and","history and passion","and passion are","passion are strong","are strong enough","strong enough to","enough to help","to help grow","help grow an","grow an independent","an independent film","independent film industry"],"2grams":["SOMETHING WICKED","WICKED THIS","THIS WAY","WAY COMES","COMES is","is an","an exploration","exploration into","into New","New England","England horror","The film","film dissects","dissects popular","popular conventions","conventions within","within the","the genre","genre and","and identifies","identifies how","how they","they 're","'re driven","driven by","by the","the history","history ,",", eerie","eerie settings","settings ,",", and","and social","social issues","issues of","of the","the area","And through","through the","the stories","stories of","of local","local actors","actors and","and filmmakers","filmmakers ,",", as","as well","well as","as discussions","discussions with","with genre","genre luminaries","luminaries ,",", horror","horror fans","fans ,",", and","and New","New England","England natives","natives ,",", it","it will","will also","also help","help us","us to","to discover","discover if","if the","the area","area 's","'s history","history and","and passion","passion are","are strong","strong enough","enough to","to help","help grow","grow an","an independent","independent film","film industry"]}

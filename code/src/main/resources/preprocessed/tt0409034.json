{"title":"Marilyn Hotchkiss' Ballroom Dancing & Charm School","plot":"Dance is a very powerful drug, if embraced judiciously; to reap its rewards, one must shoulder its challenges with intrepid countenance. Frank Keene, a grieving baker in a near catatonic state, happens on a car accident. The loquacious and insightful victim, Steve Mills, is on his way to an appointment in Pasadena with a years-ago acquaintance; he asks Frank to go in his place. It's a dance class. Frank goes, to find Steve's friend. The story moves back and forth among Steve's childhood, the scene of the accident, and the aftermath of Frank's first Lindy hop. Black eyes, group therapy, loneliness, boys being boys, roads not taken, and saying good-bye color the story.","genres":["Comedy"," Musical"," Drama"],"stems":["Danc","is","a","veri","power","drug",",","if","embrac","judici",";","to","reap","it","reward",",","one","must","shoulder","it","challeng","with","intrepid","counten",".","Frank","Keen",",","a","griev","baker","in","a","near","cataton","state",",","happen","on","a","car","accid",".","The","loquaci","and","insight","victim",",","Steve","Mill",",","is","on","his","way","to","an","appoint","in","Pasadena","with","a","years-ago","acquaint",";","he","ask","Frank","to","go","in","his","place",".","It","'s","a","danc","class",".","Frank","goe",",","to","find","Steve","'s","friend",".","The","stori","move","back","and","forth","among","Steve","'s","childhood",",","the","scene","of","the","accid",",","and","the","aftermath","of","Frank","'s","first","Lindi","hop",".","Black","eye",",","group","therapi",",","loneli",",","boy","be","boy",",","road","not","taken",",","and","say","good-by","color","the","stori","."],"lemmas":["Dance","be","a","very","powerful","drug",",","if","embrace","judiciously",";","to","reap","its","reward",",","one","must","shoulder","its","challenge","with","intrepid","countenance",".","Frank","Keene",",","a","grieving","baker","in","a","near","catatonic","state",",","happen","on","a","car","accident",".","the","loquacious","and","insightful","victim",",","Steve","Mills",",","be","on","he","way","to","a","appointment","in","Pasadena","with","a","years-ago","acquaintance",";","he","ask","Frank","to","go","in","he","place",".","it","be","a","dance","class",".","Frank","go",",","to","find","Steve","'s","friend",".","the","story","move","back","and","forth","among","Steve","'s","childhood",",","the","scene","of","the","accident",",","and","the","aftermath","of","Frank","'s","first","Lindy","hop",".","black","eye",",","group","therapy",",","loneliness",",","boy","be","boy",",","road","not","take",",","and","say","good-bye","color","the","story","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Dance is a","is a very","a very powerful","very powerful drug","powerful drug ,","drug , if",", if embraced","if embraced judiciously","embraced judiciously ;","judiciously ;

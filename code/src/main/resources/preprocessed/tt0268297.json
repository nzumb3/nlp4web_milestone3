{"title":"Family Secrets","plot":"Autumn 1978 in suburban Sweden. Everything seems to be fine with the middle class Bendrick family with their two teenage children and a younger son, until the mother starts seeing her first love again after 20 years. Just like their badly built house, the family façade starts slowly crumbling into pieces. The daughter, 15, finds her first love, and the boys too are puzzled by their own questions around adolescence and sexuality. The father tries to keep up a happy face, while the youngest son is the first and the most sensitive to realize how the family is heading towards a disaster.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Autumn","1978","in","suburban","Sweden",".","Everyth","seem","to","be","fine","with","the","middl","class","Bendrick","famili","with","their","two","teenag","children","and","a","younger","son",",","until","the","mother","start","see","her","first","love","again","after","20","year",".","Just","like","their","bad","built","hous",",","the","famili","façad","start","slowli","crumbl","into","piec",".","The","daughter",",","15",",","find","her","first","love",",","and","the","boy","too","are","puzzl","by","their","own","question","around","adolesc","and","sexual",".","The","father","tri","to","keep","up","a","happi","face",",","while","the","youngest","son","is","the","first","and","the","most","sensit","to","realiz","how","the","famili","is","head","toward","a","disast","."],"lemmas":["autumn","1978","in","suburban","Sweden",".","Everything","seem","to","be","fine","with","the","middle","class","bendrick","family","with","they","two","teenage","child","and","a","younger","son",",","until","the","mother","start","see","she","first","love","again","after","20","year",".","just","like","they","badly","build","house",",","the","family","façade","start","slowly","crumble","into","piece",".","the","daughter",",","15",",","find","she","first","love",",","and","the","boy","too","be","puzzle","by","they","own","question","around","adolescence","and","sexuality",".","the","father","try","to","keep","up","a","happy","face",",","while","the","youngest","son","be","the","first","and","the","most","sensitive","to","realize","how","the","family","be","head","towards","a","disaster","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Autumn 1978 in","1978 in suburban","in suburban Sweden","Everything seems to","seems to be","to be fine","be fine with","fine with the","with the middle","the middle class","middle class Bendrick","class Bendrick family","Bendrick family with","family with their","with their two","their two teenage","two teenage children","teenage children and","children and a","and a younger","a younger son","younger son ,","son , until",", until the","until the mother","the mother starts","mother starts seeing","starts seeing her","seeing her first","her first love","first love again","love again after","again after 20","after 20 years","Just like their","like their badly","their badly built","badly built house","built house ,","house , the",", the family","the family façade","family façade starts","façade starts slowly","starts slowly crumbling","slowly crumbling into","crumbling into pieces","The daughter ,","daughter , 15",", 15 ,","15 , finds",", finds her","finds her first","her first love","first love ,","love , and",", and the","and the boys","the boys too","boys too are","too are puzzled","are puzzled by","puzzled by their","by their own","their own questions","own questions around","questions around adolescence","around adolescence and","adolescence and sexuality","The father tries","father tries to","tries to keep","to keep up","keep up a","up a happy","a happy face","happy face ,","face , while",", while the","while the youngest","the youngest son","youngest son is","son is the","is the first","the first and","first and the","and the most","the most sensitive","most sensitive to","sensitive to realize","to realize how","realize how the","how the family","the family is","family is heading","is heading towards","heading towards a","towards a disaster"],"2grams":["Autumn 1978","1978 in","in suburban","suburban Sweden","Everything seems","seems to","to be","be fine","fine with","with the","the middle","middle class","class Bendrick","Bendrick family","family with","with their","their two","two teenage","teenage children","children and","and a","a younger","younger son","son ,",", until","until the","the mother","mother starts","starts seeing","seeing her","her first","first love","love again","again after","after 20","20 years","Just like","like their","their badly","badly built","built house","house ,",", the","the family","family façade","façade starts","starts slowly","slowly crumbling","crumbling into","into pieces","The daughter","daughter ,",", 15","15 ,",", finds","finds her","her first","first love","love ,",", and","and the","the boys","boys too","too are","are puzzled","puzzled by","by their","their own","own questions","questions around","around adolescence","adolescence and","and sexuality","The father","father tries","tries to","to keep","keep up","up a","a happy","happy face","face ,",", while","while the","the youngest","youngest son","son is","is the","the first","first and","and the","the most","most sensitive","sensitive to","to realize","realize how","how the","the family","family is","is heading","heading towards","towards a","a disaster"]}

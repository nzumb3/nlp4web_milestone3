{"title":"Happy You're Alive","plot":"'Happy You're Alive' documents both the tragedy of battle in the West Bank and the lasting effects of war on society as they play out in the lives of two men struggling after their encounters in combat. Their difficult return to life as usual after the terror of the battlefield has been captured on film over a span of more than two years. Each man deals with the haunting memories of war differently, with one turning to music and one to therapy; both stories show that the will and strength to survive can be found even in the face of the most unimaginable pain.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["'","Happi","You","re","Alive","'","document","both","the","tragedi","of","battl","in","the","West","Bank","and","the","last","effect","of","war","on","societi","as","they","play","out","in","the","live","of","two","men","struggl","after","their","encount","in","combat",".","Their","difficult","return","to","life","as","usual","after","the","terror","of","the","battlefield","has","been","captur","on","film","over","a","span","of","more","than","two","year",".","Each","man","deal","with","the","haunt","memori","of","war","differ",",","with","one","turn","to","music","and","one","to","therapi",";","both","stori","show","that","the","will","and","strength","to","surviv","can","be","found","even","in","the","face","of","the","most","unimagin","pain","."],"lemmas":["'","happy","you","be","Alive","'","document","both","the","tragedy","of","battle","in","the","West","Bank","and","the","lasting","effect","of","war","on","society","as","they","play","out","in","the","life","of","two","man","struggle","after","they","encounter","in","combat",".","they","difficult","return","to","life","as","usual","after","the","terror","of","the","battlefield","have","be","capture","on","film","over","a","span","of","more","than","two","year",".","each","man","deal","with","the","haunt","memory","of","war","differently",",","with","one","turning","to","music","and","one","to","therapy",";","both","story","show","that","the","will","and","strength","to","survive","can","be","find","even","in","the","face","of","the","most","unimaginable","pain","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Happy You","Happy You 're","You 're Alive","'re Alive '","Alive ' documents","' documents both","documents both the","both the tragedy","the tragedy of","tragedy of battle","of battle in","battle in the","in the West","the West Bank","West Bank and","Bank and the","and the lasting","the lasting effects","lasting effects of","effects of war","of war on","war on society","on society as","society as they","as they play","they play out","play out in","out in the","in the lives","the lives of","lives of two","of two men","two men struggling","men struggling after","struggling after their","after their encounters","their encounters in","encounters in combat","Their difficult return","difficult return to","return to life","to life as","life as usual","as usual after","usual after the","after the terror","the terror of","terror of the","of the battlefield","the battlefield has","battlefield has been","has been captured","been captured on","captured on film","on film over","film over a","over a span","a span of","span of more","of more than","more than two","than two years","Each man deals","man deals with","deals with the","with the haunting","the haunting memories","haunting memories of","memories of war","of war differently","war differently ,","differently , with",", with one","with one turning","one turning to","turning to music","to music and","music and one","and one to","one to therapy","to therapy ;","therapy ;

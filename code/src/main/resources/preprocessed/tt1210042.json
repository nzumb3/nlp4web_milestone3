{"title":"Brooklyn's Finest","plot":"In Brooklyn, amid drug deals, violence, casual racism, poverty, housing projects, and corrupt cops, we follow three officers: Tango, African-American, working undercover, believing he's earned a promotion to a desk job but told he has to set up the bust of an ex-con who saved his life; Sal, who'll commit murder to get cash; and, Eddie, the precinct's oldest beat cop, a week to go before retirement, assigned to mentor an earnest rookie. Can this end well for any of the three?","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["In","Brooklyn",",","amid","drug","deal",",","violenc",",","casual","racism",",","poverti",",","hous","project",",","and","corrupt","cop",",","we","follow","three","offic",":","Tango",",","African-American",",","work","undercov",",","believ","he","'s","earn","a","promot","to","a","desk","job","but","told","he","has","to","set","up","the","bust","of","an","ex-con","who","save","his","life",";","Sal",",","who","ll","commit","murder","to","get","cash",";","and",",","Eddie",",","the","precinct","'s","oldest","beat","cop",",","a","week","to","go","befor","retir",",","assign","to","mentor","an","earnest","rooki",".","Can","this","end","well","for","ani","of","the","three","?"],"lemmas":["in","Brooklyn",",","amid","drug","deal",",","violence",",","casual","racism",",","poverty",",","housing","project",",","and","corrupt","cop",",","we","follow","three","officer",":","Tango",",","African-American",",","work","undercover",",","believe","he","be","earn","a","promotion","to","a","desk","job","but","tell","he","have","to","set","up","the","bust","of","a","ex-con","who","save","he","life",";","Sal",",","who","will","commit","murder","to","get","cash",";","and",",","Eddie",",","the","precinct","'s","oldest","beat","cop",",","a","week","to","go","before","retirement",",","assign","to","mentor","a","earnest","rookie",".","can","this","end","well","for","any","of","the","three","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Brooklyn ,","Brooklyn , amid",", amid drug","amid drug deals","drug deals ,","deals , violence",", violence ,","violence , casual",", casual racism","casual racism ,","racism , poverty",", poverty ,","poverty , housing",", housing projects","housing projects ,","projects , and",", and corrupt","and corrupt cops","corrupt cops ,","cops , we",", we follow","we follow three","follow three officers","three officers :","officers : Tango",": Tango ,","Tango , African-American",", African-American ,","African-American , working",", working undercover","working undercover ,","undercover , believing",", believing he","believing he 's","he 's earned","'s earned a","earned a promotion","a promotion to","promotion to a","to a desk","a desk job","desk job but","job but told","but told he","told he has","he has to","has to set","to set up","set up the","up the bust","the bust of","bust of an","of an ex-con","an ex-con who","ex-con who saved","who saved his","saved his life","his life ;","life ; Sal","; Sal ,","Sal , who",", who 'll","who 'll commit","'ll commit murder","commit murder to","murder to get","to get cash","get cash ;","cash ; and","; and ,","and , Eddie",", Eddie ,","Eddie , the",", the precinct","the precinct 's","precinct 's oldest","'s oldest beat","oldest beat cop","beat cop ,","cop , a",", a week","a week to","week to go","to go before","go before retirement","before retirement ,","retirement , assigned",", assigned to","assigned to mentor","to mentor an","mentor an earnest","an earnest rookie","Can this end","this end well","end well for","well for any","for any of","any of the","of the three"],"2grams":["In Brooklyn","Brooklyn ,",", amid","amid drug","drug deals","deals ,",", violence","violence ,",", casual","casual racism","racism ,",", poverty","poverty ,",", housing","housing projects","projects ,",", and","and corrupt","corrupt cops","cops ,",", we","we follow","follow three","three officers","officers :",": Tango","Tango ,",", African-American","African-American ,",", working","working undercover","undercover ,",", believing","believing he","he 's","'s earned","earned a","a promotion","promotion to","to a","a desk","desk job","job but","but told","told he","he has","has to","to set","set up","up the","the bust","bust of","of an","an ex-con","ex-con who","who saved","saved his","his life","life ;","; Sal","Sal ,",", who","who 'll","'ll commit","commit murder","murder to","to get","get cash","cash ;","; and","and ,",", Eddie","Eddie ,",", the","the precinct","precinct 's","'s oldest","oldest beat","beat cop","cop ,",", a","a week","week to","to go","go before","before retirement","retirement ,",", assigned","assigned to","to mentor","mentor an","an earnest","earnest rookie","Can this","this end","end well","well for","for any","any of","of the","the three"]}

{"title":"Special Annie","plot":"A Korean filmmaker living alone in NY happens to meet an American woman, Annie. Annie was sexually abused as a child, subsequently turned to prostitution and heroin addiction from which she contracted AIDS. She robbed a bank to support her habit and served prison time. Now out of prison, and drug free, she still has to live with AIDS, but seems remarkably happy- at times, radiantly joyful - simply to be alive. The filmmaker learns that Annie is the same age as her older sister suffering Parkinson's disease in Korea and begins developing a strong bond with Annie. These two women from very different back grounds begin to share their solitary lives with the help of a rescued cat, begin opening up to each other.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","Korean","filmmak","live","alon","in","NY","happen","to","meet","an","American","woman",",","Annie",".","Annie","was","sexual","abus","as","a","child",",","subsequ","turn","to","prostitut","and","heroin","addict","from","which","she","contract","AIDS",".","She","rob","a","bank","to","support","her","habit","and","serv","prison","time",".","Now","out","of","prison",",","and","drug","free",",","she","still","has","to","live","with","AIDS",",","but","seem","remark","happi","-","at","time",",","radiant","joy","-","simpli","to","be","aliv",".","The","filmmak","learn","that","Annie","is","the","same","age","as","her","older","sister","suffer","Parkinson","'s","diseas","in","Korea","and","begin","develop","a","strong","bond","with","Annie",".","These","two","women","from","veri","differ","back","ground","begin","to","share","their","solitari","live","with","the","help","of","a","rescu","cat",",","begin","open","up","to","each","other","."],"lemmas":["a","korean","filmmaker","living","alone","in","NY","happen","to","meet","a","american","woman",",","Annie",".","Annie","be","sexually","abuse","as","a","child",",","subsequently","turn","to","prostitution","and","heroin","addiction","from","which","she","contract","AIDS",".","she","rob","a","bank","to","support","she","habit","and","serve","prison","time",".","now","out","of","prison",",","and","drug","free",",","she","still","have","to","live","with","AIDS",",","but","seem","remarkably","happy","-","at","time",",","radiantly","joyful","-","simply","to","be","alive",".","the","filmmaker","learn","that","Annie","be","the","same","age","as","she","older","sister","suffer","Parkinson","'s","disease","in","Korea","and","begin","develop","a","strong","bond","with","Annie",".","these","two","woman","from","very","different","back","grounds","begin","to","share","they","solitary","life","with","the","help","of","a","rescue","cat",",","begin","open","up","to","each","other","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A Korean filmmaker","Korean filmmaker living","filmmaker living alone","living alone in","alone in NY","in NY happens","NY happens to","happens to meet","to meet an","meet an American","an American woman","American woman ,","woman , Annie","Annie was sexually","was sexually abused","sexually abused as","abused as a","as a child","a child ,","child , subsequently",", subsequently turned","subsequently turned to","turned to prostitution","to prostitution and","prostitution and heroin","and heroin addiction","heroin addiction from","addiction from which","from which she","which she contracted","she contracted AIDS","She robbed a","robbed a bank","a bank to","bank to support","to support her","support her habit","her habit and","habit and served","and served prison","served prison time","Now out of","out of prison","of prison ,","prison , and",", and drug","and drug free","drug free ,","free , she",", she still","she still has","still has to","has to live","to live with","live with AIDS","with AIDS ,","AIDS , but",", but seems","but seems remarkably","seems remarkably happy","remarkably happy -","happy -

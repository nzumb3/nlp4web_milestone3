{"title":"Reality XL","plot":"On 13 January 2011, highly intelligent but irritable Professor Konstantin Carus (Heiner Lauterbach) enters the control room of the particle accelerator together with 23 colleagues. Eight hours later, at 6 am on 14 January 2011, the 23 scientists of the night shift have disappeared without a trace! The only survivor of this tragedy is Konstantin Carus. In order to solve this mysterious case, he is being examined at a secret location by representatives of the Swiss Depart of Public Prosecution (Max Tidof, Annika Blendl). They expect answers from him to these burning questions: Did the incalculable experiment create a temporary Black Hole, absorbing the surrounding matter? Does the LHC endanger the whole world?

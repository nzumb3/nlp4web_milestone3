{"title":"Perfect Fire","plot":"Half of the world population cook with wood stoves and more than one million people die every year breathing the smoke. In Cottage Grove, Oregon, designers, engineers and builders gather every Summer in order to compare their researches and build the perfect stove. At Aprovecho you meet people who work in Africa and South America trying to help poor people in their daily life and activities. The stove community is a worldwide community that is able to face many problems at once: global warming, deforestation, living conditions in developing countries, health problems connected with smoke and inefficient stoves. They have many solutions and they work together breaking the gap between academic science and fieldwork.","genres":["Documentary","

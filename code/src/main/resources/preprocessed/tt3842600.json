{"title":"The Leopard in the Land","plot":"Artist and Disney designer Joe Rohde sets out on a month-long horseback expedition across the Altai Mountains of Western Mongolia with the intention of painting large scale landscapes to raise funds for Snow Leopard conservation. Facing blizzards, rebellious camels and the rapidly approaching Mongolian winter, it is a pilgrimage that explores why we travel, how we interact with the world, and the monumental effect that has on everything else - including the elusive and enigmatic snow leopard.","genres":["Adventure"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Artist","and","Disney","design","Joe","Rohd","set","out","on","a","month-long","horseback","expedit","across","the","Altai","Mountain","of","Western","Mongolia","with","the","intent","of","paint","larg","scale","landscap","to","rais","fund","for","Snow","Leopard","conserv",".","Face","blizzard",",","rebelli","camel","and","the","rapid","approach","Mongolian","winter",",","it","is","a","pilgrimag","that","explor","whi","we","travel",",","how","we","interact","with","the","world",",","and","the","monument","effect","that","has","on","everyth","els","-","includ","the","elus","and","enigmat","snow","leopard","."],"lemmas":["Artist","and","Disney","designer","Joe","Rohde","set","out","on","a","month-long","horseback","expedition","across","the","Altai","Mountains","of","Western","Mongolia","with","the","intention","of","painting","large","scale","landscape","to","raise","fund","for","Snow","Leopard","conservation",".","face","blizzard",",","rebellious","camel","and","the","rapidly","approach","mongolian","winter",",","it","be","a","pilgrimage","that","explore","why","we","travel",",","how","we","interact","with","the","world",",","and","the","monumental","effect","that","have","on","everything","else","-","include","the","elusive","and","enigmatic","snow","leopard","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Artist and Disney","and Disney designer","Disney designer Joe","designer Joe Rohde","Joe Rohde sets","Rohde sets out","sets out on","out on a","on a month-long","a month-long horseback","month-long horseback expedition","horseback expedition across","expedition across the","across the Altai","the Altai Mountains","Altai Mountains of","Mountains of Western","of Western Mongolia","Western Mongolia with","Mongolia with the","with the intention","the intention of","intention of painting","of painting large","painting large scale","large scale landscapes","scale landscapes to","landscapes to raise","to raise funds","raise funds for","funds for Snow","for Snow Leopard","Snow Leopard conservation","Facing blizzards ,","blizzards , rebellious",", rebellious camels","rebellious camels and","camels and the","and the rapidly","the rapidly approaching","rapidly approaching Mongolian","approaching Mongolian winter","Mongolian winter ,","winter , it",", it is","it is a","is a pilgrimage","a pilgrimage that","pilgrimage that explores","that explores why","explores why we","why we travel","we travel ,","travel , how",", how we","how we interact","we interact with","interact with the","with the world","the world ,","world , and",", and the","and the monumental","the monumental effect","monumental effect that","effect that has","that has on","has on everything","on everything else","everything else -","else - including","- including the","including the elusive","the elusive and","elusive and enigmatic","and enigmatic snow","enigmatic snow leopard"],"2grams":["Artist and","and Disney","Disney designer","designer Joe","Joe Rohde","Rohde sets","sets out","out on","on a","a month-long","month-long horseback","horseback expedition","expedition across","across the","the Altai","Altai Mountains","Mountains of","of Western","Western Mongolia","Mongolia with","with the","the intention","intention of","of painting","painting large","large scale","scale landscapes","landscapes to","to raise","raise funds","funds for","for Snow","Snow Leopard","Leopard conservation","Facing blizzards","blizzards ,",", rebellious","rebellious camels","camels and","and the","the rapidly","rapidly approaching","approaching Mongolian","Mongolian winter","winter ,",", it","it is","is a","a pilgrimage","pilgrimage that","that explores","explores why","why we","we travel","travel ,",", how","how we","we interact","interact with","with the","the world","world ,",", and","and the","the monumental","monumental effect","effect that","that has","has on","on everything","everything else","else -","- including","including the","the elusive","elusive and","and enigmatic","enigmatic snow","snow leopard"]}

{"title":"Choke","plot":"Henry, an uptight businessman who sometimes acts with questionable ethics, nevertheless rejects Ron, a scam artist who wants a partner. Ron won't let up and finds a lever to blackmail Henry, whose daughter Gina has killed a pedestrian in a hit-and-run car accident. To protect Gina, Henry disposes of Ron, but a murderous sociopath witnesses this crime. Henry and this stranger bond in an odd way, telling stories about their childhoods. Henry makes a deal with the stranger, helping to get rid of the body of one of the stranger's victims. Will this act seal a bargain between the two men and get Henry off the hook, or will the stranger threaten Henry and Gina?","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Henri",",","an","uptight","businessman","who","sometim","act","with","question","ethic",",","nevertheless","reject","Ron",",","a","scam","artist","who","want","a","partner",".","Ron","wo","n't","let","up","and","find","a","lever","to","blackmail","Henri",",","whose","daughter","Gina","has","kill","a","pedestrian","in","a","hit-and-run","car","accid",".","To","protect","Gina",",","Henri","dispos","of","Ron",",","but","a","murder","sociopath","wit","this","crime",".","Henri","and","this","stranger","bond","in","an","odd","way",",","tell","stori","about","their","childhood",".","Henri","make","a","deal","with","the","stranger",",","help","to","get","rid","of","the","bodi","of","one","of","the","stranger","'s","victim",".","Will","this","act","seal","a","bargain","between","the","two","men","and","get","Henri","off","the","hook",",","or","will","the","stranger","threaten","Henri","and","Gina","?"],"lemmas":["Henry",",","a","uptight","businessman","who","sometimes","act","with","questionable","ethic",",","nevertheless","reject","Ron",",","a","scam","artist","who","want","a","partner",".","Ron","will","not","let","up","and","find","a","lever","to","blackmail","Henry",",","whose","daughter","Gina","have","kill","a","pedestrian","in","a","hit-and-run","car","accident",".","to","protect","Gina",",","Henry","dispose","of","Ron",",","but","a","murderous","sociopath","witness","this","crime",".","Henry","and","this","stranger","bond","in","a","odd","way",",","tell","story","about","they","childhood",".","Henry","make","a","deal","with","the","stranger",",","help","to","get","rid","of","the","body","of","one","of","the","stranger","'s","victim",".","will","this","act","seal","a","bargain","between","the","two","man","and","get","Henry","off","the","hook",",","or","will","the","stranger","threaten","Henry","and","Gina","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Henry

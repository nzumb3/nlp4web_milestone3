{"title":"Coronation","plot":"The elderly heir of a formerly wealthy and respected Chilean family, Andres, suffers from decadence and solitude. He hires young Estela in order to look after his tiranic and almost crazy grandmother. The differences in class and age don't stop Andres from courting Estela, whose fiancé Mario tries to make some money with the passions of his well-off rival. The suffocating atmosphere of the run-down mansion in the outskirts of Santiago represents the deterioration of the bourgeoisie, and sets the scene for the total collapse of Andres.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","elder","heir","of","a","former","wealthi","and","respect","Chilean","famili",",","Andres",",","suffer","from","decad","and","solitud",".","He","hire","young","Estela","in","order","to","look","after","his","tiran","and","almost","crazi","grandmoth",".","The","differ","in","class","and","age","do","n't","stop","Andres","from","court","Estela",",","whose","fiancé","Mario","tri","to","make","some","money","with","the","passion","of","his","well-off","rival",".","The","suffoc","atmospher","of","the","run-down","mansion","in","the","outskirt","of","Santiago","repres","the","deterior","of","the","bourgeoisi",",","and","set","the","scene","for","the","total","collaps","of","Andres","."],"lemmas":["the","elderly","heir","of","a","formerly","wealthy","and","respected","chilean","family",",","Andres",",","suffer","from","decadence","and","solitude",".","he","hire","young","Estela","in","order","to","look","after","he","tiranic","and","almost","crazy","grandmother",".","the","difference","in","class","and","age","do","not","stop","Andres","from","court","Estela",",","whose","fiancé","Mario","try","to","make","some","money","with","the","passion","of","he","well-off","rival",".","the","suffocating","atmosphere","of","the","run-down","mansion","in","the","outskirts","of","Santiago","represent","the","deterioration","of","the","bourgeoisie",",","and","set","the","scene","for","the","total","collapse","of","Andres","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The elderly heir","elderly heir of","heir of a","of a formerly","a formerly wealthy","formerly wealthy and","wealthy and respected","and respected Chilean","respected Chilean family","Chilean family ,","family , Andres",", Andres ,","Andres , suffers",", suffers from","suffers from decadence","from decadence and","decadence and solitude","He hires young","hires young Estela","young Estela in","Estela in order","in order to","order to look","to look after","look after his","after his tiranic","his tiranic and","tiranic and almost","and almost crazy","almost crazy grandmother","The differences in","differences in class","in class and","class and age","and age do","age do n't","do n't stop","n't stop Andres","stop Andres from","Andres from courting","from courting Estela","courting Estela ,","Estela , whose",", whose fiancé","whose fiancé Mario","fiancé Mario tries","Mario tries to","tries to make","to make some","make some money","some money with","money with the","with the passions","the passions of","passions of his","of his well-off","his well-off rival","The suffocating atmosphere","suffocating atmosphere of","atmosphere of the","of the run-down","the run-down mansion","run-down mansion in","mansion in the","in the outskirts","the outskirts of","outskirts of Santiago","of Santiago represents","Santiago represents the","represents the deterioration","the deterioration of","deterioration of the","of the bourgeoisie","the bourgeoisie ,","bourgeoisie , and",", and sets","and sets the","sets the scene","the scene for","scene for the","for the total","the total collapse","total collapse of","collapse of Andres"],"2grams":["The elderly","elderly heir","heir of","of a","a formerly","formerly wealthy","wealthy and","and respected","respected Chilean","Chilean family","family ,",", Andres","Andres ,",", suffers","suffers from","from decadence","decadence and","and solitude","He hires","hires young","young Estela","Estela in","in order","order to","to look","look after","after his","his tiranic","tiranic and","and almost","almost crazy","crazy grandmother","The differences","differences in","in class","class and","and age","age do","do n't","n't stop","stop Andres","Andres from","from courting","courting Estela","Estela ,",", whose","whose fiancé","fiancé Mario","Mario tries","tries to","to make","make some","some money","money with","with the","the passions","passions of","of his","his well-off","well-off rival","The suffocating","suffocating atmosphere","atmosphere of","of the","the run-down","run-down mansion","mansion in","in the","the outskirts","outskirts of","of Santiago","Santiago represents","represents the","the deterioration","deterioration of","of the","the bourgeoisie","bourgeoisie ,",", and","and sets","sets the","the scene","scene for","for the","the total","total collapse","collapse of","of Andres"]}

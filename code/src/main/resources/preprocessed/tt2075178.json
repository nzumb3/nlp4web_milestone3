{"title":"Frames","plot":"Peter, a young filmmaker, uses his camera to transform the banality of his Wisconsin hometown into art. Distant from his family and environment, Peter isolates himself in an aesthetic realm, one in which filmmaking grants him control, a control that reduces, simplifies, and purifies. Joining him on a documentary project, Vera - the daughter of a prominent local businessman - attempts to become the star of his cinematic and romantic universes. However, when Vera vanishes unexpectedly, Peter's creative detachment quickly gives way to deepening obsession, intensified by his fascination with a bit of scandalously suggestive footage. As Peter struggles to separate filmic fiction from reality, he uncovers a troubling explanation for Vera's disappearance . . . one that puts him on dangerous ground. Driven by loneliness and desire, Peter ignores warnings and threats - both well-meaning and sinister - on a mission to solve his own narrative. Whether daring or delusional, Peter's investigate impulse traps him in a mystery he unfortunately can't edit his way out of.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Peter",",","a","young","filmmak",",","use","his","camera","to","transform","the","banal","of","his","Wisconsin","hometown","into","art",".","Distant","from","his","famili","and","environ",",","Peter","isol","himself","in","an","aesthet","realm",",","one","in","which","filmmak","grant","him","control",",","a","control","that","reduc",",","simplifi",",","and","purifi",".","Join","him","on","a","documentari","project",",","Vera","-","the","daughter","of","a","promin","local","businessman","-","attempt","to","becom","the","star","of","his","cinemat","and","romant","univers",".","Howev",",","when","Vera","vanish","unexpect",",","Peter","'s","creativ","detach","quick","give","way","to","deepen","obsess",",","intensifi","by","his","fascin","with","a","bit","of","scandal","suggest","footag",".","As","Peter","struggl","to","separ","filmic","fiction","from","realiti",",","he","uncov","a","troubl","explan","for","Vera","'s","disappear",". . .","one","that","put","him","on","danger","ground",".","Driven","by","loneli","and","desir",",","Peter","ignor","warn","and","threat","-","both","well-mean","and","sinist","-","on","a","mission","to","solv","his","own","narrat",".","Whether","dare","or","delusion",",","Peter","'s","investig","impuls","trap","him","in","a","mysteri","he","unfortun","ca","n't","edit","his","way","out","of","."],"lemmas":["Peter",",","a","young","filmmaker",",","use","he","camera","to","transform","the","banality","of","he","Wisconsin","hometown","into","art",".","distant","from","he","family","and","environment",",","Peter","isolate","himself","in","a","aesthetic","realm",",","one","in","which","filmmaking","grant","he","control",",","a","control","that","reduce",",","simplify",",","and","purify",".","join","he","on","a","documentary","project",",","Vera","-","the","daughter","of","a","prominent","local","businessman","-","attempt","to","become","the","star","of","he","cinematic","and","romantic","universe",".","however",",","when","Vera","vanish","unexpectedly",",","Peter","'s","creative","detachment","quickly","give","way","to","deepen","obsession",",","intensify","by","he","fascination","with","a","bit","of","scandalously","suggestive","footage",".","as","Peter","struggle","to","separate","filmic","fiction","from","reality",",","he","uncover","a","troubling","explanation","for","Vera","'s","disappearance",". . .","one","that","put","he","on","dangerous","ground",".","drive","by","loneliness","and","desire",",","Peter","ignore","warning","and","threat","-","both","well-meaning","and","sinister","-","on","a","mission","to","solve","he","own","narrative",".","whether","daring","or","delusional",",","Peter","'s","investigate","impulse","trap","he","in","a","mystery","he","unfortunately","can","not","edit","he","way","out","of","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Peter , a",", a young","a young filmmaker","young filmmaker ,","filmmaker , uses",", uses his","uses his camera","his camera to","camera to transform","to transform the","transform the banality","the banality of","banality of his","of his Wisconsin","his Wisconsin hometown","Wisconsin hometown into","hometown into art","Distant from his","from his family","his family and","family and environment","and environment ,","environment , Peter",", Peter isolates","Peter isolates himself","isolates himself in","himself in an","in an aesthetic","an aesthetic realm","aesthetic realm ,","realm , one",", one in","one in which","in which filmmaking","which filmmaking grants","filmmaking grants him","grants him control","him control ,","control , a",", a control","a control that","control that reduces","that reduces ,","reduces , simplifies",", simplifies ,","simplifies , and",", and purifies","Joining him on","him on a","on a documentary","a documentary project","documentary project ,","project , Vera",", Vera -","Vera -

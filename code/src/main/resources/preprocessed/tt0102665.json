{"title":"Pictures from a Revolution","plot":"In 1981, Susan Meiselas published \"Nicaragua, June 1978 to July 1979,\" 70 photographs she took documenting the Sandinista revolution. Ten years later, Meiselas returns looking for the people who appear in the photographs: where are they now, what do they remember, what do they think of their country and of the revolution? She finds a woman who buried her husband when she was 14; she talks to those who fought the Guarda Nacional - some are disillusioned, some still have the fervor of revolution; she talks to mothers about their sons; she finds a Guarda member who became a Contra. And she offers her own reflections on time and history and on the moment and meaning of a photograph.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["In","1981",",","Susan","Meisela","publish","\"","Nicaragua",",","June","1978","to","Juli","1979",",","\"","70","photograph","she","took","document","the","Sandinista","revolut",".","Ten","year","later",",","Meisela","return","look","for","the","peopl","who","appear","in","the","photograph",":","where","are","they","now",",","what","do","they","rememb",",","what","do","they","think","of","their","countri","and","of","the","revolut","?","She","find","a","woman","who","buri","her","husband","when","she","was","14",";","she","talk","to","those","who","fought","the","Guarda","Nacion","-","some","are","disillus",",","some","still","have","the","fervor","of","revolut",";","she","talk","to","mother","about","their","son",";","she","find","a","Guarda","member","who","becam","a","Contra",".","And","she","offer","her","own","reflect","on","time","and","histori","and","on","the","moment","and","mean","of","a","photograph","."],"lemmas":["in","1981",",","Susan","Meiselas","publish","``","Nicaragua",",","June","1978","to","July","1979",",","''","70","photograph","she","take","document","the","Sandinista","revolution",".","ten","year","later",",","Meiselas","return","look","for","the","people","who","appear","in","the","photograph",":","where","be","they","now",",","what","do","they","remember",",","what","do","they","think","of","they","country","and","of","the","revolution","?","she","find","a","woman","who","bury","she","husband","when","she","be","14",";","she","talk","to","those","who","fight","the","Guarda","Nacional","-","some","be","disillusioned",",","some","still","have","the","fervor","of","revolution",";","she","talk","to","mother","about","they","son",";","she","find","a","Guarda","member","who","become","a","Contra",".","and","she","offer","she","own","reflection","on","time","and","history","and","on","the","moment","and","meaning","of","a","photograph","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In 1981 ,","1981 , Susan",", Susan Meiselas","Susan Meiselas published","Meiselas published \"","published \" Nicaragua","\" Nicaragua ,","Nicaragua , June",", June 1978","June 1978 to","1978 to July","to July 1979","July 1979 ,","1979 , \"",", \" 70","\" 70 photographs","70 photographs she","photographs she took","she took documenting","took documenting the","documenting the Sandinista","the Sandinista revolution","Ten years later","years later ,","later , Meiselas",", Meiselas returns","Meiselas returns looking","returns looking for","looking for the","for the people","the people who","people who appear","who appear in","appear in the","in the photographs","the photographs :","photographs : where",": where are","where are they","are they now","they now ,","now , what",", what do","what do they","do they remember","they remember ,","remember , what",", what do","what do they","do they think","they think of","think of their","of their country","their country and","country and of","and of the","of the revolution","She finds a","finds a woman","a woman who","woman who buried","who buried her","buried her husband","her husband when","husband when she","when she was","she was 14","was 14 ;","14 ;

{"title":"The Price of Sugar","plot":"On the Caribbean island of the Dominican Republic, tourists flock to pristine beaches, with little knowledge that a few miles away thousands of dispossessed Haitians are under armed guard on plantations harvesting sugarcane, most of which ends up in US kitchens. Cutting cane by machete, they work 14 hour days, 7 days a week, frequently without access to decent housing, electricity, clean water, education, healthcare or adequate nutrition. The Price of Sugar follows a charismatic Spanish priest, Father Christopher Hartley, as he organizes some of this hemisphere's poorest people, challenging the powerful interests profiting from their work. This film raises key questions about where the products we consume originate, at what human cost they are produced and ultimately, where our responsibility lies.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","the","Caribbean","island","of","the","Dominican","Republ",",","tourist","flock","to","pristin","beach",",","with","littl","knowledg","that","a","few","mile","away","thousand","of","dispossess","Haitian","are","under","arm","guard","on","plantat","harvest","sugarcan",",","most","of","which","end","up","in","US","kitchen",".","Cut","cane","by","machet",",","they","work","14","hour","day",",","7","day","a","week",",","frequent","without","access","to","decent","hous",",","electr",",","clean","water",",","educ",",","healthcar","or","adequ","nutrit",".","The","Price","of","Sugar","follow","a","charismat","Spanish","priest",",","Father","Christoph","Hartley",",","as","he","organ","some","of","this","hemispher","'s","poorest","peopl",",","challeng","the","power","interest","profit","from","their","work",".","This","film","rais","key","question","about","where","the","product","we","consum","origin",",","at","what","human","cost","they","are","produc","and","ultim",",","where","our","respons","lie","."],"lemmas":["on","the","caribbean","island","of","the","Dominican","Republic",",","tourist","flock","to","pristine","beach",",","with","little","knowledge","that","a","few","mile","away","thousand","of","dispossessed","Haitians","be","under","armed","guard","on","plantation","harvest","sugarcane",",","most","of","which","end","up","in","US","kitchen",".","cut","cane","by","machete",",","they","work","14","hour","day",",","7","day","a","week",",","frequently","without","access","to","decent","housing",",","electricity",",","clean","water",",","education",",","healthcare","or","adequate","nutrition",".","the","Price","of","Sugar","follow","a","charismatic","spanish","priest",",","Father","Christopher","Hartley",",","as","he","organize","some","of","this","hemisphere","'s","poorest","people",",","challenge","the","powerful","interest","profit","from","they","work",".","this","film","raise","key","question","about","where","the","product","we","consume","originate",",","at","what","human","cost","they","be","produce","and","ultimately",",","where","we","responsibility","lie","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["On

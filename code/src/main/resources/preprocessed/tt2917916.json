{"title":"Dual","plot":"Due to a weather problem a plane from Denmark is forced to land at the Slovene airport. Amongst the passengers, being taken to a hotel in Ljubljana, is a quiet, beautiful young Danish girl Iben (25). This is how she meets Tina (25) who drives a shuttle as a summer job. They both need each other, but are very careful because one of them is hiding a secret. They speak to each other in English and in their native languages. Only one of the two languages has the so-called dual, a special grammatical form used in expressions that involve just two subjects. The other language does not. Dual is an honest story about two people who meet precisely at the moment when they absolutely should not have - but they are nevertheless a bit happier because they did.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Due","to","a","weather","problem","a","plane","from","Denmark","is","forc","to","land","at","the","Sloven","airport",".","Amongst","the","passeng",",","be","taken","to","a","hotel","in","Ljubljana",",","is","a","quiet",",","beauti","young","Danish","girl","Iben","(","25",")",".","This","is","how","she","meet","Tina","(","25",")","who","drive","a","shuttl","as","a","summer","job",".","They","both","need","each","other",",","but","are","veri","care","becaus","one","of","them","is","hide","a","secret",".","They","speak","to","each","other","in","English","and","in","their","nativ","languag",".","Onli","one","of","the","two","languag","has","the","so-cal","dual",",","a","special","grammat","form","use","in","express","that","involv","just","two","subject",".","The","other","languag","doe","not",".","Dual","is","an","honest","stori","about","two","peopl","who","meet","precis","at","the","moment","when","they","absolut","should","not","have","-","but","they","are","nevertheless","a","bit","happier","becaus","they","did","."],"lemmas":["due","to","a","weather","problem","a","plane","from","Denmark","be","force","to","land","at","the","Slovene","airport",".","amongst","the","passenger",",","be","take","to","a","hotel","in","Ljubljana",",","be","a","quiet",",","beautiful","young","danish","girl","iben","-lrb-","25","-rrb-",".","this","be","how","she","meet","Tina","-lrb-","25","-rrb-","who","drive","a","shuttle","as","a","summer","job",".","they","both","need","each","other",",","but","be","very","careful","because","one","of","they","be","hide","a","secret",".","they","speak","to","each","other","in","English","and","in","they","native","language",".","only","one","of","the","two","language","have","the","so-called","dual",",","a","special","grammatical","form","use","in","expression","that","involve","just","two","subject",".","the","other","language","do","not",".","dual","be","a","honest","story","about","two","people","who","meet","precisely","at","the","moment","when","they","absolutely","should","not","have","-","but","they","be","nevertheless","a","bit","happier","because","they","do","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Due to a","to a weather","a weather problem","weather problem a","problem a plane","a plane from","plane from Denmark","from Denmark is","Denmark is forced","is forced to","forced to land","to land at","land at the","at the Slovene","the Slovene airport","Amongst the passengers","the passengers ,","passengers , being",", being taken","being taken to","taken to a","to a hotel","a hotel in","hotel in Ljubljana","in Ljubljana ,","Ljubljana , is",", is a","is a quiet","a quiet ,","quiet , beautiful",", beautiful young","beautiful young Danish","young Danish girl","Danish girl Iben","girl Iben (","Iben ( 25","( 25 )","This is how","is how she","how she meets","she meets Tina","meets Tina (","Tina ( 25","( 25 )","25 ) who",") who drives","who drives a","drives a shuttle","a shuttle as","shuttle as a","as a summer","a summer job","They both need","both need each","need each other","each other ,","other , but",", but are","but are very","are very careful","very careful because","careful because one","because one of","one of them","of them is","them is hiding","is hiding a","hiding a secret","They speak to","speak to each","to each other","each other in","other in English","in English and","English and in","and in their","in their native","their native languages","Only one of","one of the","of the two","the two languages","two languages has","languages has the","has the so-called","the so-called dual","so-called dual ,","dual , a",", a special","a special grammatical","special grammatical form","grammatical form used","form used in","used in expressions","in expressions that","expressions that involve","that involve just","involve just two","just two subjects","The other language","other language does","language does not","Dual is an","is an honest","an honest story","honest story about","story about two","about two people","two people who","people who meet","who meet precisely","meet precisely at","precisely at the","at the moment","the moment when","moment when they","when they absolutely","they absolutely should","absolutely should not","should not have","not have -","have -

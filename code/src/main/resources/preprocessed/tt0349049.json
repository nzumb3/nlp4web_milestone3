{"title":"2000 & 1 Night","plot":"The film seeks to form a \"relationship\" between the artist and her opposition, her antipode: the \"philistine\", as well as between her and her friends, admirers, fans, and serious critics. While via the camera we get a closer look at her life, her artistic and private activities - listening to her, asking her questions, observing and accompanying her - we also catch bits of reactions, comments, commentaries from others, and these we juxtapose symbolically, associatively, or as a kind of verification or support with our artists actions, skills and activities or with the artist herself. Our artist uses herself as her subject rather than the Other or the other thing. She is responsible to herself - in her art as well. We, the makers of this film, remain responsible to HER and the audience. And what exactly is the phenomenon of our unknown artist? The film has provided many possible ways to look at this question. But any answer - in keeping with the intention of the film - must be an individual one.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","film","seek","to","form","a","\"","relationship","\"","between","the","artist","and","her","opposit",",","her","antipod",":","the","\"","philistin","\"",",","as","well","as","between","her","and","her","friend",",","admir",",","fan",",","and","serious","critic",".","While","via","the","camera","we","get","a","closer","look","at","her","life",",","her","artist","and","privat","activ","-","listen","to","her",",","ask","her","question",",","observ","and","accompani","her","-","we","also","catch","bit","of","reaction",",","comment",",","commentari","from","other",",","and","these","we","juxtapos","symbol",",","associ",",","or","as","a","kind","of","verif","or","support","with","our","artist","action",",","skill","and","activ","or","with","the","artist","herself",".","Our","artist","use","herself","as","her","subject","rather","than","the","Other","or","the","other","thing",".","She","is","respons","to","herself","-","in","her","art","as","well",".","We",",","the","maker","of","this","film",",","remain","respons","to","HER","and","the","audienc",".","And","what","exact","is","the","phenomenon","of","our","unknown","artist","?","The","film","has","provid","mani","possibl","way","to","look","at","this","question",".","But","ani","answer","-","in","keep","with","the","intent","of","the","film","-","must","be","an","individu","one","."],"lemmas":["the","film","seek","to","form","a","``","relationship","''","between","the","artist","and","she","opposition",",","she","antipode",":","the","``","philistine","''",",","as","well","as","between","she","and","she","friend",",","admirer",",","fan",",","and","serious","critic",".","while","via","the","camera","we","get","a","closer","look","at","she","life",",","she","artistic","and","private","activity","-","listen","to","she",",","ask","she","question",",","observe","and","accompany","she","-","we","also","catch","bit","of","reaction",",","comment",",","commentary","from","other",",","and","these","we","juxtapose","symbolically",",","associatively",",","or","as","a","kind","of","verification","or","support","with","we","artist","action",",","skill","and","activity","or","with","the","artist","herself",".","we","artist","use","herself","as","she","subject","rather","than","the","Other","or","the","other","thing",".","she","be","responsible","to","herself","-","in","she","art","as","well",".","we",",","the","maker","of","this","film",",","remain","responsible","to","her","and","the","audience",".","and","what","exactly","be","the","phenomenon","of","we","unknown","artist","?","the","film","have","provide","many","possible","way","to","look","at","this","question",".","but","any","answer","-","in","keep","with","the","intention","of","the","film","-","must","be","a","individual","one","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The film seeks","film seeks to","seeks to form","to form a","form a \"","a \" relationship","\" relationship \"","relationship \" between","\" between the","between the artist","the artist and","artist and her","and her opposition","her opposition ,","opposition , her",", her antipode","her antipode :","antipode : the",": the \"","the \" philistine","\" philistine \"","philistine \" ,","\" , as",", as well","as well as","well as between","as between her","between her and","her and her","and her friends","her friends ,","friends , admirers",", admirers ,","admirers , fans",", fans ,","fans , and",", and serious","and serious critics","While via the","via the camera","the camera we","camera we get","we get a","get a closer","a closer look","closer look at","look at her","at her life","her life ,","life , her",", her artistic","her artistic and","artistic and private","and private activities","private activities -","activities -

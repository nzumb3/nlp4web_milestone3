{"title":"Happy Days","plot":"The movie revolves around eight youngsters, who become good friends in their freshman years when they join the college for their Bachelors in Engineering (B.E.). The life of these young minds, be it personal or that in college, is dealt with aplomb. The first-half deals with the relationship of these freshmen with their seniors, who try to gain an upper hand over their juniors. In the second half, the movie also shows love and affection among one another, but does not ignore to emphasize the main aim of going to the college, i.e., to evolve from a young person with fruity dreams, to a more purposeful professional.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","movi","revolv","around","eight","youngster",",","who","becom","good","friend","in","their","freshman","year","when","they","join","the","colleg","for","their","Bachelor","in","Engineer","(","B.E.",")",".","The","life","of","these","young","mind",",","be","it","person","or","that","in","colleg",",","is","dealt","with","aplomb",".","The","first-half","deal","with","the","relationship","of","these","freshmen","with","their","senior",",","who","tri","to","gain","an","upper","hand","over","their","junior",".","In","the","second","half",",","the","movi","also","show","love","and","affect","among","one","anoth",",","but","doe","not","ignor","to","emphas","the","main","aim","of","go","to","the","colleg",",","i.e.",",","to","evolv","from","a","young","person","with","fruiti","dream",",","to","a","more","purpos","profession","."],"lemmas":["the","movie","revolve","around","eight","youngster",",","who","become","good","friend","in","they","freshman","year","when","they","join","the","college","for","they","bachelor","in","Engineering","-lrb-","B.E.","-rrb-",".","the","life","of","these","young","mind",",","be","it","personal","or","that","in","college",",","be","deal","with","aplomb",".","the","first-half","deal","with","the","relationship","of","these","freshman","with","they","senior",",","who","try","to","gain","a","upper","hand","over","they","junior",".","in","the","second","half",",","the","movie","also","show","love","and","affection","among","one","another",",","but","do","not","ignore","to","emphasize","the","main","aim","of","go","to","the","college",",","i.e.",",","to","evolve","from","a","young","person","with","fruity","dream",",","to","a","more","purposeful","professional","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The

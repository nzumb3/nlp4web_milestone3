{"title":"Aperana Street 52","plot":"In his film Rua Aperana 52 Júlio Bressane describes the invention of a landscape, the topology of a corner of Rio de Janeiro. The film consists of a series of photographs taken between 1909 and 1955 by, among others, Bressane's parents at and around the address used as a title. These are interlarded with scenes from films made between 1957 and 2005, bringing the total fictional time the film covers to almost a century; one hundred years in which the winding road featured in almost every shot structures the new landscape behind the Aperana, which means 'wrong road'. Rua Aperana 52 is autobiographical, as it is a landscape from Bressane's youth, but it is also not so; it is more a multi-subjective mythology of a place seen through all those films and photographs. Bressane refers to his editing as an intuitive form of thinking aimed at evoking moods which make the viewer the new witness of the fictional landscape. A fiction about a fiction.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","his","film","Rua","Aperana","52","Júlio","Bressan","describ","the","invent","of","a","landscap",",","the","topolog","of","a","corner","of","Rio","de","Janeiro",".","The","film","consist","of","a","seri","of","photograph","taken","between","1909","and","1955","by",",","among","other",",","Bressan","'s","parent","at","and","around","the","address","use","as","a","titl",".","These","are","interlard","with","scene","from","film","made","between","1957","and","2005",",","bring","the","total","fiction","time","the","film","cover","to","almost","a","centuri",";","one","hundr","year","in","which","the","wind","road","featur","in","almost","everi","shot","structur","the","new","landscap","behind","the","Aperana",",","which","mean","'","wrong","road","'",".","Rua","Aperana","52","is","autobiograph",",","as","it","is","a","landscap","from","Bressan","'s","youth",",","but","it","is","also","not","so",";","it","is","more","a","multi-subject","mytholog","of","a","place","seen","through","all","those","film","and","photograph",".","Bressan","refer","to","his","edit","as","an","intuit","form","of","think","aim","at","evok","mood","which","make","the","viewer","the","new","wit","of","the","fiction","landscap",".","A","fiction","about","a","fiction","."],"lemmas":["in","he","film","Rua","Aperana","52","Júlio","Bressane","describe","the","invention","of","a","landscape",",","the","topology","of","a","corner","of","Rio","de","Janeiro",".","the","film","consist","of","a","series","of","photograph","take","between","1909","and","1955","by",",","among","other",",","Bressane","'s","parent","at","and","around","the","address","use","as","a","title",".","these","be","interlard","with","scene","from","film","make","between","1957","and","2005",",","bring","the","total","fictional","time","the","film","cover","to","almost","a","century",";","one","hundred","year","in","which","the","wind","road","feature","in","almost","every","shot","structure","the","new","landscape","behind","the","Aperana",",","which","mean","'","wrong","road","'",".","Rua","Aperana","52","be","autobiographical",",","as","it","be","a","landscape","from","Bressane","'s","youth",",","but","it","be","also","not","so",";","it","be","more","a","multi-subjective","mythology","of","a","place","see","through","all","those","film","and","photograph",".","Bressane","refer","to","he","editing","as","a","intuitive","form","of","thinking","aim","at","evoke","mood","which","make","the","viewer","the","new","witness","of","the","fictional","landscape",".","a","fiction","about","a","fiction","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In his film","his film Rua","film Rua Aperana","Rua Aperana 52","Aperana 52 Júlio","52 Júlio Bressane","Júlio Bressane describes","Bressane describes the","describes the invention","the invention of","invention of a","of a landscape","a landscape ,","landscape , the",", the topology","the topology of","topology of a","of a corner","a corner of","corner of Rio","of Rio de","Rio de Janeiro","The film consists","film consists of","consists of a","of a series","a series of","series of photographs","of photographs taken","photographs taken between","taken between 1909","between 1909 and","1909 and 1955","and 1955 by","1955 by ,","by , among",", among others","among others ,","others , Bressane",", Bressane 's","Bressane 's parents","'s parents at","parents at and","at and around","and around the","around the address","the address used","address used as","used as a","as a title","These are interlarded","are interlarded with","interlarded with scenes","with scenes from","scenes from films","from films made","films made between","made between 1957","between 1957 and","1957 and 2005","and 2005 ,","2005 , bringing",", bringing the","bringing the total","the total fictional","total fictional time","fictional time the","time the film","the film covers","film covers to","covers to almost","to almost a","almost a century","a century ;","century ;

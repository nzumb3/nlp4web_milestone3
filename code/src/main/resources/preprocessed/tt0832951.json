{"title":"A Stone's Throw","plot":"Olivia lives in a small town in Nova Scotia, Canada along with her son, Thomas, a daughter, Sarah, and has been separated from her French-speaking husband, Jean Marc. She has an estranged brother named Jack Walker who she has not seen for many years, as he refused to return her phone calls, and neglected to attend their father's funeral in Montana, U.S.A.. Due to opening of Cynaco and MacNeil Mining Company, the town expects to have about new 125 new jobs. One day she gets a surprise visit from Jack, both brother and sister update each other, and Jack also gets to meet Thomas and Sarah, as well as Olivia's attractive South Asian neighbor, Lia, a single mother. He soon starts an affair with her, and even moves in her house. What Olivia and Lia do not know that Jack has been labeled an Eco-Terrorist, is on the most wanted list of the FBI, his presence has a negative influence on Thomas, who will soon end up getting arrested, while Jack himself is busy collecting gas cans, and empty milk jugs on a possible project that he may launch against Cynaco and the MacNeil Mining Company, which he feels are polluting Earth.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Olivia","live","in","a","small","town","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada","along","with","her","son",",","Thoma",",","a","daughter",",","Sarah",",","and","has","been","separ","from","her","French-speak","husband",",","Jean","Marc",".","She","has","an","estrang","brother","name","Jack","Walker","who","she","has","not","seen","for","mani","year",",","as","he","refus","to","return","her","phone","call",",","and","neglect","to","attend","their","father","'s","funer","in","Montana",",","U.S.A.",".","Due","to","open","of","Cynaco","and","MacNeil","Mine","Compani",",","the","town","expect","to","have","about","new","125","new","job",".","One","day","she","get","a","surpris","visit","from","Jack",",","both","brother","and","sister","updat","each","other",",","and","Jack","also","get","to","meet","Thoma","and","Sarah",",","as","well","as","Olivia","'s","attract","South","Asian","neighbor",",","Lia",",","a","singl","mother",".","He","soon","start","an","affair","with","her",",","and","even","move","in","her","hous",".","What","Olivia","and","Lia","do","not","know","that","Jack","has","been","label","an","Eco-Terrorist",",","is","on","the","most","want","list","of","the","FBI",",","his","presenc","has","a","negat","influenc","on","Thoma",",","who","will","soon","end","up","get","arrest",",","while","Jack","himself","is","busi","collect","gas","can",",","and","empti","milk","jug","on","a","possibl","project","that","he","may","launch","against","Cynaco","and","the","MacNeil","Mine","Compani",",","which","he","feel","are","pollut","Earth","."],"lemmas":["Olivia","live","in","a","small","town","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada","along","with","she","son",",","Thomas",",","a","daughter",",","Sarah",",","and","have","be","separate","from","she","french-speaking","husband",",","Jean","Marc",".","she","have","a","estrange","brother","name","Jack","Walker","who","she","have","not","see","for","many","year",",","as","he","refuse","to","return","she","phone","call",",","and","neglect","to","attend","they","father","'s","funeral","in","Montana",",","U.S.A.",".","due","to","opening","of","Cynaco","and","MacNeil","Mining","Company",",","the","town","expect","to","have","about","new","125","new","job",".","one","day","she","get","a","surprise","visit","from","Jack",",","both","brother","and","sister","update","each","other",",","and","Jack","also","get","to","meet","Thomas","and","Sarah",",","as","well","as","Olivia","'s","attractive","South","Asian","neighbor",",","Lia",",","a","single","mother",".","he","soon","start","a","affair","with","she",",","and","even","move","in","she","house",".","what","Olivia","and","Lia","do","not","know","that","Jack","have","be","label","a","eco-terrorist",",","be","on","the","most","wanted","list","of","the","FBI",",","he","presence","have","a","negative","influence","on","Thomas",",","who","will","soon","end","up","get","arrest",",","while","Jack","himself","be","busy","collect","gas","can",",","and","empty","milk","jug","on","a","possible","project","that","he","may","launch","against","Cynaco","and","the","MacNeil","Mining","Company",",","which","he","feel","be","pollute","Earth","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Olivia

{"title":"Strange Factories","plot":"Have You Ever Had A Dream So Strange You Were Sure It Wasn't Your Own? Victor is a writer, possessed by a terrifying story as he hunts for four refugee performers of a theatre destroyed in a mysterious fire: Drawn to a remote settlement founded by the mysterious Stronheim, owner of a Factory hidden deep within a dreamlike landscape. Victor finds his friends under the wing of an aristocratic noble and her child-like ward who both watch over the settlement for Stronheim. A dangerous pact is made between Victor and Stronheim. The destroyed theatre will be reconstructed, and in return, Victor must complete the story, no matter the cost. Stronhem requires it to be performed at the village Festival Of Memories, where bizarre rituals are enacted by the villagers under the influence of the Factory's hallucinogenic effluence. Following the dangerous, twisted paths to the heart of inspiration and creativity, Victor's imagination and the fragmented memories and emotions of the performers violently collide in an act of creation that not everyone can survive.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

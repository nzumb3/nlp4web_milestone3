{"title":"Aiyyaa","plot":"Wildly imaginative and film-obsessed, Meenakshi Deshpande has an extra sensitive nose. After she is hired to work in a local college's library, she catches a wonderful scent in the air. The source is Surya, a handsome and enigmatic art student from a Tamil family. Meanwhile, Meenakshi's eccentric Marathi family has arranged for her marriage to Madhav, a kind and sensible man. Meenakshi is torn between marrying her parents' choice for a seemingly ideal husband, or following her nose and chasing the hunky stranger who may or may not be all that he seems.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Wild","imagin","and","film-obsess",",","Meenakshi","Deshpand","has","an","extra","sensit","nose",".","After","she","is","hire","to","work","in","a","local","colleg","'s","librari",",","she","catch","a","wonder","scent","in","the","air",".","The","sourc","is","Surya",",","a","handsom","and","enigmat","art","student","from","a","Tamil","famili",".","Meanwhil",",","Meenakshi","'s","eccentr","Marathi","famili","has","arrang","for","her","marriag","to","Madhav",",","a","kind","and","sensibl","man",".","Meenakshi","is","torn","between","marri","her","parent","'","choic","for","a","seem","ideal","husband",",","or","follow","her","nose","and","chase","the","hunki","stranger","who","may","or","may","not","be","all","that","he","seem","."],"lemmas":["wildly","imaginative","and","film-obsessed",",","Meenakshi","Deshpande","have","a","extra","sensitive","nose",".","after","she","be","hire","to","work","in","a","local","college","'s","library",",","she","catch","a","wonderful","scent","in","the","air",".","the","source","be","Surya",",","a","handsome","and","enigmatic","art","student","from","a","Tamil","family",".","meanwhile",",","Meenakshi","'s","eccentric","Marathi","family","have","arrange","for","she","marriage","to","Madhav",",","a","kind","and","sensible","man",".","Meenakshi","be","tear","between","marry","she","parent","'","choice","for","a","seemingly","ideal","husband",",","or","follow","she","nose","and","chase","the","hunky","stranger","who","may","or","may","not","be","all","that","he","seem","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wildly imaginative and","imaginative and film-obsessed","and film-obsessed ,","film-obsessed , Meenakshi",", Meenakshi Deshpande","Meenakshi Deshpande has","Deshpande has an","has an extra","an extra sensitive","extra sensitive nose","After she is","she is hired","is hired to","hired to work","to work in","work in a","in a local","a local college","local college 's","college 's library","'s library ,","library , she",", she catches","she catches a","catches a wonderful","a wonderful scent","wonderful scent in","scent in the","in the air","The source is","source is Surya","is Surya ,","Surya , a",", a handsome","a handsome and","handsome and enigmatic","and enigmatic art","enigmatic art student","art student from","student from a","from a Tamil","a Tamil family","Meanwhile , Meenakshi",", Meenakshi 's","Meenakshi 's eccentric","'s eccentric Marathi","eccentric Marathi family","Marathi family has","family has arranged","has arranged for","arranged for her","for her marriage","her marriage to","marriage to Madhav","to Madhav ,","Madhav , a",", a kind","a kind and","kind and sensible","and sensible man","Meenakshi is torn","is torn between","torn between marrying","between marrying her","marrying her parents","her parents '","parents ' choice","' choice for","choice for a","for a seemingly","a seemingly ideal","seemingly ideal husband","ideal husband ,","husband , or",", or following","or following her","following her nose","her nose and","nose and chasing","and chasing the","chasing the hunky","the hunky stranger","hunky stranger who","stranger who may","who may or","may or may","or may not","may not be","not be all","be all that","all that he","that he seems"],"2grams":["Wildly imaginative","imaginative and","and film-obsessed","film-obsessed ,",", Meenakshi","Meenakshi Deshpande","Deshpande has","has an","an extra","extra sensitive","sensitive nose","After she","she is","is hired","hired to","to work","work in","in a","a local","local college","college 's","'s library","library ,",", she","she catches","catches a","a wonderful","wonderful scent","scent in","in the","the air","The source","source is","is Surya","Surya ,",", a","a handsome","handsome and","and enigmatic","enigmatic art","art student","student from","from a","a Tamil","Tamil family","Meanwhile ,",", Meenakshi","Meenakshi 's","'s eccentric","eccentric Marathi","Marathi family","family has","has arranged","arranged for","for her","her marriage","marriage to","to Madhav","Madhav ,",", a","a kind","kind and","and sensible","sensible man","Meenakshi is","is torn","torn between","between marrying","marrying her","her parents","parents '","' choice","choice for","for a","a seemingly","seemingly ideal","ideal husband","husband ,",", or","or following","following her","her nose","nose and","and chasing","chasing the","the hunky","hunky stranger","stranger who","who may","may or","or may","may not","not be","be all","all that","that he","he seems"]}

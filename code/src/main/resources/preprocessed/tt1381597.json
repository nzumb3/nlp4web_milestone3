{"title":"Hysterical Psycho","plot":"This wild horror comedy is comedian Dan Fogler's (BALLS OF FURY, EUROPA REPORT) directorial debut. Thrills, kills, and laughs abound as a theater troupe of horny teenagers are murdered one by one in the woods. The group embarks on a retreat to Moon Lake and soon discovers it's the one place on Earth that holds the strongest amount of insanity-inducing lunar radiation. As the confused thespians die in droves, the survivors wonder who is the killer among them? Did the lunar radiation turn one of the actors into a blood-thirsty psychopath? This splatter-fest homage to Alfred Hitchcock is a Tribeca Film Festival breakout and features cult comedian Gilbert Gottfried (THE PROBLEM CHILD, ALADDIN) alongside Noah Bean (TV's DAMAGES) and Lennon Parham (TV's FUNNY OR DIE PRESENTS...).","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["This","wild","horror","comedi","is","comedian","Dan","Fogler","'s","(","BALLS","OF","FURi",",","EUROPA","REPORT",")","directori","debut",".","Thrill",",","kill",",","and","laugh","abound","as","a","theater","troup","of","horni","teenag","are","murder","one","by","one","in","the","wood",".","The","group","embark","on","a","retreat","to","Moon","Lake","and","soon","discov","it","'s","the","one","place","on","Earth","that","hold","the","strongest","amount","of","insanity-induc","lunar","radiat",".","As","the","confus","thespian","die","in","drove",",","the","survivor","wonder","who","is","the","killer","among","them","?","Did","the","lunar","radiat","turn","one","of","the","actor","into","a","blood-thirsti","psychopath","?","This","splatter-fest","homag","to","Alfred","Hitchcock","is","a","Tribeca","Film","Festiv","breakout","and","featur","cult","comedian","Gilbert","Gottfri","(","THE","PROBLEM","CHILD",",","ALADDIN",")","alongsid","Noah","Bean","(","TV","'s","DAMAGES",")","and","Lennon","Parham","(","TV","'s","FUNNi","OR","DIE","PRESENTS","...",")","."],"lemmas":["this","wild","horror","comedy","be","comedian","Dan","Fogler","'s","-lrb-","ball","of","fury",",","EUROPA","REPORT","-rrb-","directorial","debut",".","thrill",",","kill",",","and","laugh","abound","as","a","theater","troupe","of","horny","teenager","be","murder","one","by","one","in","the","wood",".","the","group","embark","on","a","retreat","to","Moon","Lake","and","soon","discover","it","be","the","one","place","on","Earth","that","hold","the","strongest","amount","of","insanity-inducing","lunar","radiation",".","as","the","confused","thespian","die","in","drove",",","the","survivor","wonder","who","be","the","killer","among","they","?","do","the","lunar","radiation","turn","one","of","the","actor","into","a","blood-thirsty","psychopath","?","this","splatter-fest","homage","to","Alfred","Hitchcock","be","a","Tribeca","Film","Festival","breakout","and","feature","cult","comedian","Gilbert","Gottfried","-lrb-","the","problem","child",",","aladdin","-rrb-","alongside","Noah","Bean","-lrb-","TV","'s","damages","-rrb-","and","Lennon","Parham","-lrb-","TV","'s","funny","or","die","present","...","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

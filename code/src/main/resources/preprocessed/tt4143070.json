{"title":"It for Others","plot":"With 'It for Others', Irish artist Duncan Campbell has created an impressive study of the web of ideas that we enshroud things, art, consumption, life and death with - nothing less. Combining essayistic combination of gorgeous archive footage, animation and a new performance by Michael Clark Company, his latest work elaborates on Chris Marker and Alain Resnais's essay film 'Les statues meurent aussi' (1953), where the Western exoticisation of African art is presented in an elegantly questioning meditation about how we see objects and movements, and endow them with meaning - be it a wooden African sculpture, a packet of cigarettes, the touch of a hand or the exchange of consumer goods. 'It for Others' refers both formally and discursively to a great number of modernistic art movements and theories, but brings them up to date with a twist, which simultaneously undermines the coolly aloof analysis that we are first presented with, and subsequently anchors it in real situations - namely the civil war in 1970s Ireland and a contemporary Chinese sweatshop, where Che Guevara t-shirts are produced on the assembly line.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["With","'","It","for","Other","'",",","Irish","artist","Duncan","Campbel","has","creat","an","impress","studi","of","the","web","of","idea","that","we","enshroud","thing",",","art",",","consumpt",",","life","and","death","with","-","noth","less",".","Combin","essayist","combin","of","gorgeous","archiv","footag",",","anim","and","a","new","perform","by","Michael","Clark","Compani",",","his","latest","work","elabor","on","Chris","Marker","and","Alain","Resnai","'s","essay","film","'","Les","statu","meurent","aussi","'","(","1953",")",",","where","the","Western","exoticis","of","African","art","is","present","in","an","eleg","question","medit","about","how","we","see","object","and","movement",",","and","endow","them","with","mean","-","be","it","a","wooden","African","sculptur",",","a","packet","of","cigarett",",","the","touch","of","a","hand","or","the","exchang","of","consum","good",".","'","It","for","Other","'","refer","both","formal","and","discurs","to","a","great","number","of","modernist","art","movement","and","theori",",","but","bring","them","up","to","date","with","a","twist",",","which","simultan","undermin","the","coolli","aloof","analysi","that","we","are","first","present","with",",","and","subsequ","anchor","it","in","real","situat","-","name","the","civil","war","in","1970s","Ireland","and","a","contemporari","Chines","sweatshop",",","where","Che","Guevara","t-shirt","are","produc","on","the","assembl","line","."],"lemmas":["with","'","it","for","other","'",",","irish","artist","Duncan","Campbell","have","create","a","impressive","study","of","the","web","of","idea","that","we","enshroud","thing",",","art",",","consumption",",","life","and","death","with","-","nothing","less",".","combine","essayistic","combination","of","gorgeous","archive","footage",",","animation","and","a","new","performance","by","Michael","Clark","Company",",","he","latest","work","elaborate","on","Chris","Marker","and","Alain","Resnais","'s","essay","film","'","Les","statue","meurent","aussi","'","-lrb-","1953","-rrb-",",","where","the","western","exoticisation","of","african","art","be","present","in","a","elegantly","question","meditation","about","how","we","see","object","and","movement",",","and","endow","they","with","meaning","-","be","it","a","wooden","african","sculpture",",","a","packet","of","cigarette",",","the","touch","of","a","hand","or","the","exchange","of","consumer","goods",".","'","it","for","other","'","refer","both","formally","and","discursively","to","a","great","number","of","modernistic","art","movement","and","theory",",","but","bring","they","up","to","date","with","a","twist",",","which","simultaneously","undermine","the","coolly","aloof","analysis","that","we","be","first","present","with",",","and","subsequently","anchor","it","in","real","situation","-","namely","the","civil","war","in","1970","Ireland","and","a","contemporary","chinese","sweatshop",",","where","Che","Guevara","t-shirt","be","produce","on","the","assembly","line","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["With ' It","' It for","It for Others","for Others '","Others ' ,","' , Irish",", Irish artist","Irish artist Duncan","artist Duncan Campbell","Duncan Campbell has","Campbell has created","has created an","created an impressive","an impressive study","impressive study of","study of the","of the web","the web of","web of ideas","of ideas that","ideas that we","that we enshroud","we enshroud things","enshroud things ,","things , art",", art ,","art , consumption",", consumption ,","consumption , life",", life and","life and death","and death with","death with -","with -

{"title":"Black White","plot":"Frances, a traffic cop, is writing novels in her free time. When Dany, her good friend from the local bookstore is found burned, tared and feathered hanging from the Hollywood sign, and a drug addicted white supremacist homeless person gets arrested for the murder shortly after, Frances switches her pen for the gun. She doubts the \"hate crime\" explanation and sets out to find the truth. When she investigates at Dany's former workplace, she meets Lee, a young man who just quit the army service. She finds out that Lee is on a mission too, and it is related to hers. The film is loosely inspired by Boris Vian's scandalous bestseller \"I shall spit on your graves\"(1946).","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Franc",",","a","traffic","cop",",","is","write","novel","in","her","free","time",".","When","Dani",",","her","good","friend","from","the","local","bookstor","is","found","burn",",","tare","and","feather","hang","from","the","Hollywood","sign",",","and","a","drug","addict","white","supremacist","homeless","person","get","arrest","for","the","murder","short","after",",","Franc","switch","her","pen","for","the","gun",".","She","doubt","the","\"","hate","crime","\"","explan","and","set","out","to","find","the","truth",".","When","she","investig","at","Dani","'s","former","workplac",",","she","meet","Lee",",","a","young","man","who","just","quit","the","armi","servic",".","She","find","out","that","Lee","is","on","a","mission","too",",","and","it","is","relat","to","her",".","The","film","is","loos","inspir","by","Bori","Vian","'s","scandal","bestsel","\"","I","shall","spit","on","your","grave","\"","(","1946",")","."],"lemmas":["Frances",",","a","traffic","cop",",","be","write","novel","in","she","free","time",".","when","Dany",",","she","good","friend","from","the","local","bookstore","be","find","burned",",","tared","and","feathered","hanging","from","the","Hollywood","sign",",","and","a","drug","addict","white","supremacist","homeless","person","get","arrest","for","the","murder","shortly","after",",","Frances","switch","she","pen","for","the","gun",".","she","doubt","the","``","hate","crime","''","explanation","and","set","out","to","find","the","truth",".","when","she","investigate","at","Dany","'s","former","workplace",",","she","meet","Lee",",","a","young","man","who","just","quit","the","army","service",".","she","find","out","that","Lee","be","on","a","mission","too",",","and","it","be","related","to","hers",".","the","film","be","loosely","inspire","by","Boris","Vian","'s","scandalous","bestseller","``","I","shall","spit","on","you","grave","''","-lrb-","1946","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Frances

{"title":"The Merging of Dance and Cinema: The Process","plot":"Eleven years after the shoot of the critically acclaimed film 'Ashes of God', the directors share their thoughts on the creative process behind the project. The film documents how scenes appeared in the rehearsal room (through structured improvisation, choreographic stimuli and character research), and how these scenes evolved in contact with the locations: the ruins of an 18th century roundhouse roundhouse, a ghost town. The adverse conditions (cold temperatures, dust, long working hours) elevated cast and crew into a state of risk taking, letting-go and creative focus beyond fatigue. New scenes emerged on site, creating a jigsaw of elements of poetic, non-linear narrative (based on Ovid's classic poem Metamorphoses), akin to the process of devised theater.","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"Brda 21000 Split","plot":"Hills Village 21000 Split is a documentary which in a Fellini style represents the inhabitants of an unusual neighbourhood. We encounter a dentist and writer, a tired ex-boxer who had a carrier in Germany, a hardcore punk band Pas Maters, whose charismatic front man and lead singer mysteriously disappeared, an old soccer supporter with the last name Hajduk, an ex-hooligan diligently studying in a night school and many others. A complex portrait of an unusual Split neighbourhood and its even more unusual inhabitants with Hajduk as their religion.","genres":["Action"," Comedy"," Adventure"],"stems":["Hill","Villag","21000","Split","is","a","documentari","which","in","a","Fellini","style","repres","the","inhabit","of","an","unusu","neighbourhood",".","We","encount","a","dentist","and","writer",",","a","tire","ex-box","who","had","a","carrier","in","Germani",",","a","hardcor","punk","band","Pas","Mater",",","whose","charismat","front","man","and","lead","singer","mysteri","disappear",",","an","old","soccer","support","with","the","last","name","Hajduk",",","an","ex-hooligan","dilig","studi","in","a","night","school","and","mani","other",".","A","complex","portrait","of","an","unusu","Split","neighbourhood","and","it","even","more","unusu","inhabit","with","Hajduk","as","their","religion","."],"lemmas":["Hills","Village","21000","Split","be","a","documentary","which","in","a","Fellini","style","represent","the","inhabitant","of","a","unusual","neighbourhood",".","we","encounter","a","dentist","and","writer",",","a","tired","ex-boxer","who","have","a","carrier","in","Germany",",","a","hardcore","punk","band","Pas","Maters",",","whose","charismatic","front","man","and","lead","singer","mysteriously","disappear",",","a","old","soccer","supporter","with","the","last","name","Hajduk",",","a","ex-hooligan","diligently","study","in","a","night","school","and","many","other",".","a","complex","portrait","of","a","unusual","split","neighbourhood","and","its","even","more","unusual","inhabitant","with","Hajduk","as","they","religion","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Hills Village 21000","Village 21000 Split","21000 Split is","Split is a","is a documentary","a documentary which","documentary which in","which in a","in a Fellini","a Fellini style","Fellini style represents","style represents the","represents the inhabitants","the inhabitants of","inhabitants of an","of an unusual","an unusual neighbourhood","We encounter a","encounter a dentist","a dentist and","dentist and writer","and writer ,","writer , a",", a tired","a tired ex-boxer","tired ex-boxer who","ex-boxer who had","who had a","had a carrier","a carrier in","carrier in Germany","in Germany ,","Germany , a",", a hardcore","a hardcore punk","hardcore punk band","punk band Pas","band Pas Maters","Pas Maters ,","Maters , whose",", whose charismatic","whose charismatic front","charismatic front man","front man and","man and lead","and lead singer","lead singer mysteriously","singer mysteriously disappeared","mysteriously disappeared ,","disappeared , an",", an old","an old soccer","old soccer supporter","soccer supporter with","supporter with the","with the last","the last name","last name Hajduk","name Hajduk ,","Hajduk , an",", an ex-hooligan","an ex-hooligan diligently","ex-hooligan diligently studying","diligently studying in","studying in a","in a night","a night school","night school and","school and many","and many others","A complex portrait","complex portrait of","portrait of an","of an unusual","an unusual Split","unusual Split neighbourhood","Split neighbourhood and","neighbourhood and its","and its even","its even more","even more unusual","more unusual inhabitants","unusual inhabitants with","inhabitants with Hajduk","with Hajduk as","Hajduk as their","as their religion"],"2grams":["Hills Village","Village 21000","21000 Split","Split is","is a","a documentary","documentary which","which in","in a","a Fellini","Fellini style","style represents","represents the","the inhabitants","inhabitants of","of an","an unusual","unusual neighbourhood","We encounter","encounter a","a dentist","dentist and","and writer","writer ,",", a","a tired","tired ex-boxer","ex-boxer who","who had","had a","a carrier","carrier in","in Germany","Germany ,",", a","a hardcore","hardcore punk","punk band","band Pas","Pas Maters","Maters ,",", whose","whose charismatic","charismatic front","front man","man and","and lead","lead singer","singer mysteriously","mysteriously disappeared","disappeared ,",", an","an old","old soccer","soccer supporter","supporter with","with the","the last","last name","name Hajduk","Hajduk ,",", an","an ex-hooligan","ex-hooligan diligently","diligently studying","studying in","in a","a night","night school","school and","and many","many others","A complex","complex portrait","portrait of","of an","an unusual","unusual Split","Split neighbourhood","neighbourhood and","and its","its even","even more","more unusual","unusual inhabitants","inhabitants with","with Hajduk","Hajduk as","as their","their religion"]}

{"title":"I Think I Love My Wife","plot":"Brenda wears comfortable, cotton panties; Nikki wears sheer, lacy thongs. Richard Cooper is in the middle, with a good job in Manhattan, a house in the suburbs, and two cute children with Brenda, his intelligent, good-looking wife who's a teacher. But there's no sex in this seven-year marriage, so Richard's bored. Into the mix walks Nikki, a sexy, sassy, single friend he's not seen in years. Nikki has problems and finds a reason to stop at his office every day. He tries to help, they have some fun, and he doesn't mention Nikki to Brenda. His work and reputation suffer. Is he about to scratch the seven year itch? What choices does Richard have?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Brenda","wear","comfort",",","cotton","panti",";","Nikki","wear","sheer",",","laci","thong",".","Richard","Cooper","is","in","the","middl",",","with","a","good","job","in","Manhattan",",","a","hous","in","the","suburb",",","and","two","cute","children","with","Brenda",",","his","intellig",",","good-look","wife","who","'s","a","teacher",".","But","there","'s","no","sex","in","this","seven-year","marriag",",","so","Richard","'s","bore",".","Into","the","mix","walk","Nikki",",","a","sexi",",","sassi",",","singl","friend","he","'s","not","seen","in","year",".","Nikki","has","problem","and","find","a","reason","to","stop","at","his","offic","everi","day",".","He","tri","to","help",",","they","have","some","fun",",","and","he","doe","n't","mention","Nikki","to","Brenda",".","His","work","and","reput","suffer",".","Is","he","about","to","scratch","the","seven","year","itch","?","What","choic","doe","Richard","have","?"],"lemmas":["Brenda","wear","comfortable",",","cotton","panties",";","Nikki","wear","sheer",",","lacy","thong",".","Richard","Cooper","be","in","the","middle",",","with","a","good","job","in","Manhattan",",","a","house","in","the","suburb",",","and","two","cute","child","with","Brenda",",","he","intelligent",",","good-looking","wife","who","be","a","teacher",".","but","there","be","no","sex","in","this","seven-year","marriage",",","so","Richard","'s","bore",".","Into","the","mix","walk","Nikki",",","a","sexy",",","sassy",",","single","friend","he","be","not","see","in","year",".","Nikki","have","problem","and","find","a","reason","to","stop","at","he","office","every","day",".","he","try","to","help",",","they","have","some","fun",",","and","he","do","not","mention","Nikki","to","Brenda",".","he","work","and","reputation","suffer",".","be","he","about","to","scratch","the","seven","year","itch","?","what","choice","do","Richard","have","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Brenda wears comfortable","wears comfortable ,","comfortable , cotton",", cotton panties","cotton panties ;","panties ;

{"title":"Happy-Go-Lucky","plot":"Poppy Cross is happy-go-lucky. At 30, she lives in Camden: cheeky, playful, frank while funny, and talkative to strangers. She's a conscientious and exuberant primary-school teacher, flatmates with Zoe, her long-time friend; she's close to one sister, and not so close to another. In this slice of life story, we watch her take driving lessons from Scott, a dour and tightly-wound instructor, take classes in flamenco dance from a fiery Spaniard, encounter a tramp in the night, and sort out a student's aggressive behavior with a social worker's help. Along the way, we wonder if her open attitude puts her at risk of misunderstanding or worse. What is the root of happiness?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Poppi","Cross","is","happy-go-lucki",".","At","30",",","she","live","in","Camden",":","cheeki",",","play",",","frank","while","funni",",","and","talkat","to","stranger",".","She","'s","a","conscienti","and","exuber","primary-school","teacher",",","flatmat","with","Zoe",",","her","long-tim","friend",";","she","'s","close","to","one","sister",",","and","not","so","close","to","anoth",".","In","this","slice","of","life","stori",",","we","watch","her","take","drive","lesson","from","Scott",",","a","dour","and","tightly-wound","instructor",",","take","class","in","flamenco","danc","from","a","fieri","Spaniard",",","encount","a","tramp","in","the","night",",","and","sort","out","a","student","'s","aggress","behavior","with","a","social","worker","'s","help",".","Along","the","way",",","we","wonder","if","her","open","attitud","put","her","at","risk","of","misunderstand","or","wors",".","What","is","the","root","of","happi","?"],"lemmas":["Poppy","Cross","be","happy-go-lucky",".","at","30",",","she","live","in","Camden",":","cheeky",",","playful",",","frank","while","funny",",","and","talkative","to","stranger",".","she","be","a","conscientious","and","exuberant","primary-school","teacher",",","flatmate","with","zoe",",","she","long-time","friend",";","she","be","close","to","one","sister",",","and","not","so","close","to","another",".","in","this","slice","of","life","story",",","we","watch","she","take","driving","lesson","from","Scott",",","a","dour","and","tightly-wound","instructor",",","take","class","in","flamenco","dance","from","a","fiery","spaniard",",","encounter","a","tramp","in","the","night",",","and","sort","out","a","student","'s","aggressive","behavior","with","a","social","worker","'s","help",".","along","the","way",",","we","wonder","if","she","open","attitude","put","she","at","risk","of","misunderstanding","or","worse",".","what","be","the","root","of","happiness","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Poppy Cross is","Cross is happy-go-lucky","At 30 ,","30 , she",", she lives","she lives in","lives in Camden","in Camden :","Camden : cheeky",": cheeky ,","cheeky , playful",", playful ,","playful , frank",", frank while","frank while funny","while funny ,","funny , and",", and talkative","and talkative to","talkative to strangers","She 's a","'s a conscientious","a conscientious and","conscientious and exuberant","and exuberant primary-school","exuberant primary-school teacher","primary-school teacher ,","teacher , flatmates",", flatmates with","flatmates with Zoe","with Zoe ,","Zoe , her",", her long-time","her long-time friend","long-time friend ;","friend ;

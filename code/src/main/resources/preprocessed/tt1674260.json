{"title":"Cut Poison Burn","plot":"The Film tells the grim tale of the half century War on Cancer and focuses on the character of Thomas Navarro. In 1999, the four year old boy was diagnosed with brain cancer and thrust into the system of Surgery, Chemo and Radiation and not allowed to be treated with a proven method by Texas Doctor Stanislaw Burzynski. The war between the Navarro Family and the FDA is perhaps this country's greatest evidence as to why there should be medical freedom and how since the War on Cancer began in 1971, the war is still failing in 2009.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["The","Film","tell","the","grim","tale","of","the","half","centuri","War","on","Cancer","and","focus","on","the","charact","of","Thoma","Navarro",".","In","1999",",","the","four","year","old","boy","was","diagnos","with","brain","cancer","and","thrust","into","the","system","of","Surgeri",",","Chemo","and","Radiat","and","not","allow","to","be","treat","with","a","proven","method","by","Texa","Doctor","Stanislaw","Burzynski",".","The","war","between","the","Navarro","Famili","and","the","FDA","is","perhap","this","countri","'s","greatest","evid","as","to","whi","there","should","be","medic","freedom","and","how","sinc","the","War","on","Cancer","began","in","1971",",","the","war","is","still","fail","in","2009","."],"lemmas":["the","Film","tell","the","grim","tale","of","the","half","century","War","on","Cancer","and","focus","on","the","character","of","Thomas","Navarro",".","in","1999",",","the","four","year","old","boy","be","diagnose","with","brain","cancer","and","thrust","into","the","system","of","Surgery",",","Chemo","and","Radiation","and","not","allow","to","be","treat","with","a","proven","method","by","Texas","Doctor","Stanislaw","Burzynski",".","the","war","between","the","Navarro","Family","and","the","FDA","be","perhaps","this","country","'s","greatest","evidence","as","to","why","there","should","be","medical","freedom","and","how","since","the","War","on","Cancer","begin","in","1971",",","the","war","be","still","fail","in","2009","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Film tells","Film tells the","tells the grim","the grim tale","grim tale of","tale of the","of the half","the half century","half century War","century War on","War on Cancer","on Cancer and","Cancer and focuses","and focuses on","focuses on the","on the character","the character of","character of Thomas","of Thomas Navarro","In 1999 ,","1999 , the",", the four","the four year","four year old","year old boy","old boy was","boy was diagnosed","was diagnosed with","diagnosed with brain","with brain cancer","brain cancer and","cancer and thrust","and thrust into","thrust into the","into the system","the system of","system of Surgery","of Surgery ,","Surgery , Chemo",", Chemo and","Chemo and Radiation","and Radiation and","Radiation and not","and not allowed","not allowed to","allowed to be","to be treated","be treated with","treated with a","with a proven","a proven method","proven method by","method by Texas","by Texas Doctor","Texas Doctor Stanislaw","Doctor Stanislaw Burzynski","The war between","war between the","between the Navarro","the Navarro Family","Navarro Family and","Family and the","and the FDA","the FDA is","FDA is perhaps","is perhaps this","perhaps this country","this country 's","country 's greatest","'s greatest evidence","greatest evidence as","evidence as to","as to why","to why there","why there should","there should be","should be medical","be medical freedom","medical freedom and","freedom and how","and how since","how since the","since the War","the War on","War on Cancer","on Cancer began","Cancer began in","began in 1971","in 1971 ,","1971 , the",", the war","the war is","war is still","is still failing","still failing in","failing in 2009"],"2grams":["The Film","Film tells","tells the","the grim","grim tale","tale of","of the","the half","half century","century War","War on","on Cancer","Cancer and","and focuses","focuses on","on the","the character","character of","of Thomas","Thomas Navarro","In 1999","1999 ,",", the","the four","four year","year old","old boy","boy was","was diagnosed","diagnosed with","with brain","brain cancer","cancer and","and thrust","thrust into","into the","the system","system of","of Surgery","Surgery ,",", Chemo","Chemo and","and Radiation","Radiation and","and not","not allowed","allowed to","to be","be treated","treated with","with a","a proven","proven method","method by","by Texas","Texas Doctor","Doctor Stanislaw","Stanislaw Burzynski","The war","war between","between the","the Navarro","Navarro Family","Family and","and the","the FDA","FDA is","is perhaps","perhaps this","this country","country 's","'s greatest","greatest evidence","evidence as","as to","to why","why there","there should","should be","be medical","medical freedom","freedom and","and how","how since","since the","the War","War on","on Cancer","Cancer began","began in","in 1971","1971 ,",", the","the war","war is","is still","still failing","failing in","in 2009"]}

{"title":"High Five: A Suburban Adoption Saga","plot":"Cathy and Martin Ward, a stereotypical North American suburban couple, fight for years to adopt five siblings from a remote Ukrainian orphanage. When they finally succeed, a new drama unfolds. A sensitive and emotional oldest girl Yuliya, who is eighteen, finds it unbearable to accept that the younger siblings don't need her care and protection any more. She forms much stronger bond with her adoptive father Martin than with Cathy, her adoptive mother, and rebels against suburban values. Yuliya's struggle to find her place in a new family becomes an ultimate test of her adoptive parents' ability to love unconditionally.'","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Cathi","and","Martin","Ward",",","a","stereotyp","North","American","suburban","coupl",",","fight","for","year","to","adopt","five","sibl","from","a","remot","Ukrainian","orphanag",".","When","they","final","succeed",",","a","new","drama","unfold",".","A","sensit","and","emot","oldest","girl","yuliya",",","who","is","eighteen",",","find","it","unbear","to","accept","that","the","younger","sibl","do","n't","need","her","care","and","protect","ani","more",".","She","form","much","stronger","bond","with","her","adopt","father","Martin","than","with","Cathi",",","her","adopt","mother",",","and","rebel","against","suburban","valu",".","yuliya","'s","struggl","to","find","her","place","in","a","new","famili","becom","an","ultim","test","of","her","adopt","parent","'","abil","to","love","uncondit",".","'"],"lemmas":["Cathy","and","Martin","Ward",",","a","stereotypical","north","american","suburban","couple",",","fight","for","year","to","adopt","five","sibling","from","a","remote","ukrainian","orphanage",".","when","they","finally","succeed",",","a","new","drama","unfold",".","a","sensitive","and","emotional","oldest","girl","Yuliya",",","who","be","eighteen",",","find","it","unbearable","to","accept","that","the","younger","sibling","do","not","need","she","care","and","protection","any","more",".","she","form","much","stronger","bond","with","she","adoptive","father","Martin","than","with","Cathy",",","she","adoptive","mother",",","and","rebel","against","suburban","value",".","Yuliya","'s","struggle","to","find","she","place","in","a","new","family","become","a","ultimate","test","of","she","adoptive","parent","'","ability","to","love","unconditionally",".","'"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cathy and Martin","and Martin Ward","Martin Ward ,","Ward , a",", a stereotypical","a stereotypical North","stereotypical North American","North American suburban","American suburban couple","suburban couple ,","couple , fight",", fight for","fight for years","for years to","years to adopt","to adopt five","adopt five siblings","five siblings from","siblings from a","from a remote","a remote Ukrainian","remote Ukrainian orphanage","When they finally","they finally succeed","finally succeed ,","succeed , a",", a new","a new drama","new drama unfolds","A sensitive and","sensitive and emotional","and emotional oldest","emotional oldest girl","oldest girl Yuliya","girl Yuliya ,","Yuliya , who",", who is","who is eighteen","is eighteen ,","eighteen , finds",", finds it","finds it unbearable","it unbearable to","unbearable to accept","to accept that","accept that the","that the younger","the younger siblings","younger siblings do","siblings do n't","do n't need","n't need her","need her care","her care and","care and protection","and protection any","protection any more","She forms much","forms much stronger","much stronger bond","stronger bond with","bond with her","with her adoptive","her adoptive father","adoptive father Martin","father Martin than","Martin than with","than with Cathy","with Cathy ,","Cathy , her",", her adoptive","her adoptive mother","adoptive mother ,","mother , and",", and rebels","and rebels against","rebels against suburban","against suburban values","Yuliya 's struggle","'s struggle to","struggle to find","to find her","find her place","her place in","place in a","in a new","a new family","new family becomes","family becomes an","becomes an ultimate","an ultimate test","ultimate test of","test of her","of her adoptive","her adoptive parents","adoptive parents '","parents ' ability","' ability to","ability to love","to love unconditionally","love unconditionally .","unconditionally .

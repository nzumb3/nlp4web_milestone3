{"title":"The Californians","plot":"Slick, smug developer Gavin Ransom has a dream: make millions by blanketing the coastal hills of northern California with flamboyant, mini mansions. His sister Olive a raving environmentalist, thinks otherwise, and aims to stop her brother's land gobbling plans. When Zoe Tripp a striking beautiful folk singer, joins Olive's cause, Gavin gets thrown for a loop, falling hard for the striking young woman with the golden voice. Caught between Olive's righteousness and Gavin's affection, the idealistic and innocent Zoe, coached by her parents and a maternal environmentalist must choose between a cause she's grown up supporting, or the affections of a man who stands for everything she believes is wrong.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Slick",",","smug","develop","Gavin","Ransom","has","a","dream",":","make","million","by","blanket","the","coastal","hill","of","northern","California","with","flamboy",",","mini","mansion",".","His","sister","Olive","a","rave","environmentalist",",","think","otherwis",",","and","aim","to","stop","her","brother","'s","land","gobbl","plan",".","When","Zoe","Tripp","a","strike","beauti","folk","singer",",","join","Olive","'s","caus",",","Gavin","get","thrown","for","a","loop",",","fall","hard","for","the","strike","young","woman","with","the","golden","voic",".","Caught","between","Olive","'s","righteous","and","Gavin","'s","affect",",","the","idealist","and","innoc","Zoe",",","coach","by","her","parent","and","a","matern","environmentalist","must","choos","between","a","caus","she","'s","grown","up","support",",","or","the","affect","of","a","man","who","stand","for","everyth","she","believ","is","wrong","."],"lemmas":["slick",",","smug","developer","Gavin","Ransom","have","a","dream",":","make","million","by","blanket","the","coastal","hill","of","northern","California","with","flamboyant",",","mini","mansion",".","he","sister","Olive","a","raving","environmentalist",",","think","otherwise",",","and","aim","to","stop","she","brother","'s","land","gobbling","plan",".","when","Zoe","Tripp","a","striking","beautiful","folk","singer",",","join","Olive","'s","cause",",","Gavin","get","throw","for","a","loop",",","fall","hard","for","the","striking","young","woman","with","the","golden","voice",".","Caught","between","Olive","'s","righteousness","and","Gavin","'s","affection",",","the","idealistic","and","innocent","zoe",",","coach","by","she","parent","and","a","maternal","environmentalist","must","choose","between","a","cause","she","be","grow","up","supporting",",","or","the","affection","of","a","man","who","stand","for","everything","she","believe","be","wrong","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Slick

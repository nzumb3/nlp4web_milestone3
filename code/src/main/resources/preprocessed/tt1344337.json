{"title":"Reuniting the Rubins","plot":"An up-tight lawyer, Lenny Rubin, (Timothy Spall), has to put his dream retirement on hold when his ailing mother (Honor Blackman) emotionally blackmails him into reuniting his estranged children for a Jewish holiday. They may be peas from the same pod, but in Lenny's eyes, his grown-up children are certainly not even from the same planet: a ruthless control-freak and hard-nosed capitalist, an outspoken, argumentative eco-warrior committed to the cause, an outer-worldly Buddhist Monk; and to cap it all, a bible bashing born-again Rabbi. While they might quarrel, fight, and perhaps even be starting a war in Africa, they are still family. It is going to take a whole lot of soul-searching and sacrifice for everyone to come together in this comic drama.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["An","up-tight","lawyer",",","Lenni","Rubin",",","(","Timothi","Spall",")",",","has","to","put","his","dream","retir","on","hold","when","his","ail","mother","(","Honor","Blackman",")","emot","blackmail","him","into","reunit","his","estrang","children","for","a","Jewish","holiday",".","They","may","be","pea","from","the","same","pod",",","but","in","Lenni","'s","eye",",","his","grown-up","children","are","certain","not","even","from","the","same","planet",":","a","ruthless","control-freak","and","hard-nos","capitalist",",","an","outspoken",",","argument","eco-warrior","commit","to","the","caus",",","an","outer-world","Buddhist","Monk",";","and","to","cap","it","all",",","a","bibl","bash","born-again","Rabbi",".","While","they","might","quarrel",",","fight",",","and","perhap","even","be","start","a","war","in","Africa",",","they","are","still","famili",".","It","is","go","to","take","a","whole","lot","of","soul-search","and","sacrific","for","everyon","to","come","togeth","in","this","comic","drama","."],"lemmas":["a","up-tight","lawyer",",","Lenny","Rubin",",","-lrb-","Timothy","Spall","-rrb-",",","have","to","put","he","dream","retirement","on","hold","when","he","ailing","mother","-lrb-","honor","blackman","-rrb-","emotionally","blackmail","he","into","reunite","he","estrange","child","for","a","jewish","holiday",".","they","may","be","pea","from","the","same","pod",",","but","in","Lenny","'s","eye",",","he","grown-up","child","be","certainly","not","even","from","the","same","planet",":","a","ruthless","control-freak","and","hard-nosed","capitalist",",","a","outspoken",",","argumentative","eco-warrior","commit","to","the","cause",",","a","outer-worldly","Buddhist","Monk",";","and","to","cap","it","all",",","a","bible","bash","born-again","rabbi",".","while","they","might","quarrel",",","fight",",","and","perhaps","even","be","start","a","war","in","Africa",",","they","be","still","family",".","it","be","go","to","take","a","whole","lot","of","soul-searching","and","sacrifice","for","everyone","to","come","together","in","this","comic","drama","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An up-tight lawyer","up-tight lawyer ,","lawyer , Lenny",", Lenny Rubin","Lenny Rubin ,","Rubin , (",", ( Timothy","( Timothy Spall","Timothy Spall )","Spall ) ,",") , has",", has to","has to put","to put his","put his dream","his dream retirement","dream retirement on","retirement on hold","on hold when","hold when his","when his ailing","his ailing mother","ailing mother (","mother ( Honor","( Honor Blackman","Honor Blackman )","Blackman ) emotionally",") emotionally blackmails","emotionally blackmails him","blackmails him into","him into reuniting","into reuniting his","reuniting his estranged","his estranged children","estranged children for","children for a","for a Jewish","a Jewish holiday","They may be","may be peas","be peas from","peas from the","from the same","the same pod","same pod ,","pod , but",", but in","but in Lenny","in Lenny 's","Lenny 's eyes","'s eyes ,","eyes , his",", his grown-up","his grown-up children","grown-up children are","children are certainly","are certainly not","certainly not even","not even from","even from the","from the same","the same planet","same planet :","planet : a",": a ruthless","a ruthless control-freak","ruthless control-freak and","control-freak and hard-nosed","and hard-nosed capitalist","hard-nosed capitalist ,","capitalist , an",", an outspoken","an outspoken ,","outspoken , argumentative",", argumentative eco-warrior","argumentative eco-warrior committed","eco-warrior committed to","committed to the","to the cause","the cause ,","cause , an",", an outer-worldly","an outer-worldly Buddhist","outer-worldly Buddhist Monk","Buddhist Monk ;","Monk ;

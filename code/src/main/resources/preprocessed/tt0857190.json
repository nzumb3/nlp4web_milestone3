{"title":"The Sweeney","plot":"Jack Regan is a slobbish, old style cop whose unsubtle methods usually get results, to the annoyance of internal affairs officer Lewis, who would be even more annoyed if he knew that Regan was having an affair with his young wife, policewoman Nancy. After Regan disobeys orders and a shoot-out in central London following a bank hold-up ends in carnage, he is stripped of office and briefly imprisoned. However, thanks to the loyalty of his young protege George Carter and a little string pulling from his superior Frank Haskins, Regan is released to bring down the villains in a gun battle at Gravesend marina, ensuring the continued existence of his department - the Sweeney.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Jack","Regan","is","a","slobbish",",","old","style","cop","whose","unsubtl","method","usual","get","result",",","to","the","annoy","of","intern","affair","offic","Lewi",",","who","would","be","even","more","annoy","if","he","knew","that","Regan","was","have","an","affair","with","his","young","wife",",","policewoman","Nanci",".","After","Regan","disobey","order","and","a","shoot-out","in","central","London","follow","a","bank","hold-up","end","in","carnag",",","he","is","strip","of","offic","and","briefli","imprison",".","Howev",",","thank","to","the","loyalti","of","his","young","proteg","Georg","Carter","and","a","littl","string","pull","from","his","superior","Frank","Haskin",",","Regan","is","releas","to","bring","down","the","villain","in","a","gun","battl","at","Gravesend","marina",",","ensur","the","continu","exist","of","his","depart","-","the","Sweeney","."],"lemmas":["Jack","Regan","be","a","slobbish",",","old","style","cop","whose","unsubtle","method","usually","get","result",",","to","the","annoyance","of","internal","affair","officer","Lewis",",","who","would","be","even","more","annoyed","if","he","know","that","Regan","be","have","a","affair","with","he","young","wife",",","policewoman","Nancy",".","after","Regan","disobey","order","and","a","shoot-out","in","central","London","follow","a","bank","hold-up","end","in","carnage",",","he","be","strip","of","office","and","briefly","imprison",".","however",",","thanks","to","the","loyalty","of","he","young","protege","George","Carter","and","a","little","string","pull","from","he","superior","Frank","Haskins",",","Regan","be","release","to","bring","down","the","villain","in","a","gun","battle","at","gravesend","marina",",","ensure","the","continued","existence","of","he","department","-","the","Sweeney","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jack Regan is","Regan is a","is a slobbish","a slobbish ,","slobbish , old",", old style","old style cop","style cop whose","cop whose unsubtle","whose unsubtle methods","unsubtle methods usually","methods usually get","usually get results","get results ,","results , to",", to the","to the annoyance","the annoyance of","annoyance of internal","of internal affairs","internal affairs officer","affairs officer Lewis","officer Lewis ,","Lewis , who",", who would","who would be","would be even","be even more","even more annoyed","more annoyed if","annoyed if he","if he knew","he knew that","knew that Regan","that Regan was","Regan was having","was having an","having an affair","an affair with","affair with his","with his young","his young wife","young wife ,","wife , policewoman",", policewoman Nancy","After Regan disobeys","Regan disobeys orders","disobeys orders and","orders and a","and a shoot-out","a shoot-out in","shoot-out in central","in central London","central London following","London following a","following a bank","a bank hold-up","bank hold-up ends","hold-up ends in","ends in carnage","in carnage ,","carnage , he",", he is","he is stripped","is stripped of","stripped of office","of office and","office and briefly","and briefly imprisoned","However , thanks",", thanks to","thanks to the","to the loyalty","the loyalty of","loyalty of his","of his young","his young protege","young protege George","protege George Carter","George Carter and","Carter and a","and a little","a little string","little string pulling","string pulling from","pulling from his","from his superior","his superior Frank","superior Frank Haskins","Frank Haskins ,","Haskins , Regan",", Regan is","Regan is released","is released to","released to bring","to bring down","bring down the","down the villains","the villains in","villains in a","in a gun","a gun battle","gun battle at","battle at Gravesend","at Gravesend marina","Gravesend marina ,","marina , ensuring",", ensuring the","ensuring the continued","the continued existence","continued existence of","existence of his","of his department","his department -","department -

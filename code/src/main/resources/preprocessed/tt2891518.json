{"title":"The Black Fatherhood Project","plot":"First-time filmmaker Jordan Thierry offers context and conversation in this honest exploration of fatherhood in Black America. Through a telling of his own story and interviews with historians, he traces the roots of the fatherless Black home and reveals a history much more complex and profound than is often told. Putting that history into perspective is a dialogue among fathers discussing their experiences, inspirations, and insight on how communities can come together to ensure the power of a father's love is not lost on America's Black children.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["First-tim","filmmak","Jordan","Thierri","offer","context","and","convers","in","this","honest","explor","of","fatherhood","in","Black","America",".","Through","a","tell","of","his","own","stori","and","interview","with","historian",",","he","trace","the","root","of","the","fatherless","Black","home","and","reveal","a","histori","much","more","complex","and","profound","than","is","often","told",".","Put","that","histori","into","perspect","is","a","dialogu","among","father","discuss","their","experi",",","inspir",",","and","insight","on","how","communiti","can","come","togeth","to","ensur","the","power","of","a","father","'s","love","is","not","lost","on","America","'s","Black","children","."],"lemmas":["first-time","filmmaker","Jordan","Thierry","offer","context","and","conversation","in","this","honest","exploration","of","fatherhood","in","Black","America",".","through","a","tell","of","he","own","story","and","interview","with","historian",",","he","trace","the","root","of","the","fatherless","Black","home","and","reveal","a","history","much","more","complex","and","profound","than","be","often","tell",".","put","that","history","into","perspective","be","a","dialogue","among","father","discuss","they","experience",",","inspiration",",","and","insight","on","how","community","can","come","together","to","ensure","the","power","of","a","father","'s","love","be","not","lose","on","America","'s","Black","child","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["First-time filmmaker Jordan","filmmaker Jordan Thierry","Jordan Thierry offers","Thierry offers context","offers context and","context and conversation","and conversation in","conversation in this","in this honest","this honest exploration","honest exploration of","exploration of fatherhood","of fatherhood in","fatherhood in Black","in Black America","Through a telling","a telling of","telling of his","of his own","his own story","own story and","story and interviews","and interviews with","interviews with historians","with historians ,","historians , he",", he traces","he traces the","traces the roots","the roots of","roots of the","of the fatherless","the fatherless Black","fatherless Black home","Black home and","home and reveals","and reveals a","reveals a history","a history much","history much more","much more complex","more complex and","complex and profound","and profound than","profound than is","than is often","is often told","Putting that history","that history into","history into perspective","into perspective is","perspective is a","is a dialogue","a dialogue among","dialogue among fathers","among fathers discussing","fathers discussing their","discussing their experiences","their experiences ,","experiences , inspirations",", inspirations ,","inspirations , and",", and insight","and insight on","insight on how","on how communities","how communities can","communities can come","can come together","come together to","together to ensure","to ensure the","ensure the power","the power of","power of a","of a father","a father 's","father 's love","'s love is","love is not","is not lost","not lost on","lost on America","on America 's","America 's Black","'s Black children"],"2grams":["First-time filmmaker","filmmaker Jordan","Jordan Thierry","Thierry offers","offers context","context and","and conversation","conversation in","in this","this honest","honest exploration","exploration of","of fatherhood","fatherhood in","in Black","Black America","Through a","a telling","telling of","of his","his own","own story","story and","and interviews","interviews with","with historians","historians ,",", he","he traces","traces the","the roots","roots of","of the","the fatherless","fatherless Black","Black home","home and","and reveals","reveals a","a history","history much","much more","more complex","complex and","and profound","profound than","than is","is often","often told","Putting that","that history","history into","into perspective","perspective is","is a","a dialogue","dialogue among","among fathers","fathers discussing","discussing their","their experiences","experiences ,",", inspirations","inspirations ,",", and","and insight","insight on","on how","how communities","communities can","can come","come together","together to","to ensure","ensure the","the power","power of","of a","a father","father 's","'s love","love is","is not","not lost","lost on","on America","America 's","'s Black","Black children"]}

{"title":"Still Here: A Journey to Triumph","plot":"An inspiring and dedicated group of African Canadian teens retrace the path of their ancestors' journey which lead them to the US from Africa, and from the US to their final resting place in Nova Scotia, Canada. They were the forgotten Americans; former slaves and free blacks who left the US in the 17 and 1800's in hopes of a better life in Canada. Instead, they were unprepared for what met them when they landed on the shores of Nova Scotia. The youth incorporate multiple artistic disciplines; including poetry, song, narration, African drumming and re-enactments to weave this powerful story.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["An","inspir","and","dedic","group","of","African","Canadian","teen","retrac","the","path","of","their","ancestor","'","journey","which","lead","them","to","the","US","from","Africa",",","and","from","the","US","to","their","final","rest","place","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada",".","They","were","the","forgotten","American",";","former","slave","and","free","black","who","left","the","US","in","the","17","and","1800","'s","in","hope","of","a","better","life","in","Canada",".","Instead",",","they","were","unprepar","for","what","met","them","when","they","land","on","the","shore","of","Nova","Scotia",".","The","youth","incorpor","multipl","artist","disciplin",";","includ","poetri",",","song",",","narrat",",","African","drum","and","re-enact","to","weav","this","power","stori","."],"lemmas":["a","inspiring","and","dedicated","group","of","african","canadian","teens","retrace","the","path","of","they","ancestor","'","journey","which","lead","they","to","the","US","from","Africa",",","and","from","the","US","to","they","final","rest","place","in","Nova","Scotia",",","Canada",".","they","be","the","forget","Americans",";","former","slave","and","free","black","who","leave","the","US","in","the","17","and","1800","'s","in","hope","of","a","better","life","in","Canada",".","instead",",","they","be","unprepared","for","what","meet","they","when","they","land","on","the","shore","of","Nova","Scotia",".","the","youth","incorporate","multiple","artistic","discipline",";","include","poetry",",","song",",","narration",",","African","drum","and","re-enactment","to","weave","this","powerful","story","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An inspiring and","inspiring and dedicated","and dedicated group","dedicated group of","group of African","of African Canadian","African Canadian teens","Canadian teens retrace","teens retrace the","retrace the path","the path of","path of their","of their ancestors","their ancestors '","ancestors ' journey","' journey which","journey which lead","which lead them","lead them to","them to the","to the US","the US from","US from Africa","from Africa ,","Africa , and",", and from","and from the","from the US","the US to","US to their","to their final","their final resting","final resting place","resting place in","place in Nova","in Nova Scotia","Nova Scotia ,","Scotia , Canada","They were the","were the forgotten","the forgotten Americans","forgotten Americans ;","Americans ;

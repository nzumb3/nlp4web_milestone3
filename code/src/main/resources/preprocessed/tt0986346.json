{"title":"Commit.","plot":"Two strangers meet at a coffee shop for what seems like a blind date. But as the conversation progresses, it becomes clear that this couple, who have never seen each other face to face and who met on the Internet, have actually formed a suicide pact. Problems arise when the couple realizes that they may have finally found something worth living for. Comprised of three continuous takes-one take for each act-and shot over the course of two days, Commit is witty and disturbing, as well as an inspirational achievement in independent filmmaking.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","stranger","meet","at","a","coffe","shop","for","what","seem","like","a","blind","date",".","But","as","the","convers","progress",",","it","becom","clear","that","this","coupl",",","who","have","never","seen","each","other","face","to","face","and","who","met","on","the","Internet",",","have","actual","form","a","suicid","pact",".","Problem","aris","when","the","coupl","realiz","that","they","may","have","final","found","someth","worth","live","for",".","Compris","of","three","continu","takes-on","take","for","each","act-and","shot","over","the","cours","of","two","day",",","Commit","is","witti","and","disturb",",","as","well","as","an","inspir","achiev","in","independ","filmmak","."],"lemmas":["two","stranger","meet","at","a","coffee","shop","for","what","seem","like","a","blind","date",".","but","as","the","conversation","progress",",","it","become","clear","that","this","couple",",","who","have","never","see","each","other","face","to","face","and","who","meet","on","the","Internet",",","have","actually","form","a","suicide","pact",".","problem","arise","when","the","couple","realize","that","they","may","have","finally","find","something","worth","live","for",".","comprise","of","three","continuous","takes-one","take","for","each","act-and","shot","over","the","course","of","two","day",",","commit","be","witty","and","disturbing",",","as","well","as","a","inspirational","achievement","in","independent","filmmaking","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Two strangers meet","strangers meet at","meet at a","at a coffee","a coffee shop","coffee shop for","shop for what","for what seems","what seems like","seems like a","like a blind","a blind date","But as the","as the conversation","the conversation progresses","conversation progresses ,","progresses , it",", it becomes","it becomes clear","becomes clear that","clear that this","that this couple","this couple ,","couple , who",", who have","who have never","have never seen","never seen each","seen each other","each other face","other face to","face to face","to face and","face and who","and who met","who met on","met on the","on the Internet","the Internet ,","Internet , have",", have actually","have actually formed","actually formed a","formed a suicide","a suicide pact","Problems arise when","arise when the","when the couple","the couple realizes","couple realizes that","realizes that they","that they may","they may have","may have finally","have finally found","finally found something","found something worth","something worth living","worth living for","Comprised of three","of three continuous","three continuous takes-one","continuous takes-one take","takes-one take for","take for each","for each act-and","each act-and shot","act-and shot over","shot over the","over the course","the course of","course of two","of two days","two days ,","days , Commit",", Commit is","Commit is witty","is witty and","witty and disturbing","and disturbing ,","disturbing , as",", as well","as well as","well as an","as an inspirational","an inspirational achievement","inspirational achievement in","achievement in independent","in independent filmmaking"],"2grams":["Two strangers","strangers meet","meet at","at a","a coffee","coffee shop","shop for","for what","what seems","seems like","like a","a blind","blind date","But as","as the","the conversation","conversation progresses","progresses ,",", it","it becomes","becomes clear","clear that","that this","this couple","couple ,",", who","who have","have never","never seen","seen each","each other","other face","face to","to face","face and","and who","who met","met on","on the","the Internet","Internet ,",", have","have actually","actually formed","formed a","a suicide","suicide pact","Problems arise","arise when","when the","the couple","couple realizes","realizes that","that they","they may","may have","have finally","finally found","found something","something worth","worth living","living for","Comprised of","of three","three continuous","continuous takes-one","takes-one take","take for","for each","each act-and","act-and shot","shot over","over the","the course","course of","of two","two days","days ,",", Commit","Commit is","is witty","witty and","and disturbing","disturbing ,",", as","as well","well as","as an","an inspirational","inspirational achievement","achievement in","in independent","independent filmmaking"]}

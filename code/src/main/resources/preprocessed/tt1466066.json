{"title":"Rab Dian Rakhan","plot":"A Sikh by religion, Chandigarh-based Jaswant Singh, invites his father's wrath when he marries a Christian, Rita, and is asked to leave. Subsequently, he gets into trouble and is held in jail. Rita goes to Ajit Prasad to ask for help, but is instead sexually molested. Afraid to show her face to her husband, she re-locates, and gives birth to Sanjay. Years later Sanjay has grown up, is a post-graduate, and re-locates to Chandigarh to get employment. Rita does not know that her son will soon be beaten by Jaswant for sexually molesting a young Hindu widow, Sandhya, who beats up anyone, including elderly women; and is now on the pay-roll of Ajit.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["A","Sikh","by","religion",",","Chandigarh-bas","Jaswant","Singh",",","invit","his","father","'s","wrath","when","he","marri","a","Christian",",","Rita",",","and","is","ask","to","leav",".","Subsequ",",","he","get","into","troubl","and","is","held","in","jail",".","Rita","goe","to","Ajit","Prasad","to","ask","for","help",",","but","is","instead","sexual","molest",".","Afraid","to","show","her","face","to","her","husband",",","she","re-loc",",","and","give","birth","to","Sanjay",".","Year","later","Sanjay","has","grown","up",",","is","a","post-gradu",",","and","re-loc","to","Chandigarh","to","get","employ",".","Rita","doe","not","know","that","her","son","will","soon","be","beaten","by","Jaswant","for","sexual","molest","a","young","Hindu","widow",",","Sandhya",",","who","beat","up","anyon",",","includ","elder","women",";","and","is","now","on","the","pay-rol","of","Ajit","."],"lemmas":["a","sikh","by","religion",",","chandigarh-based","Jaswant","Singh",",","invite","he","father","'s","wrath","when","he","marry","a","Christian",",","Rita",",","and","be","ask","to","leave",".","subsequently",",","he","get","into","trouble","and","be","hold","in","jail",".","Rita","go","to","Ajit","Prasad","to","ask","for","help",",","but","be","instead","sexually","molest",".","afraid","to","show","she","face","to","she","husband",",","she","re-locate",",","and","give","birth","to","Sanjay",".","year","later","Sanjay","have","grow","up",",","be","a","post-graduate",",","and","re-locate","to","Chandigarh","to","get","employment",".","Rita","do","not","know","that","she","son","will","soon","be","beat","by","Jaswant","for","sexually","molest","a","young","Hindu","widow",",","Sandhya",",","who","beat","up","anyone",",","include","elderly","woman",";","and","be","now","on","the","pay-roll","of","Ajit","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A Sikh by","Sikh by religion","by religion ,","religion , Chandigarh-based",", Chandigarh-based Jaswant","Chandigarh-based Jaswant Singh","Jaswant Singh ,","Singh , invites",", invites his","invites his father","his father 's","father 's wrath","'s wrath when","wrath when he","when he marries","he marries a","marries a Christian","a Christian ,","Christian , Rita",", Rita ,","Rita , and",", and is","and is asked","is asked to","asked to leave","Subsequently , he",", he gets","he gets into","gets into trouble","into trouble and","trouble and is","and is held","is held in","held in jail","Rita goes to","goes to Ajit","to Ajit Prasad","Ajit Prasad to","Prasad to ask","to ask for","ask for help","for help ,","help , but",", but is","but is instead","is instead sexually","instead sexually molested","Afraid to show","to show her","show her face","her face to","face to her","to her husband","her husband ,","husband , she",", she re-locates","she re-locates ,","re-locates , and",", and gives","and gives birth","gives birth to","birth to Sanjay","Years later Sanjay","later Sanjay has","Sanjay has grown","has grown up","grown up ,","up , is",", is a","is a post-graduate","a post-graduate ,","post-graduate , and",", and re-locates","and re-locates to","re-locates to Chandigarh","to Chandigarh to","Chandigarh to get","to get employment","Rita does not","does not know","not know that","know that her","that her son","her son will","son will soon","will soon be","soon be beaten","be beaten by","beaten by Jaswant","by Jaswant for","Jaswant for sexually","for sexually molesting","sexually molesting a","molesting a young","a young Hindu","young Hindu widow","Hindu widow ,","widow , Sandhya",", Sandhya ,","Sandhya , who",", who beats","who beats up","beats up anyone","up anyone ,","anyone , including",", including elderly","including elderly women","elderly women ;","women ;

{"title":"Echelon Conspiracy","plot":"Max Peterson is a globe-trotting techno-whiz who installs security systems on computers. He receives an anonymous gift: a phone which sends messages that enable him to win at a casino. Max soon finds himself pursed by hit men, the casino's security chief, and a CIA operative. Who's sending Max messages? Previous recipients of similar windfalls have ended up dead. After a couple of close scrapes, Max realizes he's in danger, so he tries to find out the root of the conspiracy - which seems to have access to every security camera in the world - before he's the next victim. Why is this happening to him, and who can he trust?","genres":["Action"," Mystery"," Crime"],"stems":["Max","Peterson","is","a","globe-trot","techno-whiz","who","instal","secur","system","on","comput",".","He","receiv","an","anonym","gift",":","a","phone","which","send","messag","that","enabl","him","to","win","at","a","casino",".","Max","soon","find","himself","purs","by","hit","men",",","the","casino","'s","secur","chief",",","and","a","CIA","oper",".","Who","'s","send","Max","messag","?","Previous","recipi","of","similar","windfal","have","end","up","dead",".","After","a","coupl","of","close","scrape",",","Max","realiz","he","'s","in","danger",",","so","he","tri","to","find","out","the","root","of","the","conspiraci","-","which","seem","to","have","access","to","everi","secur","camera","in","the","world","-","befor","he","'s","the","next","victim",".","Whi","is","this","happen","to","him",",","and","who","can","he","trust","?"],"lemmas":["Max","Peterson","be","a","globe-trotting","techno-whiz","who","install","security","system","on","computer",".","he","receive","a","anonymous","gift",":","a","phone","which","send","message","that","enable","he","to","win","at","a","casino",".","max","soon","find","himself","purse","by","hit","man",",","the","casino","'s","security","chief",",","and","a","CIA","operative",".","who","be","send","Max","message","?","previous","recipient","of","similar","windfall","have","end","up","dead",".","after","a","couple","of","close","scrape",",","Max","realize","he","be","in","danger",",","so","he","try","to","find","out","the","root","of","the","conspiracy","-","which","seem","to","have","access","to","every","security","camera","in","the","world","-","before","he","be","the","next","victim",".","why","be","this","happen","to","he",",","and","who","can","he","trust","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Max Peterson is","Peterson is a","is a globe-trotting","a globe-trotting techno-whiz","globe-trotting techno-whiz who","techno-whiz who installs","who installs security","installs security systems","security systems on","systems on computers","He receives an","receives an anonymous","an anonymous gift","anonymous gift :","gift : a",": a phone","a phone which","phone which sends","which sends messages","sends messages that","messages that enable","that enable him","enable him to","him to win","to win at","win at a","at a casino","Max soon finds","soon finds himself","finds himself pursed","himself pursed by","pursed by hit","by hit men","hit men ,","men , the",", the casino","the casino 's","casino 's security","'s security chief","security chief ,","chief , and",", and a","and a CIA","a CIA operative","Who 's sending","'s sending Max","sending Max messages","Previous recipients of","recipients of similar","of similar windfalls","similar windfalls have","windfalls have ended","have ended up","ended up dead","After a couple","a couple of","couple of close","of close scrapes","close scrapes ,","scrapes , Max",", Max realizes","Max realizes he","realizes he 's","he 's in","'s in danger","in danger ,","danger , so",", so he","so he tries","he tries to","tries to find","to find out","find out the","out the root","the root of","root of the","of the conspiracy","the conspiracy -","conspiracy -

{"title":"U-571","plot":"In the midst of World War II, the battle below the seas rages. The Nazis have the upper edge as the Allies are unable to crack their war codes. That is, until a wrecked U-boat sends out an SOS signal, and the Allies realize this is their chance to seize the 'enigma coding machine'. But masquerading as Nazis and taking over the U-boat is the smallest of their problems. The action really begins when they get stranded on the U-boat.","genres":["Action"," War"],"stems":["In","the","midst","of","World","War","II",",","the","battl","below","the","sea","rage",".","The","Nazi","have","the","upper","edg","as","the","Alli","are","unabl","to","crack","their","war","code",".","That","is",",","until","a","wreck","U-boat","send","out","an","SOS","signal",",","and","the","Alli","realiz","this","is","their","chanc","to","seiz","the","'","enigma","code","machin","'",".","But","masquerad","as","Nazi","and","take","over","the","U-boat","is","the","smallest","of","their","problem",".","The","action","realli","begin","when","they","get","strand","on","the","U-boat","."],"lemmas":["in","the","midst","of","World","War","II",",","the","battle","below","the","sea","rage",".","the","Nazis","have","the","upper","edge","as","the","ally","be","unable","to","crack","they","war","code",".","that","be",",","until","a","wreck","u-boat","send","out","a","SOS","signal",",","and","the","ally","realize","this","be","they","chance","to","seize","the","'","enigma","coding","machine","'",".","but","masquerade","as","Nazis","and","take","over","the","u-boat","be","the","smallest","of","they","problem",".","the","action","really","begin","when","they","get","strand","on","the","u-boat","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["In the midst","the midst of","midst of World","of World War","World War II","War II ,","II , the",", the battle","the battle below","battle below the","below the seas","the seas rages","The Nazis have","Nazis have the","have the upper","the upper edge","upper edge as","edge as the","as the Allies","the Allies are","Allies are unable","are unable to","unable to crack","to crack their","crack their war","their war codes","That is ,","is , until",", until a","until a wrecked","a wrecked U-boat","wrecked U-boat sends","U-boat sends out","sends out an","out an SOS","an SOS signal","SOS signal ,","signal , and",", and the","and the Allies","the Allies realize","Allies realize this","realize this is","this is their","is their chance","their chance to","chance to seize","to seize the","seize the '","the ' enigma","' enigma coding","enigma coding machine","coding machine '","But masquerading as","masquerading as Nazis","as Nazis and","Nazis and taking","and taking over","taking over the","over the U-boat","the U-boat is","U-boat is the","is the smallest","the smallest of","smallest of their","of their problems","The action really","action really begins","really begins when","begins when they","when they get","they get stranded","get stranded on","stranded on the","on the U-boat"],"2grams":["In the","the midst","midst of","of World","World War","War II","II ,",", the","the battle","battle below","below the","the seas","seas rages","The Nazis","Nazis have","have the","the upper","upper edge","edge as","as the","the Allies","Allies are","are unable","unable to","to crack","crack their","their war","war codes","That is","is ,",", until","until a","a wrecked","wrecked U-boat","U-boat sends","sends out","out an","an SOS","SOS signal","signal ,",", and","and the","the Allies","Allies realize","realize this","this is","is their","their chance","chance to","to seize","seize the","the '","' enigma","enigma coding","coding machine","machine '","But masquerading","masquerading as","as Nazis","Nazis and","and taking","taking over","over the","the U-boat","U-boat is","is the","the smallest","smallest of","of their","their problems","The action","action really","really begins","begins when","when they","they get","get stranded","stranded on","on the","the U-boat"]}

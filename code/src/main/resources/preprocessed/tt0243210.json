{"title":"On the Nose","plot":"Brendan is a janitor at a university who has a fondness for gambling, especially betting on horse races. However, he doesn't have much skill at it, and poorly considered bets have drained the bank account he'd set aside for his daughter's education. Brendan's wife has made Brendan promise to give up gambling, but when their daughter announces she's just been accepted to Trinity College in Ireland, Brendan has to come up with the tuition money, and fast. While doing his sweeping at work, Brendan makes a remarkable discovery - the preserved head of an aboriginal tribesman who, under proper conditions, can pick the winners in horse races.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Brendan","is","a","janitor","at","a","univers","who","has","a","fond","for","gambl",",","especi","bet","on","hors","race",".","Howev",",","he","doe","n't","have","much","skill","at","it",",","and","poor","consid","bet","have","drain","the","bank","account","he","'d","set","asid","for","his","daughter","'s","educ",".","Brendan","'s","wife","has","made","Brendan","promis","to","give","up","gambl",",","but","when","their","daughter","announc","she","'s","just","been","accept","to","Triniti","Colleg","in","Ireland",",","Brendan","has","to","come","up","with","the","tuition","money",",","and","fast",".","While","do","his","sweep","at","work",",","Brendan","make","a","remark","discoveri","-","the","preserv","head","of","an","aborigin","tribesman","who",",","under","proper","condit",",","can","pick","the","winner","in","hors","race","."],"lemmas":["Brendan","be","a","janitor","at","a","university","who","have","a","fondness","for","gambling",",","especially","bet","on","horse","race",".","however",",","he","do","not","have","much","skill","at","it",",","and","poorly","consider","bet","have","drain","the","bank","account","he","have","set","aside","for","he","daughter","'s","education",".","Brendan","'s","wife","have","make","Brendan","promise","to","give","up","gambling",",","but","when","they","daughter","announce","she","be","just","be","accept","to","Trinity","College","in","Ireland",",","Brendan","have","to","come","up","with","the","tuition","money",",","and","fast",".","while","do","he","sweeping","at","work",",","Brendan","make","a","remarkable","discovery","-","the","preserved","head","of","a","aboriginal","tribesman","who",",","under","proper","condition",",","can","pick","the","winner","in","horse","race","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Brendan is a","is a janitor","a janitor at","janitor at a","at a university","a university who","university who has","who has a","has a fondness","a fondness for","fondness for gambling","for gambling ,","gambling , especially",", especially betting","especially betting on","betting on horse","on horse races","However , he",", he does","he does n't","does n't have","n't have much","have much skill","much skill at","skill at it","at it ,","it , and",", and poorly","and poorly considered","poorly considered bets","considered bets have","bets have drained","have drained the","drained the bank","the bank account","bank account he","account he 'd","he 'd set","'d set aside","set aside for","aside for his","for his daughter","his daughter 's","daughter 's education","Brendan 's wife","'s wife has","wife has made","has made Brendan","made Brendan promise","Brendan promise to","promise to give","to give up","give up gambling","up gambling ,","gambling , but",", but when","but when their","when their daughter","their daughter announces","daughter announces she","announces she 's","she 's just","'s just been","just been accepted","been accepted to","accepted to Trinity","to Trinity College","Trinity College in","College in Ireland","in Ireland ,","Ireland , Brendan",", Brendan has","Brendan has to","has to come","to come up","come up with","up with the","with the tuition","the tuition money","tuition money ,","money , and",", and fast","While doing his","doing his sweeping","his sweeping at","sweeping at work","at work ,","work , Brendan",", Brendan makes","Brendan makes a","makes a remarkable","a remarkable discovery","remarkable discovery -","discovery -

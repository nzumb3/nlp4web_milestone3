{"title":"Homecoming","plot":"'It's hard to put the past behind you, when you're living in it'. Homecoming is the witty and poignant story of five friends who attended a Historically Black University together in the 1990s. The members of the group, now in their late-thirties, have kept in touch over the years, but have drifted somewhat apart. While gathering for Homecoming weekend at the house that was once their off-campus dorm, news of one member's recent death forces the friends to reflect on the past; rekindle relationships; reveal secrets; and redefine their lives.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["'","It","'s","hard","to","put","the","past","behind","you",",","when","you","re","live","in","it","'",".","Homecom","is","the","witti","and","poignant","stori","of","five","friend","who","attend","a","Histor","Black","Univers","togeth","in","the","1990s",".","The","member","of","the","group",",","now","in","their","late-thirti",",","have","kept","in","touch","over","the","year",",","but","have","drift","somewhat","apart",".","While","gather","for","Homecom","weekend","at","the","hous","that","was","onc","their","off-campus","dorm",",","news","of","one","member","'s","recent","death","forc","the","friend","to","reflect","on","the","past",";","rekindl","relationship",";","reveal","secret",";","and","redefin","their","live","."],"lemmas":["'","it","be","hard","to","put","the","past","behind","you",",","when","you","be","live","in","it","'",".","Homecoming","be","the","witty","and","poignant","story","of","five","friend","who","attend","a","Historically","Black","University","together","in","the","1990s",".","the","member","of","the","group",",","now","in","they","late-thirty",",","have","keep","in","touch","over","the","year",",","but","have","drift","somewhat","apart",".","while","gathering","for","homecome","weekend","at","the","house","that","be","once","they","off-campus","dorm",",","news","of","one","member","'s","recent","death","force","the","friend","to","reflect","on","the","past",";","rekindle","relationship",";","reveal","secret",";","and","redefine","they","life","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["' It 's","It 's hard","'s hard to","hard to put","to put the","put the past","the past behind","past behind you","behind you ,","you , when",", when you","when you 're","you 're living","'re living in","living in it","in it '","Homecoming is the","is the witty","the witty and","witty and poignant","and poignant story","poignant story of","story of five","of five friends","five friends who","friends who attended","who attended a","attended a Historically","a Historically Black","Historically Black University","Black University together","University together in","together in the","in the 1990s","The members of","members of the","of the group","the group ,","group , now",", now in","now in their","in their late-thirties","their late-thirties ,","late-thirties , have",", have kept","have kept in","kept in touch","in touch over","touch over the","over the years","the years ,","years , but",", but have","but have drifted","have drifted somewhat","drifted somewhat apart","While gathering for","gathering for Homecoming","for Homecoming weekend","Homecoming weekend at","weekend at the","at the house","the house that","house that was","that was once","was once their","once their off-campus","their off-campus dorm","off-campus dorm ,","dorm , news",", news of","news of one","of one member","one member 's","member 's recent","'s recent death","recent death forces","death forces the","forces the friends","the friends to","friends to reflect","to reflect on","reflect on the","on the past","the past ;","past ; rekindle","; rekindle relationships","rekindle relationships ;","relationships ; reveal","; reveal secrets","reveal secrets ;","secrets ; and","; and redefine","and redefine their","redefine their lives"],"2grams":["' It","It 's","'s hard","hard to","to put","put the","the past","past behind","behind you","you ,",", when","when you","you 're","'re living","living in","in it","it '","Homecoming is","is the","the witty","witty and","and poignant","poignant story","story of","of five","five friends","friends who","who attended","attended a","a Historically","Historically Black","Black University","University together","together in","in the","the 1990s","The members","members of","of the","the group","group ,",", now","now in","in their","their late-thirties","late-thirties ,",", have","have kept","kept in","in touch","touch over","over the","the years","years ,",", but","but have","have drifted","drifted somewhat","somewhat apart","While gathering","gathering for","for Homecoming","Homecoming weekend","weekend at","at the","the house","house that","that was","was once","once their","their off-campus","off-campus dorm","dorm ,",", news","news of","of one","one member","member 's","'s recent","recent death","death forces","forces the","the friends","friends to","to reflect","reflect on","on the","the past","past ;","; rekindle","rekindle relationships","relationships ;","; reveal","reveal secrets","secrets ;","; and","and redefine","redefine their","their lives"]}

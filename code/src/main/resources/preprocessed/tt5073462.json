{"title":"School Among Glaciers","plot":"School Among Glaciers is a compelling documentary about a schoolteacher who sets out on a 14-day journey on foot to Lunana. He survives a number of narrow trails and high passes including the dreadful 5,200 meter high Gangla Karchung Pass. He finally settles under very harsh living conditions in Lunana, 4,500 meters above sea level, for five months. Here are semi nomadic tribes such as the Layaps and the Lunaps. With just over 1000 people, the Lunaps are considered the most backward people of Bhutan. However, they have their language, customs and culture, which they are jealously proud of. They inhabit one of the most inhospitable valleys in Bhutan. They live on Yaks producing butter, cheese and hides, which they trade with the lower valleys of Bhutan.The teacher soon learns that there is a great deal more knowledge and wisdom in these simple nomads than originally thought. He therefore proceeds to explore the way of life, native wisdoms and local traditions of this amazing people as has never been done before.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["School","Among","Glacier","is","a","compel","documentari","about","a","schoolteach","who","set","out","on","a","14-day","journey","on","foot","to","Lunana",".","He","surviv","a","number","of","narrow","trail","and","high","pass","includ","the","dread","5,200","meter","high","Gangla","Karchung","Pass",".","He","final","settl","under","veri","harsh","live","condit","in","Lunana",",","4,500","meter","abov","sea","level",",","for","five","month",".","Here","are","semi","nomad","tribe","such","as","the","Layap","and","the","Lunap",".","With","just","over","1000","peopl",",","the","Lunap","are","consid","the","most","backward","peopl","of","Bhutan",".","Howev",",","they","have","their","languag",",","custom","and","cultur",",","which","they","are","jealous","proud","of",".","They","inhabit","one","of","the","most","inhospit","valley","in","Bhutan",".","They","live","on","Yak","produc","butter",",","chees","and","hide",",","which","they","trade","with","the","lower","valley","of","Bhutan.Th","teacher","soon","learn","that","there","is","a","great","deal","more","knowledg","and","wisdom","in","these","simpl","nomad","than","origin","thought",".","He","therefor","proceed","to","explor","the","way","of","life",",","nativ","wisdom","and","local","tradit","of","this","amaz","peopl","as","has","never","been","done","befor","."],"lemmas":["school","among","glacier","be","a","compelling","documentary","about","a","schoolteacher","who","set","out","on","a","14-day","journey","on","foot","to","Lunana",".","he","survive","a","number","of","narrow","trail","and","high","pass","include","the","dreadful","5,200","meter","high","gangla","karchung","pass",".","he","finally","settle","under","very","harsh","living","condition","in","Lunana",",","4,500","meter","above","sea","level",",","for","five","month",".","here","be","semi","nomadic","tribe","such","as","the","Layaps","and","the","Lunaps",".","with","just","over","1000","people",",","the","Lunaps","be","consider","the","most","backward","people","of","Bhutan",".","however",",","they","have","they","language",",","custom","and","culture",",","which","they","be","jealously","proud","of",".","they","inhabit","one","of","the","most","inhospitable","valley","in","Bhutan",".","they","live","on","yak","produce","butter",",","cheese","and","hide",",","which","they","trade","with","the","lower","valley","of","bhutan.the","teacher","soon","learn","that","there","be","a","great","deal","more","knowledge","and","wisdom","in","these","simple","nomad","than","originally","think",".","he","therefore","proceed","to","explore","the","way","of","life",",","native","wisdom","and","local","tradition","of","this","amazing","people","as","have","never","be","do","before","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["School

{"title":"Be Home Soon: Letters from My Grandfather","plot":"A documentary about war and faith, love and loss, family myth and legacy - based on family letters from the patriarch who volunteered as a Chaplain in WWII in the Philippines, survived the Bataan Death March and died as a Japanese Prisoner of War. More poem than biopic or World War II documentary, Be Home Soon is a beautifully told and gorgeous lyrical testament which touches a universal nerve in its exploration of war and devotion - a meditation in motion on grace, memory and healing. Using letters, archival footage and stills, animation and present day footage, the film is poignant, thought-provoking and historically informative.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","documentari","about","war","and","faith",",","love","and","loss",",","famili","myth","and","legaci","-","base","on","famili","letter","from","the","patriarch","who","volunt","as","a","Chaplain","in","WWII","in","the","Philippin",",","surviv","the","Bataan","Death","March","and","die","as","a","Japanes","Prison","of","War",".","More","poem","than","biopic","or","World","War","II","documentari",",","Be","Home","Soon","is","a","beauti","told","and","gorgeous","lyric","testament","which","touch","a","univers","nerv","in","it","explor","of","war","and","devot","-","a","medit","in","motion","on","grace",",","memori","and","heal",".","Using","letter",",","archiv","footag","and","still",",","anim","and","present","day","footag",",","the","film","is","poignant",",","thought-provok","and","histor","inform","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","about","war","and","faith",",","love","and","loss",",","family","myth","and","legacy","-","base","on","family","letter","from","the","patriarch","who","volunteer","as","a","Chaplain","in","WWII","in","the","Philippines",",","survive","the","Bataan","Death","March","and","die","as","a","Japanese","Prisoner","of","War",".","more","poem","than","biopic","or","World","War","II","documentary",",","be","home","soon","be","a","beautifully","tell","and","gorgeous","lyrical","testament","which","touch","a","universal","nerve","in","its","exploration","of","war","and","devotion","-","a","meditation","in","motion","on","grace",",","memory","and","healing",".","use","letter",",","archival","footage","and","still",",","animation","and","present","day","footage",",","the","film","be","poignant",",","thought-provoking","and","historically","informative","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A documentary about","documentary about war","about war and","war and faith","and faith ,","faith , love",", love and","love and loss","and loss ,","loss , family",", family myth","family myth and","myth and legacy","and legacy -","legacy -

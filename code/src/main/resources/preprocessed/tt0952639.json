{"title":"9/12: From Chaos to Community","plot":"In the wake of the September 11 attacks, New Yorkers from all walks of life felt compelled to overcome their sense of powerlessness by volunteering to help out in the recovery effort. They brought in supplies, set up relief stations, and for ten months fed and cared for the recovery workers. Many deep and unexpected - even unlikely - relationships developed out of this. Using cinema verite footage, interviews and archival photographs, we follow several characters through a series of events reuniting them with each other after the closing of the site. Through their stories we present a portrait of the city within a city that was Ground Zero, and examine how an extremely diverse group of people transcended politics and culture in an effort to heal their city and themselves. 9/12: From Chaos to Community - a 60-minute character-driven documentary - is a vibrant, moving, sometimes funny, sometimes painful portrayal of hope and healing in the wake of disaster.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","wake","of","the","Septemb","11","attack",",","New","Yorker","from","all","walk","of","life","felt","compel","to","overcom","their","sens","of","powerless","by","volunt","to","help","out","in","the","recoveri","effort",".","They","brought","in","suppli",",","set","up","relief","station",",","and","for","ten","month","fed","and","care","for","the","recoveri","worker",".","Mani","deep","and","unexpect","-","even","unlik","-","relationship","develop","out","of","this",".","Using","cinema","verit","footag",",","interview","and","archiv","photograph",",","we","follow","sever","charact","through","a","seri","of","event","reunit","them","with","each","other","after","the","close","of","the","site",".","Through","their","stori","we","present","a","portrait","of","the","citi","within","a","citi","that","was","Ground","Zero",",","and","examin","how","an","extrem","divers","group","of","peopl","transcend","polit","and","cultur","in","an","effort","to","heal","their","citi","and","themselv",".","9/12",":","From","Chao","to","Commun","-","a","60-minut","character-driven","documentari","-","is","a","vibrant",",","move",",","sometim","funni",",","sometim","pain","portray","of","hope","and","heal","in","the","wake","of","disast","."],"lemmas":["in","the","wake","of","the","September","11","attack",",","New","Yorkers","from","all","walk","of","life","feel","compel","to","overcome","they","sense","of","powerlessness","by","volunteer","to","help","out","in","the","recovery","effort",".","they","bring","in","supplies",",","set","up","relief","station",",","and","for","ten","month","feed","and","care","for","the","recovery","worker",".","many","deep","and","unexpected","-","even","unlikely","-","relationship","develop","out","of","this",".","use","cinema","verite","footage",",","interview","and","archival","photograph",",","we","follow","several","character","through","a","series","of","event","reunite","they","with","each","other","after","the","closing","of","the","site",".","through","they","story","we","present","a","portrait","of","the","city","within","a","city","that","be","Ground","Zero",",","and","examine","how","a","extremely","diverse","group","of","people","transcend","politics","and","culture","in","a","effort","to","heal","they","city","and","themselves",".","9/12",":","from","chaos","to","Community","-","a","60-minute","character-driven","documentary","-","be","a","vibrant",",","move",",","sometimes","funny",",","sometimes","painful","portrayal","of","hope","and","healing","in","the","wake","of","disaster","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the wake","the wake of","wake of the","of the September","the September 11","September 11 attacks","11 attacks ,","attacks , New",", New Yorkers","New Yorkers from","Yorkers from all","from all walks","all walks of","walks of life","of life felt","life felt compelled","felt compelled to","compelled to overcome","to overcome their","overcome their sense","their sense of","sense of powerlessness","of powerlessness by","powerlessness by volunteering","by volunteering to","volunteering to help","to help out","help out in","out in the","in the recovery","the recovery effort","They brought in","brought in supplies","in supplies ,","supplies , set",", set up","set up relief","up relief stations","relief stations ,","stations , and",", and for","and for ten","for ten months","ten months fed","months fed and","fed and cared","and cared for","cared for the","for the recovery","the recovery workers","Many deep and","deep and unexpected","and unexpected -","unexpected -

{"title":"Starting Over","plot":"Sarah has dated Ben since freshman year of high school. The two went off to college together, where they stayed in their committed relationship, and following college moved together across the country. Shortly thereafter, Ben decided to break up with Sarah to live \"the single life.\" In his logic, he got to keep their apartment and furniture and she had to move out that day. Still not really knowing anyone in this new city, Sarah must find a place to live. She does find a place and finds friends in her new roommates, Andrea and Natalie. While Sarah is trying to discover what it means to be single, Andrea is trying to help her find a new man, whether Sarah wants to or not. Natalie, having had a similar situation to Sarah in the past, acts as her encouragement to help her deal with the minefield of emotions following her break-up and trouble adapting to being single. Having had her entire life planned out, Sarah discovers how difficult it can be to meet that special someone through a series of mishaps and bad dates. Just as Sarah is starting to figure things out, Ben returns to her, only to turn her world upside down. Sarah continues to struggle in finding herself and discovering the strength within, while she is Starting Over.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

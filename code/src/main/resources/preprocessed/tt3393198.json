{"title":"Resistance","plot":"80 years ago antibiotics revolutionized medicine. Only now are we realizing the potentially catastrophic consequences of these miracle drugs. The question is: have we reached a point where we must save antibiotics to save ourselves? RESISTANCE uses interviews, archival material, and verite footage to untangle the web of factors behind the global crisis of antibiotic resistance. Experts and ordinary individuals who've faced resistance first hand reveal how our use of antibiotics has created profound challenges not only for hospitals, but for much of modern life - from our food supply to our personal health. With their help the film clarifies what's at stake, what's driving the problem and how we might turn the tide.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["80","year","ago","antibiot","revolution","medicin",".","Onli","now","are","we","realiz","the","potenti","catastroph","consequ","of","these","miracl","drug",".","The","question","is",":","have","we","reach","a","point","where","we","must","save","antibiot","to","save","ourselv","?","RESISTANCE","use","interview",",","archiv","materi",",","and","verit","footag","to","untangl","the","web","of","factor","behind","the","global","crisi","of","antibiot","resist",".","Expert","and","ordinari","individu","who","ve","face","resist","first","hand","reveal","how","our","use","of","antibiot","has","creat","profound","challeng","not","onli","for","hospit",",","but","for","much","of","modern","life","-","from","our","food","suppli","to","our","person","health",".","With","their","help","the","film","clarifi","what","'s","at","stake",",","what","'s","drive","the","problem","and","how","we","might","turn","the","tide","."],"lemmas":["80","year","ago","antibiotic","revolutionize","medicine",".","only","now","be","we","realize","the","potentially","catastrophic","consequence","of","these","miracle","drug",".","the","question","be",":","have","we","reach","a","point","where","we","must","save","antibiotic","to","save","ourselves","?","resistance","use","interview",",","archival","material",",","and","verite","footage","to","untangle","the","web","of","factor","behind","the","global","crisis","of","antibiotic","resistance",".","expert","and","ordinary","individual","who","have","face","resistance","first","hand","reveal","how","we","use","of","antibiotic","have","create","profound","challenge","not","only","for","hospital",",","but","for","much","of","modern","life","-","from","we","food","supply","to","we","personal","health",".","with","they","help","the","film","clarify","what","be","at","stake",",","what","be","drive","the","problem","and","how","we","might","turn","the","tide","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["80 years ago","years ago antibiotics","ago antibiotics revolutionized","antibiotics revolutionized medicine","Only now are","now are we","are we realizing","we realizing the","realizing the potentially","the potentially catastrophic","potentially catastrophic consequences","catastrophic consequences of","consequences of these","of these miracle","these miracle drugs","The question is","question is :","is : have",": have we","have we reached","we reached a","reached a point","a point where","point where we","where we must","we must save","must save antibiotics","save antibiotics to","antibiotics to save","to save ourselves","RESISTANCE uses interviews","uses interviews ,","interviews , archival",", archival material","archival material ,","material , and",", and verite","and verite footage","verite footage to","footage to untangle","to untangle the","untangle the web","the web of","web of factors","of factors behind","factors behind the","behind the global","the global crisis","global crisis of","crisis of antibiotic","of antibiotic resistance","Experts and ordinary","and ordinary individuals","ordinary individuals who","individuals who 've","who 've faced","'ve faced resistance","faced resistance first","resistance first hand","first hand reveal","hand reveal how","reveal how our","how our use","our use of","use of antibiotics","of antibiotics has","antibiotics has created","has created profound","created profound challenges","profound challenges not","challenges not only","not only for","only for hospitals","for hospitals ,","hospitals , but",", but for","but for much","for much of","much of modern","of modern life","modern life -","life -

{"title":"Saving Sarah Cain","plot":"When Sarah Cain, a self-involved big-city newspaper columnist, travels to Pennsylvania for the funeral of her Amish sister, she soon discovers that she is the legal guardian of her five Amish nieces and nephews. Rather than choose to move to Lancaster County to finish raising them there herself, or let them be separated by the foster care system, Sarah decides to take them with her back to Portland where she believes she can make a new life for them. However, she soon realizes that the modern world has forced them to compromise who they are, and that she has moved them there for all the wrong reasons - a motive which is soon exposed - because secrets can really never be kept secret. In order to find her own redemption, she knows she must make a choice to give them back their lives in Amish Country. And whether she remains part of their lives will have a lot to do with how much she has grown to love them.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","Sarah","Cain",",","a","self-involv","big-citi","newspap","columnist",",","travel","to","Pennsylvania","for","the","funer","of","her","Amish","sister",",","she","soon","discov","that","she","is","the","legal","guardian","of","her","five","Amish","niec","and","nephew",".","Rather","than","choos","to","move","to","Lancast","Counti","to","finish","rais","them","there","herself",",","or","let","them","be","separ","by","the","foster","care","system",",","Sarah","decid","to","take","them","with","her","back","to","Portland","where","she","believ","she","can","make","a","new","life","for","them",".","Howev",",","she","soon","realiz","that","the","modern","world","has","forc","them","to","compromis","who","they","are",",","and","that","she","has","move","them","there","for","all","the","wrong","reason","-","a","motiv","which","is","soon","expos","-","becaus","secret","can","realli","never","be","kept","secret",".","In","order","to","find","her","own","redempt",",","she","know","she","must","make","a","choic","to","give","them","back","their","live","in","Amish","Countri",".","And","whether","she","remain","part","of","their","live","will","have","a","lot","to","do","with","how","much","she","has","grown","to","love","them","."],"lemmas":["when","Sarah","Cain",",","a","self-involved","big-city","newspaper","columnist",",","travel","to","Pennsylvania","for","the","funeral","of","she","amish","sister",",","she","soon","discover","that","she","be","the","legal","guardian","of","she","five","amish","niece","and","nephew",".","rather","than","choose","to","move","to","Lancaster","County","to","finish","raise","they","there","herself",",","or","let","they","be","separate","by","the","foster","care","system",",","Sarah","decide","to","take","they","with","she","back","to","Portland","where","she","believe","she","can","make","a","new","life","for","they",".","however",",","she","soon","realize","that","the","modern","world","have","force","they","to","compromise","who","they","be",",","and","that","she","have","move","they","there","for","all","the","wrong","reason","-","a","motive","which","be","soon","expose","-","because","secret","can","really","never","be","keep","secret",".","in","order","to","find","she","own","redemption",",","she","know","she","must","make","a","choice","to","give","they","back","they","life","in","amish","country",".","and","whether","she","remain","part","of","they","life","will","have","a","lot","to","do","with","how","much","she","have","grow","to","love","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["When Sarah Cain","Sarah Cain ,","Cain , a",", a self-involved","a self-involved big-city","self-involved big-city newspaper","big-city newspaper columnist","newspaper columnist ,","columnist , travels",", travels to","travels to Pennsylvania","to Pennsylvania for","Pennsylvania for the","for the funeral","the funeral of","funeral of her","of her Amish","her Amish sister","Amish sister ,","sister , she",", she soon","she soon discovers","soon discovers that","discovers that she","that she is","she is the","is the legal","the legal guardian","legal guardian of","guardian of her","of her five","her five Amish","five Amish nieces","Amish nieces and","nieces and nephews","Rather than choose","than choose to","choose to move","to move to","move to Lancaster","to Lancaster County","Lancaster County to","County to finish","to finish raising","finish raising them","raising them there","them there herself","there herself ,","herself , or",", or let","or let them","let them be","them be separated","be separated by","separated by the","by the foster","the foster care","foster care system","care system ,","system , Sarah",", Sarah decides","Sarah decides to","decides to take","to take them","take them with","them with her","with her back","her back to","back to Portland","to Portland where","Portland where she","where she believes","she believes she","believes she can","she can make","can make a","make a new","a new life","new life for","life for them","However , she",", she soon","she soon realizes","soon realizes that","realizes that the","that the modern","the modern world","modern world has","world has forced","has forced them","forced them to","them to compromise","to compromise who","compromise who they","who they are","they are ,","are , and",", and that","and that she","that she has","she has moved","has moved them","moved them there","them there for","there for all","for all the","all the wrong","the wrong reasons","wrong reasons -","reasons -

{"title":"Engels: On My Way... Someway, Somehow","plot":"This film is about Engels, the artist. He was born in Haiti. He has lived and worked in Brooklyn, New York for the past 25 years. His journey is truly remarkable in that he has always done his art. No day job. This film will explore this remarkable journey from Haiti to him recently being asked to the Florence Biennale. It will also explore how Engels creates himself for the world stage and how he shares with so many his personal enchanting world while also creating a true sense of community. He gives us a chance to be apart of his art; a connection that is not high-tech and fast paced but rather experiential, meaningful and requires participation.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["This","film","is","about","Engel",",","the","artist",".","He","was","born","in","Haiti",".","He","has","live","and","work","in","Brooklyn",",","New","York","for","the","past","25","year",".","His","journey","is","truli","remark","in","that","he","has","alway","done","his","art",".","No","day","job",".","This","film","will","explor","this","remark","journey","from","Haiti","to","him","recent","be","ask","to","the","Florenc","Biennal",".","It","will","also","explor","how","Engel","creat","himself","for","the","world","stage","and","how","he","share","with","so","mani","his","person","enchant","world","while","also","creat","a","true","sens","of","communiti",".","He","give","us","a","chanc","to","be","apart","of","his","art",";","a","connect","that","is","not","high-tech","and","fast","pace","but","rather","experienti",",","meaning","and","requir","particip","."],"lemmas":["this","film","be","about","Engels",",","the","artist",".","he","be","bear","in","Haiti",".","he","have","live","and","work","in","Brooklyn",",","New","York","for","the","past","25","year",".","he","journey","be","truly","remarkable","in","that","he","have","always","do","he","art",".","no","day","job",".","this","film","will","explore","this","remarkable","journey","from","Haiti","to","he","recently","be","ask","to","the","Florence","Biennale",".","it","will","also","explore","how","Engels","create","himself","for","the","world","stage","and","how","he","share","with","so","many","he","personal","enchanting","world","while","also","create","a","true","sense","of","community",".","he","give","we","a","chance","to","be","apart","of","he","art",";","a","connection","that","be","not","high-tech","and","fast","pace","but","rather","experiential",",","meaningful","and","require","participation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film is","film is about","is about Engels","about Engels ,","Engels , the",", the artist","He was born","was born in","born in Haiti","He has lived","has lived and","lived and worked","and worked in","worked in Brooklyn","in Brooklyn ,","Brooklyn , New",", New York","New York for","York for the","for the past","the past 25","past 25 years","His journey is","journey is truly","is truly remarkable","truly remarkable in","remarkable in that","in that he","that he has","he has always","has always done","always done his","done his art","No day job","This film will","film will explore","will explore this","explore this remarkable","this remarkable journey","remarkable journey from","journey from Haiti","from Haiti to","Haiti to him","to him recently","him recently being","recently being asked","being asked to","asked to the","to the Florence","the Florence Biennale","It will also","will also explore","also explore how","explore how Engels","how Engels creates","Engels creates himself","creates himself for","himself for the","for the world","the world stage","world stage and","stage and how","and how he","how he shares","he shares with","shares with so","with so many","so many his","many his personal","his personal enchanting","personal enchanting world","enchanting world while","world while also","while also creating","also creating a","creating a true","a true sense","true sense of","sense of community","He gives us","gives us a","us a chance","a chance to","chance to be","to be apart","be apart of","apart of his","of his art","his art ;","art ;

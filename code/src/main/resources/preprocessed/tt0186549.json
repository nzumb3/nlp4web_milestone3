{"title":"The Simian Line","plot":"In addition to declaring that Katharine's (Lynn Redgrave) head and heart line are hopelessly fused into one \"simian line\", eccentric palm reader/fortune-teller Arnita (Tyne Daly) makes a dire prediction: By the end of the year, one of the couples present at a Halloween party will have broken up. But will it be Katherine and her much-younger boyfriend Rick (Harry Connick Jr.); her upstairs tenants Marta and Billy or new yuppie neighbors Sandra (Cindy Crawford) and Paul? Fueled by Arnita's prediction, each of the couples begins to drift apart in a sea of doubt and distrust. Can the \"divine\" intervention of two well-meaning ghosts (William Hurt and Samantha Mathis) keep these earthly conflicts from erupting into multiple self-fulfilling prophecies?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["In","addit","to","declar","that","Katharin","'s","(","Lynn","Redgrav",")","head","and","heart","line","are","hopeless","fuse","into","one","\"","simian","line","\"",",","eccentr","palm","reader/fortune-tel","Arnita","(","Tyne","Dali",")","make","a","dire","predict",":","By","the","end","of","the","year",",","one","of","the","coupl","present","at","a","Halloween","parti","will","have","broken","up",".","But","will","it","be","Katherin","and","her","much-young","boyfriend","Rick","(","Harri","Connick","Jr.",")",";","her","upstair","tenant","Marta","and","Billi","or","new","yuppi","neighbor","Sandra","(","Cindi","Crawford",")","and","Paul","?","Fuel","by","Arnita","'s","predict",",","each","of","the","coupl","begin","to","drift","apart","in","a","sea","of","doubt","and","distrust",".","Can","the","\"","divin","\"","intervent","of","two","well-mean","ghost","(","William","Hurt","and","Samantha","Mathi",")","keep","these","earth","conflict","from","erupt","into","multipl","self-fulfil","propheci","?"],"lemmas":["in","addition","to","declare","that","Katharine","'s","-lrb-","Lynn","Redgrave","-rrb-","head","and","heart","line","be","hopelessly","fuse","into","one","``","simian","line","''",",","eccentric","palm","reader/fortune-teller","Arnita","-lrb-","Tyne","Daly","-rrb-","make","a","dire","prediction",":","by","the","end","of","the","year",",","one","of","the","couple","present","at","a","Halloween","party","will","have","break","up",".","but","will","it","be","Katherine","and","she","much-younger","boyfriend","Rick","-lrb-","Harry","Connick","Jr.","-rrb-",";","she","upstairs","tenant","Marta","and","Billy","or","new","yuppie","neighbor","Sandra","-lrb-","Cindy","Crawford","-rrb-","and","Paul","?","fuel","by","Arnita","'s","prediction",",","each","of","the","couple","begin","to","drift","apart","in","a","sea","of","doubt","and","distrust",".","can","the","``","divine","''","intervention","of","two","well-meaning","ghost","-lrb-","William","Hurt","and","Samantha","Mathis","-rrb-","keep","these","earthly","conflict","from","erupt","into","multiple","self-fulfilling","prophecy","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In addition to","addition to declaring","to declaring that","declaring that Katharine","that Katharine 's","Katharine 's (","'s ( Lynn","( Lynn Redgrave","Lynn Redgrave )","Redgrave ) head",") head and","head and heart","and heart line","heart line are","line are hopelessly","are hopelessly fused","hopelessly fused into","fused into one","into one \"","one \" simian","\" simian line","simian line \"","line \" ,","\" , eccentric",", eccentric palm","eccentric palm reader/fortune-teller","palm reader/fortune-teller Arnita","reader/fortune-teller Arnita (","Arnita ( Tyne","( Tyne Daly","Tyne Daly )","Daly ) makes",") makes a","makes a dire","a dire prediction","dire prediction :","prediction : By",": By the","By the end","the end of","end of the","of the year","the year ,","year , one",", one of","one of the","of the couples","the couples present","couples present at","present at a","at a Halloween","a Halloween party","Halloween party will","party will have","will have broken","have broken up","But will it","will it be","it be Katherine","be Katherine and","Katherine and her","and her much-younger","her much-younger boyfriend","much-younger boyfriend Rick","boyfriend Rick (","Rick ( Harry","( Harry Connick","Harry Connick Jr.","Connick Jr. )","Jr. ) ;",") ;

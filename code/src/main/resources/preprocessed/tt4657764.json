{"title":"You Are My Sunshine","plot":"In their university days, Zhao Mosheng fell in love at first sight with law student He Yichen. Through various incidents where Mosheng \"stalked\" Yichen on campus, Mosheng's cheerful personality charmed Yichen, and they slowly became college sweethearts. When Yichen's foster sister Yimei challenged Mosheng for Yichen's attention, Mosheng turned directly to Yichen for clarification, but did not expect to receive a cold response from him. Mistaking that Yichen and Yimei are a couple, Mosheng followed her father's arrangements and moved to the United States to continue her studies. Seven years later, Mosheng - who is now a professional photographer - returns to China, and coincidentally bumps into the unforgettable Yichen. Since the seven years they broke up, many people stand in the way of these star-crossed lovers: foster-sister Yimei; Mosheng's marriage in United States; the unrelentingly infatuated ex-husband Ying Hui; as well as the financial grudges between the couple's fathers. All these situations continue to affect the two former lovers, but instead, these misunderstandings and challenges give them a better comprehension of the love they have missed over the past seven years.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["In","their","univers","day",",","Zhao","Mosheng","fell","in","love","at","first","sight","with","law","student","He","Yichen",".","Through","various","incid","where","Mosheng","\"","stalk","\"","Yichen","on","campus",",","Mosheng","'s","cheer","person","charm","Yichen",",","and","they","slowli","becam","colleg","sweetheart",".","When","Yichen","'s","foster","sister","Yimei","challeng","Mosheng","for","Yichen","'s","attent",",","Mosheng","turn","direct","to","Yichen","for","clarif",",","but","did","not","expect","to","receiv","a","cold","respons","from","him",".","Mistak","that","Yichen","and","Yimei","are","a","coupl",",","Mosheng","follow","her","father","'s","arrang","and","move","to","the","Unite","State","to","continu","her","studi",".","Seven","year","later",",","Mosheng","-","who","is","now","a","profession","photograph","-","return","to","China",",","and","coincident","bump","into","the","unforgett","Yichen",".","Sinc","the","seven","year","they","broke","up",",","mani","peopl","stand","in","the","way","of","these","star-cross","lover",":","foster-sist","Yimei",";","Mosheng","'s","marriag","in","Unite","State",";","the","unrel","infatu","ex-husband","Ying","Hui",";","as","well","as","the","financi","grudg","between","the","coupl","'s","father",".","All","these","situat","continu","to","affect","the","two","former","lover",",","but","instead",",","these","misunderstand","and","challeng","give","them","a","better","comprehens","of","the","love","they","have","miss","over","the","past","seven","year","."],"lemmas":["in","they","university","day",",","Zhao","Mosheng","fall","in","love","at","first","sight","with","law","student","he","Yichen",".","through","various","incident","where","Mosheng","``","stalk","''","Yichen","on","campus",",","Mosheng","'s","cheerful","personality","charm","Yichen",",","and","they","slowly","become","college","sweetheart",".","when","Yichen","'s","foster","sister","Yimei","challenge","Mosheng","for","Yichen","'s","attention",",","Mosheng","turn","directly","to","Yichen","for","clarification",",","but","do","not","expect","to","receive","a","cold","response","from","he",".","mistake","that","Yichen","and","Yimei","be","a","couple",",","Mosheng","follow","she","father","'s","arrangement","and","move","to","the","United","States","to","continue","she","study",".","seven","year","later",",","Mosheng","-","who","be","now","a","professional","photographer","-","return","to","China",",","and","coincidentally","bump","into","the","unforgettable","Yichen",".","since","the","seven","year","they","break","up",",","many","people","stand","in","the","way","of","these","star-crossed","lover",":","foster-sister","yimei",";","Mosheng","'s","marriage","in","United","States",";","the","unrelentingly","infatuate","ex-husband","Ying","Hui",";","as","well","as","the","financial","grudge","between","the","couple","'s","father",".","all","these","situation","continue","to","affect","the","two","former","lover",",","but","instead",",","these","misunderstanding","and","challenge","give","they","a","better","comprehension","of","the","love","they","have","miss","over","the","past","seven","year","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

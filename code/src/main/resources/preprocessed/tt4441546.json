{"title":"Mask of Love on Yukio Mishima","plot":"Yukio Mishima text is being used to render the reality, to get rid of the fiction- not only from Mishima's writings and life but also Malga's world. Japanese imagery is a cocoon for semi- documentary, dark fairy-tale-like voyeuristic shots and all that in raw trash punk aesthetics. She makes Mishima's fantasies as true as her intimate confessions on love and suicide. Despite the title there is not much love, and if there is- it's all contaminated with death.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Yukio","Mishima","text","is","be","use","to","render","the","realiti",",","to","get","rid","of","the","fiction","-","not","onli","from","Mishima","'s","write","and","life","but","also","Malga","'s","world",".","Japanes","imageri","is","a","cocoon","for","semi","-","documentari",",","dark","fairy-tale-lik","voyeurist","shot","and","all","that","in","raw","trash","punk","aesthet",".","She","make","Mishima","'s","fantasi","as","true","as","her","intim","confess","on","love","and","suicid",".","Despit","the","titl","there","is","not","much","love",",","and","if","there","is","-","it","'s","all","contamin","with","death","."],"lemmas":["Yukio","Mishima","text","be","be","use","to","render","the","reality",",","to","get","rid","of","the","fiction","-","not","only","from","Mishima","'s","writings","and","life","but","also","Malga","'s","world",".","japanese","imagery","be","a","cocoon","for","semi","-","documentary",",","dark","fairy-tale-like","voyeuristic","shot","and","all","that","in","raw","trash","punk","aesthetics",".","she","make","Mishima","'s","fantasy","as","true","as","she","intimate","confession","on","love","and","suicide",".","despite","the","title","there","be","not","much","love",",","and","if","there","be","-","it","be","all","contaminate","with","death","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Yukio Mishima text","Mishima text is","text is being","is being used","being used to","used to render","to render the","render the reality","the reality ,","reality , to",", to get","to get rid","get rid of","rid of the","of the fiction","the fiction -","fiction - not","- not only","not only from","only from Mishima","from Mishima 's","Mishima 's writings","'s writings and","writings and life","and life but","life but also","but also Malga","also Malga 's","Malga 's world","Japanese imagery is","imagery is a","is a cocoon","a cocoon for","cocoon for semi","for semi -","semi - documentary","- documentary ,","documentary , dark",", dark fairy-tale-like","dark fairy-tale-like voyeuristic","fairy-tale-like voyeuristic shots","voyeuristic shots and","shots and all","and all that","all that in","that in raw","in raw trash","raw trash punk","trash punk aesthetics","She makes Mishima","makes Mishima 's","Mishima 's fantasies","'s fantasies as","fantasies as true","as true as","true as her","as her intimate","her intimate confessions","intimate confessions on","confessions on love","on love and","love and suicide","Despite the title","the title there","title there is","there is not","is not much","not much love","much love ,","love , and",", and if","and if there","if there is","there is -","is - it","- it 's","it 's all","'s all contaminated","all contaminated with","contaminated with death"],"2grams":["Yukio Mishima","Mishima text","text is","is being","being used","used to","to render","render the","the reality","reality ,",", to","to get","get rid","rid of","of the","the fiction","fiction -","- not","not only","only from","from Mishima","Mishima 's","'s writings","writings and","and life","life but","but also","also Malga","Malga 's","'s world","Japanese imagery","imagery is","is a","a cocoon","cocoon for","for semi","semi -","- documentary","documentary ,",", dark","dark fairy-tale-like","fairy-tale-like voyeuristic","voyeuristic shots","shots and","and all","all that","that in","in raw","raw trash","trash punk","punk aesthetics","She makes","makes Mishima","Mishima 's","'s fantasies","fantasies as","as true","true as","as her","her intimate","intimate confessions","confessions on","on love","love and","and suicide","Despite the","the title","title there","there is","is not","not much","much love","love ,",", and","and if","if there","there is","is -","- it","it 's","'s all","all contaminated","contaminated with","with death"]}

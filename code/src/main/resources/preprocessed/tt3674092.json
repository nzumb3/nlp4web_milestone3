{"title":"Say Farewell","plot":"A surprise cruise for a young man takes an unexpected turn when his girlfriend leaves him shortly before they are due to depart. Choosing to board regardless, the man embarks upon a lonesome voyage across the Baltic sea. Cruise life is not treating him well. However on the second day, he encounters a Welsh male choir rehearsing for a series of concerts on board the ship and in various cities along the Baltic coastline. He finds comfort in their sound and begins to follow them on tour, gradually immersing himself in their affable company, but is it enough to save his troubled soul?","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["A","surpris","cruis","for","a","young","man","take","an","unexpect","turn","when","his","girlfriend","leav","him","short","befor","they","are","due","to","depart",".","Choos","to","board","regardless",",","the","man","embark","upon","a","lonesom","voyag","across","the","Baltic","sea",".","Cruis","life","is","not","treat","him","well",".","Howev","on","the","second","day",",","he","encount","a","Welsh","male","choir","rehears","for","a","seri","of","concert","on","board","the","ship","and","in","various","citi","along","the","Baltic","coastlin",".","He","find","comfort","in","their","sound","and","begin","to","follow","them","on","tour",",","gradual","immers","himself","in","their","affabl","compani",",","but","is","it","enough","to","save","his","troubl","soul","?"],"lemmas":["a","surprise","cruise","for","a","young","man","take","a","unexpected","turn","when","he","girlfriend","leave","he","shortly","before","they","be","due","to","depart",".","choose","to","board","regardless",",","the","man","embark","upon","a","lonesome","voyage","across","the","baltic","sea",".","cruise","life","be","not","treat","he","well",".","however","on","the","second","day",",","he","encounter","a","welsh","male","choir","rehearse","for","a","series","of","concert","on","board","the","ship","and","in","various","city","along","the","baltic","coastline",".","he","find","comfort","in","they","sound","and","begin","to","follow","they","on","tour",",","gradually","immerse","himself","in","they","affable","company",",","but","be","it","enough","to","save","he","troubled","soul","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A surprise cruise","surprise cruise for","cruise for a","for a young","a young man","young man takes","man takes an","takes an unexpected","an unexpected turn","unexpected turn when","turn when his","when his girlfriend","his girlfriend leaves","girlfriend leaves him","leaves him shortly","him shortly before","shortly before they","before they are","they are due","are due to","due to depart","Choosing to board","to board regardless","board regardless ,","regardless , the",", the man","the man embarks","man embarks upon","embarks upon a","upon a lonesome","a lonesome voyage","lonesome voyage across","voyage across the","across the Baltic","the Baltic sea","Cruise life is","life is not","is not treating","not treating him","treating him well","However on the","on the second","the second day","second day ,","day , he",", he encounters","he encounters a","encounters a Welsh","a Welsh male","Welsh male choir","male choir rehearsing","choir rehearsing for","rehearsing for a","for a series","a series of","series of concerts","of concerts on","concerts on board","on board the","board the ship","the ship and","ship and in","and in various","in various cities","various cities along","cities along the","along the Baltic","the Baltic coastline","He finds comfort","finds comfort in","comfort in their","in their sound","their sound and","sound and begins","and begins to","begins to follow","to follow them","follow them on","them on tour","on tour ,","tour , gradually",", gradually immersing","gradually immersing himself","immersing himself in","himself in their","in their affable","their affable company","affable company ,","company , but",", but is","but is it","is it enough","it enough to","enough to save","to save his","save his troubled","his troubled soul"],"2grams":["A surprise","surprise cruise","cruise for","for a","a young","young man","man takes","takes an","an unexpected","unexpected turn","turn when","when his","his girlfriend","girlfriend leaves","leaves him","him shortly","shortly before","before they","they are","are due","due to","to depart","Choosing to","to board","board regardless","regardless ,",", the","the man","man embarks","embarks upon","upon a","a lonesome","lonesome voyage","voyage across","across the","the Baltic","Baltic sea","Cruise life","life is","is not","not treating","treating him","him well","However on","on the","the second","second day","day ,",", he","he encounters","encounters a","a Welsh","Welsh male","male choir","choir rehearsing","rehearsing for","for a","a series","series of","of concerts","concerts on","on board","board the","the ship","ship and","and in","in various","various cities","cities along","along the","the Baltic","Baltic coastline","He finds","finds comfort","comfort in","in their","their sound","sound and","and begins","begins to","to follow","follow them","them on","on tour","tour ,",", gradually","gradually immersing","immersing himself","himself in","in their","their affable","affable company","company ,",", but","but is","is it","it enough","enough to","to save","save his","his troubled","troubled soul"]}

{"title":"Bamboozled","plot":"Dark, biting satire of the television industry, focusing on an Ivy-League educated black writer at a major network. Frustrated that his ideas for a \"Cosby Show\"-esque take on the black family has been rejected by network brass, he devises an outlandish scheme: reviving the minstrel show. The hook: instead of white actors in black face, the show stars black actors in even blacker face. The show becomes an instant smash, but with the success also come repercussions for all involved.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["Dark",",","bite","satir","of","the","televis","industri",",","focus","on","an","Ivy-Leagu","educ","black","writer","at","a","major","network",".","Frustrat","that","his","idea","for","a","\"","Cosbi","Show","\"","-","esqu","take","on","the","black","famili","has","been","reject","by","network","brass",",","he","devis","an","outlandish","scheme",":","reviv","the","minstrel","show",".","The","hook",":","instead","of","white","actor","in","black","face",",","the","show","star","black","actor","in","even","blacker","face",".","The","show","becom","an","instant","smash",",","but","with","the","success","also","come","repercuss","for","all","involv","."],"lemmas":["dark",",","bite","satire","of","the","television","industry",",","focus","on","a","Ivy-League","educate","black","writer","at","a","major","network",".","frustrate","that","he","idea","for","a","``","Cosby","Show","''","-","esque","take","on","the","black","family","have","be","reject","by","network","brass",",","he","devise","a","outlandish","scheme",":","revive","the","minstrel","show",".","the","hook",":","instead","of","white","actor","in","black","face",",","the","show","star","black","actor","in","even","blacker","face",".","the","show","become","a","instant","smash",",","but","with","the","success","also","come","repercussion","for","all","involve","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Dark , biting",", biting satire","biting satire of","satire of the","of the television","the television industry","television industry ,","industry , focusing",", focusing on","focusing on an","on an Ivy-League","an Ivy-League educated","Ivy-League educated black","educated black writer","black writer at","writer at a","at a major","a major network","Frustrated that his","that his ideas","his ideas for","ideas for a","for a \"","a \" Cosby","\" Cosby Show","Cosby Show \"","Show \" -","\" - esque","- esque take","esque take on","take on the","on the black","the black family","black family has","family has been","has been rejected","been rejected by","rejected by network","by network brass","network brass ,","brass , he",", he devises","he devises an","devises an outlandish","an outlandish scheme","outlandish scheme :","scheme : reviving",": reviving the","reviving the minstrel","the minstrel show","The hook :","hook : instead",": instead of","instead of white","of white actors","white actors in","actors in black","in black face","black face ,","face , the",", the show","the show stars","show stars black","stars black actors","black actors in","actors in even","in even blacker","even blacker face","The show becomes","show becomes an","becomes an instant","an instant smash","instant smash ,","smash , but",", but with","but with the","with the success","the success also","success also come","also come repercussions","come repercussions for","repercussions for all","for all involved"],"2grams":["Dark ,",", biting","biting satire","satire of","of the","the television","television industry","industry ,",", focusing","focusing on","on an","an Ivy-League","Ivy-League educated","educated black","black writer","writer at","at a","a major","major network","Frustrated that","that his","his ideas","ideas for","for a","a \"","\" Cosby","Cosby Show","Show \"","\" -","- esque","esque take","take on","on the","the black","black family","family has","has been","been rejected","rejected by","by network","network brass","brass ,",", he","he devises","devises an","an outlandish","outlandish scheme","scheme :",": reviving","reviving the","the minstrel","minstrel show","The hook","hook :",": instead","instead of","of white","white actors","actors in","in black","black face","face ,",", the","the show","show stars","stars black","black actors","actors in","in even","even blacker","blacker face","The show","show becomes","becomes an","an instant","instant smash","smash ,",", but","but with","with the","the success","success also","also come","come repercussions","repercussions for","for all","all involved"]}

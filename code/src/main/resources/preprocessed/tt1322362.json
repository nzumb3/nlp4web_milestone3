{"title":"Revenge of the Mekons","plot":"REVENGE OF THE MEKONS charts the unlikely career of the genre-defying collective notorious for being--as rock critic Greil Marcus notes--\"the band that took punk ideology most seriously.\" Born out of the 1977 British punk scene, the Mekons progressed from a group of socialist art students with no musical skills to the prolific, raucous progeny of Hank Williams. Joe Angio's exuberant documentary follows their improbable history - a surprising and influential embrace of folk and country music, forays into the art world and consistent bad luck with major record labels. Featuring interviews with celebrated fans, from author Jonathan Franzen to film director Mary Harron to comedian/musician Fred Armisen, REVENGE OF THE MEKONS reveals how, four decades into an ever-evolving career, punk's reigning contrarians continue to make bold, unpredictable music while staying true to the punk ethos.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["REVENGE","OF","THE","MEKONS","chart","the","unlik","career","of","the","genre-defi","collect","notori","for","be","--","as","rock","critic","Greil","Marcus","note","--","\"","the","band","that","took","punk","ideolog","most","serious",".","\"","Born","out","of","the","1977","British","punk","scene",",","the","Mekon","progress","from","a","group","of","socialist","art","student","with","no","music","skill","to","the","prolif",",","raucous","progeni","of","Hank","William",".","Joe","Angio","'s","exuber","documentari","follow","their","improb","histori","-","a","surpris","and","influenti","embrac","of","folk","and","countri","music",",","foray","into","the","art","world","and","consist","bad","luck","with","major","record","label",".","Featur","interview","with","celebr","fan",",","from","author","Jonathan","Franzen","to","film","director","Mari","Harron","to","comedian/musician","Fred","Armisen",",","REVENGE","OF","THE","MEKONS","reveal","how",",","four","decad","into","an","ever-evolv","career",",","punk","'s","reign","contrarian","continu","to","make","bold",",","unpredict","music","while","stay","true","to","the","punk","etho","."],"lemmas":["revenge","of","the","mekons","chart","the","unlikely","career","of","the","genre-defying","collective","notorious","for","be","--","as","rock","critic","Greil","Marcus","note","--","``","the","band","that","take","punk","ideology","most","seriously",".","''","bear","out","of","the","1977","british","punk","scene",",","the","Mekons","progress","from","a","group","of","socialist","art","student","with","no","musical","skill","to","the","prolific",",","raucous","progeny","of","Hank","Williams",".","Joe","Angio","'s","exuberant","documentary","follow","they","improbable","history","-","a","surprising","and","influential","embrace","of","folk","and","country","music",",","foray","into","the","art","world","and","consistent","bad","luck","with","major","record","label",".","feature","interview","with","celebrated","fan",",","from","author","Jonathan","Franzen","to","film","director","Mary","Harron","to","comedian/musician","Fred","Armisen",",","REVENGE","of","the","mekons","reveal","how",",","four","decade","into","a","ever-evolving","career",",","punk","'s","reign","contrarian","continue","to","make","bold",",","unpredictable","music","while","stay","true","to","the","punk","ethos","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["REVENGE OF THE","OF THE MEKONS","THE MEKONS charts","MEKONS charts the","charts the unlikely","the unlikely career","unlikely career of","career of the","of the genre-defying","the genre-defying collective","genre-defying collective notorious","collective notorious for","notorious for being","for being --","being -- as","-- as rock","as rock critic","rock critic Greil","critic Greil Marcus","Greil Marcus notes","Marcus notes --","notes -- \"","-- \" the","\" the band","the band that","band that took","that took punk","took punk ideology","punk ideology most","ideology most seriously","most seriously .","seriously . \"","Born out of","out of the","of the 1977","the 1977 British","1977 British punk","British punk scene","punk scene ,","scene , the",", the Mekons","the Mekons progressed","Mekons progressed from","progressed from a","from a group","a group of","group of socialist","of socialist art","socialist art students","art students with","students with no","with no musical","no musical skills","musical skills to","skills to the","to the prolific","the prolific ,","prolific , raucous",", raucous progeny","raucous progeny of","progeny of Hank","of Hank Williams","Joe Angio 's","Angio 's exuberant","'s exuberant documentary","exuberant documentary follows","documentary follows their","follows their improbable","their improbable history","improbable history -","history -

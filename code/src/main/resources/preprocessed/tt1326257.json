{"title":"The Road Home","plot":"If duty compelled you to serve your country at wartime, and you returned home as an amputee, perhaps with a traumatic brain injury, how would you deal? The Road Home follows six recent American veterans from varied backgrounds as they travel the hard road back to their former lives with the dedicated Achilles Track Club. From their first shaky steps at Walter Reed towards a year long odyssey to train for and complete the NY Marathon, we follow their road home.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["If","duti","compel","you","to","serv","your","countri","at","wartim",",","and","you","return","home","as","an","ampute",",","perhap","with","a","traumat","brain","injuri",",","how","would","you","deal","?","The","Road","Home","follow","six","recent","American","veteran","from","vari","background","as","they","travel","the","hard","road","back","to","their","former","live","with","the","dedic","Achill","Track","Club",".","From","their","first","shaki","step","at","Walter","Reed","toward","a","year","long","odyssey","to","train","for","and","complet","the","NY","Marathon",",","we","follow","their","road","home","."],"lemmas":["if","duty","compel","you","to","serve","you","country","at","wartime",",","and","you","return","home","as","a","amputee",",","perhaps","with","a","traumatic","brain","injury",",","how","would","you","deal","?","the","Road","Home","follow","six","recent","american","veteran","from","varied","background","as","they","travel","the","hard","road","back","to","they","former","life","with","the","dedicated","Achilles","Track","Club",".","from","they","first","shaky","step","at","Walter","Reed","towards","a","year","long","odyssey","to","train","for","and","complete","the","NY","Marathon",",","we","follow","they","road","home","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["If duty compelled","duty compelled you","compelled you to","you to serve","to serve your","serve your country","your country at","country at wartime","at wartime ,","wartime , and",", and you","and you returned","you returned home","returned home as","home as an","as an amputee","an amputee ,","amputee , perhaps",", perhaps with","perhaps with a","with a traumatic","a traumatic brain","traumatic brain injury","brain injury ,","injury , how",", how would","how would you","would you deal","The Road Home","Road Home follows","Home follows six","follows six recent","six recent American","recent American veterans","American veterans from","veterans from varied","from varied backgrounds","varied backgrounds as","backgrounds as they","as they travel","they travel the","travel the hard","the hard road","hard road back","road back to","back to their","to their former","their former lives","former lives with","lives with the","with the dedicated","the dedicated Achilles","dedicated Achilles Track","Achilles Track Club","From their first","their first shaky","first shaky steps","shaky steps at","steps at Walter","at Walter Reed","Walter Reed towards","Reed towards a","towards a year","a year long","year long odyssey","long odyssey to","odyssey to train","to train for","train for and","for and complete","and complete the","complete the NY","the NY Marathon","NY Marathon ,","Marathon , we",", we follow","we follow their","follow their road","their road home"],"2grams":["If duty","duty compelled","compelled you","you to","to serve","serve your","your country","country at","at wartime","wartime ,",", and","and you","you returned","returned home","home as","as an","an amputee","amputee ,",", perhaps","perhaps with","with a","a traumatic","traumatic brain","brain injury","injury ,",", how","how would","would you","you deal","The Road","Road Home","Home follows","follows six","six recent","recent American","American veterans","veterans from","from varied","varied backgrounds","backgrounds as","as they","they travel","travel the","the hard","hard road","road back","back to","to their","their former","former lives","lives with","with the","the dedicated","dedicated Achilles","Achilles Track","Track Club","From their","their first","first shaky","shaky steps","steps at","at Walter","Walter Reed","Reed towards","towards a","a year","year long","long odyssey","odyssey to","to train","train for","for and","and complete","complete the","the NY","NY Marathon","Marathon ,",", we","we follow","follow their","their road","road home"]}

{"title":"Let Um Hear Ya Comin","plot":"'let um hear ya comin' is the story of the Northern Ca. Chapter of the Black Riders Liberation Party New Generation Black Panther Party for Self Defense (BRLP). BRLP is a revolutionary organization founded in the YTS gang prison in Los Angeles fifteen years ago. BRLP was founded by Bloods and Cripps who while in prison realized the ignorance of their fighting each other and pledged unity in fighting their common enemies, police brutality and racism. The northern Ca. chapter was founded in 2010 during Oakland uprisings around the police murder of Oscar Grant. The 'let um hear ya comin' documentary was completed during two years of participatory observation by the filmmaker who shadowed BRLP during its confrontational political activities in four northern California cities.","genres":["Action","

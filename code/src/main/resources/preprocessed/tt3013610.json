{"title":"Mia Madre","plot":"These are hard days for Margherita, who is going through a very difficult period in her life. On a professional level first, the middle-aged film director, has started wondering whether the committed movies she has been making are really an actual reflection of the world she lives in ; on top of this, she is in conflict not only with her crew but also, and primarily, with Barry Huggins, a well-known American actor of Italian origin, who proves awfully bad and uncontrollable. On the personal level, things do not get any better - it could even be said they are worse. Margherita has just left her life partner and she has become unable to relate to her teenage daughter. As for her mother, she is now seriously ill and her doctor tries to prepare her brother and her for the worst. Which is unacceptable to the weakened woman who can find salvation only in denial of reality. Will she manage to face up to the facts and to come to terms with herself?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["These","are","hard","day","for","Margherita",",","who","is","go","through","a","veri","difficult","period","in","her","life",".","On","a","profession","level","first",",","the","middle-ag","film","director",",","has","start","wonder","whether","the","commit","movi","she","has","been","make","are","realli","an","actual","reflect","of","the","world","she","live","in",";","on","top","of","this",",","she","is","in","conflict","not","onli","with","her","crew","but","also",",","and","primarili",",","with","Barri","Huggin",",","a","well-known","American","actor","of","Italian","origin",",","who","prove","aw","bad","and","uncontrol",".","On","the","person","level",",","thing","do","not","get","ani","better","-","it","could","even","be","said","they","are","wors",".","Margherita","has","just","left","her","life","partner","and","she","has","becom","unabl","to","relat","to","her","teenag","daughter",".","As","for","her","mother",",","she","is","now","serious","ill","and","her","doctor","tri","to","prepar","her","brother","and","her","for","the","worst",".","Which","is","unaccept","to","the","weaken","woman","who","can","find","salvat","onli","in","denial","of","realiti",".","Will","she","manag","to","face","up","to","the","fact","and","to","come","to","term","with","herself","?"],"lemmas":["these","be","hard","day","for","Margherita",",","who","be","go","through","a","very","difficult","period","in","she","life",".","on","a","professional","level","first",",","the","middle-aged","film","director",",","have","start","wonder","whether","the","committed","movie","she","have","be","make","be","really","a","actual","reflection","of","the","world","she","live","in",";","on","top","of","this",",","she","be","in","conflict","not","only","with","she","crew","but","also",",","and","primarily",",","with","Barry","Huggins",",","a","well-known","american","actor","of","italian","origin",",","who","prove","awfully","bad","and","uncontrollable",".","on","the","personal","level",",","thing","do","not","get","any","better","-","it","could","even","be","say","they","be","worse",".","Margherita","have","just","leave","she","life","partner","and","she","have","become","unable","to","relate","to","she","teenage","daughter",".","as","for","she","mother",",","she","be","now","seriously","ill","and","she","doctor","try","to","prepare","she","brother","and","she","for","the","worst",".","which","be","unacceptable","to","the","weakened","woman","who","can","find","salvation","only","in","denial","of","reality",".","will","she","manage","to","face","up","to","the","fact","and","to","come","to","term","with","herself","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["These are hard","are hard days","hard days for","days for Margherita","for Margherita ,","Margherita , who",", who is","who is going","is going through","going through a","through a very","a very difficult","very difficult period","difficult period in","period in her","in her life","On a professional","a professional level","professional level first","level first ,","first , the",", the middle-aged","the middle-aged film","middle-aged film director","film director ,","director , has",", has started","has started wondering","started wondering whether","wondering whether the","whether the committed","the committed movies","committed movies she","movies she has","she has been","has been making","been making are","making are really","are really an","really an actual","an actual reflection","actual reflection of","reflection of the","of the world","the world she","world she lives","she lives in","lives in ;","in ;

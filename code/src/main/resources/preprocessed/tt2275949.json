{"title":"Silence","plot":"Eoghan is a sound recordist who is returning to Ireland for the first time in 15 years. His reason for returning is a job offer: to find and record places free from man-made sound. His quest takes him away from towns and villages into remote terrain. Throughout his journey, he is drawn into a series of encounters and conversations which gradually divert his attention towards a more intangible silence, one that is bound up with the sounds of the life he had left behind. Influenced by elements of folklore and archive, Silence unfolds with a quiet intensity, where poetic images reveal an absorbing meditation on themes relating to sound and silence, history, memory and exile.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Eoghan","is","a","sound","recordist","who","is","return","to","Ireland","for","the","first","time","in","15","year",".","His","reason","for","return","is","a","job","offer",":","to","find","and","record","place","free","from","man-mad","sound",".","His","quest","take","him","away","from","town","and","villag","into","remot","terrain",".","Throughout","his","journey",",","he","is","drawn","into","a","seri","of","encount","and","convers","which","gradual","divert","his","attent","toward","a","more","intang","silenc",",","one","that","is","bound","up","with","the","sound","of","the","life","he","had","left","behind",".","Influenc","by","element","of","folklor","and","archiv",",","Silenc","unfold","with","a","quiet","intens",",","where","poetic","imag","reveal","an","absorb","medit","on","theme","relat","to","sound","and","silenc",",","histori",",","memori","and","exil","."],"lemmas":["Eoghan","be","a","sound","recordist","who","be","return","to","Ireland","for","the","first","time","in","15","year",".","he","reason","for","return","be","a","job","offer",":","to","find","and","record","place","free","from","man-made","sound",".","he","quest","take","he","away","from","town","and","village","into","remote","terrain",".","throughout","he","journey",",","he","be","draw","into","a","series","of","encounter","and","conversation","which","gradually","divert","he","attention","towards","a","more","intangible","silence",",","one","that","be","bind","up","with","the","sound","of","the","life","he","have","leave","behind",".","Influenced","by","element","of","folklore","and","archive",",","silence","unfold","with","a","quiet","intensity",",","where","poetic","image","reveal","a","absorb","meditation","on","theme","relate","to","sound","and","silence",",","history",",","memory","and","exile","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Eoghan

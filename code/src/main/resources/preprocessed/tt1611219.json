{"title":"What Are We Waiting For?","plot":"During the Korean War, there were many married couples divided by the chaotic state of war without knowing whether the other one was alive or dead. In 2000, a decision to reunite separated families was implemented. The most tragic thing was reunions of South Korean wives who had been waiting for their husbands to return for more than 50 years and their husbands who ended up having new families in North Korea. Why would they wait for their husbands for so long? What are their feelings like after meeting their husbands who didn't wait for them? This is a documentary about the Korean War and the sad romantic relationships viewed from a single Korean woman.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Dure","the","Korean","War",",","there","were","mani","marri","coupl","divid","by","the","chaotic","state","of","war","without","know","whether","the","other","one","was","aliv","or","dead",".","In","2000",",","a","decis","to","reunit","separ","famili","was","implement",".","The","most","tragic","thing","was","reunion","of","South","Korean","wive","who","had","been","wait","for","their","husband","to","return","for","more","than","50","year","and","their","husband","who","end","up","have","new","famili","in","North","Korea",".","Whi","would","they","wait","for","their","husband","for","so","long","?","What","are","their","feel","like","after","meet","their","husband","who","did","n't","wait","for","them","?","This","is","a","documentari","about","the","Korean","War","and","the","sad","romant","relationship","view","from","a","singl","Korean","woman","."],"lemmas":["during","the","Korean","War",",","there","be","many","married","couple","divide","by","the","chaotic","state","of","war","without","know","whether","the","other","one","be","alive","or","dead",".","in","2000",",","a","decision","to","reunite","separated","family","be","implement",".","the","most","tragic","thing","be","reunion","of","south","korean","wife","who","have","be","wait","for","they","husband","to","return","for","more","than","50","year","and","they","husband","who","end","up","have","new","family","in","North","Korea",".","why","would","they","wait","for","they","husband","for","so","long","?","what","be","they","feeling","like","after","meet","they","husband","who","do","not","wait","for","they","?","this","be","a","documentary","about","the","Korean","War","and","the","sad","romantic","relationship","view","from","a","single","korean","woman","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["During

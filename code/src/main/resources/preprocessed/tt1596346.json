{"title":"Soul Surfer","plot":"13 year-old Bethany Hamilton is a champion surfer who was born to be in the water. But after a fun night out night surfing and what should be a fun day in the water, she is attacked by a shark and loses her arm. Rushed to the hospital, she remains calm, and maintains her faith in God. Now she has to re-learn how to do everything with only one arm - including how to surf. It will take her friends, family, and her Christian faith to get her back into the water, but if that is where she is meant to be, she will find a way to get there.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["13","year-old","Bethani","Hamilton","is","a","champion","surfer","who","was","born","to","be","in","the","water",".","But","after","a","fun","night","out","night","surf","and","what","should","be","a","fun","day","in","the","water",",","she","is","attack","by","a","shark","and","lose","her","arm",".","Rush","to","the","hospit",",","she","remain","calm",",","and","maintain","her","faith","in","God",".","Now","she","has","to","re-learn","how","to","do","everyth","with","onli","one","arm","-","includ","how","to","surf",".","It","will","take","her","friend",",","famili",",","and","her","Christian","faith","to","get","her","back","into","the","water",",","but","if","that","is","where","she","is","meant","to","be",",","she","will","find","a","way","to","get","there","."],"lemmas":["13","year-old","Bethany","Hamilton","be","a","champion","surfer","who","be","bear","to","be","in","the","water",".","but","after","a","fun","night","out","night","surfing","and","what","should","be","a","fun","day","in","the","water",",","she","be","attack","by","a","shark","and","lose","she","arm",".","rush","to","the","hospital",",","she","remain","calm",",","and","maintain","she","faith","in","God",".","now","she","have","to","re-learn","how","to","do","everything","with","only","one","arm","-","include","how","to","surf",".","it","will","take","she","friend",",","family",",","and","she","christian","faith","to","get","she","back","into","the","water",",","but","if","that","be","where","she","be","mean","to","be",",","she","will","find","a","way","to","get","there","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["13 year-old Bethany","year-old Bethany Hamilton","Bethany Hamilton is","Hamilton is a","is a champion","a champion surfer","champion surfer who","surfer who was","who was born","was born to","born to be","to be in","be in the","in the water","But after a","after a fun","a fun night","fun night out","night out night","out night surfing","night surfing and","surfing and what","and what should","what should be","should be a","be a fun","a fun day","fun day in","day in the","in the water","the water ,","water , she",", she is","she is attacked","is attacked by","attacked by a","by a shark","a shark and","shark and loses","and loses her","loses her arm","Rushed to the","to the hospital","the hospital ,","hospital , she",", she remains","she remains calm","remains calm ,","calm , and",", and maintains","and maintains her","maintains her faith","her faith in","faith in God","Now she has","she has to","has to re-learn","to re-learn how","re-learn how to","how to do","to do everything","do everything with","everything with only","with only one","only one arm","one arm -","arm - including","- including how","including how to","how to surf","It will take","will take her","take her friends","her friends ,","friends , family",", family ,","family , and",", and her","and her Christian","her Christian faith","Christian faith to","faith to get","to get her","get her back","her back into","back into the","into the water","the water ,","water , but",", but if","but if that","if that is","that is where","is where she","where she is","she is meant","is meant to","meant to be","to be ,","be , she",", she will","she will find","will find a","find a way","a way to","way to get","to get there"],"2grams":["13 year-old","year-old Bethany","Bethany Hamilton","Hamilton is","is a","a champion","champion surfer","surfer who","who was","was born","born to","to be","be in","in the","the water","But after","after a","a fun","fun night","night out","out night","night surfing","surfing and","and what","what should","should be","be a","a fun","fun day","day in","in the","the water","water ,",", she","she is","is attacked","attacked by","by a","a shark","shark and","and loses","loses her","her arm","Rushed to","to the","the hospital","hospital ,",", she","she remains","remains calm","calm ,",", and","and maintains","maintains her","her faith","faith in","in God","Now she","she has","has to","to re-learn","re-learn how","how to","to do","do everything","everything with","with only","only one","one arm","arm -","- including","including how","how to","to surf","It will","will take","take her","her friends","friends ,",", family","family ,",", and","and her","her Christian","Christian faith","faith to","to get","get her","her back","back into","into the","the water","water ,",", but","but if","if that","that is","is where","where she","she is","is meant","meant to","to be","be ,",", she","she will","will find","find a","a way","way to","to get","get there"]}

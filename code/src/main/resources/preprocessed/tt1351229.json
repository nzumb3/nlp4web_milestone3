{"title":"Rock Music Rock Art","plot":"'Rock Music, Rock Art' is a cultural exchange adventure that sets out to discover musical sounds of our earliest ancestors and fuse two very different music styles. A group of contemporary western classical musicians, a composer from Edinburgh, and several traditional Ugandan musicians journeyed in perilous canoes to a remote island in Lake Victoria to make music using the most elaborate prehistoric 'rock gongs' on the African continent. They discover a new gong with notes that suggest this beautiful granite landscape could have been the original birthplace of both African and European musical scales.","genres":["Documentary","

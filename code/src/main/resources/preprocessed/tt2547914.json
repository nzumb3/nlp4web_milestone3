{"title":"On the Cusp, Off the Cuff","plot":"A sociologist and improv comedian, filmmaker Nate Dern follows five aspiring comedians hoping to make it onto a house team at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre. Since its founding in 1998, the UCB Theatre has become a training ground for the country's next generation of comedic talent. This film explores the motivations and dreams of five comedy hopefuls, while providing an insider's look into the exclusive New York City improv comedy community. The filmmaker's own journey through the UCB system - from student to performer to teacher to artistic director of the theatre - is woven throughout the film. This film takes a serious look at improv comedy.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["A","sociologist","and","improv","comedian",",","filmmak","Nate","Dern","follow","five","aspir","comedian","hope","to","make","it","onto","a","hous","team","at","the","Upright","Citizen","Brigad","Theatr",".","Sinc","it","found","in","1998",",","the","UCB","Theatr","has","becom","a","train","ground","for","the","countri","'s","next","generat","of","comed","talent",".","This","film","explor","the","motiv","and","dream","of","five","comedi","hope",",","while","provid","an","insid","'s","look","into","the","exclus","New","York","Citi","improv","comedi","communiti",".","The","filmmak","'s","own","journey","through","the","UCB","system","-","from","student","to","perform","to","teacher","to","artist","director","of","the","theatr","-","is","woven","throughout","the","film",".","This","film","take","a","serious","look","at","improv","comedi","."],"lemmas":["a","sociologist","and","improv","comedian",",","filmmaker","Nate","Dern","follow","five","aspiring","comedian","hope","to","make","it","onto","a","house","team","at","the","Upright","Citizens","brigade","Theatre",".","since","its","founding","in","1998",",","the","UCB","Theatre","have","become","a","training","ground","for","the","country","'s","next","generation","of","comedic","talent",".","this","film","explore","the","motivation","and","dream","of","five","comedy","hopeful",",","while","provide","a","insider","'s","look","into","the","exclusive","New","York","City","improv","comedy","community",".","the","filmmaker","'s","own","journey","through","the","UCB","system","-","from","student","to","performer","to","teacher","to","artistic","director","of","the","theatre","-","be","weave","throughout","the","film",".","this","film","take","a","serious","look","at","improv","comedy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A sociologist and","sociologist and improv","and improv comedian","improv comedian ,","comedian , filmmaker",", filmmaker Nate","filmmaker Nate Dern","Nate Dern follows","Dern follows five","follows five aspiring","five aspiring comedians","aspiring comedians hoping","comedians hoping to","hoping to make","to make it","make it onto","it onto a","onto a house","a house team","house team at","team at the","at the Upright","the Upright Citizens","Upright Citizens Brigade","Citizens Brigade Theatre","Since its founding","its founding in","founding in 1998","in 1998 ,","1998 , the",", the UCB","the UCB Theatre","UCB Theatre has","Theatre has become","has become a","become a training","a training ground","training ground for","ground for the","for the country","the country 's","country 's next","'s next generation","next generation of","generation of comedic","of comedic talent","This film explores","film explores the","explores the motivations","the motivations and","motivations and dreams","and dreams of","dreams of five","of five comedy","five comedy hopefuls","comedy hopefuls ,","hopefuls , while",", while providing","while providing an","providing an insider","an insider 's","insider 's look","'s look into","look into the","into the exclusive","the exclusive New","exclusive New York","New York City","York City improv","City improv comedy","improv comedy community","The filmmaker 's","filmmaker 's own","'s own journey","own journey through","journey through the","through the UCB","the UCB system","UCB system -","system -

{"title":"Pandorum","plot":"Two crew members are stranded on a spacecraft and quickly - and horrifically - realize they are not alone. Two astronauts awaken in a hyper-sleep chamber aboard a seemingly abandoned spacecraft. It's pitch black, they are disoriented, and the only sound is a low rumble and creak from the belly of the ship. They can't remember anything: Who are they? What is their mission? With Lt. Payton staying behind to guide him via radio transmitter, Cpl. Bower ventures deep into the ship and begins to uncover a terrifying reality. Slowly the spacecraft's shocking, deadly secrets are revealed...and the astronauts find their own survival is more important than they could ever have imagined.","genres":["Action"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["Two","crew","member","are","strand","on","a","spacecraft","and","quick","-","and","horrif","-","realiz","they","are","not","alon",".","Two","astronaut","awaken","in","a","hyper-sleep","chamber","aboard","a","seem","abandon","spacecraft",".","It","'s","pitch","black",",","they","are","disori",",","and","the","onli","sound","is","a","low","rumbl","and","creak","from","the","belli","of","the","ship",".","They","ca","n't","rememb","anyth",":","Who","are","they","?","What","is","their","mission","?","With","Lt.","Payton","stay","behind","to","guid","him","via","radio","transmitt",",","Cpl.","Bower","ventur","deep","into","the","ship","and","begin","to","uncov","a","terrifi","realiti",".","Slowli","the","spacecraft","'s","shock",",","dead","secret","are","reveal","...","and","the","astronaut","find","their","own","surviv","is","more","import","than","they","could","ever","have","imagin","."],"lemmas":["two","crew","member","be","strand","on","a","spacecraft","and","quickly","-","and","horrifically","-","realize","they","be","not","alone",".","two","astronaut","awaken","in","a","hyper-sleep","chamber","aboard","a","seemingly","abandon","spacecraft",".","it","be","pitch","black",",","they","be","disoriented",",","and","the","only","sound","be","a","low","rumble","and","creak","from","the","belly","of","the","ship",".","they","can","not","remember","anything",":","who","be","they","?","what","be","they","mission","?","with","Lt.","Payton","staying","behind","to","guide","he","via","radio","transmitter",",","Cpl.","Bower","venture","deep","into","the","ship","and","begin","to","uncover","a","terrifying","reality",".","slowly","the","spacecraft","'s","shocking",",","deadly","secret","be","reveal","...","and","the","astronaut","find","they","own","survival","be","more","important","than","they","could","ever","have","imagine","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two crew members","crew members are","members are stranded","are stranded on","stranded on a","on a spacecraft","a spacecraft and","spacecraft and quickly","and quickly -","quickly - and","- and horrifically","and horrifically -","horrifically - realize","- realize they","realize they are","they are not","are not alone","Two astronauts awaken","astronauts awaken in","awaken in a","in a hyper-sleep","a hyper-sleep chamber","hyper-sleep chamber aboard","chamber aboard a","aboard a seemingly","a seemingly abandoned","seemingly abandoned spacecraft","It 's pitch","'s pitch black","pitch black ,","black , they",", they are","they are disoriented","are disoriented ,","disoriented , and",", and the","and the only","the only sound","only sound is","sound is a","is a low","a low rumble","low rumble and","rumble and creak","and creak from","creak from the","from the belly","the belly of","belly of the","of the ship","They ca n't","ca n't remember","n't remember anything","remember anything :","anything : Who",": Who are","Who are they","What is their","is their mission","With Lt.

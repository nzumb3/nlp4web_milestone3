{"title":"Nuclear Neighbourhood","plot":"Nuclear Neighbourhood is a Independent feature horror comedy film written & directed by Matthew J Oliver. Produced by Megan Schultz and Matthew J Oliver from Oliverschultz Film . This film was made on a very tight budget, we like to call it a punk-DIY 80's throwback film. Local punk bands/artists/musicians and actors were involved in the making of the production. We think this film has a unique B-movie 80's horror feel that some might compare to the rawness of John Waters films meets the Cult Killer B genre of underground cinema.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"],"stems":["Nuclear","Neighbourhood","is","a","Independ","featur","horror","comedi","film","written","&","direct","by","Matthew","J","Oliver",".","Produc","by","Megan","Schultz","and","Matthew","J","Oliver","from","Oliverschultz","Film",".","This","film","was","made","on","a","veri","tight","budget",",","we","like","to","call","it","a","punk-DIi","80","'s","throwback","film",".","Local","punk","bands/artists/musician","and","actor","were","involv","in","the","make","of","the","product",".","We","think","this","film","has","a","uniqu","B-movi","80","'s","horror","feel","that","some","might","compar","to","the","raw","of","John","Water","film","meet","the","Cult","Killer","B","genr","of","underground","cinema","."],"lemmas":["Nuclear","Neighbourhood","be","a","Independent","feature","horror","comedy","film","write","&","direct","by","Matthew","J","Oliver",".","produce","by","Megan","Schultz","and","Matthew","J","Oliver","from","Oliverschultz","Film",".","this","film","be","make","on","a","very","tight","budget",",","we","like","to","call","it","a","punk-diy","80","'s","throwback","film",".","local","punk","bands/artists/musicians","and","actor","be","involve","in","the","making","of","the","production",".","we","think","this","film","have","a","unique","b-movie","80","'s","horror","feel","that","some","might","compare","to","the","rawness","of","John","Waters","film","meet","the","cult","killer","b","genre","of","underground","cinema","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nuclear Neighbourhood is","Neighbourhood is a","is a Independent","a Independent feature","Independent feature horror","feature horror comedy","horror comedy film","comedy film written","film written &","written & directed","& directed by","directed by Matthew","by Matthew J","Matthew J Oliver","Produced by Megan","by Megan Schultz","Megan Schultz and","Schultz and Matthew","and Matthew J","Matthew J Oliver","J Oliver from","Oliver from Oliverschultz","from Oliverschultz Film","This film was","film was made","was made on","made on a","on a very","a very tight","very tight budget","tight budget ,","budget , we",", we like","we like to","like to call","to call it","call it a","it a punk-DIY","a punk-DIY 80","punk-DIY 80 's","80 's throwback","'s throwback film","Local punk bands/artists/musicians","punk bands/artists/musicians and","bands/artists/musicians and actors","and actors were","actors were involved","were involved in","involved in the","in the making","the making of","making of the","of the production","We think this","think this film","this film has","film has a","has a unique","a unique B-movie","unique B-movie 80","B-movie 80 's","80 's horror","'s horror feel","horror feel that","feel that some","that some might","some might compare","might compare to","compare to the","to the rawness","the rawness of","rawness of John","of John Waters","John Waters films","Waters films meets","films meets the","meets the Cult","the Cult Killer","Cult Killer B","Killer B genre","B genre of","genre of underground","of underground cinema"],"2grams":["Nuclear Neighbourhood","Neighbourhood is","is a","a Independent","Independent feature","feature horror","horror comedy","comedy film","film written","written &","& directed","directed by","by Matthew","Matthew J","J Oliver","Produced by","by Megan","Megan Schultz","Schultz and","and Matthew","Matthew J","J Oliver","Oliver from","from Oliverschultz","Oliverschultz Film","This film","film was","was made","made on","on a","a very","very tight","tight budget","budget ,",", we","we like","like to","to call","call it","it a","a punk-DIY","punk-DIY 80","80 's","'s throwback","throwback film","Local punk","punk bands/artists/musicians","bands/artists/musicians and","and actors","actors were","were involved","involved in","in the","the making","making of","of the","the production","We think","think this","this film","film has","has a","a unique","unique B-movie","B-movie 80","80 's","'s horror","horror feel","feel that","that some","some might","might compare","compare to","to the","the rawness","rawness of","of John","John Waters","Waters films","films meets","meets the","the Cult","Cult Killer","Killer B","B genre","genre of","of underground","underground cinema"]}

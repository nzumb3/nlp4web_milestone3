{"title":"Manchester by the Sea","plot":"Lee Chandler is a brooding, irritable loner who works as a handyman for a Boston apartment block. One damp winter day he gets a call summoning him to his hometown, north of the city. His brother's heart has given out suddenly, and he's been named guardian to his 16-year-old nephew. As if losing his only sibling and doubts about raising a teenager weren't enough, his return to the past re-opens an unspeakable tragedy.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Lee","Chandler","is","a","brood",",","irrit","loner","who","work","as","a","handyman","for","a","Boston","apart","block",".","One","damp","winter","day","he","get","a","call","summon","him","to","his","hometown",",","north","of","the","citi",".","His","brother","'s","heart","has","given","out","sudden",",","and","he","'s","been","name","guardian","to","his","16-year-old","nephew",".","As","if","lose","his","onli","sibl","and","doubt","about","rais","a","teenag","were","n't","enough",",","his","return","to","the","past","re-open","an","unspeak","tragedi","."],"lemmas":["Lee","Chandler","be","a","brooding",",","irritable","loner","who","work","as","a","handyman","for","a","Boston","apartment","block",".","one","damp","winter","day","he","get","a","call","summon","he","to","he","hometown",",","north","of","the","city",".","he","brother","'s","heart","have","give","out","suddenly",",","and","he","be","be","name","guardian","to","he","16-year-old","nephew",".","as","if","lose","he","only","sibling","and","doubt","about","raise","a","teenager","be","not","enough",",","he","return","to","the","past","re-open","a","unspeakable","tragedy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Lee Chandler is","Chandler is a","is a brooding","a brooding ,","brooding , irritable",", irritable loner","irritable loner who","loner who works","who works as","works as a","as a handyman","a handyman for","handyman for a","for a Boston","a Boston apartment","Boston apartment block","One damp winter","damp winter day","winter day he","day he gets","he gets a","gets a call","a call summoning","call summoning him","summoning him to","him to his","to his hometown","his hometown ,","hometown , north",", north of","north of the","of the city","His brother 's","brother 's heart","'s heart has","heart has given","has given out","given out suddenly","out suddenly ,","suddenly , and",", and he","and he 's","he 's been","'s been named","been named guardian","named guardian to","guardian to his","to his 16-year-old","his 16-year-old nephew","As if losing","if losing his","losing his only","his only sibling","only sibling and","sibling and doubts","and doubts about","doubts about raising","about raising a","raising a teenager","a teenager were","teenager were n't","were n't enough","n't enough ,","enough , his",", his return","his return to","return to the","to the past","the past re-opens","past re-opens an","re-opens an unspeakable","an unspeakable tragedy"],"2grams":["Lee Chandler","Chandler is","is a","a brooding","brooding ,",", irritable","irritable loner","loner who","who works","works as","as a","a handyman","handyman for","for a","a Boston","Boston apartment","apartment block","One damp","damp winter","winter day","day he","he gets","gets a","a call","call summoning","summoning him","him to","to his","his hometown","hometown ,",", north","north of","of the","the city","His brother","brother 's","'s heart","heart has","has given","given out","out suddenly","suddenly ,",", and","and he","he 's","'s been","been named","named guardian","guardian to","to his","his 16-year-old","16-year-old nephew","As if","if losing","losing his","his only","only sibling","sibling and","and doubts","doubts about","about raising","raising a","a teenager","teenager were","were n't","n't enough","enough ,",", his","his return","return to","to the","the past","past re-opens","re-opens an","an unspeakable","unspeakable tragedy"]}

{"title":"Easy Money II: Hard to Kill","plot":"JW (Joel Kinnaman, Robocop, The Killing), the promising business student who became an organized coke smuggler in Easy Money, is serving hard time in prison and struggling to get back on an honest path. There are glimmers of hope in his life - some venture capitalists are interested in a new piece of trading software he's developed, and while behind bars he's made peace with an old enemy. This all proves to be an illusion. On leave from prison, and back in contact with his former gang, JW learns that once you've walked in the shoes of a criminal there just may be no going back.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["JW","(","Joel","Kinnaman",",","Robocop",",","The","Kill",")",",","the","promis","busi","student","who","becam","an","organ","coke","smuggler","in","Easi","Money",",","is","serv","hard","time","in","prison","and","struggl","to","get","back","on","an","honest","path",".","There","are","glimmer","of","hope","in","his","life","-","some","ventur","capitalist","are","interest","in","a","new","piec","of","trade","softwar","he","'s","develop",",","and","while","behind","bar","he","'s","made","peac","with","an","old","enemi",".","This","all","prove","to","be","an","illus",".","On","leav","from","prison",",","and","back","in","contact","with","his","former","gang",",","JW","learn","that","onc","you","ve","walk","in","the","shoe","of","a","crimin","there","just","may","be","no","go","back","."],"lemmas":["jw","-lrb-","Joel","Kinnaman",",","Robocop",",","The","Killing","-rrb-",",","the","promising","business","student","who","become","a","organize","coke","smuggler","in","Easy","Money",",","be","serve","hard","time","in","prison","and","struggle","to","get","back","on","a","honest","path",".","there","be","glimmer","of","hope","in","he","life","-","some","venture","capitalist","be","interested","in","a","new","piece","of","trading","software","he","be","develop",",","and","while","behind","bar","he","be","make","peace","with","a","old","enemy",".","this","all","prove","to","be","a","illusion",".","on","leave","from","prison",",","and","back","in","contact","with","he","former","gang",",","jw","learn","that","once","you","have","walk","in","the","shoe","of","a","criminal","there","just","may","be","no","go","back","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["JW ( Joel","( Joel Kinnaman","Joel Kinnaman ,","Kinnaman , Robocop",", Robocop ,","Robocop , The",", The Killing","The Killing )","Killing ) ,",") , the",", the promising","the promising business","promising business student","business student who","student who became","who became an","became an organized","an organized coke","organized coke smuggler","coke smuggler in","smuggler in Easy","in Easy Money","Easy Money ,","Money , is",", is serving","is serving hard","serving hard time","hard time in","time in prison","in prison and","prison and struggling","and struggling to","struggling to get","to get back","get back on","back on an","on an honest","an honest path","There are glimmers","are glimmers of","glimmers of hope","of hope in","hope in his","in his life","his life -","life -

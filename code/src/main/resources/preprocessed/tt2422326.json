{"title":"In the Shadow of the Sun","plot":"Ukerewe Island, in Tanzania is home to a large community of people who live with albinism. While many albinos are killed at birth or rejected by their families, those who survive risk being murdered for their body parts. Told over the course of five years, In the Shadow Of The Sun tells the story of two members of the Tanzanian Albino Society. We follow Vedastus, a teenage boy as he struggles to find a place in the world, and Josephat, a strong-willed advocate for people with albinism, who fights to unite his country and dreams of scaling the heights of Kilimanjaro. As the brutal wave of murders escalate Vedastus flees the island in search of safety whilst Josephat stands and faces the killings head on.","genres":["Biography"," Drama","

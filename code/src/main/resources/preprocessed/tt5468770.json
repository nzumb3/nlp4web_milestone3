{"title":"Rights of Passage","plot":"Rights of Passage is an anthology fictional feature-film made by first-time young black filmmakers who were born when Nelson Mandela became South Africa's first democratically elected President and who entered young adulthood during the last years of Mandela's remarkable life. It is an anthology of 8 short films linked by a theme and African proverbs that delicately reflect on and explore the challenges of intimacy and change: the search for love, belonging and healing while navigating the rites and turmoil of everyday life. It offers a rare, honest, resilient and creative insight into the concerns and experiences of black youth in contemporary South Africa.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Right","of","Passag","is","an","antholog","fiction","feature-film","made","by","first-tim","young","black","filmmak","who","were","born","when","Nelson","Mandela","becam","South","Africa","'s","first","democrat","elect","Presid","and","who","enter","young","adulthood","dure","the","last","year","of","Mandela","'s","remark","life",".","It","is","an","antholog","of","8","short","film","link","by","a","theme","and","African","proverb","that","delic","reflect","on","and","explor","the","challeng","of","intimaci","and","chang",":","the","search","for","love",",","belong","and","heal","while","navig","the","rite","and","turmoil","of","everyday","life",".","It","offer","a","rare",",","honest",",","resili","and","creativ","insight","into","the","concern","and","experi","of","black","youth","in","contemporari","South","Africa","."],"lemmas":["rights","of","passage","be","a","anthology","fictional","feature-film","make","by","first-time","young","black","filmmaker","who","be","bear","when","Nelson","Mandela","become","South","Africa","'s","first","democratically","elect","President","and","who","enter","young","adulthood","during","the","last","year","of","Mandela","'s","remarkable","life",".","it","be","a","anthology","of","8","short","film","link","by","a","theme","and","african","proverb","that","delicately","reflect","on","and","explore","the","challenge","of","intimacy","and","change",":","the","search","for","love",",","belong","and","heal","while","navigate","the","rite","and","turmoil","of","everyday","life",".","it","offer","a","rare",",","honest",",","resilient","and","creative","insight","into","the","concern","and","experience","of","black","youth","in","contemporary","South","Africa","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Rights

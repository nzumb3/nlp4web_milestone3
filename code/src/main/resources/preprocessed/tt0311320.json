{"title":"Blind Spot. Hitler's Secretary","plot":"Traudl Junge was Adolf Hitler's private secretary, from Autumn 1942 until the collapse of the Nazi regime. She worked for him at the Wolfsschanze in Obersalzberg, on his private train and, finally, in his bunker in the besieged capital. It was Traudl Junge to whom Hitler dictated his final testament. In her first ever on-camera interview, 81-year-old Junge talks about her unique life. In the spring of 2001, Andre Heller succeeded in convincing Traudl Junge how valuable it is to record her unique memories. Fifty-six years after the end of the Second World War, an important eyewitness reveals her experiences to us. What she saw and heard turned her into an furious opponent of National Socialism; an opponent, moreover, who is still painfully aware and seems incapable of forgiving the young girl she once was--for her naivete, ignorance, and her liking for Hitler.","genres":["Biography"," War"," Documentary"],"stems":["Traudl","Jung","was","Adolf","Hitler","'s","privat","secretari",",","from","Autumn","1942","until","the","collaps","of","the","Nazi","regim",".","She","work","for","him","at","the","Wolfsschanz","in","Obersalzberg",",","on","his","privat","train","and",",","final",",","in","his","bunker","in","the","besieg","capit",".","It","was","Traudl","Jung","to","whom","Hitler","dictat","his","final","testament",".","In","her","first","ever","on-camera","interview",",","81-year-old","Jung","talk","about","her","uniqu","life",".","In","the","spring","of","2001",",","Andre","Heller","succeed","in","convinc","Traudl","Jung","how","valuabl","it","is","to","record","her","uniqu","memori",".","Fifty-six","year","after","the","end","of","the","Second","World","War",",","an","import","eyewit","reveal","her","experi","to","us",".","What","she","saw","and","heard","turn","her","into","an","furious","oppon","of","Nation","Social",";","an","oppon",",","moreov",",","who","is","still","pain","awar","and","seem","incap","of","forgiv","the","young","girl","she","onc","was","--","for","her","naivet",",","ignor",",","and","her","like","for","Hitler","."],"lemmas":["Traudl","Junge","be","Adolf","Hitler","'s","private","secretary",",","from","Autumn","1942","until","the","collapse","of","the","Nazi","regime",".","she","work","for","he","at","the","Wolfsschanze","in","Obersalzberg",",","on","he","private","train","and",",","finally",",","in","he","bunker","in","the","besiege","capital",".","it","be","Traudl","Junge","to","whom","Hitler","dictate","he","final","testament",".","in","she","first","ever","on-camera","interview",",","81-year-old","Junge","talk","about","she","unique","life",".","in","the","spring","of","2001",",","Andre","Heller","succeed","in","convincing","Traudl","Junge","how","valuable","it","be","to","record","she","unique","memory",".","fifty-six","year","after","the","end","of","the","Second","World","War",",","a","important","eyewitness","reveal","she","experience","to","we",".","what","she","see","and","hear","turn","she","into","a","furious","opponent","of","National","Socialism",";","a","opponent",",","moreover",",","who","be","still","painfully","aware","and","seem","incapable","of","forgive","the","young","girl","she","once","be","--","for","she","naivete",",","ignorance",",","and","she","liking","for","Hitler","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Traudl Junge was","Junge was Adolf","was Adolf Hitler","Adolf Hitler 's","Hitler 's private","'s private secretary","private secretary ,","secretary , from",", from Autumn","from Autumn 1942","Autumn 1942 until","1942 until the","until the collapse","the collapse of","collapse of the","of the Nazi","the Nazi regime","She worked for","worked for him","for him at","him at the","at the Wolfsschanze","the Wolfsschanze in","Wolfsschanze in Obersalzberg","in Obersalzberg ,","Obersalzberg , on",", on his","on his private","his private train","private train and","train and ,","and , finally",", finally ,","finally , in",", in his","in his bunker","his bunker in","bunker in the","in the besieged","the besieged capital","It was Traudl","was Traudl Junge","Traudl Junge to","Junge to whom","to whom Hitler","whom Hitler dictated","Hitler dictated his","dictated his final","his final testament","In her first","her first ever","first ever on-camera","ever on-camera interview","on-camera interview ,","interview , 81-year-old",", 81-year-old Junge","81-year-old Junge talks","Junge talks about","talks about her","about her unique","her unique life","In the spring","the spring of","spring of 2001","of 2001 ,","2001 , Andre",", Andre Heller","Andre Heller succeeded","Heller succeeded in","succeeded in convincing","in convincing Traudl","convincing Traudl Junge","Traudl Junge how","Junge how valuable","how valuable it","valuable it is","it is to","is to record","to record her","record her unique","her unique memories","Fifty-six years after","years after the","after the end","the end of","end of the","of the Second","the Second World","Second World War","World War ,","War , an",", an important","an important eyewitness","important eyewitness reveals","eyewitness reveals her","reveals her experiences","her experiences to","experiences to us","What she saw","she saw and","saw and heard","and heard turned","heard turned her","turned her into","her into an","into an furious","an furious opponent","furious opponent of","opponent of National","of National Socialism","National Socialism ;","Socialism ;

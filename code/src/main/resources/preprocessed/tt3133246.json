{"title":"The Last Time You Had Fun","plot":"Ida, a beautiful mess obsessing over her marital separation, shows up at her sister Alison's for a visit a week too early. Alison is well used to cleaning up after Ida, and settles them both at a local wine bar. There they meet Clark, fresh from signing his divorce papers and sporting his favorite sweatpants, and his friend Will: charming, glib and avoiding his pregnant bride. Recognizing their similarities yet excited by the differences, the foursome climb into a party limo and navigate their way through embarrassing confessions, pot pharmacies, and covert skinny dipping; balancing an undercurrent of sexual tension and the sobering knowledge that they may have left their lives behind for this night, but they would have to return to them come morning.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Ida",",","a","beauti","mess","obsess","over","her","marit","separ",",","show","up","at","her","sister","Alison","'s","for","a","visit","a","week","too","earli",".","Alison","is","well","use","to","clean","up","after","Ida",",","and","settl","them","both","at","a","local","wine","bar",".","There","they","meet","Clark",",","fresh","from","sign","his","divorc","paper","and","sport","his","favorit","sweatpant",",","and","his","friend","Will",":","charm",",","glib","and","avoid","his","pregnant","bride",".","Recogn","their","similar","yet","excit","by","the","differ",",","the","foursom","climb","into","a","parti","limo","and","navig","their","way","through","embarrass","confess",",","pot","pharmaci",",","and","covert","skinni","dip",";","balanc","an","undercurr","of","sexual","tension","and","the","sober","knowledg","that","they","may","have","left","their","live","behind","for","this","night",",","but","they","would","have","to","return","to","them","come","morn","."],"lemmas":["Ida",",","a","beautiful","mess","obsess","over","she","marital","separation",",","show","up","at","she","sister","Alison","'s","for","a","visit","a","week","too","early",".","Alison","be","well","use","to","clean","up","after","Ida",",","and","settle","they","both","at","a","local","wine","bar",".","there","they","meet","Clark",",","fresh","from","sign","he","divorce","papers","and","sport","he","favorite","sweatpant",",","and","he","friend","Will",":","charming",",","glib","and","avoid","he","pregnant","bride",".","recognize","they","similarity","yet","excite","by","the","difference",",","the","foursome","climb","into","a","party","limo","and","navigate","they","way","through","embarrassing","confession",",","pot","pharmacy",",","and","covert","skinny","dip",";","balance","a","undercurrent","of","sexual","tension","and","the","sobering","knowledge","that","they","may","have","leave","they","life","behind","for","this","night",",","but","they","would","have","to","return","to","they","come","morning","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ida , a",", a beautiful","a beautiful mess","beautiful mess obsessing","mess obsessing over","obsessing over her","over her marital","her marital separation","marital separation ,","separation , shows",", shows up","shows up at","up at her","at her sister","her sister Alison","sister Alison 's","Alison 's for","'s for a","for a visit","a visit a","visit a week","a week too","week too early","Alison is well","is well used","well used to","used to cleaning","to cleaning up","cleaning up after","up after Ida","after Ida ,","Ida , and",", and settles","and settles them","settles them both","them both at","both at a","at a local","a local wine","local wine bar","There they meet","they meet Clark","meet Clark ,","Clark , fresh",", fresh from","fresh from signing","from signing his","signing his divorce","his divorce papers","divorce papers and","papers and sporting","and sporting his","sporting his favorite","his favorite sweatpants","favorite sweatpants ,","sweatpants , and",", and his","and his friend","his friend Will","friend Will :","Will : charming",": charming ,","charming , glib",", glib and","glib and avoiding","and avoiding his","avoiding his pregnant","his pregnant bride","Recognizing their similarities","their similarities yet","similarities yet excited","yet excited by","excited by the","by the differences","the differences ,","differences , the",", the foursome","the foursome climb","foursome climb into","climb into a","into a party","a party limo","party limo and","limo and navigate","and navigate their","navigate their way","their way through","way through embarrassing","through embarrassing confessions","embarrassing confessions ,","confessions , pot",", pot pharmacies","pot pharmacies ,","pharmacies , and",", and covert","and covert skinny","covert skinny dipping","skinny dipping ;","dipping ;

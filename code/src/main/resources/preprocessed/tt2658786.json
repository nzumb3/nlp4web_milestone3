{"title":"Acting Outlaws: The LA La Ride","plot":"On October 22nd, 2010, actresses Katee Sackhoff and Tricia Helfer embarked on a cross-country motorcycle ride taking them 2,500 miles from Los Angeles, CA to New Orleans, LA to raise awareness for the BP Oil Spill Disaster in the Gulf. Titled 'The LA La Ride', it was the very first under the Acting Outlaws brand -- a charity company started by Katee and Tricia to raise money and awareness for various charities and causes. Joining them on this trip was a film crew who documented the entire event. This footage was edited together to create a documentary film which follows these two as they ride from city to city, raising awareness and experiencing an adventure unlike any other.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","October","22nd",",","2010",",","actress","Kate","Sackhoff","and","Tricia","Helfer","embark","on","a","cross-countri","motorcycl","ride","take","them","2,500","mile","from","Los","Angele",",","CA","to","New","Orlean",",","LA","to","rais","awar","for","the","BP","Oil","Spill","Disast","in","the","Gulf",".","Titl","'","The","LA","La","Ride","'",",","it","was","the","veri","first","under","the","Acting","Outlaw","brand","--","a","chariti","compani","start","by","Kate","and","Tricia","to","rais","money","and","awar","for","various","chariti","and","caus",".","Join","them","on","this","trip","was","a","film","crew","who","document","the","entir","event",".","This","footag","was","edit","togeth","to","creat","a","documentari","film","which","follow","these","two","as","they","ride","from","citi","to","citi",",","rais","awar","and","experienc","an","adventur","unlik","ani","other","."],"lemmas":["on","October","22nd",",","2010",",","actress","Katee","Sackhoff","and","Tricia","Helfer","embark","on","a","cross-country","motorcycle","ride","take","they","2,500","mile","from","Los","Angeles",",","CA","to","New","Orleans",",","LA","to","raise","awareness","for","the","bp","oil","spill","disaster","in","the","Gulf",".","title","'","the","LA","La","ride","'",",","it","be","the","very","first","under","the","Acting","Outlaws","brand","--","a","charity","company","start","by","Katee","and","Tricia","to","raise","money","and","awareness","for","various","charity","and","cause",".","join","they","on","this","trip","be","a","film","crew","who","document","the","entire","event",".","this","footage","be","edit","together","to","create","a","documentary","film","which","follow","these","two","as","they","ride","from","city","to","city",",","raise","awareness","and","experience","a","adventure","unlike","any","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On

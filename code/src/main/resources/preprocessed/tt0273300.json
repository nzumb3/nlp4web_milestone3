{"title":"Jump Tomorrow","plot":"George, a passive and sometimes expressionless Nigerian, arrives at the Buffalo airport to meet the women his family has arranged for him to marry. He's late, she's gone on to Niagara Falls, so he has two days, traveling slowly and reluctantly, to get to the wedding. At the airport, he meets Alicia, a lively Latin, going with her boyfriend to see her family. George is smitten. Partly by happenstance, and partly by the designs of Gerard, a romantic and manic Frenchman George meets at the airport, his path crosses Alicia's a few times. As Gerard puts it, George should seize the chance to see what happens with Alicia - he can always jump tomorrow. Can George take on fate and custom?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Georg",",","a","passiv","and","sometim","expressionless","Nigerian",",","arriv","at","the","Buffalo","airport","to","meet","the","women","his","famili","has","arrang","for","him","to","marri",".","He","'s","late",",","she","'s","gone","on","to","Niagara","Fall",",","so","he","has","two","day",",","travel","slowli","and","reluct",",","to","get","to","the","wed",".","At","the","airport",",","he","meet","Alicia",",","a","live","Latin",",","go","with","her","boyfriend","to","see","her","famili",".","Georg","is","smitten",".","Part","by","happenst",",","and","part","by","the","design","of","Gerard",",","a","romant","and","manic","Frenchman","Georg","meet","at","the","airport",",","his","path","cross","Alicia","'s","a","few","time",".","As","Gerard","put","it",",","Georg","should","seiz","the","chanc","to","see","what","happen","with","Alicia","-","he","can","alway","jump","tomorrow",".","Can","Georg","take","on","fate","and","custom","?"],"lemmas":["George",",","a","passive","and","sometimes","expressionless","nigerian",",","arrive","at","the","Buffalo","airport","to","meet","the","woman","he","family","have","arrange","for","he","to","marry",".","he","be","late",",","she","be","go","on","to","Niagara","Falls",",","so","he","have","two","day",",","travel","slowly","and","reluctantly",",","to","get","to","the","wedding",".","at","the","airport",",","he","meet","Alicia",",","a","lively","Latin",",","go","with","she","boyfriend","to","see","she","family",".","George","be","smitten",".","partly","by","happenstance",",","and","partly","by","the","design","of","Gerard",",","a","romantic","and","manic","Frenchman","George","meet","at","the","airport",",","he","path","cross","Alicia","'s","a","few","time",".","as","Gerard","put","it",",","George","should","seize","the","chance","to","see","what","happen","with","Alicia","-","he","can","always","jump","tomorrow",".","can","George","take","on","fate","and","custom","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["George , a",", a passive","a passive and","passive and sometimes","and sometimes expressionless","sometimes expressionless Nigerian","expressionless Nigerian ,","Nigerian , arrives",", arrives at","arrives at the","at the Buffalo","the Buffalo airport","Buffalo airport to","airport to meet","to meet the","meet the women","the women his","women his family","his family has","family has arranged","has arranged for","arranged for him","for him to","him to marry","He 's late","'s late ,","late , she",", she 's","she 's gone","'s gone on","gone on to","on to Niagara","to Niagara Falls","Niagara Falls ,","Falls , so",", so he","so he has","he has two","has two days","two days ,","days , traveling",", traveling slowly","traveling slowly and","slowly and reluctantly","and reluctantly ,","reluctantly , to",", to get","to get to","get to the","to the wedding","At the airport","the airport ,","airport , he",", he meets","he meets Alicia","meets Alicia ,","Alicia , a",", a lively","a lively Latin","lively Latin ,","Latin , going",", going with","going with her","with her boyfriend","her boyfriend to","boyfriend to see","to see her","see her family","George is smitten","Partly by happenstance","by happenstance ,","happenstance , and",", and partly","and partly by","partly by the","by the designs","the designs of","designs of Gerard","of Gerard ,","Gerard , a",", a romantic","a romantic and","romantic and manic","and manic Frenchman","manic Frenchman George","Frenchman George meets","George meets at","meets at the","at the airport","the airport ,","airport , his",", his path","his path crosses","path crosses Alicia","crosses Alicia 's","Alicia 's a","'s a few","a few times","As Gerard puts","Gerard puts it","puts it ,","it , George",", George should","George should seize","should seize the","seize the chance","the chance to","chance to see","to see what","see what happens","what happens with","happens with Alicia","with Alicia -","Alicia -

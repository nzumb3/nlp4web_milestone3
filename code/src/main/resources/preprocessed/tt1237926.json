{"title":"Snuff: A Documentary About Killing on Camera","plot":"Feature film examining the existence of films in which people are murdered on camera and the culture surrounding them. Through interviews with former FBI Profilers, Cultural Academics, and Film Historians the documentary delves into the disturbing history and myth of Snuff Films. The FBI claims there is no evidence to prove the existence of Snuff and, therefore, Snuff Films are a myth. This documentary analyzes the relationships between war, cult films, serial killers and pornography to prove whether or not this pervasive myth is, in fact, reality.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Featur","film","examin","the","exist","of","film","in","which","peopl","are","murder","on","camera","and","the","cultur","surround","them",".","Through","interview","with","former","FBI","Profil",",","Cultur","Academ",",","and","Film","Historian","the","documentari","delv","into","the","disturb","histori","and","myth","of","Snuff","Film",".","The","FBI","claim","there","is","no","evid","to","prove","the","exist","of","Snuff","and",",","therefor",",","Snuff","Film","are","a","myth",".","This","documentari","analyz","the","relationship","between","war",",","cult","film",",","serial","killer","and","pornographi","to","prove","whether","or","not","this","pervas","myth","is",",","in","fact",",","realiti","."],"lemmas":["feature","film","examine","the","existence","of","film","in","which","people","be","murder","on","camera","and","the","culture","surround","they",".","through","interview","with","former","FBI","Profilers",",","Cultural","Academics",",","and","Film","Historians","the","documentary","delve","into","the","disturbing","history","and","myth","of","snuff","films",".","the","FBI","claim","there","be","no","evidence","to","prove","the","existence","of","Snuff","and",",","therefore",",","snuff","film","be","a","myth",".","this","documentary","analyze","the","relationship","between","war",",","cult","film",",","serial","killer","and","pornography","to","prove","whether","or","not","this","pervasive","myth","be",",","in","fact",",","reality","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Feature film examining","film examining the","examining the existence","the existence of","existence of films","of films in","films in which","in which people","which people are","people are murdered","are murdered on","murdered on camera","on camera and","camera and the","and the culture","the culture surrounding","culture surrounding them","Through interviews with","interviews with former","with former FBI","former FBI Profilers","FBI Profilers ,","Profilers , Cultural",", Cultural Academics","Cultural Academics ,","Academics , and",", and Film","and Film Historians","Film Historians the","Historians the documentary","the documentary delves","documentary delves into","delves into the","into the disturbing","the disturbing history","disturbing history and","history and myth","and myth of","myth of Snuff","of Snuff Films","The FBI claims","FBI claims there","claims there is","there is no","is no evidence","no evidence to","evidence to prove","to prove the","prove the existence","the existence of","existence of Snuff","of Snuff and","Snuff and ,","and , therefore",", therefore ,","therefore , Snuff",", Snuff Films","Snuff Films are","Films are a","are a myth","This documentary analyzes","documentary analyzes the","analyzes the relationships","the relationships between","relationships between war","between war ,","war , cult",", cult films","cult films ,","films , serial",", serial killers","serial killers and","killers and pornography","and pornography to","pornography to prove","to prove whether","prove whether or","whether or not","or not this","not this pervasive","this pervasive myth","pervasive myth is","myth is ,","is , in",", in fact","in fact ,","fact , reality"],"2grams":["Feature film","film examining","examining the","the existence","existence of","of films","films in","in which","which people","people are","are murdered","murdered on","on camera","camera and","and the","the culture","culture surrounding","surrounding them","Through interviews","interviews with","with former","former FBI","FBI Profilers","Profilers ,",", Cultural","Cultural Academics","Academics ,",", and","and Film","Film Historians","Historians the","the documentary","documentary delves","delves into","into the","the disturbing","disturbing history","history and","and myth","myth of","of Snuff","Snuff Films","The FBI","FBI claims","claims there","there is","is no","no evidence","evidence to","to prove","prove the","the existence","existence of","of Snuff","Snuff and","and ,",", therefore","therefore ,",", Snuff","Snuff Films","Films are","are a","a myth","This documentary","documentary analyzes","analyzes the","the relationships","relationships between","between war","war ,",", cult","cult films","films ,",", serial","serial killers","killers and","and pornography","pornography to","to prove","prove whether","whether or","or not","not this","this pervasive","pervasive myth","myth is","is ,",", in","in fact","fact ,",", reality"]}

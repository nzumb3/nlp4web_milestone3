{"title":"Jazz Nights: A Confidential Journey","plot":"The documentary JAZZ NIGHTS: A CONFIDENTIAL JOURNEY chronicles a revolving group of jazz musicians performing on the cutting-edge of a societal and cultural metamorphosis. These musical journeymen congregate Sunday nights at a self-described \"hash bar\" in Los Angeles to improvise and explore jazz music and the jazz experience on their own terms. As opposed to playing out to an audience, the musicians form a circle, a coterie of non-verbal, intuitive communication. There are no pre-determined set lists, no rehearsals. These intimate and exploratory sessions ripple out through the audience until all in attendance are swept away on the lyrical and intrepid journey the musicians, themselves, have come to honor, as so many musicians have before them.","genres":["Biography"," Music","

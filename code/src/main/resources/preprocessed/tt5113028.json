{"title":"Schrotten!","plot":"Mirko Talhammer is beyond himself when two strange guys show up in his noble insurance office and remind him where he really comes from: from a scrapyard in the provinces, where careers are not what counts, other things are more important: scrapping things, the family, and every once in a while, a nice fist fight. Mirko left all that behind, but his father messes things up big time when he dies and leaves his son the run down scrapyard - together with his brother Letscho. And Letscho is still ticked off that Mirko deserted the clan. But soon the brothers realize that the Talhammers only have a future if they can pull themselves together and fulfill their father's last wish: to rob a train like real professionals! The coup itself is like a suicide mission, but then Kercher, the Talhammer's biggest nemesis, gets wind of things...","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["Mirko","Talhamm","is","beyond","himself","when","two","strang","guy","show","up","in","his","nobl","insur","offic","and","remind","him","where","he","realli","come","from",":","from","a","scrapyard","in","the","provinc",",","where","career","are","not","what","count",",","other","thing","are","more","import",":","scrap","thing",",","the","famili",",","and","everi","onc","in","a","while",",","a","nice","fist","fight",".","Mirko","left","all","that","behind",",","but","his","father","mess","thing","up","big","time","when","he","die","and","leav","his","son","the","run","down","scrapyard","-","togeth","with","his","brother","Letscho",".","And","Letscho","is","still","tick","off","that","Mirko","desert","the","clan",".","But","soon","the","brother","realiz","that","the","Talhamm","onli","have","a","futur","if","they","can","pull","themselv","togeth","and","fulfil","their","father","'s","last","wish",":","to","rob","a","train","like","real","profession","!","The","coup","itself","is","like","a","suicid","mission",",","but","then","Kercher",",","the","Talhamm","'s","biggest","nemesi",",","get","wind","of","thing","..."],"lemmas":["Mirko","Talhammer","be","beyond","himself","when","two","strange","guy","show","up","in","he","noble","insurance","office","and","remind","he","where","he","really","come","from",":","from","a","scrapyard","in","the","province",",","where","career","be","not","what","count",",","other","thing","be","more","important",":","scrap","thing",",","the","family",",","and","every","once","in","a","while",",","a","nice","fist","fight",".","Mirko","leave","all","that","behind",",","but","he","father","mess","thing","up","big","time","when","he","die","and","leave","he","son","the","run","down","scrapyard","-","together","with","he","brother","Letscho",".","and","Letscho","be","still","tick","off","that","Mirko","desert","the","clan",".","but","soon","the","brother","realize","that","the","talhammer","only","have","a","future","if","they","can","pull","themselves","together","and","fulfill","they","father","'s","last","wish",":","to","rob","a","train","like","real","professional","!","the","coup","itself","be","like","a","suicide","mission",",","but","then","Kercher",",","the","Talhammer","'s","biggest","nemesis",",","get","wind","of","thing","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mirko Talhammer is","Talhammer is beyond","is beyond himself","beyond himself when","himself when two","when two strange","two strange guys","strange guys show","guys show up","show up in","up in his","in his noble","his noble insurance","noble insurance office","insurance office and","office and remind","and remind him","remind him where","him where he","where he really","he really comes","really comes from","comes from :","from : from",": from a","from a scrapyard","a scrapyard in","scrapyard in the","in the provinces","the provinces ,","provinces , where",", where careers","where careers are","careers are not","are not what","not what counts","what counts ,","counts , other",", other things","other things are","things are more","are more important","more important :","important : scrapping",": scrapping things","scrapping things ,","things , the",", the family","the family ,","family , and",", and every","and every once","every once in","once in a","in a while","a while ,","while , a",", a nice","a nice fist","nice fist fight","Mirko left all","left all that","all that behind","that behind ,","behind , but",", but his","but his father","his father messes","father messes things","messes things up","things up big","up big time","big time when","time when he","when he dies","he dies and","dies and leaves","and leaves his","leaves his son","his son the","son the run","the run down","run down scrapyard","down scrapyard -","scrapyard -

{"title":"Aaj Ka Gang Leader","plot":"Vijay lives a poor lifestyle in the Southern part of India. As he is unable to secure any job for his livelihood he takes to petty crime such as picking peoples pockets and theft. As a result of this he becomes known to the police, who instead of arresting him ask him to go underground and seek out some criminal elements. Vijay does so, only to find out that he has been tricked by the police and ends up hating them. Word of this gets out and a gangster named Teja asks Vijay to join him, which Vijay accepts. Then when Teja finds out that Vijay is not a police informer nor a gangster of repute but a mere pick-pocket, he sends one of his men to inquire about him, and to their surprise they find out that he working undercover for the police. His men abduct Munni, Vijay's sweetheart and hold her captive. The question remains is Vijay really an agent of the police; a gang leader; or merely a pick-pocket.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Vijay","live","a","poor","lifestyl","in","the","Southern","part","of","India",".","As","he","is","unabl","to","secur","ani","job","for","his","livelihood","he","take","to","petti","crime","such","as","pick","peopl","pocket","and","theft",".","As","a","result","of","this","he","becom","known","to","the","polic",",","who","instead","of","arrest","him","ask","him","to","go","underground","and","seek","out","some","crimin","element",".","Vijay","doe","so",",","onli","to","find","out","that","he","has","been","trick","by","the","polic","and","end","up","hate","them",".","Word","of","this","get","out","and","a","gangster","name","Teja","ask","Vijay","to","join","him",",","which","Vijay","accept",".","Then","when","Teja","find","out","that","Vijay","is","not","a","polic","inform","nor","a","gangster","of","reput","but","a","mere","pick-pocket",",","he","send","one","of","his","men","to","inquir","about","him",",","and","to","their","surpris","they","find","out","that","he","work","undercov","for","the","polic",".","His","men","abduct","Munni",",","Vijay","'s","sweetheart","and","hold","her","captiv",".","The","question","remain","is","Vijay","realli","an","agent","of","the","polic",";","a","gang","leader",";","or","mere","a","pick-pocket","."],"lemmas":["Vijay","live","a","poor","lifestyle","in","the","southern","part","of","India",".","as","he","be","unable","to","secure","any","job","for","he","livelihood","he","take","to","petty","crime","such","as","pick","people","pocket","and","theft",".","as","a","result","of","this","he","become","know","to","the","police",",","who","instead","of","arrest","he","ask","he","to","go","underground","and","seek","out","some","criminal","element",".","Vijay","do","so",",","only","to","find","out","that","he","have","be","trick","by","the","police","and","end","up","hate","they",".","word","of","this","get","out","and","a","gangster","name","Teja","ask","Vijay","to","join","he",",","which","Vijay","accept",".","then","when","Teja","find","out","that","Vijay","be","not","a","police","informer","nor","a","gangster","of","repute","but","a","mere","pick-pocket",",","he","send","one","of","he","man","to","inquire","about","he",",","and","to","they","surprise","they","find","out","that","he","work","undercover","for","the","police",".","he","man","abduct","Munni",",","Vijay","'s","sweetheart","and","hold","she","captive",".","the","question","remain","be","Vijay","really","a","agent","of","the","police",";","a","gang","leader",";","or","merely","a","pick-pocket","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Vijay

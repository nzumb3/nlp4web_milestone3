{"title":"Music to My Ears","plot":"Times are tough in modern middle America, and traditions are dying out. The city's oldest movie house will soon be a parking ramp unless somebody can do something to save it. Supporters think they have the perfect solution-they'll put on a benefit stage show to save the theater. But nobody is prepared for what happens next. Not the aging theater owners, the ambitious manager, the scheming banker, the mercenary real estate agent, the Broadway producer, the greedy ex-wife, the caustic choreographer, the old-movie nut, the pesky cute kid, or anyone else.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Musical"],"stems":["Time","are","tough","in","modern","middl","America",",","and","tradit","are","die","out",".","The","citi","'s","oldest","movi","hous","will","soon","be","a","park","ramp","unless","somebodi","can","do","someth","to","save","it",".","Support","think","they","have","the","perfect","solution-they","ll","put","on","a","benefit","stage","show","to","save","the","theater",".","But","nobodi","is","prepar","for","what","happen","next",".","Not","the","age","theater","owner",",","the","ambiti","manag",",","the","scheme","banker",",","the","mercenari","real","estat","agent",",","the","Broadway","produc",",","the","greedi","ex-wif",",","the","caustic","choreograph",",","the","old-movi","nut",",","the","peski","cute","kid",",","or","anyon","els","."],"lemmas":["time","be","tough","in","modern","middle","America",",","and","tradition","be","die","out",".","the","city","'s","oldest","movie","house","will","soon","be","a","parking","ramp","unless","somebody","can","do","something","to","save","it",".","supporter","think","they","have","the","perfect","solution-they","will","put","on","a","benefit","stage","show","to","save","the","theater",".","but","nobody","be","prepare","for","what","happen","next",".","not","the","aging","theater","owner",",","the","ambitious","manager",",","the","scheming","banker",",","the","mercenary","real","estate","agent",",","the","Broadway","producer",",","the","greedy","ex-wife",",","the","caustic","choreographer",",","the","old-movie","nut",",","the","pesky","cute","kid",",","or","anyone","else","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Times are tough","are tough in","tough in modern","in modern middle","modern middle America","middle America ,","America , and",", and traditions","and traditions are","traditions are dying","are dying out","The city 's","city 's oldest","'s oldest movie","oldest movie house","movie house will","house will soon","will soon be","soon be a","be a parking","a parking ramp","parking ramp unless","ramp unless somebody","unless somebody can","somebody can do","can do something","do something to","something to save","to save it","Supporters think they","think they have","they have the","have the perfect","the perfect solution-they","perfect solution-they 'll","solution-they 'll put","'ll put on","put on a","on a benefit","a benefit stage","benefit stage show","stage show to","show to save","to save the","save the theater","But nobody is","nobody is prepared","is prepared for","prepared for what","for what happens","what happens next","Not the aging","the aging theater","aging theater owners","theater owners ,","owners , the",", the ambitious","the ambitious manager","ambitious manager ,","manager , the",", the scheming","the scheming banker","scheming banker ,","banker , the",", the mercenary","the mercenary real","mercenary real estate","real estate agent","estate agent ,","agent , the",", the Broadway","the Broadway producer","Broadway producer ,","producer , the",", the greedy","the greedy ex-wife","greedy ex-wife ,","ex-wife , the",", the caustic","the caustic choreographer","caustic choreographer ,","choreographer , the",", the old-movie","the old-movie nut","old-movie nut ,","nut , the",", the pesky","the pesky cute","pesky cute kid","cute kid ,","kid , or",", or anyone","or anyone else"],"2grams":["Times are","are tough","tough in","in modern","modern middle","middle America","America ,",", and","and traditions","traditions are","are dying","dying out","The city","city 's","'s oldest","oldest movie","movie house","house will","will soon","soon be","be a","a parking","parking ramp","ramp unless","unless somebody","somebody can","can do","do something","something to","to save","save it","Supporters think","think they","they have","have the","the perfect","perfect solution-they","solution-they 'll","'ll put","put on","on a","a benefit","benefit stage","stage show","show to","to save","save the","the theater","But nobody","nobody is","is prepared","prepared for","for what","what happens","happens next","Not the","the aging","aging theater","theater owners","owners ,",", the","the ambitious","ambitious manager","manager ,",", the","the scheming","scheming banker","banker ,",", the","the mercenary","mercenary real","real estate","estate agent","agent ,",", the","the Broadway","Broadway producer","producer ,",", the","the greedy","greedy ex-wife","ex-wife ,",", the","the caustic","caustic choreographer","choreographer ,",", the","the old-movie","old-movie nut","nut ,",", the","the pesky","pesky cute","cute kid","kid ,",", or","or anyone","anyone else"]}

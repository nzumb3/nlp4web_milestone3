{"title":"Stereo Future","plot":"Keisuke, an aspiring samurai-movie actor lands a major role in a new film, but must contend with a director who has nothing but scorn for him, but who continually fawns over the film's obnoxious ham of a star. Meanwhile, Keisuke has been dumped by his girlfriend, Eri, after she becomes heartbroken when he considers working full-time as a bar manager rather than pursuing his dream. Through her job as a translator, she meets an Italian professor who claims to talk to trees, and who immediately starts trying to woo her.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Keisuk",",","an","aspir","samurai-movi","actor","land","a","major","role","in","a","new","film",",","but","must","contend","with","a","director","who","has","noth","but","scorn","for","him",",","but","who","continu","fawn","over","the","film","'s","obnoxi","ham","of","a","star",".","Meanwhil",",","Keisuk","has","been","dump","by","his","girlfriend",",","Eri",",","after","she","becom","heartbroken","when","he","consid","work","full-tim","as","a","bar","manag","rather","than","pursu","his","dream",".","Through","her","job","as","a","translat",",","she","meet","an","Italian","professor","who","claim","to","talk","to","tree",",","and","who","immedi","start","tri","to","woo","her","."],"lemmas":["Keisuke",",","a","aspiring","samurai-movie","actor","land","a","major","role","in","a","new","film",",","but","must","contend","with","a","director","who","have","nothing","but","scorn","for","he",",","but","who","continually","fawn","over","the","film","'s","obnoxious","ham","of","a","star",".","meanwhile",",","Keisuke","have","be","dump","by","he","girlfriend",",","Eri",",","after","she","become","heartbroken","when","he","consider","work","full-time","as","a","bar","manager","rather","than","pursue","he","dream",".","through","she","job","as","a","translator",",","she","meet","a","italian","professor","who","claim","to","talk","to","tree",",","and","who","immediately","start","try","to","woo","she","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Keisuke , an",", an aspiring","an aspiring samurai-movie","aspiring samurai-movie actor","samurai-movie actor lands","actor lands a","lands a major","a major role","major role in","role in a","in a new","a new film","new film ,","film , but",", but must","but must contend","must contend with","contend with a","with a director","a director who","director who has","who has nothing","has nothing but","nothing but scorn","but scorn for","scorn for him","for him ,","him , but",", but who","but who continually","who continually fawns","continually fawns over","fawns over the","over the film","the film 's","film 's obnoxious","'s obnoxious ham","obnoxious ham of","ham of a","of a star","Meanwhile , Keisuke",", Keisuke has","Keisuke has been","has been dumped","been dumped by","dumped by his","by his girlfriend","his girlfriend ,","girlfriend , Eri",", Eri ,","Eri , after",", after she","after she becomes","she becomes heartbroken","becomes heartbroken when","heartbroken when he","when he considers","he considers working","considers working full-time","working full-time as","full-time as a","as a bar","a bar manager","bar manager rather","manager rather than","rather than pursuing","than pursuing his","pursuing his dream","Through her job","her job as","job as a","as a translator","a translator ,","translator , she",", she meets","she meets an","meets an Italian","an Italian professor","Italian professor who","professor who claims","who claims to","claims to talk","to talk to","talk to trees","to trees ,","trees , and",", and who","and who immediately","who immediately starts","immediately starts trying","starts trying to","trying to woo","to woo her"],"2grams":["Keisuke ,",", an","an aspiring","aspiring samurai-movie","samurai-movie actor","actor lands","lands a","a major","major role","role in","in a","a new","new film","film ,",", but","but must","must contend","contend with","with a","a director","director who","who has","has nothing","nothing but","but scorn","scorn for","for him","him ,",", but","but who","who continually","continually fawns","fawns over","over the","the film","film 's","'s obnoxious","obnoxious ham","ham of","of a","a star","Meanwhile ,",", Keisuke","Keisuke has","has been","been dumped","dumped by","by his","his girlfriend","girlfriend ,",", Eri","Eri ,",", after","after she","she becomes","becomes heartbroken","heartbroken when","when he","he considers","considers working","working full-time","full-time as","as a","a bar","bar manager","manager rather","rather than","than pursuing","pursuing his","his dream","Through her","her job","job as","as a","a translator","translator ,",", she","she meets","meets an","an Italian","Italian professor","professor who","who claims","claims to","to talk","talk to","to trees","trees ,",", and","and who","who immediately","immediately starts","starts trying","trying to","to woo","woo her"]}

{"title":"Kartini","plot":"This is a story about the most famous Indonesian heroine, Kartini. In the early 1900s, Indonesia was still a colony of the Netherlands, Java is a land where noble families rule under Dutch supervision. Only noble and royal family were able to get education. Women weren't allowed to get higher education, even for women of royal blood. Women in the Javanese culture only had one purpose - to be a bride for a man with royal blood. Kartini grew up to fight this caste system, fight for equality for women, and most importantly she fought for the right for everyone to get an education regardless of their social status or gender. This is an emotional journey of Kartini where she had to defy her own family, her own culture and she had to fight to change in rules and traditions that were considered sacred in Java.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["This","is","a","stori","about","the","most","famous","Indonesian","heroin",",","Kartini",".","In","the","earli","1900s",",","Indonesia","was","still","a","coloni","of","the","Netherland",",","Java","is","a","land","where","nobl","famili","rule","under","Dutch","supervis",".","Onli","nobl","and","royal","famili","were","abl","to","get","educ",".","Women","were","n't","allow","to","get","higher","educ",",","even","for","women","of","royal","blood",".","Women","in","the","Javanes","cultur","onli","had","one","purpos","-","to","be","a","bride","for","a","man","with","royal","blood",".","Kartini","grew","up","to","fight","this","cast","system",",","fight","for","equal","for","women",",","and","most","import","she","fought","for","the","right","for","everyon","to","get","an","educ","regardless","of","their","social","status","or","gender",".","This","is","an","emot","journey","of","Kartini","where","she","had","to","defi","her","own","famili",",","her","own","cultur","and","she","had","to","fight","to","chang","in","rule","and","tradit","that","were","consid","sacr","in","Java","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","story","about","the","most","famous","indonesian","heroine",",","Kartini",".","in","the","early","1900s",",","Indonesia","be","still","a","colony","of","the","Netherlands",",","Java","be","a","land","where","noble","family","rule","under","dutch","supervision",".","only","noble","and","royal","family","be","able","to","get","education",".","woman","be","not","allow","to","get","higher","education",",","even","for","woman","of","royal","blood",".","woman","in","the","javanese","culture","only","have","one","purpose","-","to","be","a","bride","for","a","man","with","royal","blood",".","Kartini","grow","up","to","fight","this","caste","system",",","fight","for","equality","for","woman",",","and","most","importantly","she","fight","for","the","right","for","everyone","to","get","a","education","regardless","of","they","social","status","or","gender",".","this","be","a","emotional","journey","of","Kartini","where","she","have","to","defy","she","own","family",",","she","own","culture","and","she","have","to","fight","to","change","in","rule","and","tradition","that","be","consider","sacred","in","Java","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is a","is a story","a story about","story about the","about the most","the most famous","most famous Indonesian","famous Indonesian heroine","Indonesian heroine ,","heroine , Kartini","In the early","the early 1900s","early 1900s ,","1900s , Indonesia",", Indonesia was","Indonesia was still","was still a","still a colony","a colony of","colony of the","of the Netherlands","the Netherlands ,","Netherlands , Java",", Java is","Java is a","is a land","a land where","land where noble","where noble families","noble families rule","families rule under","rule under Dutch","under Dutch supervision","Only noble and","noble and royal","and royal family","royal family were","family were able","were able to","able to get","to get education","Women were n't","were n't allowed","n't allowed to","allowed to get","to get higher","get higher education","higher education ,","education , even",", even for","even for women","for women of","women of royal","of royal blood","Women in the","in the Javanese","the Javanese culture","Javanese culture only","culture only had","only had one","had one purpose","one purpose -","purpose -

{"title":"Bunny and the Bull","plot":"Stephen has agoraphobia and, in the flat he won't leave, meticulously labels and stores everything from nail clippings to urine. In long flashbacks we see a trip to the continent he took with his only friend Bunny, an outgoing, inveterate gambler. The European trip is a bit dull (Stephen wants to visit every museum imaginable) until one night in Poland they meet Eloisa, a Spanish waitress, and offer to drive her home for her city's fiesta. We can guess that the trip won't end well - because Stephen is now stuck in his flat with occasional visits from Bunny - but will anything in the reverie move Stephen to action?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Stephen","has","agoraphobia","and",",","in","the","flat","he","wo","n't","leav",",","meticul","label","and","store","everyth","from","nail","clip","to","urin",".","In","long","flashback","we","see","a","trip","to","the","contin","he","took","with","his","onli","friend","Bunni",",","an","outgo",",","inveter","gambler",".","The","European","trip","is","a","bit","dull","(","Stephen","want","to","visit","everi","museum","imagin",")","until","one","night","in","Poland","they","meet","Eloisa",",","a","Spanish","waitress",",","and","offer","to","drive","her","home","for","her","citi","'s","fiesta",".","We","can","guess","that","the","trip","wo","n't","end","well","-","becaus","Stephen","is","now","stuck","in","his","flat","with","occasion","visit","from","Bunni","-","but","will","anyth","in","the","reveri","move","Stephen","to","action","?"],"lemmas":["Stephen","have","agoraphobia","and",",","in","the","flat","he","will","not","leave",",","meticulously","label","and","store","everything","from","nail","clipping","to","urine",".","in","long","flashback","we","see","a","trip","to","the","continent","he","take","with","he","only","friend","Bunny",",","a","outgoing",",","inveterate","gambler",".","the","european","trip","be","a","bit","dull","-lrb-","Stephen","want","to","visit","every","museum","imaginable","-rrb-","until","one","night","in","Poland","they","meet","Eloisa",",","a","spanish","waitress",",","and","offer","to","drive","she","home","for","she","city","'s","fiesta",".","we","can","guess","that","the","trip","will","not","end","well","-","because","Stephen","be","now","stick","in","he","flat","with","occasional","visit","from","Bunny","-","but","will","anything","in","the","reverie","move","Stephen","to","action","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Stephen has agoraphobia","has agoraphobia and","agoraphobia and ,","and , in",", in the","in the flat","the flat he","flat he wo","he wo n't","wo n't leave","n't leave ,","leave , meticulously",", meticulously labels","meticulously labels and","labels and stores","and stores everything","stores everything from","everything from nail","from nail clippings","nail clippings to","clippings to urine","In long flashbacks","long flashbacks we","flashbacks we see","we see a","see a trip","a trip to","trip to the","to the continent","the continent he","continent he took","he took with","took with his","with his only","his only friend","only friend Bunny","friend Bunny ,","Bunny , an",", an outgoing","an outgoing ,","outgoing , inveterate",", inveterate gambler","The European trip","European trip is","trip is a","is a bit","a bit dull","bit dull (","dull ( Stephen","( Stephen wants","Stephen wants to","wants to visit","to visit every","visit every museum","every museum imaginable","museum imaginable )","imaginable ) until",") until one","until one night","one night in","night in Poland","in Poland they","Poland they meet","they meet Eloisa","meet Eloisa ,","Eloisa , a",", a Spanish","a Spanish waitress","Spanish waitress ,","waitress , and",", and offer","and offer to","offer to drive","to drive her","drive her home","her home for","home for her","for her city","her city 's","city 's fiesta","We can guess","can guess that","guess that the","that the trip","the trip wo","trip wo n't","wo n't end","n't end well","end well -","well -

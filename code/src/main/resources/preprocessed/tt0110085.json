{"title":"Fear of Heights","plot":"This is an unusal love story between Mario, a young man from the city, who despite his age has already failed in life, and a country-woman from a small village in the provinces who is disenchanted with life. Wanting to start life afresh, Mario flees to the countryside and ends up on a mountain farm that belongs to Ms Gusenleitner and her father, who gives him work as a farmhand for bed and board. For the first time in his life, Mario comes to experience love and sexuality without hate and dependency. However, he fears that his idyllic life will be short-lived when his past catches up with him.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","is","an","unus","love","stori","between","Mario",",","a","young","man","from","the","citi",",","who","despit","his","age","has","alreadi","fail","in","life",",","and","a","country-woman","from","a","small","villag","in","the","provinc","who","is","disench","with","life",".","Want","to","start","life","afresh",",","Mario","flee","to","the","countrysid","and","end","up","on","a","mountain","farm","that","belong","to","Ms","Gusenleitn","and","her","father",",","who","give","him","work","as","a","farmhand","for","bed","and","board",".","For","the","first","time","in","his","life",",","Mario","come","to","experi","love","and","sexual","without","hate","and","depend",".","Howev",",","he","fear","that","his","idyl","life","will","be","short-liv","when","his","past","catch","up","with","him","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","unusal","love","story","between","Mario",",","a","young","man","from","the","city",",","who","despite","he","age","have","already","fail","in","life",",","and","a","country-woman","from","a","small","village","in","the","province","who","be","disenchant","with","life",".","want","to","start","life","afresh",",","Mario","flee","to","the","countryside","and","end","up","on","a","mountain","farm","that","belong","to","Ms","Gusenleitner","and","she","father",",","who","give","he","work","as","a","farmhand","for","bed","and","board",".","for","the","first","time","in","he","life",",","Mario","come","to","experience","love","and","sexuality","without","hate","and","dependency",".","however",",","he","fear","that","he","idyllic","life","will","be","short-lived","when","he","past","catch","up","with","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

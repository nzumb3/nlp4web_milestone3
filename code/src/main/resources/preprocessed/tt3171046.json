{"title":"We Were Quiet Once","plot":"Somerset was the picture-perfect small town, where life embodied a quiet, pleasant innocence - until September 11, 2001. United Flight 93 crashed in its sheltered countryside, claiming 40 innocent lives and forever changing the people on the ground. What lasting effects does a history-changing event have on a small town? How do those who have lived in anonymity for their entire lives deal with international attention? How do people memorialize a tragedy without perpetuating grief? Grief connected a small community with a nation. For many, that bond has sealed a sense of patriotism and delivered a positive response to a terrible tragedy; for others, it has chained them from moving forward. We Were Quiet Once follows three locals - Father Al, Terry Butler and Rick Flick - as they prepare for the 10th anniversary of 9/11.","genres":["Biography"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["Somerset","was","the","picture-perfect","small","town",",","where","life","embodi","a","quiet",",","pleasant","innoc","-","until","Septemb","11",",","2001",".","Unite","Flight","93","crash","in","it","shelter","countrysid",",","claim","40","innoc","live","and","forev","chang","the","peopl","on","the","ground",".","What","last","effect","doe","a","history-chang","event","have","on","a","small","town","?","How","do","those","who","have","live","in","anonym","for","their","entir","live","deal","with","intern","attent","?","How","do","peopl","memori","a","tragedi","without","perpetu","grief","?","Grief","connect","a","small","communiti","with","a","nation",".","For","mani",",","that","bond","has","seal","a","sens","of","patriot","and","deliv","a","posit","respons","to","a","terribl","tragedi",";","for","other",",","it","has","chain","them","from","move","forward",".","We","Were","Quiet","Once","follow","three","local","-","Father","Al",",","Terri","Butler","and","Rick","Flick","-","as","they","prepar","for","the","10th","anniversari","of","9/11","."],"lemmas":["Somerset","be","the","picture-perfect","small","town",",","where","life","embody","a","quiet",",","pleasant","innocence","-","until","September","11",",","2001",".","United","Flight","93","crash","in","its","sheltered","countryside",",","claim","40","innocent","life","and","forever","change","the","people","on","the","ground",".","what","lasting","effect","do","a","history-changing","event","have","on","a","small","town","?","how","do","those","who","have","live","in","anonymity","for","they","entire","live","deal","with","international","attention","?","how","do","people","memorialize","a","tragedy","without","perpetuate","grief","?","grief","connect","a","small","community","with","a","nation",".","for","many",",","that","bond","have","seal","a","sense","of","patriotism","and","deliver","a","positive","response","to","a","terrible","tragedy",";","for","other",",","it","have","chained","they","from","move","forward",".","we","be","Quiet","once","follow","three","local","-","Father","Al",",","Terry","Butler","and","Rick","flick","-","as","they","prepare","for","the","10th","anniversary","of","9/11","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Somerset was the","was the picture-perfect","the picture-perfect small","picture-perfect small town","small town ,","town , where",", where life","where life embodied","life embodied a","embodied a quiet","a quiet ,","quiet , pleasant",", pleasant innocence","pleasant innocence -","innocence - until","- until September","until September 11","September 11 ,","11 , 2001","United Flight 93","Flight 93 crashed","93 crashed in","crashed in its","in its sheltered","its sheltered countryside","sheltered countryside ,","countryside , claiming",", claiming 40","claiming 40 innocent","40 innocent lives","innocent lives and","lives and forever","and forever changing","forever changing the","changing the people","the people on","people on the","on the ground","What lasting effects","lasting effects does","effects does a","does a history-changing","a history-changing event","history-changing event have","event have on","have on a","on a small","a small town","How do those","do those who","those who have","who have lived","have lived in","lived in anonymity","in anonymity for","anonymity for their","for their entire","their entire lives","entire lives deal","lives deal with","deal with international","with international attention","How do people","do people memorialize","people memorialize a","memorialize a tragedy","a tragedy without","tragedy without perpetuating","without perpetuating grief","Grief connected a","connected a small","a small community","small community with","community with a","with a nation","For many ,","many , that",", that bond","that bond has","bond has sealed","has sealed a","sealed a sense","a sense of","sense of patriotism","of patriotism and","patriotism and delivered","and delivered a","delivered a positive","a positive response","positive response to","response to a","to a terrible","a terrible tragedy","terrible tragedy ;","tragedy ;

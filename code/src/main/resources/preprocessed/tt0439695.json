{"title":"Dalecarlians","plot":"Mia, who's living in Stockholm, comes home to her small childhood town to celebrate her father's birthday. There she finds herself looked down-upon by her oldest sister; and she has to confront both her sisters when her father decides to give her the cabin by the lake, a place sought-after by both of her sisters. She visits some people who are still living in the small town, and all seem quite content with the lives they're leading. However, as the story progresses it becomes more and more noticeable that none of the characters feel good about how they live.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Mia",",","who","'s","live","in","Stockholm",",","come","home","to","her","small","childhood","town","to","celebr","her","father","'s","birthday",".","There","she","find","herself","look","down-upon","by","her","oldest","sister",";","and","she","has","to","confront","both","her","sister","when","her","father","decid","to","give","her","the","cabin","by","the","lake",",","a","place","sought-aft","by","both","of","her","sister",".","She","visit","some","peopl","who","are","still","live","in","the","small","town",",","and","all","seem","quit","content","with","the","live","they","re","lead",".","Howev",",","as","the","stori","progress","it","becom","more","and","more","notic","that","none","of","the","charact","feel","good","about","how","they","live","."],"lemmas":["Mia",",","who","be","live","in","Stockholm",",","come","home","to","she","small","childhood","town","to","celebrate","she","father","'s","birthday",".","there","she","find","herself","look","down-upon","by","she","oldest","sister",";","and","she","have","to","confront","both","she","sister","when","she","father","decide","to","give","she","the","cabin","by","the","lake",",","a","place","sought-after","by","both","of","she","sister",".","she","visit","some","people","who","be","still","live","in","the","small","town",",","and","all","seem","quite","content","with","the","life","they","be","lead",".","however",",","as","the","story","progress","it","become","more","and","more","noticeable","that","none","of","the","character","feel","good","about","how","they","live","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Mia , who",", who 's","who 's living","'s living in","living in Stockholm","in Stockholm ,","Stockholm , comes",", comes home","comes home to","home to her","to her small","her small childhood","small childhood town","childhood town to","town to celebrate","to celebrate her","celebrate her father","her father 's","father 's birthday","There she finds","she finds herself","finds herself looked","herself looked down-upon","looked down-upon by","down-upon by her","by her oldest","her oldest sister","oldest sister ;","sister ; and","; and she","and she has","she has to","has to confront","to confront both","confront both her","both her sisters","her sisters when","sisters when her","when her father","her father decides","father decides to","decides to give","to give her","give her the","her the cabin","the cabin by","cabin by the","by the lake","the lake ,","lake , a",", a place","a place sought-after","place sought-after by","sought-after by both","by both of","both of her","of her sisters","She visits some","visits some people","some people who","people who are","who are still","are still living","still living in","living in the","in the small","the small town","small town ,","town , and",", and all","and all seem","all seem quite","seem quite content","quite content with","content with the","with the lives","the lives they","lives they 're","they 're leading","However , as",", as the","as the story","the story progresses","story progresses it","progresses it becomes","it becomes more","becomes more and","more and more","and more noticeable","more noticeable that","noticeable that none","that none of","none of the","of the characters","the characters feel","characters feel good","feel good about","good about how","about how they","how they live"],"2grams":["Mia ,",", who","who 's","'s living","living in","in Stockholm","Stockholm ,",", comes","comes home","home to","to her","her small","small childhood","childhood town","town to","to celebrate","celebrate her","her father","father 's","'s birthday","There she","she finds","finds herself","herself looked","looked down-upon","down-upon by","by her","her oldest","oldest sister","sister ;","; and","and she","she has","has to","to confront","confront both","both her","her sisters","sisters when","when her","her father","father decides","decides to","to give","give her","her the","the cabin","cabin by","by the","the lake","lake ,",", a","a place","place sought-after","sought-after by","by both","both of","of her","her sisters","She visits","visits some","some people","people who","who are","are still","still living","living in","in the","the small","small town","town ,",", and","and all","all seem","seem quite","quite content","content with","with the","the lives","lives they","they 're","'re leading","However ,",", as","as the","the story","story progresses","progresses it","it becomes","becomes more","more and","and more","more noticeable","noticeable that","that none","none of","of the","the characters","characters feel","feel good","good about","about how","how they","they live"]}

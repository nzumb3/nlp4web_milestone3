{"title":"Hükümet Kadin","plot":"Xate is an ordinary woman from Midyat with eight children in tow. The only thing that sets her apart is her husband's job as Mayor of Midyat. Until, that is, an extraordinary day changes her life - and the lives of everyone else in Midyat. For the illiterate, uneducated Xate becomes Mayor of Midyat! While she takes on her mayoral duties much as she does those in her house, the infantile rivalry between her children in municipal matters leads to adventures that have the Midyat folk howling with laughter.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Xate","is","an","ordinari","woman","from","Midyat","with","eight","children","in","tow",".","The","onli","thing","that","set","her","apart","is","her","husband","'s","job","as","Mayor","of","Midyat",".","Until",",","that","is",",","an","extraordinari","day","chang","her","life","-","and","the","live","of","everyon","els","in","Midyat",".","For","the","illiter",",","uneduc","Xate","becom","Mayor","of","Midyat","!","While","she","take","on","her","mayor","duti","much","as","she","doe","those","in","her","hous",",","the","infantil","rivalri","between","her","children","in","municip","matter","lead","to","adventur","that","have","the","Midyat","folk","howl","with","laughter","."],"lemmas":["Xate","be","a","ordinary","woman","from","Midyat","with","eight","child","in","tow",".","the","only","thing","that","set","she","apart","be","she","husband","'s","job","as","Mayor","of","Midyat",".","until",",","that","be",",","a","extraordinary","day","change","she","life","-","and","the","life","of","everyone","else","in","Midyat",".","for","the","illiterate",",","uneducated","Xate","become","Mayor","of","Midyat","!","while","she","take","on","she","mayoral","duty","much","as","she","do","those","in","she","house",",","the","infantile","rivalry","between","she","child","in","municipal","matter","lead","to","adventure","that","have","the","Midyat","folk","howl","with","laughter","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Xate is an","is an ordinary","an ordinary woman","ordinary woman from","woman from Midyat","from Midyat with","Midyat with eight","with eight children","eight children in","children in tow","The only thing","only thing that","thing that sets","that sets her","sets her apart","her apart is","apart is her","is her husband","her husband 's","husband 's job","'s job as","job as Mayor","as Mayor of","Mayor of Midyat","Until , that",", that is","that is ,","is , an",", an extraordinary","an extraordinary day","extraordinary day changes","day changes her","changes her life","her life -","life - and","- and the","and the lives","the lives of","lives of everyone","of everyone else","everyone else in","else in Midyat","For the illiterate","the illiterate ,","illiterate , uneducated",", uneducated Xate","uneducated Xate becomes","Xate becomes Mayor","becomes Mayor of","Mayor of Midyat","While she takes","she takes on","takes on her","on her mayoral","her mayoral duties","mayoral duties much","duties much as","much as she","as she does","she does those","does those in","those in her","in her house","her house ,","house , the",", the infantile","the infantile rivalry","infantile rivalry between","rivalry between her","between her children","her children in","children in municipal","in municipal matters","municipal matters leads","matters leads to","leads to adventures","to adventures that","adventures that have","that have the","have the Midyat","the Midyat folk","Midyat folk howling","folk howling with","howling with laughter"],"2grams":["Xate is","is an","an ordinary","ordinary woman","woman from","from Midyat","Midyat with","with eight","eight children","children in","in tow","The only","only thing","thing that","that sets","sets her","her apart","apart is","is her","her husband","husband 's","'s job","job as","as Mayor","Mayor of","of Midyat","Until ,",", that","that is","is ,",", an","an extraordinary","extraordinary day","day changes","changes her","her life","life -","- and","and the","the lives","lives of","of everyone","everyone else","else in","in Midyat","For the","the illiterate","illiterate ,",", uneducated","uneducated Xate","Xate becomes","becomes Mayor","Mayor of","of Midyat","While she","she takes","takes on","on her","her mayoral","mayoral duties","duties much","much as","as she","she does","does those","those in","in her","her house","house ,",", the","the infantile","infantile rivalry","rivalry between","between her","her children","children in","in municipal","municipal matters","matters leads","leads to","to adventures","adventures that","that have","have the","the Midyat","Midyat folk","folk howling","howling with","with laughter"]}

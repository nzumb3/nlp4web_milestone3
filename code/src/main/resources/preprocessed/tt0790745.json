{"title":"The Salvation of Barry","plot":"THE SALVATION OF BARRY \"The Salvation of Barry\" is the story of Barry, a thirty-something, acerbic New York business owner who has found success but not fulfillment. At the beginning of our story, we find Barry in the fight of his life with a monstrous illness. After years of therapy and several attempts at finding a cure, to no avail, Barry decides to try to find peace of mind through the one avenue he hasn't explored - religion, spirituality, and God. Barry vows to meet with representatives of many religions and spiritual philosophies and do whatever they require of him in order to find true happiness and possibly salvation. What follows is a unique documentary series that ranges from heartbreaking to hilarious and disturbing to inspiring as Barry and God play a cosmic game of 'Hide-and Seek'.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["THE","SALVATION","OF","BARRi","\"","The","Salvat","of","Barri","\"","is","the","stori","of","Barri",",","a","thirty-someth",",","acerb","New","York","busi","owner","who","has","found","success","but","not","fulfil",".","At","the","begin","of","our","stori",",","we","find","Barri","in","the","fight","of","his","life","with","a","monstrous","ill",".","After","year","of","therapi","and","sever","attempt","at","find","a","cure",",","to","no","avail",",","Barri","decid","to","tri","to","find","peac","of","mind","through","the","one","avenu","he","has","n't","explor","-","religion",",","spiritu",",","and","God",".","Barri","vow","to","meet","with","repres","of","mani","religion","and","spiritu","philosophi","and","do","whatev","they","requir","of","him","in","order","to","find","true","happi","and","possibl","salvat",".","What","follow","is","a","uniqu","documentari","seri","that","rang","from","heartbreak","to","hilari","and","disturb","to","inspir","as","Barri","and","God","play","a","cosmic","game","of","'","Hide-and","Seek","'","."],"lemmas":["the","SALVATION","of","BARRY","``","the","Salvation","of","Barry","''","be","the","story","of","Barry",",","a","thirty-something",",","acerbic","New","York","business","owner","who","have","find","success","but","not","fulfillment",".","at","the","beginning","of","we","story",",","we","find","Barry","in","the","fight","of","he","life","with","a","monstrous","illness",".","after","year","of","therapy","and","several","attempt","at","find","a","cure",",","to","no","avail",",","Barry","decide","to","try","to","find","peace","of","mind","through","the","one","avenue","he","have","not","explore","-","religion",",","spirituality",",","and","God",".","Barry","vow","to","meet","with","representative","of","many","religion","and","spiritual","philosophy","and","do","whatever","they","require","of","he","in","order","to","find","true","happiness","and","possibly","salvation",".","what","follow","be","a","unique","documentary","series","that","range","from","heartbreak","to","hilarious","and","disturbing","to","inspiring","as","Barry","and","God","play","a","cosmic","game","of","'","hide-and","seek","'","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["THE SALVATION OF","SALVATION OF BARRY","OF BARRY \"","BARRY \" The","\" The Salvation","The Salvation of","Salvation of Barry","of Barry \"","Barry \" is","\" is the","is the story","the story of","story of Barry","of Barry ,","Barry , a",", a thirty-something","a thirty-something ,","thirty-something , acerbic",", acerbic New","acerbic New York","New York business","York business owner","business owner who","owner who has","who has found","has found success","found success but","success but not","but not fulfillment","At the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of our","of our story","our story ,","story , we",", we find","we find Barry","find Barry in","Barry in the","in the fight","the fight of","fight of his","of his life","his life with","life with a","with a monstrous","a monstrous illness","After years of","years of therapy","of therapy and","therapy and several","and several attempts","several attempts at","attempts at finding","at finding a","finding a cure","a cure ,","cure , to",", to no","to no avail","no avail ,","avail , Barry",", Barry decides","Barry decides to","decides to try","to try to","try to find","to find peace","find peace of","peace of mind","of mind through","mind through the","through the one","the one avenue","one avenue he","avenue he has","he has n't","has n't explored","n't explored -","explored -

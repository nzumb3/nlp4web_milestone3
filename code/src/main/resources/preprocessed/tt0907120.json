{"title":"Hasta la última piedra","plot":"In early 2005, yet another massacre of peasants from the San José de Apartadó peace community, leaves two families, seven people dead. The Colombian government uses this event as a pretext to setup a 150 men police force in the main village of the community. The citizens, afraid of finding themselves in the middle of the fighting between police and guerrilla, decide to abandon their houses and build a new village on some of the communities own land. The killings continue, the peasants accuse the military of most of them. Their status as a peace community is not recognized, yet they continue their peaceful resistance.","genres":["Documentary","

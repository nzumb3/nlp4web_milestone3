{"title":"Adormecidos","plot":"Other than being a fervent fan of horror and sci-fi cinema (B movies included), Raúl seems to be a fairly ordinary man in his early thirties. He's got a 9-to-5 job, follows quite a predictable routine both at work and in his personal life, and appears to be satisfied with the way things are. Yet, behind the surface, there's another side to him. He has a history of psychiatric problems and is now medicated - but don't picture a zombie; he's just your average urban man on your average meds. Plus there's something that's driving him insane: he suffers from an acute case of insomnia. Gradually, his sleeping disorder begins to hinder his work performance; he blames the lame condition of his pillows for his insomnia. So instead of going to see a shrink (again), he decides to buy a NASA-designed intelligent pillow. Believe it or not, he actually wakes up feeling unstressed and well rested. In no time, he's sleeping like a baby. That is, until he begins to have strongly disturbing nightmares. Soon enough, he starts losing touch with reality and feeling like he's someone else. From here on, it all goes into a spiral of unavoidable madness. Or is there any reality to some of the things he's experiencing? What if he's not that crazy?","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Other","than","be","a","fervent","fan","of","horror","and","sci-fi","cinema","(","B","movi","includ",")",",","Raúl","seem","to","be","a","fair","ordinari","man","in","his","earli","thirti",".","He","'s","got","a","9-to-5","job",",","follow","quit","a","predict","routin","both","at","work","and","in","his","person","life",",","and","appear","to","be","satisfi","with","the","way","thing","are",".","Yet",",","behind","the","surfac",",","there","'s","anoth","side","to","him",".","He","has","a","histori","of","psychiatr","problem","and","is","now","medic","-","but","do","n't","pictur","a","zombi",";","he","'s","just","your","averag","urban","man","on","your","averag","med",".","Plus","there","'s","someth","that","'s","drive","him","insan",":","he","suffer","from","an","acut","case","of","insomnia",".","Gradual",",","his","sleep","disord","begin","to","hinder","his","work","perform",";","he","blame","the","lame","condit","of","his","pillow","for","his","insomnia",".","So","instead","of","go","to","see","a","shrink","(","again",")",",","he","decid","to","buy","a","NASA-design","intellig","pillow",".","Believ","it","or","not",",","he","actual","wake","up","feel","unstress","and","well","rest",".","In","no","time",",","he","'s","sleep","like","a","babi",".","That","is",",","until","he","begin","to","have","strong","disturb","nightmar",".","Soon","enough",",","he","start","lose","touch","with","realiti","and","feel","like","he","'s","someon","els",".","From","here","on",",","it","all","goe","into","a","spiral","of","unavoid","mad",".","Or","is","there","ani","realiti","to","some","of","the","thing","he","'s","experienc","?","What","if","he","'s","not","that","crazi","?"],"lemmas":["other","than","be","a","fervent","fan","of","horror","and","sci-fi","cinema","-lrb-","b","movie","include","-rrb-",",","raúl","seem","to","be","a","fairly","ordinary","man","in","he","early","thirty",".","he","be","get","a","9-to-5","job",",","follow","quite","a","predictable","routine","both","at","work","and","in","he","personal","life",",","and","appear","to","be","satisfy","with","the","way","thing","be",".","yet",",","behind","the","surface",",","there","be","another","side","to","he",".","he","have","a","history","of","psychiatric","problem","and","be","now","medicate","-","but","do","not","picture","a","zombie",";","he","be","just","you","average","urban","man","on","you","average","med",".","Plus","there","be","something","that","be","drive","he","insane",":","he","suffer","from","a","acute","case","of","insomnia",".","gradually",",","he","sleep","disorder","begin","to","hinder","he","work","performance",";","he","blame","the","lame","condition","of","he","pillow","for","he","insomnia",".","so","instead","of","go","to","see","a","shrink","-lrb-","again","-rrb-",",","he","decide","to","buy","a","nasa-designed","intelligent","pillow",".","believe","it","or","not",",","he","actually","wake","up","feel","unstressed","and","well","rest",".","in","no","time",",","he","be","sleep","like","a","baby",".","that","be",",","until","he","begin","to","have","strongly","disturbing","nightmare",".","soon","enough",",","he","start","lose","touch","with","reality","and","feeling","like","he","be","someone","else",".","from","here","on",",","it","all","go","into","a","spiral","of","unavoidable","madness",".","or","be","there","any","reality","to","some","of","the","thing","he","be","experience","?","what","if","he","be","not","that","crazy","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Other than being","than being a","being a fervent","a fervent fan","fervent fan of","fan of horror","of horror and","horror and sci-fi","and sci-fi cinema","sci-fi cinema (","cinema ( B","( B movies","B movies included","movies included )","included ) ,",") , Raúl",", Raúl seems","Raúl seems to","seems to be","to be a","be a fairly","a fairly ordinary","fairly ordinary man","ordinary man in","man in his","in his early","his early thirties","He 's got","'s got a","got a 9-to-5","a 9-to-5 job","9-to-5 job ,","job , follows",", follows quite","follows quite a","quite a predictable","a predictable routine","predictable routine both","routine both at","both at work","at work and","work and in","and in his","in his personal","his personal life","personal life ,","life , and",", and appears","and appears to","appears to be","to be satisfied","be satisfied with","satisfied with the","with the way","the way things","way things are","Yet , behind",", behind the","behind the surface","the surface ,","surface , there",", there 's","there 's another","'s another side","another side to","side to him","He has a","has a history","a history of","history of psychiatric","of psychiatric problems","psychiatric problems and","problems and is","and is now","is now medicated","now medicated -","medicated - but","- but do","but do n't","do n't picture","n't picture a","picture a zombie","a zombie ;","zombie ;

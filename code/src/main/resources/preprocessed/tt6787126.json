{"title":"Lake Vostok. At the Mountains of Madness","plot":"More than 100 years ago, explorers raced to discover the South Pole. Now scientists are racing to discover the secret subterranean world of rivers and lakes buried miles beneath it. In 1974, scientists made a sensational discovery: a vast lake underneath the icy desert of Antarctica, untouched for 400.000 years, Lake Vostok. In spring 2012, after 40 years of drilling, Russian scientist broke through the ice. In two different narrative strands the film tells the story of the evolution of life and climate, the story of four decades of exploration in the coldest place on Earth, and it accompanies the scientists on their final trip to the camp. The film also explores the mythologies and legends surrounding Antarctica - from H.P. Lovecraft to James Cameron: the 'Mountains of Madness' have lured many into their realm - not many left unscathed.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["More","than","100","year","ago",",","explor","race","to","discov","the","South","Pole",".","Now","scientist","are","race","to","discov","the","secret","subterranean","world","of","river","and","lake","buri","mile","beneath","it",".","In","1974",",","scientist","made","a","sensat","discoveri",":","a","vast","lake","underneath","the","ici","desert","of","Antarctica",",","untouch","for","400.000","year",",","Lake","Vostok",".","In","spring","2012",",","after","40","year","of","drill",",","Russian","scientist","broke","through","the","ice",".","In","two","differ","narrat","strand","the","film","tell","the","stori","of","the","evolut","of","life","and","climat",",","the","stori","of","four","decad","of","explor","in","the","coldest","place","on","Earth",",","and","it","accompani","the","scientist","on","their","final","trip","to","the","camp",".","The","film","also","explor","the","mytholog","and","legend","surround","Antarctica","-","from","H.P.","Lovecraft","to","Jame","Cameron",":","the","'","Mountain","of","Mad","'","have","lure","mani","into","their","realm","-","not","mani","left","unscath","."],"lemmas":["more","than","100","year","ago",",","explorer","race","to","discover","the","South","Pole",".","now","scientist","be","race","to","discover","the","secret","subterranean","world","of","river","and","lake","bury","mile","beneath","it",".","in","1974",",","scientist","make","a","sensational","discovery",":","a","vast","lake","underneath","the","icy","desert","of","Antarctica",",","untouched","for","400.000","year",",","Lake","Vostok",".","in","spring","2012",",","after","40","year","of","drilling",",","russian","scientist","break","through","the","ice",".","in","two","different","narrative","strand","the","film","tell","the","story","of","the","evolution","of","life","and","climate",",","the","story","of","four","decade","of","exploration","in","the","coldest","place","on","Earth",",","and","it","accompany","the","scientist","on","they","final","trip","to","the","camp",".","the","film","also","explore","the","mythology","and","legend","surround","Antarctica","-","from","H.P.","Lovecraft","to","James","Cameron",":","the","'","mountain","of","madness","'","have","lure","many","into","they","realm","-","not","many","leave","unscathed","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["More than 100","than 100 years","100 years ago","years ago ,","ago , explorers",", explorers raced","explorers raced to","raced to discover","to discover the","discover the South","the South Pole","Now scientists are","scientists are racing","are racing to","racing to discover","to discover the","discover the secret","the secret subterranean","secret subterranean world","subterranean world of","world of rivers","of rivers and","rivers and lakes","and lakes buried","lakes buried miles","buried miles beneath","miles beneath it","In 1974 ,","1974 , scientists",", scientists made","scientists made a","made a sensational","a sensational discovery","sensational discovery :","discovery : a",": a vast","a vast lake","vast lake underneath","lake underneath the","underneath the icy","the icy desert","icy desert of","desert of Antarctica","of Antarctica ,","Antarctica , untouched",", untouched for","untouched for 400.000","for 400.000 years","400.000 years ,","years , Lake",", Lake Vostok","In spring 2012","spring 2012 ,","2012 , after",", after 40","after 40 years","40 years of","years of drilling","of drilling ,","drilling , Russian",", Russian scientist","Russian scientist broke","scientist broke through","broke through the","through the ice","In two different","two different narrative","different narrative strands","narrative strands the","strands the film","the film tells","film tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of the","of the evolution","the evolution of","evolution of life","of life and","life and climate","and climate ,","climate , the",", the story","the story of","story of four","of four decades","four decades of","decades of exploration","of exploration in","exploration in the","in the coldest","the coldest place","coldest place on","place on Earth","on Earth ,","Earth , and",", and it","and it accompanies","it accompanies the","accompanies the scientists","the scientists on","scientists on their","on their final","their final trip","final trip to","trip to the","to the camp","The film also","film also explores","also explores the","explores the mythologies","the mythologies and","mythologies and legends","and legends surrounding","legends surrounding Antarctica","surrounding Antarctica -","Antarctica - from","- from H.P.","from H.P.

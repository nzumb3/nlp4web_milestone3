{"title":"T.N.T.","plot":"The Tactical Neutralization Team, or T.N.T., is a squad of elite soldiers sent on top-secret, near-suicidal missions around the world. After one of their missions ends in failure, team member Alex decides he's had enough of the special-op life and calls it quits. His commanding officer, however, doesn't want the security risk of a former member walking around, so he assigns another member of the team to hunt down Alex and retire him permanently.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["The","Tactic","Neutral","Team",",","or","T.N.T.",",","is","a","squad","of","elit","soldier","sent","on","top-secret",",","near-suicid","mission","around","the","world",".","After","one","of","their","mission","end","in","failur",",","team","member","Alex","decid","he","'s","had","enough","of","the","special-op","life","and","call","it","quit",".","His","command","offic",",","howev",",","doe","n't","want","the","secur","risk","of","a","former","member","walk","around",",","so","he","assign","anoth","member","of","the","team","to","hunt","down","Alex","and","retir","him","perman","."],"lemmas":["the","Tactical","Neutralization","Team",",","or","T.N.T.",",","be","a","squad","of","elite","soldier","send","on","top-secret",",","near-suicidal","mission","around","the","world",".","after","one","of","they","mission","end","in","failure",",","team","member","Alex","decide","he","be","have","enough","of","the","special-op","life","and","call","it","quit",".","he","commanding","officer",",","however",",","do","not","want","the","security","risk","of","a","former","member","walk","around",",","so","he","assign","another","member","of","the","team","to","hunt","down","Alex","and","retire","he","permanently","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Tactical Neutralization","Tactical Neutralization Team","Neutralization Team ,","Team , or",", or T.N.T.","or T.N.T. ,","T.N.T. , is",", is a","is a squad","a squad of","squad of elite","of elite soldiers","elite soldiers sent","soldiers sent on","sent on top-secret","on top-secret ,","top-secret , near-suicidal",", near-suicidal missions","near-suicidal missions around","missions around the","around the world","After one of","one of their","of their missions","their missions ends","missions ends in","ends in failure","in failure ,","failure , team",", team member","team member Alex","member Alex decides","Alex decides he","decides he 's","he 's had","'s had enough","had enough of","enough of the","of the special-op","the special-op life","special-op life and","life and calls","and calls it","calls it quits","His commanding officer","commanding officer ,","officer , however",", however ,","however , does",", does n't","does n't want","n't want the","want the security","the security risk","security risk of","risk of a","of a former","a former member","former member walking","member walking around","walking around ,","around , so",", so he","so he assigns","he assigns another","assigns another member","another member of","member of the","of the team","the team to","team to hunt","to hunt down","hunt down Alex","down Alex and","Alex and retire","and retire him","retire him permanently"],"2grams":["The Tactical","Tactical Neutralization","Neutralization Team","Team ,",", or","or T.N.T.","T.N.T. ,",", is","is a","a squad","squad of","of elite","elite soldiers","soldiers sent","sent on","on top-secret","top-secret ,",", near-suicidal","near-suicidal missions","missions around","around the","the world","After one","one of","of their","their missions","missions ends","ends in","in failure","failure ,",", team","team member","member Alex","Alex decides","decides he","he 's","'s had","had enough","enough of","of the","the special-op","special-op life","life and","and calls","calls it","it quits","His commanding","commanding officer","officer ,",", however","however ,",", does","does n't","n't want","want the","the security","security risk","risk of","of a","a former","former member","member walking","walking around","around ,",", so","so he","he assigns","assigns another","another member","member of","of the","the team","team to","to hunt","hunt down","down Alex","Alex and","and retire","retire him","him permanently"]}

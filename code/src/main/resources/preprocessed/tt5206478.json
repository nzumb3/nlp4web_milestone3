{"title":"Loving Carmen","plot":"The Gypsy woman from the tobacco factory in Seville has become the brightest symbol of the female free spirit in the 19th century. For more than a century musicians, singers, directors, researchers and collectors take through time her story, turning it into a legend. This movie shows the different ways of transforming the character into a favorite and immortal love story treated in art, literature, music and cinema. The documentary 'Loving Carmen' is built on the earliest studies of Carmen in art, literature, music and cinema. Presenting the first recordings of Carmen arias, the film also shows the history of the recording industry at the end of 19th and early 20th century. The development of cinema and television industry goes hand in hand with the immortal Bizet opera in an unique way. 'Loving Carmen' presents multiple archive images from Bibliothèque nationale de France, The Library of the US Congress and a number of private collections. In parallel the movie unveils the process of the latest opera staging in the Swiss town of St. Gallen by Nicola Berloffa, conducted by Modestas Pitrenas, the famous Latvian conductor with Alex Penda /a.k.a. Alexandina Pendachanska/ as Carmen, Ladislav Elgr as Don Jose, Aris Argiris- Esacmilio and Cristina Pasaroiu as Micaela. Various playwrights, researchers and collectors of rare records from the late 19th and early 20th century also take part in the documentary.

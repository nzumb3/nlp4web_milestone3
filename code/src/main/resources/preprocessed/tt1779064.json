{"title":"Two and a Half Heroes","plot":"It is the story of the unusual friendship that develops between Luka and Umut, two very different boys who meet by chance on the streets of Stuttgart. While Luka, the mute, communicates only through a bizarre hand puppet, the talkative Umut barely pauses for breath as he strives to grow up to be a policeman, a secret agent or perhaps a bodyguard. At first, Umut shows little more than mild curiosity for strange boy he names 'Psycho'. When the Turkish boy discovers Luka's dark secret, he suddenly learns much more about him. At the end of the most exhilarating day of their lives, they are both a whole lot more grown up.","genres":["Comedy"," Family","

{"title":"Jana und Jan","plot":"Fall 1989: Jan is almost 16. Caught while trying to escape to West Germany, he is transferred from prison to a juvenile detention center. Here, he meets Jana ... and what starts as a bet, becomes true love. When Jana gets pregnant, the situation spirals out of control. In the summer of 1990, Jana and Jan flee into the unknown, insecure future of a new Germany. In this film, the director, internationally known for his critical films about children and young people, cast non-professional actors - some from juvenile detention centers - in the leading roles.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Fall","1989",":","Jan","is","almost","16",".","Caught","while","tri","to","escap","to","West","Germani",",","he","is","transfer","from","prison","to","a","juvenil","detent","center",".","Here",",","he","meet","Jana","...","and","what","start","as","a","bet",",","becom","true","love",".","When","Jana","get","pregnant",",","the","situat","spiral","out","of","control",".","In","the","summer","of","1990",",","Jana","and","Jan","flee","into","the","unknown",",","insecur","futur","of","a","new","Germani",".","In","this","film",",","the","director",",","intern","known","for","his","critic","film","about","children","and","young","peopl",",","cast","non-profession","actor","-","some","from","juvenil","detent","center","-","in","the","lead","role","."],"lemmas":["fall","1989",":","Jan","be","almost","16",".","catch","while","try","to","escape","to","West","Germany",",","he","be","transfer","from","prison","to","a","juvenile","detention","center",".","here",",","he","meet","Jana","...","and","what","start","as","a","bet",",","become","true","love",".","when","Jana","get","pregnant",",","the","situation","spiral","out","of","control",".","in","the","summer","of","1990",",","Jana","and","Jan","flee","into","the","unknown",",","insecure","future","of","a","new","Germany",".","in","this","film",",","the","director",",","internationally","know","for","he","critical","film","about","child","and","young","people",",","cast","non-professional","actor","-","some","from","juvenile","detention","center","-","in","the","lead","role","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fall 1989 :","1989 : Jan",": Jan is","Jan is almost","is almost 16","Caught while trying","while trying to","trying to escape","to escape to","escape to West","to West Germany","West Germany ,","Germany , he",", he is","he is transferred","is transferred from","transferred from prison","from prison to","prison to a","to a juvenile","a juvenile detention","juvenile detention center","Here , he",", he meets","he meets Jana","meets Jana ...","Jana ... and","... and what","and what starts","what starts as","starts as a","as a bet","a bet ,","bet , becomes",", becomes true","becomes true love","When Jana gets","Jana gets pregnant","gets pregnant ,","pregnant , the",", the situation","the situation spirals","situation spirals out","spirals out of","out of control","In the summer","the summer of","summer of 1990","of 1990 ,","1990 , Jana",", Jana and","Jana and Jan","and Jan flee","Jan flee into","flee into the","into the unknown","the unknown ,","unknown , insecure",", insecure future","insecure future of","future of a","of a new","a new Germany","In this film","this film ,","film , the",", the director","the director ,","director , internationally",", internationally known","internationally known for","known for his","for his critical","his critical films","critical films about","films about children","about children and","children and young","and young people","young people ,","people , cast",", cast non-professional","cast non-professional actors","non-professional actors -","actors - some","- some from","some from juvenile","from juvenile detention","juvenile detention centers","detention centers -","centers - in","- in the","in the leading","the leading roles"],"2grams":["Fall 1989","1989 :",": Jan","Jan is","is almost","almost 16","Caught while","while trying","trying to","to escape","escape to","to West","West Germany","Germany ,",", he","he is","is transferred","transferred from","from prison","prison to","to a","a juvenile","juvenile detention","detention center","Here ,",", he","he meets","meets Jana","Jana ...","... and","and what","what starts","starts as","as a","a bet","bet ,",", becomes","becomes true","true love","When Jana","Jana gets","gets pregnant","pregnant ,",", the","the situation","situation spirals","spirals out","out of","of control","In the","the summer","summer of","of 1990","1990 ,",", Jana","Jana and","and Jan","Jan flee","flee into","into the","the unknown","unknown ,",", insecure","insecure future","future of","of a","a new","new Germany","In this","this film","film ,",", the","the director","director ,",", internationally","internationally known","known for","for his","his critical","critical films","films about","about children","children and","and young","young people","people ,",", cast","cast non-professional","non-professional actors","actors -","- some","some from","from juvenile","juvenile detention","detention centers","centers -","- in","in the","the leading","leading roles"]}

{"title":"East Side Showdown","plot":"In inner Metropolitian Toronto, there is a conflict growing. With many formerly run down sections of the city increasingly coming under the ownership of well off people who determined to fix up their new homes, they are becoming increasingly hostile to the indigenous poor population there. This film examines the two worlds of the gentrification side and the urban poor who struggle to live within their means and the activists who help them as the two sides fight their political battles for their fair share of living space in the city.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","inner","Metropolitian","Toronto",",","there","is","a","conflict","grow",".","With","mani","former","run","down","section","of","the","citi","increas","come","under","the","ownership","of","well","off","peopl","who","determin","to","fix","up","their","new","home",",","they","are","becom","increas","hostil","to","the","indigen","poor","popul","there",".","This","film","examin","the","two","world","of","the","gentrif","side","and","the","urban","poor","who","struggl","to","live","within","their","mean","and","the","activist","who","help","them","as","the","two","side","fight","their","polit","battl","for","their","fair","share","of","live","space","in","the","citi","."],"lemmas":["in","inner","Metropolitian","Toronto",",","there","be","a","conflict","growing",".","with","many","formerly","run","down","section","of","the","city","increasingly","come","under","the","ownership","of","well","off","people","who","determine","to","fix","up","they","new","home",",","they","be","become","increasingly","hostile","to","the","indigenous","poor","population","there",".","this","film","examine","the","two","world","of","the","gentrification","side","and","the","urban","poor","who","struggle","to","live","within","they","means","and","the","activist","who","help","they","as","the","two","side","fight","they","political","battle","for","they","fair","share","of","live","space","in","the","city","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In inner Metropolitian","inner Metropolitian Toronto","Metropolitian Toronto ,","Toronto , there",", there is","there is a","is a conflict","a conflict growing","With many formerly","many formerly run","formerly run down","run down sections","down sections of","sections of the","of the city","the city increasingly","city increasingly coming","increasingly coming under","coming under the","under the ownership","the ownership of","ownership of well","of well off","well off people","off people who","people who determined","who determined to","determined to fix","to fix up","fix up their","up their new","their new homes","new homes ,","homes , they",", they are","they are becoming","are becoming increasingly","becoming increasingly hostile","increasingly hostile to","hostile to the","to the indigenous","the indigenous poor","indigenous poor population","poor population there","This film examines","film examines the","examines the two","the two worlds","two worlds of","worlds of the","of the gentrification","the gentrification side","gentrification side and","side and the","and the urban","the urban poor","urban poor who","poor who struggle","who struggle to","struggle to live","to live within","live within their","within their means","their means and","means and the","and the activists","the activists who","activists who help","who help them","help them as","them as the","as the two","the two sides","two sides fight","sides fight their","fight their political","their political battles","political battles for","battles for their","for their fair","their fair share","fair share of","share of living","of living space","living space in","space in the","in the city"],"2grams":["In inner","inner Metropolitian","Metropolitian Toronto","Toronto ,",", there","there is","is a","a conflict","conflict growing","With many","many formerly","formerly run","run down","down sections","sections of","of the","the city","city increasingly","increasingly coming","coming under","under the","the ownership","ownership of","of well","well off","off people","people who","who determined","determined to","to fix","fix up","up their","their new","new homes","homes ,",", they","they are","are becoming","becoming increasingly","increasingly hostile","hostile to","to the","the indigenous","indigenous poor","poor population","population there","This film","film examines","examines the","the two","two worlds","worlds of","of the","the gentrification","gentrification side","side and","and the","the urban","urban poor","poor who","who struggle","struggle to","to live","live within","within their","their means","means and","and the","the activists","activists who","who help","help them","them as","as the","the two","two sides","sides fight","fight their","their political","political battles","battles for","for their","their fair","fair share","share of","of living","living space","space in","in the","the city"]}

{"title":"Transcendent","plot":"From the outside, 18-year-old Rachel Woods looks like she has it all; beauty, money, and a future full of hope. But on the inside, Rachel struggles with the fact that she's never really lived life on her own terms. All too often she concedes to overbearing parents with lofty expectations as to what Rachel should 'be' in the future. Rachel's entire world transforms after she meets Swan, a mysterious teen from a foreign land. As their relationship blossoms, Swan teaches Rachel that the only person she has to make happy in her life is herself.","genres":["Mystery"],"stems":["From","the","outsid",",","18-year-old","Rachel","Wood","look","like","she","has","it","all",";","beauti",",","money",",","and","a","futur","full","of","hope",".","But","on","the","insid",",","Rachel","struggl","with","the","fact","that","she","'s","never","realli","live","life","on","her","own","term",".","All","too","often","she","conced","to","overbear","parent","with","lofti","expect","as","to","what","Rachel","should","'","be","'","in","the","futur",".","Rachel","'s","entir","world","transform","after","she","meet","Swan",",","a","mysteri","teen","from","a","foreign","land",".","As","their","relationship","blossom",",","Swan","teach","Rachel","that","the","onli","person","she","has","to","make","happi","in","her","life","is","herself","."],"lemmas":["from","the","outside",",","18-year-old","Rachel","Woods","look","like","she","have","it","all",";","beauty",",","money",",","and","a","future","full","of","hope",".","but","on","the","inside",",","Rachel","struggle","with","the","fact","that","she","be","never","really","live","life","on","she","own","term",".","all","too","often","she","concede","to","overbearing","parent","with","lofty","expectation","as","to","what","Rachel","should","'","be","'","in","the","future",".","Rachel","'s","entire","world","transform","after","she","meet","swan",",","a","mysterious","teen","from","a","foreign","land",".","as","they","relationship","blossom",",","swan","teach","Rachel","that","the","only","person","she","have","to","make","happy","in","she","life","be","herself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["From the outside","the outside ,","outside , 18-year-old",", 18-year-old Rachel","18-year-old Rachel Woods","Rachel Woods looks","Woods looks like","looks like she","like she has","she has it","has it all","it all ;","all ; beauty","; beauty ,","beauty , money",", money ,","money , and",", and a","and a future","a future full","future full of","full of hope","But on the","on the inside","the inside ,","inside , Rachel",", Rachel struggles","Rachel struggles with","struggles with the","with the fact","the fact that","fact that she","that she 's","she 's never","'s never really","never really lived","really lived life","lived life on","life on her","on her own","her own terms","All too often","too often she","often she concedes","she concedes to","concedes to overbearing","to overbearing parents","overbearing parents with","parents with lofty","with lofty expectations","lofty expectations as","expectations as to","as to what","to what Rachel","what Rachel should","Rachel should '","should ' be","' be '","be ' in","' in the","in the future","Rachel 's entire","'s entire world","entire world transforms","world transforms after","transforms after she","after she meets","she meets Swan","meets Swan ,","Swan , a",", a mysterious","a mysterious teen","mysterious teen from","teen from a","from a foreign","a foreign land","As their relationship","their relationship blossoms","relationship blossoms ,","blossoms , Swan",", Swan teaches","Swan teaches Rachel","teaches Rachel that","Rachel that the","that the only","the only person","only person she","person she has","she has to","has to make","to make happy","make happy in","happy in her","in her life","her life is","life is herself"],"2grams":["From the","the outside","outside ,",", 18-year-old","18-year-old Rachel","Rachel Woods","Woods looks","looks like","like she","she has","has it","it all","all ;","; beauty","beauty ,",", money","money ,",", and","and a","a future","future full","full of","of hope","But on","on the","the inside","inside ,",", Rachel","Rachel struggles","struggles with","with the","the fact","fact that","that she","she 's","'s never","never really","really lived","lived life","life on","on her","her own","own terms","All too","too often","often she","she concedes","concedes to","to overbearing","overbearing parents","parents with","with lofty","lofty expectations","expectations as","as to","to what","what Rachel","Rachel should","should '","' be","be '","' in","in the","the future","Rachel 's","'s entire","entire world","world transforms","transforms after","after she","she meets","meets Swan","Swan ,",", a","a mysterious","mysterious teen","teen from","from a","a foreign","foreign land","As their","their relationship","relationship blossoms","blossoms ,",", Swan","Swan teaches","teaches Rachel","Rachel that","that the","the only","only person","person she","she has","has to","to make","make happy","happy in","in her","her life","life is","is herself"]}

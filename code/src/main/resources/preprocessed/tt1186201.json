{"title":"Bulletproof Salesman","plot":"Within days of the coalition forces entering Baghdad, Fidelis Cloer has arrived as well. He sells armored cars. Over the next few years, he sells more than 200 in Iraq. We watch him examine the wreckage of destroyed vehicles, gathering information on how to improve his product. He talks about his competition. We visit a testing center in Bavaria where Cloer's researchers blow up vehicles. Talking to the camera, Cloer gives advice on safety and blending in. Near the end of the film, he's in Kabul, repeating his pattern of research and sales. He's philosophical, confident he'll always have work.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Within","day","of","the","coalit","forc","enter","Baghdad",",","Fide","Cloer","has","arriv","as","well",".","He","sell","armor","car",".","Over","the","next","few","year",",","he","sell","more","than","200","in","Iraq",".","We","watch","him","examin","the","wreckag","of","destroy","vehicl",",","gather","inform","on","how","to","improv","his","product",".","He","talk","about","his","competit",".","We","visit","a","test","center","in","Bavaria","where","Cloer","'s","research","blow","up","vehicl",".","Talk","to","the","camera",",","Cloer","give","advic","on","safeti","and","blend","in",".","Near","the","end","of","the","film",",","he","'s","in","Kabul",",","repeat","his","pattern","of","research","and","sale",".","He","'s","philosoph",",","confid","he","ll","alway","have","work","."],"lemmas":["within","day","of","the","coalition","force","enter","Baghdad",",","fidelis","Cloer","have","arrive","as","well",".","he","sell","armored","car",".","over","the","next","few","year",",","he","sell","more","than","200","in","Iraq",".","we","watch","he","examine","the","wreckage","of","destroy","vehicle",",","gather","information","on","how","to","improve","he","product",".","he","talk","about","he","competition",".","we","visit","a","testing","center","in","Bavaria","where","Cloer","'s","researcher","blow","up","vehicle",".","talk","to","the","camera",",","Cloer","give","advice","on","safety","and","blend","in",".","near","the","end","of","the","film",",","he","be","in","Kabul",",","repeat","he","pattern","of","research","and","sale",".","he","be","philosophical",",","confident","he","will","always","have","work","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Within days of","days of the","of the coalition","the coalition forces","coalition forces entering","forces entering Baghdad","entering Baghdad ,","Baghdad , Fidelis",", Fidelis Cloer","Fidelis Cloer has","Cloer has arrived","has arrived as","arrived as well","He sells armored","sells armored cars","Over the next","the next few","next few years","few years ,","years , he",", he sells","he sells more","sells more than","more than 200","than 200 in","200 in Iraq","We watch him","watch him examine","him examine the","examine the wreckage","the wreckage of","wreckage of destroyed","of destroyed vehicles","destroyed vehicles ,","vehicles , gathering",", gathering information","gathering information on","information on how","on how to","how to improve","to improve his","improve his product","He talks about","talks about his","about his competition","We visit a","visit a testing","a testing center","testing center in","center in Bavaria","in Bavaria where","Bavaria where Cloer","where Cloer 's","Cloer 's researchers","'s researchers blow","researchers blow up","blow up vehicles","Talking to the","to the camera","the camera ,","camera , Cloer",", Cloer gives","Cloer gives advice","gives advice on","advice on safety","on safety and","safety and blending","and blending in","Near the end","the end of","end of the","of the film","the film ,","film , he",", he 's","he 's in","'s in Kabul","in Kabul ,","Kabul , repeating",", repeating his","repeating his pattern","his pattern of","pattern of research","of research and","research and sales","He 's philosophical","'s philosophical ,","philosophical , confident",", confident he","confident he 'll","he 'll always","'ll always have","always have work"],"2grams":["Within days","days of","of the","the coalition","coalition forces","forces entering","entering Baghdad","Baghdad ,",", Fidelis","Fidelis Cloer","Cloer has","has arrived","arrived as","as well","He sells","sells armored","armored cars","Over the","the next","next few","few years","years ,",", he","he sells","sells more","more than","than 200","200 in","in Iraq","We watch","watch him","him examine","examine the","the wreckage","wreckage of","of destroyed","destroyed vehicles","vehicles ,",", gathering","gathering information","information on","on how","how to","to improve","improve his","his product","He talks","talks about","about his","his competition","We visit","visit a","a testing","testing center","center in","in Bavaria","Bavaria where","where Cloer","Cloer 's","'s researchers","researchers blow","blow up","up vehicles","Talking to","to the","the camera","camera ,",", Cloer","Cloer gives","gives advice","advice on","on safety","safety and","and blending","blending in","Near the","the end","end of","of the","the film","film ,",", he","he 's","'s in","in Kabul","Kabul ,",", repeating","repeating his","his pattern","pattern of","of research","research and","and sales","He 's","'s philosophical","philosophical ,",", confident","confident he","he 'll","'ll always","always have","have work"]}

{"title":"The Final Gift","plot":"The Final Gift documents director/producer Therese Bartholomew's quest to find life and meaning after the murder of her younger brother, Steve. Through video diary footage as well as interviews with Bartholomew and other members of Steve's family, Bartholomew has created an intimate story of grief and healing. The film culminates with a victim/offender dialog where Bartholomew comes face to face with her brother's killer, Karl, in a South Carolina prison. The film is a poignant story of introspection; it's about resilience and the complexity of being human. Through grit and grace, Bartholomew emerges a passionate advocate for restorative justice and, for victims, and yes, for offenders.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Final","Gift","document","director/produc","Theres","Bartholomew","'s","quest","to","find","life","and","mean","after","the","murder","of","her","younger","brother",",","Steve",".","Through","video","diari","footag","as","well","as","interview","with","Bartholomew","and","other","member","of","Steve","'s","famili",",","Bartholomew","has","creat","an","intim","stori","of","grief","and","heal",".","The","film","culmin","with","a","victim/offend","dialog","where","Bartholomew","come","face","to","face","with","her","brother","'s","killer",",","Karl",",","in","a","South","Carolina","prison",".","The","film","is","a","poignant","stori","of","introspect",";","it","'s","about","resili","and","the","complex","of","be","human",".","Through","grit","and","grace",",","Bartholomew","emerg","a","passion","advoc","for","restor","justic","and",",","for","victim",",","and","yes",",","for","offend","."],"lemmas":["the","Final","gift","document","director/producer","Therese","Bartholomew","'s","quest","to","find","life","and","meaning","after","the","murder","of","she","younger","brother",",","Steve",".","through","video","diary","footage","as","well","as","interview","with","Bartholomew","and","other","member","of","Steve","'s","family",",","Bartholomew","have","create","a","intimate","story","of","grief","and","healing",".","the","film","culminate","with","a","victim/offender","dialog","where","Bartholomew","come","face","to","face","with","she","brother","'s","killer",",","Karl",",","in","a","South","Carolina","prison",".","the","film","be","a","poignant","story","of","introspection",";","it","be","about","resilience","and","the","complexity","of","be","human",".","through","grit","and","grace",",","Bartholomew","emerge","a","passionate","advocate","for","restorative","justice","and",",","for","victim",",","and","yes",",","for","offender","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Final Gift","Final Gift documents","Gift documents director/producer","documents director/producer Therese","director/producer Therese Bartholomew","Therese Bartholomew 's","Bartholomew 's quest","'s quest to","quest to find","to find life","find life and","life and meaning","and meaning after","meaning after the","after the murder","the murder of","murder of her","of her younger","her younger brother","younger brother ,","brother , Steve","Through video diary","video diary footage","diary footage as","footage as well","as well as","well as interviews","as interviews with","interviews with Bartholomew","with Bartholomew and","Bartholomew and other","and other members","other members of","members of Steve","of Steve 's","Steve 's family","'s family ,","family , Bartholomew",", Bartholomew has","Bartholomew has created","has created an","created an intimate","an intimate story","intimate story of","story of grief","of grief and","grief and healing","The film culminates","film culminates with","culminates with a","with a victim/offender","a victim/offender dialog","victim/offender dialog where","dialog where Bartholomew","where Bartholomew comes","Bartholomew comes face","comes face to","face to face","to face with","face with her","with her brother","her brother 's","brother 's killer","'s killer ,","killer , Karl",", Karl ,","Karl , in",", in a","in a South","a South Carolina","South Carolina prison","The film is","film is a","is a poignant","a poignant story","poignant story of","story of introspection","of introspection ;","introspection ;

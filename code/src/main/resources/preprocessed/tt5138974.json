{"title":"The Man Who Saw Too Much","plot":"What drives someone to pursue scenes of death and suffering? From the age of nine, avid cinephile Enrique Metinides was photographing corpses in the street. Despite his age, this passion soon landed him a job in the tabloids, where he was given license to follow his morbid obsession. Through his work we explore Mexico City, as seen through the prism of its crime scenes, and delve into the human fascination with the macabre.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["What","drive","someon","to","pursu","scene","of","death","and","suffer","?","From","the","age","of","nine",",","avid","cinephil","Enriqu","Metinid","was","photograph","corps","in","the","street",".","Despit","his","age",",","this","passion","soon","land","him","a","job","in","the","tabloid",",","where","he","was","given","licens","to","follow","his","morbid","obsess",".","Through","his","work","we","explor","Mexico","Citi",",","as","seen","through","the","prism","of","it","crime","scene",",","and","delv","into","the","human","fascin","with","the","macabr","."],"lemmas":["what","drive","someone","to","pursue","scene","of","death","and","suffering","?","from","the","age","of","nine",",","avid","cinephile","Enrique","Metinides","be","photograph","corpse","in","the","street",".","despite","he","age",",","this","passion","soon","land","he","a","job","in","the","tabloid",",","where","he","be","give","license","to","follow","he","morbid","obsession",".","through","he","work","we","explore","Mexico","City",",","as","see","through","the","prism","of","its","crime","scene",",","and","delve","into","the","human","fascination","with","the","macabre","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["What drives someone","drives someone to","someone to pursue","to pursue scenes","pursue scenes of","scenes of death","of death and","death and suffering","From the age","the age of","age of nine","of nine ,","nine , avid",", avid cinephile","avid cinephile Enrique","cinephile Enrique Metinides","Enrique Metinides was","Metinides was photographing","was photographing corpses","photographing corpses in","corpses in the","in the street","Despite his age","his age ,","age , this",", this passion","this passion soon","passion soon landed","soon landed him","landed him a","him a job","a job in","job in the","in the tabloids","the tabloids ,","tabloids , where",", where he","where he was","he was given","was given license","given license to","license to follow","to follow his","follow his morbid","his morbid obsession","Through his work","his work we","work we explore","we explore Mexico","explore Mexico City","Mexico City ,","City , as",", as seen","as seen through","seen through the","through the prism","the prism of","prism of its","of its crime","its crime scenes","crime scenes ,","scenes , and",", and delve","and delve into","delve into the","into the human","the human fascination","human fascination with","fascination with the","with the macabre"],"2grams":["What drives","drives someone","someone to","to pursue","pursue scenes","scenes of","of death","death and","and suffering","From the","the age","age of","of nine","nine ,",", avid","avid cinephile","cinephile Enrique","Enrique Metinides","Metinides was","was photographing","photographing corpses","corpses in","in the","the street","Despite his","his age","age ,",", this","this passion","passion soon","soon landed","landed him","him a","a job","job in","in the","the tabloids","tabloids ,",", where","where he","he was","was given","given license","license to","to follow","follow his","his morbid","morbid obsession","Through his","his work","work we","we explore","explore Mexico","Mexico City","City ,",", as","as seen","seen through","through the","the prism","prism of","of its","its crime","crime scenes","scenes ,",", and","and delve","delve into","into the","the human","human fascination","fascination with","with the","the macabre"]}

Kushal meets a bubbly girl Kushi (Shwetha Srivatsav) in the house he is sent to, but the rest of the family is out of town. The two share their past romantic liaisons before falling in love with each other. It turns out, though, that the girl is not who she pretends to be. The film takes a curious turn from here.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Kushal","(","Rakshit","Shetti",")","is","sent","by","his","radio","jockey","sister","Rachana","to","Kodagu","to","meet","her","boyfriend","'s","sister","in","the","hope","that","the","two","will","take","a","like","to","each","other",",","lead","to","marriag",",","and","thus","pave","the","way","for","her","own","marriag",".","Kushal","meet","a","bubbl","girl","Kushi","(","Shwetha","Srivatsav",")","in","the","hous","he","is","sent","to",",","but","the","rest","of","the","famili","is","out","of","town",".","The","two","share","their","past","romant","liaison","befor","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","It","turn","out",",","though",",","that","the","girl","is","not","who","she","pretend","to","be",".","The","film","take","a","curious","turn","from","here","."],"lemmas":["Kushal","-lrb-","Rakshit","Shetty","-rrb-","be","send","by","he","radio","jockey","sister","rachana","to","Kodagu","to","meet","she","boyfriend","'s","sister","in","the","hope","that","the","two","will","take","a","liking","to","each","other",",","lead","to","marriage",",","and","thus","pave","the","way","for","she","own","marriage",".","Kushal","meet","a","bubbly","girl","Kushi","-lrb-","Shwetha","Srivatsav","-rrb-","in","the","house","he","be","send","to",",","but","the","rest","of","the","family","be","out","of","town",".","the","two","share","they","past","romantic","liaison","before","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","it","turn","out",",","though",",","that","the","girl","be","not","who","she","pretend","to","be",".","the","film","take","a","curious","turn","from","here","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kushal ( Rakshit","( Rakshit Shetty","Rakshit Shetty )","Shetty ) is",") is sent","is sent by","sent by his","by his radio","his radio jockey","radio jockey sister","jockey sister Rachana","sister Rachana to","Rachana to Kodagu","to Kodagu to","Kodagu to meet","to meet her","meet her boyfriend","her boyfriend 's","boyfriend 's sister","'s sister in","sister in the","in the hope","the hope that","hope that the","that the two","the two will","two will take","will take a","take a liking","a liking to","liking to each","to each other","each other ,","other , leading",", leading to","leading to marriage","to marriage ,","marriage , and",", and thus","and thus paving","thus paving the","paving the way","the way for","way for her","for her own","her own marriage","Kushal meets a","meets a bubbly","a bubbly girl","bubbly girl Kushi","girl Kushi (","Kushi ( Shwetha","( Shwetha Srivatsav","Shwetha Srivatsav )","Srivatsav ) in",") in the","in the house","the house he","house he is","he is sent","is sent to","sent to ,","to , but",", but the","but the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the family","the family is","family is out","is out of","out of town","The two share","two share their","share their past","their past romantic","past romantic liaisons","romantic liaisons before","liaisons before falling","before falling in","falling in love","in love with","love with each","with each other","It turns out","turns out ,","out , though",", though ,","though , that",", that the","that the girl","the girl is","girl is not","is not who","not who she","who she pretends","she pretends to","pretends to be","The film takes","film takes a","takes a curious","a curious turn","curious turn from","turn from here"],"2grams":["Kushal (","( Rakshit","Rakshit Shetty","Shetty )",") is","is sent","sent by","by his","his radio","radio jockey","jockey sister","sister Rachana","Rachana to","to Kodagu","Kodagu to","to meet","meet her","her boyfriend","boyfriend 's","'s sister","sister in","in the","the hope","hope that","that the","the two","two will","will take","take a","a liking","liking to","to each","each other","other ,",", leading","leading to","to marriage","marriage ,",", and","and thus","thus paving","paving the","the way","way for","for her","her own","own marriage","Kushal meets","meets a","a bubbly","bubbly girl","girl Kushi","Kushi (","( Shwetha","Shwetha Srivatsav","Srivatsav )",") in","in the","the house","house he","he is","is sent","sent to","to ,",", but","but the","the rest","rest of","of the","the family","family is","is out","out of","of town","The two","two share","share their","their past","past romantic","romantic liaisons","liaisons before","before falling","falling in","in love","love with","with each","each other","It turns","turns out","out ,",", though","though ,",", that","that the","the girl","girl is","is not","not who","who she","she pretends","pretends to","to be","The film","film takes","takes a","a curious","curious turn","turn from","from here"]}

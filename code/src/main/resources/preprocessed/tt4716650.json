{"title":"The Lost Diggers of Fromelles","plot":"Outside a small village in France, on the night of July 19, 1916, 5,533 Australian soldiers were killed, wounded, or disappeared into the abyss of the Western Front. They suffered more casualties in one night that in the Boer, Korean and Vietnam wars combined. Through sheer determination, 250 of these fallen, mostly Australian, were unearthed from five mass grave burial pits. These fallen are now being identified through DNA processing and stubborn detective work. This is the exclusive, behind-the-scenes story of the largest excavation of World War One dead in modern times.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Outsid","a","small","villag","in","Franc",",","on","the","night","of","Juli","19",",","1916",",","5,533","Australian","soldier","were","kill",",","wound",",","or","disappear","into","the","abyss","of","the","Western","Front",".","They","suffer","more","casualti","in","one","night","that","in","the","Boer",",","Korean","and","Vietnam","war","combin",".","Through","sheer","determin",",","250","of","these","fallen",",","most","Australian",",","were","unearth","from","five","mass","grave","burial","pit",".","These","fallen","are","now","be","identifi","through","DNA","process","and","stubborn","detect","work",".","This","is","the","exclus",",","behind-the-scen","stori","of","the","largest","excav","of","World","War","One","dead","in","modern","time","."],"lemmas":["outside","a","small","village","in","France",",","on","the","night","of","July","19",",","1916",",","5,533","australian","soldier","be","kill",",","wound",",","or","disappear","into","the","abyss","of","the","western","front",".","they","suffer","more","casualty","in","one","night","that","in","the","Boer",",","Korean","and","Vietnam","war","combine",".","through","sheer","determination",",","250","of","these","fallen",",","mostly","australian",",","be","unearth","from","five","mass","grave","burial","pit",".","these","fall","be","now","be","identify","through","dna","processing","and","stubborn","detective","work",".","this","be","the","exclusive",",","behind-the-scenes","story","of","the","largest","excavation","of","World","War","one","dead","in","modern","time","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Outside a small","a small village","small village in","village in France","in France ,","France , on",", on the","on the night","the night of","night of July","of July 19","July 19 ,","19 , 1916",", 1916 ,","1916 , 5,533",", 5,533 Australian","5,533 Australian soldiers","Australian soldiers were","soldiers were killed","were killed ,","killed , wounded",", wounded ,","wounded , or",", or disappeared","or disappeared into","disappeared into the","into the abyss","the abyss of","abyss of the","of the Western","the Western Front","They suffered more","suffered more casualties","more casualties in","casualties in one","in one night","one night that","night that in","that in the","in the Boer","the Boer ,","Boer , Korean",", Korean and","Korean and Vietnam","and Vietnam wars","Vietnam wars combined","Through sheer determination","sheer determination ,","determination , 250",", 250 of","250 of these","of these fallen","these fallen ,","fallen , mostly",", mostly Australian","mostly Australian ,","Australian , were",", were unearthed","were unearthed from","unearthed from five","from five mass","five mass grave","mass grave burial","grave burial pits","These fallen are","fallen are now","are now being","now being identified","being identified through","identified through DNA","through DNA processing","DNA processing and","processing and stubborn","and stubborn detective","stubborn detective work","This is the","is the exclusive","the exclusive ,","exclusive , behind-the-scenes",", behind-the-scenes story","behind-the-scenes story of","story of the","of the largest","the largest excavation","largest excavation of","excavation of World","of World War","World War One","War One dead","One dead in","dead in modern","in modern times"],"2grams":["Outside a","a small","small village","village in","in France","France ,",", on","on the","the night","night of","of July","July 19","19 ,",", 1916","1916 ,",", 5,533","5,533 Australian","Australian soldiers","soldiers were","were killed","killed ,",", wounded","wounded ,",", or","or disappeared","disappeared into","into the","the abyss","abyss of","of the","the Western","Western Front","They suffered","suffered more","more casualties","casualties in","in one","one night","night that","that in","in the","the Boer","Boer ,",", Korean","Korean and","and Vietnam","Vietnam wars","wars combined","Through sheer","sheer determination","determination ,",", 250","250 of","of these","these fallen","fallen ,",", mostly","mostly Australian","Australian ,",", were","were unearthed","unearthed from","from five","five mass","mass grave","grave burial","burial pits","These fallen","fallen are","are now","now being","being identified","identified through","through DNA","DNA processing","processing and","and stubborn","stubborn detective","detective work","This is","is the","the exclusive","exclusive ,",", behind-the-scenes","behind-the-scenes story","story of","of the","the largest","largest excavation","excavation of","of World","World War","War One","One dead","dead in","in modern","modern times"]}

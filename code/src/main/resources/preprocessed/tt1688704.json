While her husband is away in war, a creepy neighbor is molesting her, and her daughter. In the skirmish on the family's farm, her husband got killed, and her daughter found him. She does not tell her mother, that her father is dead from fear that her mother would not take the news to well. They also discover a gravely wounded Union soldier who is using their cellar as hide-out. Together they decide to nurse him back to health and hide him when Confederate soldiers check the house. When the Union soldier recovers, Sarabeth makes sure he reaches his army. Upon his return, he is taken as a spy.

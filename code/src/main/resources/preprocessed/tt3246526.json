{"title":"En plein air","plot":"Filmed in the proposed Scotchman Peaks Wilderness of Idaho and Montana, the documentary, 'en Plein Air', captures the experiences of artists during a 5 day trek through the mountains. Plein Air art is known as landscape paintings that are physically created 'in the open air' rather than painted indoors based on a sketch or photo. This film delves into the personal interpretations of the Plein Air concept by water-color painters and a sculptor. The intrinsic value of wild areas for personal inspiration and the challenges of this type of artistic endeavor serve as the main themes of this documentary.","genres":["Adventure","

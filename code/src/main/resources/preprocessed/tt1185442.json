{"title":"Sacrifice","plot":"Delhi University's Professor Avantika Ahuja meets fellow professor Ehsan Khan in typical Bollywood filmy style, and both fall in love with each other. Her father, who had preferred that she marry a Hindu, reluctantly permits them to get married. They do so, and subsequently re-locate to live in the United States. They buy a house, settle in, and are welcomed by their neighbors, Hamid and Anjum. A few days later Avantika's world will be turned upside down when she finds out that their neighbors are terrorists who want to avenge the deaths of innocent Iraqi and Afghani civilians massacred by British and American forces, and that her husband is not who he claims to be.","genres":["Action"," Drama","

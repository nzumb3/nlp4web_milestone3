{"title":"A Different Loyalty","plot":"Leo Cauffield, chief of British counterespionage, fails by a whisker to arrest two fellow Cambridge-graduated spies who just manage to defect to Moscow, resigns and becomes a journalist. In Beirut, home of his Islam-converted father, Leo seduces Sally Tyler to divorce her husband for him. Their happiness with children from both marriages is cut short a few years later, when Leo suddenly disappears; Sally learns soon he's suspected of having defected to Moscow too, which she refuses to believe, but will be forced to while Western secret services want Leo back or dead.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Romance"],"stems":["Leo","Cauffield",",","chief","of","British","counterespionag",",","fail","by","a","whisker","to","arrest","two","fellow","Cambridge-gradu","spi","who","just","manag","to","defect","to","Moscow",",","resign","and","becom","a","journalist",".","In","Beirut",",","home","of","his","Islam-convert","father",",","Leo","seduc","Salli","Tyler","to","divorc","her","husband","for","him",".","Their","happi","with","children","from","both","marriag","is","cut","short","a","few","year","later",",","when","Leo","sudden","disappear",";","Salli","learn","soon","he","'s","suspect","of","have","defect","to","Moscow","too",",","which","she","refus","to","believ",",","but","will","be","forc","to","while","Western","secret","servic","want","Leo","back","or","dead","."],"lemmas":["Leo","Cauffield",",","chief","of","british","counterespionage",",","fail","by","a","whisker","to","arrest","two","fellow","cambridge-graduated","spy","who","just","manage","to","defect","to","Moscow",",","resign","and","become","a","journalist",".","in","Beirut",",","home","of","he","islam-converted","father",",","Leo","seduce","Sally","Tyler","to","divorce","she","husband","for","he",".","they","happiness","with","child","from","both","marriage","be","cut","short","a","few","year","later",",","when","Leo","suddenly","disappear",";","Sally","learn","soon","he","be","suspect","of","have","defect","to","Moscow","too",",","which","she","refuse","to","believe",",","but","will","be","force","to","while","western","secret","service","want","Leo","back","or","dead","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Leo Cauffield ,","Cauffield , chief",", chief of","chief of British","of British counterespionage","British counterespionage ,","counterespionage , fails",", fails by","fails by a","by a whisker","a whisker to","whisker to arrest","to arrest two","arrest two fellow","two fellow Cambridge-graduated","fellow Cambridge-graduated spies","Cambridge-graduated spies who","spies who just","who just manage","just manage to","manage to defect","to defect to","defect to Moscow","to Moscow ,","Moscow , resigns",", resigns and","resigns and becomes","and becomes a","becomes a journalist","In Beirut ,","Beirut , home",", home of","home of his","of his Islam-converted","his Islam-converted father","Islam-converted father ,","father , Leo",", Leo seduces","Leo seduces Sally","seduces Sally Tyler","Sally Tyler to","Tyler to divorce","to divorce her","divorce her husband","her husband for","husband for him","Their happiness with","happiness with children","with children from","children from both","from both marriages","both marriages is","marriages is cut","is cut short","cut short a","short a few","a few years","few years later","years later ,","later , when",", when Leo","when Leo suddenly","Leo suddenly disappears","suddenly disappears ;","disappears ;

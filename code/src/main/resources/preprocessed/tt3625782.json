{"title":"Trained to Kill","plot":"A former British Special Air Service Soldier was made an example by his government and discharged dishonourably by the service. A year later his friend who runs a special covert operations group within the SAS contacts him to ask for his help to gain evidence against 3 very prominent people, who are secret Drug Dealers and Arms Suppliers plus high profile members of the public with important jobs. He still holds a grudge against the Army and so he refuses to help, however he ends up being drawn into a web of deceit and action, as he has to change his own conceptions of life when his family are targeted by these same drug dealers. He enlists the help of his step-brother who was a former Paratrooper wounded in Afghanistan and together they start to track down and gather evidence against these criminals.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["A","former","British","Special","Air","Servic","Soldier","was","made","an","exampl","by","his","govern","and","discharg","dishonour","by","the","servic",".","A","year","later","his","friend","who","run","a","special","covert","oper","group","within","the","SAS","contact","him","to","ask","for","his","help","to","gain","evid","against","3","veri","promin","peopl",",","who","are","secret","Drug","Dealer","and","Arms","Supplier","plus","high","profil","member","of","the","public","with","import","job",".","He","still","hold","a","grudg","against","the","Armi","and","so","he","refus","to","help",",","howev","he","end","up","be","drawn","into","a","web","of","deceit","and","action",",","as","he","has","to","chang","his","own","concept","of","life","when","his","famili","are","target","by","these","same","drug","dealer",".","He","enlist","the","help","of","his","step-broth","who","was","a","former","Paratroop","wound","in","Afghanistan","and","togeth","they","start","to","track","down","and","gather","evid","against","these","crimin","."],"lemmas":["a","former","british","special","air","service","soldier","be","make","a","example","by","he","government","and","discharge","dishonourably","by","the","service",".","a","year","later","he","friend","who","run","a","special","covert","operation","group","within","the","SAS","contact","he","to","ask","for","he","help","to","gain","evidence","against","3","very","prominent","people",",","who","be","secret","Drug","Dealers","and","arm","supplier","plus","high","profile","member","of","the","public","with","important","job",".","he","still","hold","a","grudge","against","the","Army","and","so","he","refuse","to","help",",","however","he","end","up","be","draw","into","a","web","of","deceit","and","action",",","as","he","have","to","change","he","own","conception","of","life","when","he","family","be","target","by","these","same","drug","dealer",".","he","enlist","the","help","of","he","step-brother","who","be","a","former","paratrooper","wound","in","Afghanistan","and","together","they","start","to","track","down","and","gather","evidence","against","these","criminal","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A

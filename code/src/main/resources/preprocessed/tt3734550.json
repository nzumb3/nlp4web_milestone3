{"title":"Revolutionary Medicine: A Story of the First Garifuna Hospital","plot":"Since their expulsion from the island of Saint Vincent 215 years ago, the Garifuna have struggled against exclusion, racism, and dispossession of their land and territory. Today, their very first hospital in Honduras serves as a bastion of self-determination. Revolutionary Medicine: A Story of the First Garifuna Hospital tells the story of how the hospital's alternative health model is transforming communities on Honduras' Northern Coast and standing as an alternative to an increasingly privatized national health system. Could a remote hospital that runs on solar panels, in a community with no paved roads or electricity provide a new global model for health care?","genres":["Documentary","

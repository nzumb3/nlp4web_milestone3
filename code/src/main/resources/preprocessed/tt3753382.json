{"title":"Where Time Stops","plot":"They escaped the hustle and bustle of civilization and the treadmill of capitalism. In a village in the French Pyrenees, cut off from the world, Jens and Micky from Germany found what they desired the most: freedom, peace and close contact with nature. Their idyll ended a few years ago when tourists fascinated with esoterism began to frequent the area. The aim of their pilgrimages was the holy mountain of Pic de Bugarach. In December 2012, before the announced end of the world, thousands of pilgrims came to visit the place.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["They","escap","the","hustl","and","bustl","of","civil","and","the","treadmil","of","capit",".","In","a","villag","in","the","French","Pyrene",",","cut","off","from","the","world",",","Jen","and","Micki","from","Germani","found","what","they","desir","the","most",":","freedom",",","peac","and","close","contact","with","natur",".","Their","idyl","end","a","few","year","ago","when","tourist","fascin","with","esoter","began","to","frequent","the","area",".","The","aim","of","their","pilgrimag","was","the","holi","mountain","of","Pic","de","Bugarach",".","In","Decemb","2012",",","befor","the","announc","end","of","the","world",",","thousand","of","pilgrim","came","to","visit","the","place","."],"lemmas":["they","escape","the","hustle","and","bustle","of","civilization","and","the","treadmill","of","capitalism",".","in","a","village","in","the","French","Pyrenees",",","cut","off","from","the","world",",","Jens","and","Micky","from","Germany","find","what","they","desire","the","most",":","freedom",",","peace","and","close","contact","with","nature",".","they","idyll","end","a","few","year","ago","when","tourist","fascinate","with","esoterism","begin","to","frequent","the","area",".","the","aim","of","they","pilgrimage","be","the","holy","mountain","of","Pic","de","Bugarach",".","in","December","2012",",","before","the","announced","end","of","the","world",",","thousand","of","pilgrim","come","to","visit","the","place","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["They escaped the","escaped the hustle","the hustle and","hustle and bustle","and bustle of","bustle of civilization","of civilization and","civilization and the","and the treadmill","the treadmill of","treadmill of capitalism","In a village","a village in","village in the","in the French","the French Pyrenees","French Pyrenees ,","Pyrenees , cut",", cut off","cut off from","off from the","from the world","the world ,","world , Jens",", Jens and","Jens and Micky","and Micky from","Micky from Germany","from Germany found","Germany found what","found what they","what they desired","they desired the","desired the most","the most :","most : freedom",": freedom ,","freedom , peace",", peace and","peace and close","and close contact","close contact with","contact with nature","Their idyll ended","idyll ended a","ended a few","a few years","few years ago","years ago when","ago when tourists","when tourists fascinated","tourists fascinated with","fascinated with esoterism","with esoterism began","esoterism began to","began to frequent","to frequent the","frequent the area","The aim of","aim of their","of their pilgrimages","their pilgrimages was","pilgrimages was the","was the holy","the holy mountain","holy mountain of","mountain of Pic","of Pic de","Pic de Bugarach","In December 2012","December 2012 ,","2012 , before",", before the","before the announced","the announced end","announced end of","end of the","of the world","the world ,","world , thousands",", thousands of","thousands of pilgrims","of pilgrims came","pilgrims came to","came to visit","to visit the","visit the place"],"2grams":["They escaped","escaped the","the hustle","hustle and","and bustle","bustle of","of civilization","civilization and","and the","the treadmill","treadmill of","of capitalism","In a","a village","village in","in the","the French","French Pyrenees","Pyrenees ,",", cut","cut off","off from","from the","the world","world ,",", Jens","Jens and","and Micky","Micky from","from Germany","Germany found","found what","what they","they desired","desired the","the most","most :",": freedom","freedom ,",", peace","peace and","and close","close contact","contact with","with nature","Their idyll","idyll ended","ended a","a few","few years","years ago","ago when","when tourists","tourists fascinated","fascinated with","with esoterism","esoterism began","began to","to frequent","frequent the","the area","The aim","aim of","of their","their pilgrimages","pilgrimages was","was the","the holy","holy mountain","mountain of","of Pic","Pic de","de Bugarach","In December","December 2012","2012 ,",", before","before the","the announced","announced end","end of","of the","the world","world ,",", thousands","thousands of","of pilgrims","pilgrims came","came to","to visit","visit the","the place"]}

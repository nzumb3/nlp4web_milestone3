It is a high definition odyssey up a river far distanced in time from the corridor into the heart of darkness portrayed in Francis Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now.\" In Angkor, the World Monuments Fund's John Stubbs and John Sanday describe their 15-year restoration of one of the jewels of a city called \"the eighth wonder of the world.\" As we go inside the 12th Century temple complex of Preah Khan, along with the other major sites of Angkor Wat, Bayon and Banteay Srei, we learn that the story of their work in Angkor is not only a story of the rebirth of Angkor after the horrors of the Khmer Rouge Era, but it also is a story of the rebirth of Cambodia.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["One","of","the","mythic","journey","of","our","time",",","through","the","exquisit",",","complic",",","surpris","terrain","of","Vietnam","and","Cambodia","to","the","great","ruin","at","Angkor","-","the","magnific","Khmer","templ","be","painstak","restor","deep","in","the","Cambodian","jungl",".","It","is","a","high","definit","odyssey","up","a","river","far","distanc","in","time","from","the","corridor","into","the","heart","of","dark","portray","in","Franci","Coppola","'s","\"","Apocalyps","Now",".","\"","In","Angkor",",","the","World","Monument","Fund","'s","John","Stubb","and","John","Sanday","describ","their","15-year","restor","of","one","of","the","jewel","of","a","citi","call","\"","the","eighth","wonder","of","the","world",".","\"","As","we","go","insid","the","12th","Centuri","templ","complex","of","Preah","Khan",",","along","with","the","other","major","site","of","Angkor","Wat",",","Bayon","and","Banteay","Srei",",","we","learn","that","the","stori","of","their","work","in","Angkor","is","not","onli","a","stori","of","the","rebirth","of","Angkor","after","the","horror","of","the","Khmer","Roug","Era",",","but","it","also","is","a","stori","of","the","rebirth","of","Cambodia","."],"lemmas":["one","of","the","mythic","journey","of","we","time",",","through","the","exquisite",",","complicated",",","surprising","terrain","of","Vietnam","and","Cambodia","to","the","great","ruin","at","Angkor","-","the","magnificent","Khmer","temple","be","painstakingly","restore","deep","in","the","cambodian","jungle",".","it","be","a","high","definition","odyssey","up","a","river","far","distance","in","time","from","the","corridor","into","the","heart","of","darkness","portray","in","Francis","Coppola","'s","``","Apocalypse","Now",".","''","in","Angkor",",","the","World","Monuments","Fund","'s","John","Stubbs","and","John","Sanday","describe","they","15-year","restoration","of","one","of","the","jewel","of","a","city","call","``","the","eighth","wonder","of","the","world",".","''","as","we","go","inside","the","12th","Century","temple","complex","of","Preah","Khan",",","along","with","the","other","major","site","of","Angkor","Wat",",","Bayon","and","Banteay","Srei",",","we","learn","that","the","story","of","they","work","in","Angkor","be","not","only","a","story","of","the","rebirth","of","Angkor","after","the","horror","of","the","Khmer","Rouge","Era",",","but","it","also","be","a","story","of","the","rebirth","of","Cambodia","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["One of the","of the mythic","the mythic journeys","mythic journeys of","journeys of our","of our time","our time ,","time , through",", through the","through the exquisite","the exquisite ,","exquisite , complicated",", complicated ,","complicated , surprising",", surprising terrain","surprising terrain of","terrain of Vietnam","of Vietnam and","Vietnam and Cambodia","and Cambodia to","Cambodia to the","to the great","the great ruins","great ruins at","ruins at Angkor","at Angkor -","Angkor -

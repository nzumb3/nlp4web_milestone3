{"title":"A Knock at the Door","plot":"A young, Jewish woman delivers her first baby just two days before her parents and brothers are rounded up and sent to Auschwitz. Her husband was in prison, arrested while searching for a safe place for his family to hide. Alone, she must undertake a harrowing journey through Nazi-occupied France with her newborn baby. Her destination: a small town in southern France where some courageous families were willing to hide Jewish refugees. Almost 70 years later, the woman who was that baby returns to France to pay homage to the family that hid her. She successfully petitions Yad Vashem to honor them as Righteous Among the Nations. This is the story of the Holocaust in France as seen through the perspective of one family.","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"American Vagabond","plot":"American Vagabond is a cinematic feature documentary about gay youth living without a home in the shadows of a promised city. It's a story about a modern Western society in which homosexuality is still so demonized in some communities that some parents are ready to abandon their children over it. One out of every four young people who are coming out to their parents is kicked out of the house. 20 to 40 percent of homeless youth are estimated to belong to sexual minorities in the United States.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["American","Vagabond","is","a","cinemat","featur","documentari","about","gay","youth","live","without","a","home","in","the","shadow","of","a","promis","citi",".","It","'s","a","stori","about","a","modern","Western","societi","in","which","homosexu","is","still","so","demon","in","some","communiti","that","some","parent","are","readi","to","abandon","their","children","over","it",".","One","out","of","everi","four","young","peopl","who","are","come","out","to","their","parent","is","kick","out","of","the","hous",".","20","to","40","percent","of","homeless","youth","are","estim","to","belong","to","sexual","minor","in","the","Unite","State","."],"lemmas":["American","Vagabond","be","a","cinematic","feature","documentary","about","gay","youth","live","without","a","home","in","the","shadow","of","a","promised","city",".","it","be","a","story","about","a","modern","western","society","in","which","homosexuality","be","still","so","demonize","in","some","community","that","some","parent","be","ready","to","abandon","they","child","over","it",".","one","out","of","every","four","young","people","who","be","come","out","to","they","parent","be","kick","out","of","the","house",".","20","to","40","percent","of","homeless","youth","be","estimate","to","belong","to","sexual","minority","in","the","United","States","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["American Vagabond is","Vagabond is a","is a cinematic","a cinematic feature","cinematic feature documentary","feature documentary about","documentary about gay","about gay youth","gay youth living","youth living without","living without a","without a home","a home in","home in the","in the shadows","the shadows of","shadows of a","of a promised","a promised city","It 's a","'s a story","a story about","story about a","about a modern","a modern Western","modern Western society","Western society in","society in which","in which homosexuality","which homosexuality is","homosexuality is still","is still so","still so demonized","so demonized in","demonized in some","in some communities","some communities that","communities that some","that some parents","some parents are","parents are ready","are ready to","ready to abandon","to abandon their","abandon their children","their children over","children over it","One out of","out of every","of every four","every four young","four young people","young people who","people who are","who are coming","are coming out","coming out to","out to their","to their parents","their parents is","parents is kicked","is kicked out","kicked out of","out of the","of the house","20 to 40","to 40 percent","40 percent of","percent of homeless","of homeless youth","homeless youth are","youth are estimated","are estimated to","estimated to belong","to belong to","belong to sexual","to sexual minorities","sexual minorities in","minorities in the","in the United","the United States"],"2grams":["American Vagabond","Vagabond is","is a","a cinematic","cinematic feature","feature documentary","documentary about","about gay","gay youth","youth living","living without","without a","a home","home in","in the","the shadows","shadows of","of a","a promised","promised city","It 's","'s a","a story","story about","about a","a modern","modern Western","Western society","society in","in which","which homosexuality","homosexuality is","is still","still so","so demonized","demonized in","in some","some communities","communities that","that some","some parents","parents are","are ready","ready to","to abandon","abandon their","their children","children over","over it","One out","out of","of every","every four","four young","young people","people who","who are","are coming","coming out","out to","to their","their parents","parents is","is kicked","kicked out","out of","of the","the house","20 to","to 40","40 percent","percent of","of homeless","homeless youth","youth are","are estimated","estimated to","to belong","belong to","to sexual","sexual minorities","minorities in","in the","the United","United States"]}

{"title":"Music for a Blue Train","plot":"Music for a Blue Train is a bluesy mood piece featuring an eclectic line-up of musicians who busk in Montreal's metro, or subways. Film score, camera work and editing evoke the essence of what it's like to work ' in the trenches,' hustling for a time slot and a good spot, fighting and forging friendships, playing to indifferent audiences--all in subterranean spaces. Unlike other cities, Montreal doesn't require auditions or permits. It's first-come, first-served, usually before the metro opens, while the city is still asleep. Names are scribbled on the back of a cigarette pack or a piece of cardboard. Bad News Brown, a charismatic harmonica player, acts as our witty impromptu host. Great music turns up in unexpected places.","genres":["Documentary","

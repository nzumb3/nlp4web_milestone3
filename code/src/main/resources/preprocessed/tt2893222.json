{"title":"Geraldo de Barros - sobras em obras","plot":"\"Sobras\", in Portuguese, means \"remainders\", like the falls of fabrics which the dressmaker draws aside with a hand. It is also the title of the last photographs carried out by Geraldo de Barros (1923-1998), pioneer of Brazilian experimental photography and also one of the most significant artists of the constructivist movement . His creative process is approached in this film in a stimulative dialogue between passed and present, between the trajectory of a man and that of his country.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Sobra","\"",",","in","Portugues",",","mean","\"","remaind","\"",",","like","the","fall","of","fabric","which","the","dressmak","draw","asid","with","a","hand",".","It","is","also","the","titl","of","the","last","photograph","carri","out","by","Geraldo","de","Barro","(","1923-1998",")",",","pioneer","of","Brazilian","experiment","photographi","and","also","one","of","the","most","signific","artist","of","the","constructivist","movement",".","His","creativ","process","is","approach","in","this","film","in","a","stimul","dialogu","between","pass","and","present",",","between","the","trajectori","of","a","man","and","that","of","his","countri","."],"lemmas":["``","Sobras","''",",","in","Portuguese",",","mean","``","remainder","''",",","like","the","fall","of","fabric","which","the","dressmaker","draw","aside","with","a","hand",".","it","be","also","the","title","of","the","last","photograph","carry","out","by","Geraldo","de","Barros","-lrb-","1923-1998","-rrb-",",","pioneer","of","brazilian","experimental","photography","and","also","one","of","the","most","significant","artist","of","the","constructivist","movement",".","he","creative","process","be","approach","in","this","film","in","a","stimulative","dialogue","between","pass","and","present",",","between","the","trajectory","of","a","man","and","that","of","he","country","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Sobras \"","Sobras \" ,","\" , in",", in Portuguese","in Portuguese ,","Portuguese , means",", means \"","means \" remainders","\" remainders \"","remainders \" ,","\" , like",", like the","like the falls","the falls of","falls of fabrics","of fabrics which","fabrics which the","which the dressmaker","the dressmaker draws","dressmaker draws aside","draws aside with","aside with a","with a hand","It is also","is also the","also the title","the title of","title of the","of the last","the last photographs","last photographs carried","photographs carried out","carried out by","out by Geraldo","by Geraldo de","Geraldo de Barros","de Barros (","Barros ( 1923-1998","( 1923-1998 )","1923-1998 ) ,",") , pioneer",", pioneer of","pioneer of Brazilian","of Brazilian experimental","Brazilian experimental photography","experimental photography and","photography and also","and also one","also one of","one of the","of the most","the most significant","most significant artists","significant artists of","artists of the","of the constructivist","the constructivist movement","His creative process","creative process is","process is approached","is approached in","approached in this","in this film","this film in","film in a","in a stimulative","a stimulative dialogue","stimulative dialogue between","dialogue between passed","between passed and","passed and present","and present ,","present , between",", between the","between the trajectory","the trajectory of","trajectory of a","of a man","a man and","man and that","and that of","that of his","of his country"],"2grams":["\" Sobras","Sobras \"","\" ,",", in","in Portuguese","Portuguese ,",", means","means \"","\" remainders","remainders \"","\" ,",", like","like the","the falls","falls of","of fabrics","fabrics which","which the","the dressmaker","dressmaker draws","draws aside","aside with","with a","a hand","It is","is also","also the","the title","title of","of the","the last","last photographs","photographs carried","carried out","out by","by Geraldo","Geraldo de","de Barros","Barros (","( 1923-1998","1923-1998 )",") ,",", pioneer","pioneer of","of Brazilian","Brazilian experimental","experimental photography","photography and","and also","also one","one of","of the","the most","most significant","significant artists","artists of","of the","the constructivist","constructivist movement","His creative","creative process","process is","is approached","approached in","in this","this film","film in","in a","a stimulative","stimulative dialogue","dialogue between","between passed","passed and","and present","present ,",", between","between the","the trajectory","trajectory of","of a","a man","man and","and that","that of","of his","his country"]}

{"title":"Gritty and Unpretty: A Life in One Day","plot":"On July 24, 2010, some Hollywood producers put out a call to the world for anyone to shoot their story for a user-generated documentary. The winners would be invited to Sundance. They wanted to capture the true essence of humanity. But, they didn't allow profanity, alcohol, illegal drugs or any music. And the real world doesn't go around without foul language, beer, joint and/or good music. So the longtime friends of a long ago punk band decided to get together on July 24th anyway... and shoot their real life in a day. No... it's not pretty or inspirational. Nor is it likely to be invited to Sundance. But it's an honest document of how these old punkers... still live hard and make music!","genres":["Documentary","

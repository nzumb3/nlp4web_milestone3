{"title":"The Selfish Giant","plot":"An official selection at the Cannes Film Festival, The Selfish Giant is a contemporary fable about 13 year old Arbor (Conner Chapman) and his best friend Swifty (Shaun Thomas). Excluded from school and outsiders in their own neighborhood, the two boys meet Kitten (Sean Gilder), a local scrap dealer. Wandering their town with just a horse and a cart, they begin collecting scrap metal for him. Swifty has a natural gift with horses while Arbor emulates Kitten - keen to impress him and make some money. However, Kitten favors Swifty, leaving Arbor feeling hurt and excluded, driving a wedge between the boys. As Arbor becomes increasingly greedy and exploitative, tensions build, leading to a tragic event that transforms them all.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["An","offici","select","at","the","Cann","Film","Festiv",",","The","Selfish","Giant","is","a","contemporari","fabl","about","13","year","old","Arbor","(","Conner","Chapman",")","and","his","best","friend","Swifti","(","Shaun","Thoma",")",".","Exclude","from","school","and","outsid","in","their","own","neighborhood",",","the","two","boy","meet","Kitten","(","Sean","Gilder",")",",","a","local","scrap","dealer",".","Wander","their","town","with","just","a","hors","and","a","cart",",","they","begin","collect","scrap","metal","for","him",".","Swifti","has","a","natur","gift","with","hors","while","Arbor","emul","Kitten","-","keen","to","impress","him","and","make","some","money",".","Howev",",","Kitten","favor","Swifti",",","leav","Arbor","feel","hurt","and","exclud",",","drive","a","wedg","between","the","boy",".","As","Arbor","becom","increas","greedi","and","exploit",",","tension","build",",","lead","to","a","tragic","event","that","transform","them","all","."],"lemmas":["a","official","selection","at","the","Cannes","Film","Festival",",","The","Selfish","Giant","be","a","contemporary","fable","about","13","year","old","Arbor","-lrb-","Conner","Chapman","-rrb-","and","he","best","friend","Swifty","-lrb-","Shaun","Thomas","-rrb-",".","exclude","from","school","and","outsider","in","they","own","neighborhood",",","the","two","boy","meet","Kitten","-lrb-","Sean","Gilder","-rrb-",",","a","local","scrap","dealer",".","wander","they","town","with","just","a","horse","and","a","cart",",","they","begin","collect","scrap","metal","for","he",".","Swifty","have","a","natural","gift","with","horse","while","Arbor","emulate","Kitten","-","keen","to","impress","he","and","make","some","money",".","however",",","Kitten","favor","Swifty",",","leave","Arbor","feeling","hurt","and","exclude",",","drive","a","wedge","between","the","boy",".","as","Arbor","become","increasingly","greedy","and","exploitative",",","tension","build",",","lead","to","a","tragic","event","that","transform","they","all","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An official selection","official selection at","selection at the","at the Cannes","the Cannes Film","Cannes Film Festival","Film Festival ,","Festival , The",", The Selfish","The Selfish Giant","Selfish Giant is","Giant is a","is a contemporary","a contemporary fable","contemporary fable about","fable about 13","about 13 year","13 year old","year old Arbor","old Arbor (","Arbor ( Conner","( Conner Chapman","Conner Chapman )","Chapman ) and",") and his","and his best","his best friend","best friend Swifty","friend Swifty (","Swifty ( Shaun","( Shaun Thomas","Shaun Thomas )","Excluded from school","from school and","school and outsiders","and outsiders in","outsiders in their","in their own","their own neighborhood","own neighborhood ,","neighborhood , the",", the two","the two boys","two boys meet","boys meet Kitten","meet Kitten (","Kitten ( Sean","( Sean Gilder","Sean Gilder )","Gilder ) ,",") , a",", a local","a local scrap","local scrap dealer","Wandering their town","their town with","town with just","with just a","just a horse","a horse and","horse and a","and a cart","a cart ,","cart , they",", they begin","they begin collecting","begin collecting scrap","collecting scrap metal","scrap metal for","metal for him","Swifty has a","has a natural","a natural gift","natural gift with","gift with horses","with horses while","horses while Arbor","while Arbor emulates","Arbor emulates Kitten","emulates Kitten -","Kitten -

{"title":"Just Like Heaven","plot":"Elizabeth Masterson, a dedicated doctor in San Francisco, had almost no time for anything. When her sister with two kids set her up on a date, she gets into a tragic car crash and goes into a coma. Meanwhile, a landscape architect named David Abbott moves to San Francisco and, coincidentally, into Elizabeth's apartment for rent. While at the apartment, Elizabeth's spirit haunts him. She doesn't remember who she is, who her family is or what she did - All that she remembered was her apartment and where everything was. To settle the arguments, David agrees to figure out who Elizabeth really is. When they get close to figuring out who she is, they eventually find love with one another and as they finally know who she really is, they learn that fate really has put them both together.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["Elizabeth","Masterson",",","a","dedic","doctor","in","San","Francisco",",","had","almost","no","time","for","anyth",".","When","her","sister","with","two","kid","set","her","up","on","a","date",",","she","get","into","a","tragic","car","crash","and","goe","into","a","coma",".","Meanwhil",",","a","landscap","architect","name","David","Abbott","move","to","San","Francisco","and",",","coincident",",","into","Elizabeth","'s","apart","for","rent",".","While","at","the","apart",",","Elizabeth","'s","spirit","haunt","him",".","She","doe","n't","rememb","who","she","is",",","who","her","famili","is","or","what","she","did","-","All","that","she","rememb","was","her","apart","and","where","everyth","was",".","To","settl","the","argument",",","David","agre","to","figur","out","who","Elizabeth","realli","is",".","When","they","get","close","to","figur","out","who","she","is",",","they","eventu","find","love","with","one","anoth","and","as","they","final","know","who","she","realli","is",",","they","learn","that","fate","realli","has","put","them","both","togeth","."],"lemmas":["Elizabeth","Masterson",",","a","dedicated","doctor","in","San","Francisco",",","have","almost","no","time","for","anything",".","when","she","sister","with","two","kid","set","she","up","on","a","date",",","she","get","into","a","tragic","car","crash","and","go","into","a","coma",".","meanwhile",",","a","landscape","architect","name","David","Abbott","move","to","San","Francisco","and",",","coincidentally",",","into","Elizabeth","'s","apartment","for","rent",".","while","at","the","apartment",",","Elizabeth","'s","spirit","haunt","he",".","she","do","not","remember","who","she","be",",","who","she","family","be","or","what","she","do","-","all","that","she","remember","be","she","apartment","and","where","everything","be",".","to","settle","the","argument",",","David","agree","to","figure","out","who","Elizabeth","really","be",".","when","they","get","close","to","figure","out","who","she","be",",","they","eventually","find","love","with","one","another","and","as","they","finally","know","who","she","really","be",",","they","learn","that","fate","really","have","put","they","both","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Elizabeth Masterson ,","Masterson , a",", a dedicated","a dedicated doctor","dedicated doctor in","doctor in San","in San Francisco","San Francisco ,","Francisco , had",", had almost","had almost no","almost no time","no time for","time for anything","When her sister","her sister with","sister with two","with two kids","two kids set","kids set her","set her up","her up on","up on a","on a date","a date ,","date , she",", she gets","she gets into","gets into a","into a tragic","a tragic car","tragic car crash","car crash and","crash and goes","and goes into","goes into a","into a coma","Meanwhile , a",", a landscape","a landscape architect","landscape architect named","architect named David","named David Abbott","David Abbott moves","Abbott moves to","moves to San","to San Francisco","San Francisco and","Francisco and ,","and , coincidentally",", coincidentally ,","coincidentally , into",", into Elizabeth","into Elizabeth 's","Elizabeth 's apartment","'s apartment for","apartment for rent","While at the","at the apartment","the apartment ,","apartment , Elizabeth",", Elizabeth 's","Elizabeth 's spirit","'s spirit haunts","spirit haunts him","She does n't","does n't remember","n't remember who","remember who she","who she is","she is ,","is , who",", who her","who her family","her family is","family is or","is or what","or what she","what she did","she did -","did -

{"title":"Tamar: Source to Sound","plot":"A dawn to dusk journey down the river Tamar capturing the sights and sounds of summer along the Devon/Cornwall border. The film was originally made for the ICCI 360 festival, a panoramic film festival held in Plymouth in September 2010. It was made to be shown on five different HD screens in a special dome with surround sound. I didn't have any budget and shot the film over about 4 days on a DSLR. The score was composed especially although the composer had only seen a few rushes beforehand. I have now re-edited the film and made a single screen version.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["A","dawn","to","dusk","journey","down","the","river","Tamar","captur","the","sight","and","sound","of","summer","along","the","Devon/Cornwal","border",".","The","film","was","origin","made","for","the","ICCI","360","festiv",",","a","panoram","film","festiv","held","in","Plymouth","in","Septemb","2010",".","It","was","made","to","be","shown","on","five","differ","HD","screen","in","a","special","dome","with","surround","sound",".","I","did","n't","have","ani","budget","and","shot","the","film","over","about","4","day","on","a","DSLR",".","The","score","was","compos","especi","although","the","compos","had","onli","seen","a","few","rush","beforehand",".","I","have","now","re-edit","the","film","and","made","a","singl","screen","version","."],"lemmas":["a","dawn","to","dusk","journey","down","the","river","Tamar","capture","the","sight","and","sound","of","summer","along","the","Devon/Cornwall","border",".","the","film","be","originally","make","for","the","icci","360","festival",",","a","panoramic","film","festival","hold","in","Plymouth","in","September","2010",".","it","be","make","to","be","show","on","five","different","hd","screen","in","a","special","dome","with","surround","sound",".","I","do","not","have","any","budget","and","shoot","the","film","over","about","4","day","on","a","dslr",".","the","score","be","compose","especially","although","the","composer","have","only","see","a","few","rush","beforehand",".","I","have","now","re-edit","the","film","and","make","a","single","screen","version","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A dawn to","dawn to dusk","to dusk journey","dusk journey down","journey down the","down the river","the river Tamar","river Tamar capturing","Tamar capturing the","capturing the sights","the sights and","sights and sounds","and sounds of","sounds of summer","of summer along","summer along the","along the Devon/Cornwall","the Devon/Cornwall border","The film was","film was originally","was originally made","originally made for","made for the","for the ICCI","the ICCI 360","ICCI 360 festival","360 festival ,","festival , a",", a panoramic","a panoramic film","panoramic film festival","film festival held","festival held in","held in Plymouth","in Plymouth in","Plymouth in September","in September 2010","It was made","was made to","made to be","to be shown","be shown on","shown on five","on five different","five different HD","different HD screens","HD screens in","screens in a","in a special","a special dome","special dome with","dome with surround","with surround sound","I did n't","did n't have","n't have any","have any budget","any budget and","budget and shot","and shot the","shot the film","the film over","film over about","over about 4","about 4 days","4 days on","days on a","on a DSLR","The score was","score was composed","was composed especially","composed especially although","especially although the","although the composer","the composer had","composer had only","had only seen","only seen a","seen a few","a few rushes","few rushes beforehand","I have now","have now re-edited","now re-edited the","re-edited the film","the film and","film and made","and made a","made a single","a single screen","single screen version"],"2grams":["A dawn","dawn to","to dusk","dusk journey","journey down","down the","the river","river Tamar","Tamar capturing","capturing the","the sights","sights and","and sounds","sounds of","of summer","summer along","along the","the Devon/Cornwall","Devon/Cornwall border","The film","film was","was originally","originally made","made for","for the","the ICCI","ICCI 360","360 festival","festival ,",", a","a panoramic","panoramic film","film festival","festival held","held in","in Plymouth","Plymouth in","in September","September 2010","It was","was made","made to","to be","be shown","shown on","on five","five different","different HD","HD screens","screens in","in a","a special","special dome","dome with","with surround","surround sound","I did","did n't","n't have","have any","any budget","budget and","and shot","shot the","the film","film over","over about","about 4","4 days","days on","on a","a DSLR","The score","score was","was composed","composed especially","especially although","although the","the composer","composer had","had only","only seen","seen a","a few","few rushes","rushes beforehand","I have","have now","now re-edited","re-edited the","the film","film and","and made","made a","a single","single screen","screen version"]}

{"title":"Le Degr√© 6 du Voyageur","plot":"I have long dreamed of leaving a monotonous life to hit the road but I've never done it until the day I met Greg. Greg adopted the travel as a lifestyle and made me share his daily life spent on the road. In his philosophy of travel, Greg has established five different degrees equivalent to five different ways to travel. I realized over the adventures and encounters that have been made on the roads of Eastern Europe, India and the United States that there was a sixth degree; a degree that, when it reaches you, change your perception of the world and its multiple realities. A sixth degree that transports you or destroys you.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["I","have","long","dream","of","leav","a","monoton","life","to","hit","the","road","but","I","ve","never","done","it","until","the","day","I","met","Greg",".","Greg","adopt","the","travel","as","a","lifestyl","and","made","me","share","his","daili","life","spent","on","the","road",".","In","his","philosophi","of","travel",",","Greg","has","establish","five","differ","degre","equival","to","five","differ","way","to","travel",".","I","realiz","over","the","adventur","and","encount","that","have","been","made","on","the","road","of","Eastern","Europ",",","India","and","the","Unite","State","that","there","was","a","sixth","degre",";","a","degre","that",",","when","it","reach","you",",","chang","your","percept","of","the","world","and","it","multipl","realiti",".","A","sixth","degre","that","transport","you","or","destroy","you","."],"lemmas":["I","have","long","dream","of","leave","a","monotonous","life","to","hit","the","road","but","I","have","never","do","it","until","the","day","I","meet","Greg",".","Greg","adopt","the","travel","as","a","lifestyle","and","make","I","share","he","daily","life","spend","on","the","road",".","in","he","philosophy","of","travel",",","Greg","have","establish","five","different","degree","equivalent","to","five","different","way","to","travel",".","I","realize","over","the","adventure","and","encounter","that","have","be","make","on","the","road","of","Eastern","Europe",",","India","and","the","United","States","that","there","be","a","sixth","degree",";","a","degree","that",",","when","it","reach","you",",","change","you","perception","of","the","world","and","its","multiple","reality",".","a","sixth","degree","that","transport","you","or","destroy","you","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["I have long","have long dreamed","long dreamed of","dreamed of leaving","of leaving a","leaving a monotonous","a monotonous life","monotonous life to","life to hit","to hit the","hit the road","the road but","road but I","but I 've","I 've never","'ve never done","never done it","done it until","it until the","until the day","the day I","day I met","I met Greg","Greg adopted the","adopted the travel","the travel as","travel as a","as a lifestyle","a lifestyle and","lifestyle and made","and made me","made me share","me share his","share his daily","his daily life","daily life spent","life spent on","spent on the","on the road","In his philosophy","his philosophy of","philosophy of travel","of travel ,","travel , Greg",", Greg has","Greg has established","has established five","established five different","five different degrees","different degrees equivalent","degrees equivalent to","equivalent to five","to five different","five different ways","different ways to","ways to travel","I realized over","realized over the","over the adventures","the adventures and","adventures and encounters","and encounters that","encounters that have","that have been","have been made","been made on","made on the","on the roads","the roads of","roads of Eastern","of Eastern Europe","Eastern Europe ,","Europe , India",", India and","India and the","and the United","the United States","United States that","States that there","that there was","there was a","was a sixth","a sixth degree","sixth degree ;","degree ;

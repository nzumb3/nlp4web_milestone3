When the father of Otávio commits suicide, Célio is assigned for an interview with Otávio, and is invited by Otávio to participate in a scheme in Cayman Islands, where he would receive five millions dollars. However, Célio has a breakdown when his father dies, and believed God assigned him to make Otávio give away all the money he has on behalf of the homeless.","genres":["Drama","

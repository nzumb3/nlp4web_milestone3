{"title":"Souls of Zen","plot":"This documentary presents perspectives on Buddhism as practiced by clergy and millions of families in Japan today by drawing on ethnographic fieldwork about prayer practice and mortuary rituals \"on the ground\". \"Souls\" of Zen thereby refers to one of Japan's most enduring traditions - the commemoration of ancestral spirits. We visit rural graveyards, urban temples, modern funeral halls, and public events to trace the rapid change this tradition is undergoing in the last decades and, most recently, in the wake of the tsunami.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","present","perspect","on","Buddhism","as","practic","by","clergi","and","million","of","famili","in","Japan","today","by","draw","on","ethnograph","fieldwork","about","prayer","practic","and","mortuari","ritual","\"","on","the","ground","\"",".","\"","Soul","\"","of","Zen","therebi","refer","to","one","of","Japan","'s","most","endur","tradit","-","the","commemor","of","ancestr","spirit",".","We","visit","rural","graveyard",",","urban","templ",",","modern","funer","hall",",","and","public","event","to","trace","the","rapid","chang","this","tradit","is","undergo","in","the","last","decad","and",",","most","recent",",","in","the","wake","of","the","tsunami","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","present","perspective","on","Buddhism","as","practice","by","clergy","and","million","of","family","in","Japan","today","by","draw","on","ethnographic","fieldwork","about","prayer","practice","and","mortuary","ritual","``","on","the","ground","''",".","``","soul","''","of","Zen","thereby","refer","to","one","of","Japan","'s","most","enduring","tradition","-","the","commemoration","of","ancestral","spirit",".","we","visit","rural","graveyard",",","urban","temple",",","modern","funeral","hall",",","and","public","event","to","trace","the","rapid","change","this","tradition","be","undergo","in","the","last","decade","and",",","most","recently",",","in","the","wake","of","the","tsunami","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary presents","documentary presents perspectives","presents perspectives on","perspectives on Buddhism","on Buddhism as","Buddhism as practiced","as practiced by","practiced by clergy","by clergy and","clergy and millions","and millions of","millions of families","of families in","families in Japan","in Japan today","Japan today by","today by drawing","by drawing on","drawing on ethnographic","on ethnographic fieldwork","ethnographic fieldwork about","fieldwork about prayer","about prayer practice","prayer practice and","practice and mortuary","and mortuary rituals","mortuary rituals \"","rituals \" on","\" on the","on the ground","the ground \"","\" Souls \"","Souls \" of","\" of Zen","of Zen thereby","Zen thereby refers","thereby refers to","refers to one","to one of","one of Japan","of Japan 's","Japan 's most","'s most enduring","most enduring traditions","enduring traditions -","traditions - the","- the commemoration","the commemoration of","commemoration of ancestral","of ancestral spirits","We visit rural","visit rural graveyards","rural graveyards ,","graveyards , urban",", urban temples","urban temples ,","temples , modern",", modern funeral","modern funeral halls","funeral halls ,","halls , and",", and public","and public events","public events to","events to trace","to trace the","trace the rapid","the rapid change","rapid change this","change this tradition","this tradition is","tradition is undergoing","is undergoing in","undergoing in the","in the last","the last decades","last decades and","decades and ,","and , most",", most recently","most recently ,","recently , in",", in the","in the wake","the wake of","wake of the","of the tsunami"],"2grams":["This documentary","documentary presents","presents perspectives","perspectives on","on Buddhism","Buddhism as","as practiced","practiced by","by clergy","clergy and","and millions","millions of","of families","families in","in Japan","Japan today","today by","by drawing","drawing on","on ethnographic","ethnographic fieldwork","fieldwork about","about prayer","prayer practice","practice and","and mortuary","mortuary rituals","rituals \"","\" on","on the","the ground","ground \"","\" Souls","Souls \"","\" of","of Zen","Zen thereby","thereby refers","refers to","to one","one of","of Japan","Japan 's","'s most","most enduring","enduring traditions","traditions -","- the","the commemoration","commemoration of","of ancestral","ancestral spirits","We visit","visit rural","rural graveyards","graveyards ,",", urban","urban temples","temples ,",", modern","modern funeral","funeral halls","halls ,",", and","and public","public events","events to","to trace","trace the","the rapid","rapid change","change this","this tradition","tradition is","is undergoing","undergoing in","in the","the last","last decades","decades and","and ,",", most","most recently","recently ,",", in","in the","the wake","wake of","of the","the tsunami"]}

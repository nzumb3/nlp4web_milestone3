{"title":"Le derrière","plot":"Frédérique's mother has died recently leaving her the family stud farm. She's never met her father, doesn't even know his name. But she finds it on the back of an old photo. She sets off for Paris. She stays with her gay dancer pal Marc. Marc and friends decide to go to their favourite gay bar... but it's men only. So Frédérique becomes Frédéric, an effeminate gay boy... Frédérique follows her father. Pierre Arroux is an art curator - and gay. She introduces herself to him, but as Frédéric. So while Frédéric is quite an awkward young man and an embarrassment to his father, Frédérique is secretly meeting with her old boyfriend now living in Paris...","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Frédériqu","'s","mother","has","die","recent","leav","her","the","famili","stud","farm",".","She","'s","never","met","her","father",",","doe","n't","even","know","his","name",".","But","she","find","it","on","the","back","of","an","old","photo",".","She","set","off","for","Pari",".","She","stay","with","her","gay","dancer","pal","Marc",".","Marc","and","friend","decid","to","go","to","their","favourit","gay","bar","...","but","it","'s","men","onli",".","So","Frédériqu","becom","Frédéric",",","an","effemin","gay","boy","...","Frédériqu","follow","her","father",".","Pierr","Arroux","is","an","art","curat","-","and","gay",".","She","introduc","herself","to","him",",","but","as","Frédéric",".","So","while","Frédéric","is","quit","an","awkward","young","man","and","an","embarrass","to","his","father",",","Frédériqu","is","secret","meet","with","her","old","boyfriend","now","live","in","Pari","..."],"lemmas":["Frédérique","'s","mother","have","die","recently","leave","she","the","family","stud","farm",".","she","be","never","meet","she","father",",","do","not","even","know","he","name",".","but","she","find","it","on","the","back","of","a","old","photo",".","she","set","off","for","Paris",".","she","stay","with","she","gay","dancer","pal","Marc",".","Marc","and","friend","decide","to","go","to","they","favourite","gay","bar","...","but","it","be","man","only",".","so","Frédérique","become","Frédéric",",","a","effeminate","gay","boy","...","Frédérique","follow","she","father",".","Pierre","Arroux","be","a","art","curator","-","and","gay",".","she","introduce","herself","to","he",",","but","as","Frédéric",".","so","while","Frédéric","be","quite","a","awkward","young","man","and","a","embarrassment","to","he","father",",","Frédérique","be","secretly","meet","with","she","old","boyfriend","now","live","in","Paris","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Frédérique 's mother","'s mother has","mother has died","has died recently","died recently leaving","recently leaving her","leaving her the","her the family","the family stud","family stud farm","She 's never","'s never met","never met her","met her father","her father ,","father , does",", does n't","does n't even","n't even know","even know his","know his name","But she finds","she finds it","finds it on","it on the","on the back","the back of","back of an","of an old","an old photo","She sets off","sets off for","off for Paris","She stays with","stays with her","with her gay","her gay dancer","gay dancer pal","dancer pal Marc","Marc and friends","and friends decide","friends decide to","decide to go","to go to","go to their","to their favourite","their favourite gay","favourite gay bar","gay bar ...","bar ... but","... but it","but it 's","it 's men","'s men only","So Frédérique becomes","Frédérique becomes Frédéric","becomes Frédéric ,","Frédéric , an",", an effeminate","an effeminate gay","effeminate gay boy","gay boy ...","boy ...

{"title":"The Nothing","plot":"THE NOTHING tells the story of Ren Dubbin, a man struggling to reconcile his spiritual convictions with his crippling fear of the unknown. He awakes to find himself in an eerie, ramshackle barn with four strangers. The men have no idea where they are, and no memory of how they got there. The mystery turns to desperation when they open the doors to find the barn floating in an endless expanse of emptiness and total darkness. Nothing. The oppressive nothingness outside and bizarre events inside bring to light the men's deepest fears, doubts, failings, and beliefs. When their situation appears to grow hopeless, the men turn to reflections on life and death, faith, God and- ultimately- the afterlife.","genres":["Drama"," Mystery"],"stems":["THE","NOTHING","tell","the","stori","of","Ren","Dubbin",",","a","man","struggl","to","reconcil","his","spiritu","convict","with","his","crippl","fear","of","the","unknown",".","He","awak","to","find","himself","in","an","eeri",",","ramshackl","barn","with","four","stranger",".","The","men","have","no","idea","where","they","are",",","and","no","memori","of","how","they","got","there",".","The","mysteri","turn","to","desper","when","they","open","the","door","to","find","the","barn","float","in","an","endless","expans","of","empti","and","total","dark",".","Noth",".","The","oppress","nothing","outsid","and","bizarr","event","insid","bring","to","light","the","men","'s","deepest","fear",",","doubt",",","fail",",","and","belief",".","When","their","situat","appear","to","grow","hopeless",",","the","men","turn","to","reflect","on","life","and","death",",","faith",",","God","and","-","ultim","-","the","afterlif","."],"lemmas":["the","nothing","tell","the","story","of","Ren","Dubbin",",","a","man","struggle","to","reconcile","he","spiritual","conviction","with","he","crippling","fear","of","the","unknown",".","he","awake","to","find","himself","in","a","eerie",",","ramshackle","barn","with","four","stranger",".","the","man","have","no","idea","where","they","be",",","and","no","memory","of","how","they","get","there",".","the","mystery","turn","to","desperation","when","they","open","the","door","to","find","the","barn","float","in","a","endless","expanse","of","emptiness","and","total","darkness",".","nothing",".","the","oppressive","nothingness","outside","and","bizarre","event","inside","bring","to","light","the","man","'s","deepest","fear",",","doubt",",","failing",",","and","belief",".","when","they","situation","appear","to","grow","hopeless",",","the","man","turn","to","reflection","on","life","and","death",",","faith",",","God","and","-","ultimately","-","the","afterlife","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["THE NOTHING tells","NOTHING tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of Ren","of Ren Dubbin","Ren Dubbin ,","Dubbin , a",", a man","a man struggling","man struggling to","struggling to reconcile","to reconcile his","reconcile his spiritual","his spiritual convictions","spiritual convictions with","convictions with his","with his crippling","his crippling fear","crippling fear of","fear of the","of the unknown","He awakes to","awakes to find","to find himself","find himself in","himself in an","in an eerie","an eerie ,","eerie , ramshackle",", ramshackle barn","ramshackle barn with","barn with four","with four strangers","The men have","men have no","have no idea","no idea where","idea where they","where they are","they are ,","are , and",", and no","and no memory","no memory of","memory of how","of how they","how they got","they got there","The mystery turns","mystery turns to","turns to desperation","to desperation when","desperation when they","when they open","they open the","open the doors","the doors to","doors to find","to find the","find the barn","the barn floating","barn floating in","floating in an","in an endless","an endless expanse","endless expanse of","expanse of emptiness","of emptiness and","emptiness and total","and total darkness","The oppressive nothingness","oppressive nothingness outside","nothingness outside and","outside and bizarre","and bizarre events","bizarre events inside","events inside bring","inside bring to","bring to light","to light the","light the men","the men 's","men 's deepest","'s deepest fears","deepest fears ,","fears , doubts",", doubts ,","doubts , failings",", failings ,","failings , and",", and beliefs","When their situation","their situation appears","situation appears to","appears to grow","to grow hopeless","grow hopeless ,","hopeless , the",", the men","the men turn","men turn to","turn to reflections","to reflections on","reflections on life","on life and","life and death","and death ,","death , faith",", faith ,","faith , God",", God and","God and -","and -

{"title":"Back in Time","plot":"A look at the very real impact the Back to the Future movies have had on our culture. What was once a little idea that spawned a tightly-focused documentary has grown into something truly amazing over two years of filming. Back in Time is a cinematic monument to the vastness of the trilogy's fandom. In addition to the footage and interviews revolving around the time machine itself, the crew found that simply by delving into the impact of the trilogy an epic journey began to unfold before them. The crew captured countless hours of footage during filming. From Steven Spielberg to Robert Zemeckis and Bob Gale, to the Sheas and Hollers, and from James Tolkan and Lea Thompson to Christopher Lloyd and Michael J. Fox, Back in Time features interview after interview that simply must be seen.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["A","look","at","the","veri","real","impact","the","Back","to","the","Futur","movi","have","had","on","our","cultur",".","What","was","onc","a","littl","idea","that","spawn","a","tightly-focus","documentari","has","grown","into","someth","truli","amaz","over","two","year","of","film",".","Back","in","Time","is","a","cinemat","monument","to","the","vast","of","the","trilog","'s","fandom",".","In","addit","to","the","footag","and","interview","revolv","around","the","time","machin","itself",",","the","crew","found","that","simpli","by","delv","into","the","impact","of","the","trilog","an","epic","journey","began","to","unfold","befor","them",".","The","crew","captur","countless","hour","of","footag","dure","film",".","From","Steven","Spielberg","to","Robert","Zemecki","and","Bob","Gale",",","to","the","Shea","and","Holler",",","and","from","Jame","Tolkan","and","Lea","Thompson","to","Christoph","Lloyd","and","Michael","J.","Fox",",","Back","in","Time","featur","interview","after","interview","that","simpli","must","be","seen","."],"lemmas":["a","look","at","the","very","real","impact","the","Back","to","the","Future","movie","have","have","on","we","culture",".","what","be","once","a","little","idea","that","spawn","a","tightly-focused","documentary","have","grow","into","something","truly","amazing","over","two","year","of","film",".","back","in","Time","be","a","cinematic","monument","to","the","vastness","of","the","trilogy","'s","fandom",".","in","addition","to","the","footage","and","interview","revolve","around","the","time","machine","itself",",","the","crew","find","that","simply","by","delving","into","the","impact","of","the","trilogy","a","epic","journey","begin","to","unfold","before","they",".","the","crew","capture","countless","hour","of","footage","during","film",".","from","Steven","Spielberg","to","Robert","Zemeckis","and","Bob","Gale",",","to","the","Sheas","and","Hollers",",","and","from","James","Tolkan","and","Lea","Thompson","to","Christopher","Lloyd","and","Michael","J.","Fox",",","Back","in","Time","feature","interview","after","interview","that","simply","must","be","see","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A look at","look at the","at the very","the very real","very real impact","real impact the","impact the Back","the Back to","Back to the","to the Future","the Future movies","Future movies have","movies have had","have had on","had on our","on our culture","What was once","was once a","once a little","a little idea","little idea that","idea that spawned","that spawned a","spawned a tightly-focused","a tightly-focused documentary","tightly-focused documentary has","documentary has grown","has grown into","grown into something","into something truly","something truly amazing","truly amazing over","amazing over two","over two years","two years of","years of filming","Back in Time","in Time is","Time is a","is a cinematic","a cinematic monument","cinematic monument to","monument to the","to the vastness","the vastness of","vastness of the","of the trilogy","the trilogy 's","trilogy 's fandom","In addition to","addition to the","to the footage","the footage and","footage and interviews","and interviews revolving","interviews revolving around","revolving around the","around the time","the time machine","time machine itself","machine itself ,","itself , the",", the crew","the crew found","crew found that","found that simply","that simply by","simply by delving","by delving into","delving into the","into the impact","the impact of","impact of the","of the trilogy","the trilogy an","trilogy an epic","an epic journey","epic journey began","journey began to","began to unfold","to unfold before","unfold before them","The crew captured","crew captured countless","captured countless hours","countless hours of","hours of footage","of footage during","footage during filming","From Steven Spielberg","Steven Spielberg to","Spielberg to Robert","to Robert Zemeckis","Robert Zemeckis and","Zemeckis and Bob","and Bob Gale","Bob Gale ,","Gale , to",", to the","to the Sheas","the Sheas and","Sheas and Hollers","and Hollers ,","Hollers , and",", and from","and from James","from James Tolkan","James Tolkan and","Tolkan and Lea","and Lea Thompson","Lea Thompson to","Thompson to Christopher","to Christopher Lloyd","Christopher Lloyd and","Lloyd and Michael","and Michael J.","Michael J.

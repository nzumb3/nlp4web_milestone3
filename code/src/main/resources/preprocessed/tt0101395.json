{"title":"Backsliding","plot":"While in prison, Jack had two momentous experiences: he got religion, and met the woman who would become his wife. He and Alison are devoted to the idea of staying in God's good graces, so they have moved to a remote power station in central Australia, far from anything. Into this possibly idyllic arrangement comes a rootless young man who the power company has hired on to be the station's handyman. Tensions escalate between the men as their conflicting values rub up against one another.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["While","in","prison",",","Jack","had","two","moment","experi",":","he","got","religion",",","and","met","the","woman","who","would","becom","his","wife",".","He","and","Alison","are","devot","to","the","idea","of","stay","in","God","'s","good","grace",",","so","they","have","move","to","a","remot","power","station","in","central","Australia",",","far","from","anyth",".","Into","this","possibl","idyl","arrang","come","a","rootless","young","man","who","the","power","compani","has","hire","on","to","be","the","station","'s","handyman",".","Tension","escal","between","the","men","as","their","conflict","valu","rub","up","against","one","anoth","."],"lemmas":["while","in","prison",",","Jack","have","two","momentous","experience",":","he","get","religion",",","and","meet","the","woman","who","would","become","he","wife",".","he","and","Alison","be","devote","to","the","idea","of","staying","in","God","'s","good","grace",",","so","they","have","move","to","a","remote","power","station","in","central","Australia",",","far","from","anything",".","Into","this","possibly","idyllic","arrangement","come","a","rootless","young","man","who","the","power","company","have","hire","on","to","be","the","station","'s","handyman",".","tension","escalate","between","the","man","as","they","conflict","value","rub","up","against","one","another","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["While in prison","in prison ,","prison , Jack",", Jack had","Jack had two","had two momentous","two momentous experiences","momentous experiences :","experiences : he",": he got","he got religion","got religion ,","religion , and",", and met","and met the","met the woman","the woman who","woman who would","who would become","would become his","become his wife","He and Alison","and Alison are","Alison are devoted","are devoted to","devoted to the","to the idea","the idea of","idea of staying","of staying in","staying in God","in God 's","God 's good","'s good graces","good graces ,","graces , so",", so they","so they have","they have moved","have moved to","moved to a","to a remote","a remote power","remote power station","power station in","station in central","in central Australia","central Australia ,","Australia , far",", far from","far from anything","Into this possibly","this possibly idyllic","possibly idyllic arrangement","idyllic arrangement comes","arrangement comes a","comes a rootless","a rootless young","rootless young man","young man who","man who the","who the power","the power company","power company has","company has hired","has hired on","hired on to","on to be","to be the","be the station","the station 's","station 's handyman","Tensions escalate between","escalate between the","between the men","the men as","men as their","as their conflicting","their conflicting values","conflicting values rub","values rub up","rub up against","up against one","against one another"],"2grams":["While in","in prison","prison ,",", Jack","Jack had","had two","two momentous","momentous experiences","experiences :",": he","he got","got religion","religion ,",", and","and met","met the","the woman","woman who","who would","would become","become his","his wife","He and","and Alison","Alison are","are devoted","devoted to","to the","the idea","idea of","of staying","staying in","in God","God 's","'s good","good graces","graces ,",", so","so they","they have","have moved","moved to","to a","a remote","remote power","power station","station in","in central","central Australia","Australia ,",", far","far from","from anything","Into this","this possibly","possibly idyllic","idyllic arrangement","arrangement comes","comes a","a rootless","rootless young","young man","man who","who the","the power","power company","company has","has hired","hired on","on to","to be","be the","the station","station 's","'s handyman","Tensions escalate","escalate between","between the","the men","men as","as their","their conflicting","conflicting values","values rub","rub up","up against","against one","one another"]}

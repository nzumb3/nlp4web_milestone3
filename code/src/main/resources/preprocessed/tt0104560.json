He and his friends (his master and a kid) went to the hotel before the mountain. The hotel was linked with the mountain while they delivered the peolple that showed up there. That's why they never get out of the hotel. The owner of the hotel ( a woman) loved Andy. The king of mountain loves Andy. Andy got the ice. He found a woman in there which happens to be his dream lover since his childhood. She got a breath which can cure any disease. The king wants it and Andy died in a battle.

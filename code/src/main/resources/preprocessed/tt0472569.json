{"title":"Thunder and Hurricane","plot":"This comedy follows the adventures of two simple-minded cousins, Rufus and Silas, who are hoping to escape their less-than-average existence by moonlighting as 'superheroes.' They believe the power rings they purchase from a shady pawnshop salesman are their one shot at becoming somebody. 'Thunder' and 'Hurricane,' Rufus and Silas' alter egos, quickly set off for superhero-dom only to fail at their several heroic attempts. However, their fate seems to change when they meet a self-proclaimed, retired superhero who offers to train them to become the heroes they long to be. It isn't long until their newly acquired training is put to the test when they find themselves mixed up in a crime spree that plagues the town. Through turmoil, romance, deception, and imprisonment, Rufus and Silas are in for the ride of their lives.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"],"stems":["This","comedi","follow","the","adventur","of","two","simple-mind","cousin",",","Rufus","and","Sila",",","who","are","hope","to","escap","their","less-than-averag","exist","by","moonlight","as","'","superhero",".","'","They","believ","the","power","ring","they","purchas","from","a","shadi","pawnshop","salesman","are","their","one","shot","at","becom","somebodi",".","'","Thunder","'","and","'","Hurrican",",","'","Rufus","and","Sila","'","alter","ego",",","quick","set","off","for","superhero-dom","onli","to","fail","at","their","sever","heroic","attempt",".","Howev",",","their","fate","seem","to","chang","when","they","meet","a","self-proclaim",",","retir","superhero","who","offer","to","train","them","to","becom","the","hero","they","long","to","be",".","It","is","n't","long","until","their","newli","acquir","train","is","put","to","the","test","when","they","find","themselv","mix","up","in","a","crime","spree","that","plagu","the","town",".","Through","turmoil",",","romanc",",","decept",",","and","imprison",",","Rufus","and","Sila","are","in","for","the","ride","of","their","live","."],"lemmas":["this","comedy","follow","the","adventure","of","two","simple-minded","cousin",",","Rufus","and","Silas",",","who","be","hope","to","escape","they","less-than-average","existence","by","moonlight","as","'","superhero",".","'","they","believe","the","power","ring","they","purchase","from","a","shady","pawnshop","salesman","be","they","one","shot","at","become","somebody",".","'","thunder","'","and","'","Hurricane",",","'","Rufus","and","Silas","'","alter","ego",",","quickly","set","off","for","superhero-dom","only","to","fail","at","they","several","heroic","attempt",".","however",",","they","fate","seem","to","change","when","they","meet","a","self-proclaimed",",","retired","superhero","who","offer","to","train","they","to","become","the","hero","they","long","to","be",".","it","be","not","long","until","they","newly","acquire","training","be","put","to","the","test","when","they","find","themselves","mix","up","in","a","crime","spree","that","plague","the","town",".","through","turmoil",",","romance",",","deception",",","and","imprisonment",",","Rufus","and","Silas","be","in","for","the","ride","of","they","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This comedy follows","comedy follows the","follows the adventures","the adventures of","adventures of two","of two simple-minded","two simple-minded cousins","simple-minded cousins ,","cousins , Rufus",", Rufus and","Rufus and Silas","and Silas ,","Silas , who",", who are","who are hoping","are hoping to","hoping to escape","to escape their","escape their less-than-average","their less-than-average existence","less-than-average existence by","existence by moonlighting","by moonlighting as","moonlighting as '","as ' superheroes","' superheroes .","superheroes .

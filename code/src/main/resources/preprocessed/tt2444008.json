{"title":"Children of Conflict","plot":"Children of Conflict is about the kids who grew up in the IRA dealing with the British Occupation, and had to learn how to survive being born into a war. Our story centers on a Irish daughter of the I.R.A, Bernedette Laub, who ran away 20 years ago to protect her son, but has returned to find closure from the tortures of her childhood. In the end, and to our surprise as we were filming, she finds it in the forgiveness from a British soldier she had sworn off as the enemy.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Children","of","Conflict","is","about","the","kid","who","grew","up","in","the","IRA","deal","with","the","British","Occupat",",","and","had","to","learn","how","to","surviv","be","born","into","a","war",".","Our","stori","center","on","a","Irish","daughter","of","the","I.R.A",",","Bernedett","Laub",",","who","ran","away","20","year","ago","to","protect","her","son",",","but","has","return","to","find","closur","from","the","tortur","of","her","childhood",".","In","the","end",",","and","to","our","surpris","as","we","were","film",",","she","find","it","in","the","forgiv","from","a","British","soldier","she","had","sworn","off","as","the","enemi","."],"lemmas":["child","of","conflict","be","about","the","kid","who","grow","up","in","the","IRA","deal","with","the","british","occupation",",","and","have","to","learn","how","to","survive","be","bear","into","a","war",".","we","story","center","on","a","irish","daughter","of","the","I.R.A",",","Bernedette","Laub",",","who","run","away","20","year","ago","to","protect","she","son",",","but","have","return","to","find","closure","from","the","torture","of","she","childhood",".","in","the","end",",","and","to","we","surprise","as","we","be","film",",","she","find","it","in","the","forgiveness","from","a","british","soldier","she","have","swear","off","as","the","enemy","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Children of Conflict","of Conflict is","Conflict is about","is about the","about the kids","the kids who","kids who grew","who grew up","grew up in","up in the","in the IRA","the IRA dealing","IRA dealing with","dealing with the","with the British","the British Occupation","British Occupation ,","Occupation , and",", and had","and had to","had to learn","to learn how","learn how to","how to survive","to survive being","survive being born","being born into","born into a","into a war","Our story centers","story centers on","centers on a","on a Irish","a Irish daughter","Irish daughter of","daughter of the","of the I.R.A","the I.R.A ,","I.R.A , Bernedette",", Bernedette Laub","Bernedette Laub ,","Laub , who",", who ran","who ran away","ran away 20","away 20 years","20 years ago","years ago to","ago to protect","to protect her","protect her son","her son ,","son , but",", but has","but has returned","has returned to","returned to find","to find closure","find closure from","closure from the","from the tortures","the tortures of","tortures of her","of her childhood","In the end","the end ,","end , and",", and to","and to our","to our surprise","our surprise as","surprise as we","as we were","we were filming","were filming ,","filming , she",", she finds","she finds it","finds it in","it in the","in the forgiveness","the forgiveness from","forgiveness from a","from a British","a British soldier","British soldier she","soldier she had","she had sworn","had sworn off","sworn off as","off as the","as the enemy"],"2grams":["Children of","of Conflict","Conflict is","is about","about the","the kids","kids who","who grew","grew up","up in","in the","the IRA","IRA dealing","dealing with","with the","the British","British Occupation","Occupation ,",", and","and had","had to","to learn","learn how","how to","to survive","survive being","being born","born into","into a","a war","Our story","story centers","centers on","on a","a Irish","Irish daughter","daughter of","of the","the I.R.A","I.R.A ,",", Bernedette","Bernedette Laub","Laub ,",", who","who ran","ran away","away 20","20 years","years ago","ago to","to protect","protect her","her son","son ,",", but","but has","has returned","returned to","to find","find closure","closure from","from the","the tortures","tortures of","of her","her childhood","In the","the end","end ,",", and","and to","to our","our surprise","surprise as","as we","we were","were filming","filming ,",", she","she finds","finds it","it in","in the","the forgiveness","forgiveness from","from a","a British","British soldier","soldier she","she had","had sworn","sworn off","off as","as the","the enemy"]}

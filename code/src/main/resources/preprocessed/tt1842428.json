{"title":"Never Happen Here: The Whitehorse 9/11 Story","plot":"On 9/11, the peaceful world of a remote northern town was shattered when a \"hijacked\" 747 approached with fighter jets on its tail. Schools were evacuated, and parents, already shaken by images of the tragedy in New York City, raced in panic to locate their children in what they feared could be the last moments of their lives. Until that day, the people of Whitehorse, Yukon believed that such a thing could \"never happen here.\" A decade later, questions remain about why a hostile Korean airliner was diverted to Canada. This documentary reveals new information about the mysterious flight of KAL 085. A northern point of view documentary with national and international implications.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","9/11",",","the","peac","world","of","a","remot","northern","town","was","shatter","when","a","\"","hijack","\"","747","approach","with","fighter","jet","on","it","tail",".","School","were","evacu",",","and","parent",",","alreadi","shaken","by","imag","of","the","tragedi","in","New","York","Citi",",","race","in","panic","to","locat","their","children","in","what","they","fear","could","be","the","last","moment","of","their","live",".","Until","that","day",",","the","peopl","of","Whitehors",",","Yukon","believ","that","such","a","thing","could","\"","never","happen","here",".","\"","A","decad","later",",","question","remain","about","whi","a","hostil","Korean","airlin","was","divert","to","Canada",".","This","documentari","reveal","new","inform","about","the","mysteri","flight","of","KAL","085",".","A","northern","point","of","view","documentari","with","nation","and","intern","implic","."],"lemmas":["on","9/11",",","the","peaceful","world","of","a","remote","northern","town","be","shatter","when","a","``","hijack","''","747","approach","with","fighter","jet","on","its","tail",".","school","be","evacuate",",","and","parent",",","already","shake","by","image","of","the","tragedy","in","New","York","City",",","race","in","panic","to","locate","they","child","in","what","they","fear","could","be","the","last","moment","of","they","life",".","until","that","day",",","the","people","of","Whitehorse",",","Yukon","believe","that","such","a","thing","could","``","never","happen","here",".","''","a","decade","later",",","question","remain","about","why","a","hostile","korean","airliner","be","divert","to","Canada",".","this","documentary","reveal","new","information","about","the","mysterious","flight","of","kal","085",".","a","northern","point","of","view","documentary","with","national","and","international","implication","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["On

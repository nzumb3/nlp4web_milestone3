{"title":"Graffiti In/Out","plot":"Graffiti on buildings used to be the sign of a neglected neighborhood, however the Wynwood area in Miami has become an example of a neighborhood revitalized by graffiti art. The film shows the story of local and out of town artists working in Wynwood, their interactions with developers and business owners in the area. The Artists also discuss legal versus illegal ways of promoting their graffiti, the messages they convey to the public through graffiti and whether they can make a living off of their art.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Graffiti","on","build","use","to","be","the","sign","of","a","neglect","neighborhood",",","howev","the","Wynwood","area","in","Miami","has","becom","an","exampl","of","a","neighborhood","revit","by","graffiti","art",".","The","film","show","the","stori","of","local","and","out","of","town","artist","work","in","Wynwood",",","their","interact","with","develop","and","busi","owner","in","the","area",".","The","Artist","also","discuss","legal","versus","illeg","way","of","promot","their","graffiti",",","the","messag","they","convey","to","the","public","through","graffiti","and","whether","they","can","make","a","live","off","of","their","art","."],"lemmas":["graffiti","on","building","use","to","be","the","sign","of","a","neglect","neighborhood",",","however","the","Wynwood","area","in","Miami","have","become","a","example","of","a","neighborhood","revitalize","by","graffiti","art",".","the","film","show","the","story","of","local","and","out","of","town","artist","work","in","Wynwood",",","they","interaction","with","developer","and","business","owner","in","the","area",".","the","Artists","also","discuss","legal","versus","illegal","way","of","promote","they","graffitus",",","the","message","they","convey","to","the","public","through","graffiti","and","whether","they","can","make","a","living","off","of","they","art","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Graffiti on buildings","on buildings used","buildings used to","used to be","to be the","be the sign","the sign of","sign of a","of a neglected","a neglected neighborhood","neglected neighborhood ,","neighborhood , however",", however the","however the Wynwood","the Wynwood area","Wynwood area in","area in Miami","in Miami has","Miami has become","has become an","become an example","an example of","example of a","of a neighborhood","a neighborhood revitalized","neighborhood revitalized by","revitalized by graffiti","by graffiti art","The film shows","film shows the","shows the story","the story of","story of local","of local and","local and out","and out of","out of town","of town artists","town artists working","artists working in","working in Wynwood","in Wynwood ,","Wynwood , their",", their interactions","their interactions with","interactions with developers","with developers and","developers and business","and business owners","business owners in","owners in the","in the area","The Artists also","Artists also discuss","also discuss legal","discuss legal versus","legal versus illegal","versus illegal ways","illegal ways of","ways of promoting","of promoting their","promoting their graffiti","their graffiti ,","graffiti , the",", the messages","the messages they","messages they convey","they convey to","convey to the","to the public","the public through","public through graffiti","through graffiti and","graffiti and whether","and whether they","whether they can","they can make","can make a","make a living","a living off","living off of","off of their","of their art"],"2grams":["Graffiti on","on buildings","buildings used","used to","to be","be the","the sign","sign of","of a","a neglected","neglected neighborhood","neighborhood ,",", however","however the","the Wynwood","Wynwood area","area in","in Miami","Miami has","has become","become an","an example","example of","of a","a neighborhood","neighborhood revitalized","revitalized by","by graffiti","graffiti art","The film","film shows","shows the","the story","story of","of local","local and","and out","out of","of town","town artists","artists working","working in","in Wynwood","Wynwood ,",", their","their interactions","interactions with","with developers","developers and","and business","business owners","owners in","in the","the area","The Artists","Artists also","also discuss","discuss legal","legal versus","versus illegal","illegal ways","ways of","of promoting","promoting their","their graffiti","graffiti ,",", the","the messages","messages they","they convey","convey to","to the","the public","public through","through graffiti","graffiti and","and whether","whether they","they can","can make","make a","a living","living off","off of","of their","their art"]}

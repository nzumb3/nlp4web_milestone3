{"title":"Big Daddy","plot":"Sonny Koufax is 32 years old. He's a law school graduate. He's got a nice apartment in Manhattan. There's just one problem. He does nothing, except sit on his butt and live off an investment that was the result of a meager lawsuit he won a year ago. But after his fed up girlfriend leaves him, he comes up with the ingenious idea to adopt a five year old boy to showcase his newfound maturity. But things don't go as planned, and Sonny finds himself the unlikely foster father that will change his perspective on just looking out for himself.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Sonni","Koufax","is","32","year","old",".","He","'s","a","law","school","graduat",".","He","'s","got","a","nice","apart","in","Manhattan",".","There","'s","just","one","problem",".","He","doe","noth",",","except","sit","on","his","butt","and","live","off","an","invest","that","was","the","result","of","a","meager","lawsuit","he","won","a","year","ago",".","But","after","his","fed","up","girlfriend","leav","him",",","he","come","up","with","the","ingeni","idea","to","adopt","a","five","year","old","boy","to","showcas","his","newfound","matur",".","But","thing","do","n't","go","as","plan",",","and","Sonni","find","himself","the","unlik","foster","father","that","will","chang","his","perspect","on","just","look","out","for","himself","."],"lemmas":["Sonny","Koufax","be","32","year","old",".","he","be","a","law","school","graduate",".","he","be","get","a","nice","apartment","in","Manhattan",".","there","be","just","one","problem",".","he","do","nothing",",","except","sit","on","he","butt","and","live","off","a","investment","that","be","the","result","of","a","meager","lawsuit","he","win","a","year","ago",".","but","after","he","fed","up","girlfriend","leave","he",",","he","come","up","with","the","ingenious","idea","to","adopt","a","five","year","old","boy","to","showcase","he","newfound","maturity",".","but","thing","do","not","go","as","plan",",","and","Sonny","find","himself","the","unlikely","foster","father","that","will","change","he","perspective","on","just","look","out","for","himself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sonny Koufax is","Koufax is 32","is 32 years","32 years old","He 's a","'s a law","a law school","law school graduate","He 's got","'s got a","got a nice","a nice apartment","nice apartment in","apartment in Manhattan","There 's just","'s just one","just one problem","He does nothing","does nothing ,","nothing , except",", except sit","except sit on","sit on his","on his butt","his butt and","butt and live","and live off","live off an","off an investment","an investment that","investment that was","that was the","was the result","the result of","result of a","of a meager","a meager lawsuit","meager lawsuit he","lawsuit he won","he won a","won a year","a year ago","But after his","after his fed","his fed up","fed up girlfriend","up girlfriend leaves","girlfriend leaves him","leaves him ,","him , he",", he comes","he comes up","comes up with","up with the","with the ingenious","the ingenious idea","ingenious idea to","idea to adopt","to adopt a","adopt a five","a five year","five year old","year old boy","old boy to","boy to showcase","to showcase his","showcase his newfound","his newfound maturity","But things do","things do n't","do n't go","n't go as","go as planned","as planned ,","planned , and",", and Sonny","and Sonny finds","Sonny finds himself","finds himself the","himself the unlikely","the unlikely foster","unlikely foster father","foster father that","father that will","that will change","will change his","change his perspective","his perspective on","perspective on just","on just looking","just looking out","looking out for","out for himself"],"2grams":["Sonny Koufax","Koufax is","is 32","32 years","years old","He 's","'s a","a law","law school","school graduate","He 's","'s got","got a","a nice","nice apartment","apartment in","in Manhattan","There 's","'s just","just one","one problem","He does","does nothing","nothing ,",", except","except sit","sit on","on his","his butt","butt and","and live","live off","off an","an investment","investment that","that was","was the","the result","result of","of a","a meager","meager lawsuit","lawsuit he","he won","won a","a year","year ago","But after","after his","his fed","fed up","up girlfriend","girlfriend leaves","leaves him","him ,",", he","he comes","comes up","up with","with the","the ingenious","ingenious idea","idea to","to adopt","adopt a","a five","five year","year old","old boy","boy to","to showcase","showcase his","his newfound","newfound maturity","But things","things do","do n't","n't go","go as","as planned","planned ,",", and","and Sonny","Sonny finds","finds himself","himself the","the unlikely","unlikely foster","foster father","father that","that will","will change","change his","his perspective","perspective on","on just","just looking","looking out","out for","for himself"]}

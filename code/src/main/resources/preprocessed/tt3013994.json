{"title":"Junior Shooters","plot":"The Freeport Rifle and Revolver Association has taught children gun safety and marksmanship for the past 25 years, attracting families and gun enthusiasts several towns and counties away to its range in western Long Island. Now with America's unique gun culture under the microscope following several mass shootings - including the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School that left 20 young children murdered on Dec. 14, 2012 - the range and its dedicated families find themselves part of a vocal movement against gun control measures. 'Junior Shooters' is a thought-provoking look at the cultural divide between two cultures and America's obsession with firearms.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["The","Freeport","Rifl","and","Revolv","Associat","has","taught","children","gun","safeti","and","marksmanship","for","the","past","25","year",",","attract","famili","and","gun","enthusiast","sever","town","and","counti","away","to","it","rang","in","western","Long","Island",".","Now","with","America","'s","uniqu","gun","cultur","under","the","microscop","follow","sever","mass","shoot","-","includ","the","massacr","at","Sandi","Hook","Elementari","School","that","left","20","young","children","murder","on","Dec.","14",",","2012","-","the","rang","and","it","dedic","famili","find","themselv","part","of","a","vocal","movement","against","gun","control","measur",".","'","Junior","Shooter","'","is","a","thought-provok","look","at","the","cultur","divid","between","two","cultur","and","America","'s","obsess","with","firearm","."],"lemmas":["the","Freeport","Rifle","and","Revolver","Association","have","teach","child","gun","safety","and","marksmanship","for","the","past","25","year",",","attract","family","and","gun","enthusiast","several","town","and","county","away","to","its","range","in","western","Long","Island",".","now","with","America","'s","unique","gun","culture","under","the","microscope","follow","several","mass","shooting","-","include","the","massacre","at","Sandy","Hook","Elementary","School","that","leave","20","young","child","murder","on","Dec.","14",",","2012","-","the","range","and","its","dedicated","family","find","themselves","part","of","a","vocal","movement","against","gun","control","measure",".","'","junior","shooter","'","be","a","thought-provoking","look","at","the","cultural","divide","between","two","culture","and","America","'s","obsession","with","firearm","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Freeport Rifle","Freeport Rifle and","Rifle and Revolver","and Revolver Association","Revolver Association has","Association has taught","has taught children","taught children gun","children gun safety","gun safety and","safety and marksmanship","and marksmanship for","marksmanship for the","for the past","the past 25","past 25 years","25 years ,","years , attracting",", attracting families","attracting families and","families and gun","and gun enthusiasts","gun enthusiasts several","enthusiasts several towns","several towns and","towns and counties","and counties away","counties away to","away to its","to its range","its range in","range in western","in western Long","western Long Island","Now with America","with America 's","America 's unique","'s unique gun","unique gun culture","gun culture under","culture under the","under the microscope","the microscope following","microscope following several","following several mass","several mass shootings","mass shootings -","shootings - including","- including the","including the massacre","the massacre at","massacre at Sandy","at Sandy Hook","Sandy Hook Elementary","Hook Elementary School","Elementary School that","School that left","that left 20","left 20 young","20 young children","young children murdered","children murdered on","murdered on Dec.","on Dec. 14","Dec. 14 ,","14 , 2012",", 2012 -","2012 - the","- the range","the range and","range and its","and its dedicated","its dedicated families","dedicated families find","families find themselves","find themselves part","themselves part of","part of a","of a vocal","a vocal movement","vocal movement against","movement against gun","against gun control","gun control measures","control measures .","measures .

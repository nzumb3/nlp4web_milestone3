{"title":"Hatalyan","plot":"The life of Shalom, The Nazi major officer Adolf Eichmann's hangman, turned ritual slaughterer, encapsulates the story of Israel from the perspective of the 'other'- the marginalized Sephardi prison warden who is forced to do the dirty work of hanging the arch enemy and thus to carry a national burden that dramatically shaped his life. His job in the abattoir, together with his memories of his past, create a fascinating and complex portrait. His voice, yet unheard, from the edge of Israel's historical events, reveals new insights through his unique perspective. Shalom's clear, alternative voice from the margins of society carries a deeply humanistic universal message.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["The","life","of","Shalom",",","The","Nazi","major","offic","Adolf","Eichmann","'s","hangman",",","turn","ritual","slaughter",",","encapsul","the","stori","of","Israel","from","the","perspect","of","the","'","other","'","-","the","margin","Sephardi","prison","warden","who","is","forc","to","do","the","dirti","work","of","hang","the","arch","enemi","and","thus","to","carri","a","nation","burden","that","dramat","shape","his","life",".","His","job","in","the","abattoir",",","togeth","with","his","memori","of","his","past",",","creat","a","fascin","and","complex","portrait",".","His","voic",",","yet","unheard",",","from","the","edg","of","Israel","'s","histor","event",",","reveal","new","insight","through","his","uniqu","perspect",".","Shalom","'s","clear",",","altern","voic","from","the","margin","of","societi","carri","a","deepli","humanist","univers","messag","."],"lemmas":["the","life","of","shalom",",","the","nazi","major","officer","Adolf","Eichmann","'s","hangman",",","turn","ritual","slaughterer",",","encapsulate","the","story","of","Israel","from","the","perspective","of","the","'","other","'","-","the","marginalized","sephardi","prison","warden","who","be","force","to","do","the","dirty","work","of","hang","the","arch","enemy","and","thus","to","carry","a","national","burden","that","dramatically","shape","he","life",".","he","job","in","the","abattoir",",","together","with","he","memory","of","he","past",",","create","a","fascinating","and","complex","portrait",".","he","voice",",","yet","unheard",",","from","the","edge","of","Israel","'s","historical","event",",","reveal","new","insight","through","he","unique","perspective",".","shalom","'s","clear",",","alternative","voice","from","the","margin","of","society","carry","a","deeply","humanistic","universal","message","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The life of","life of Shalom","of Shalom ,","Shalom , The",", The Nazi","The Nazi major","Nazi major officer","major officer Adolf","officer Adolf Eichmann","Adolf Eichmann 's","Eichmann 's hangman","'s hangman ,","hangman , turned",", turned ritual","turned ritual slaughterer","ritual slaughterer ,","slaughterer , encapsulates",", encapsulates the","encapsulates the story","the story of","story of Israel","of Israel from","Israel from the","from the perspective","the perspective of","perspective of the","of the '","the ' other","' other '","other ' -","' -

{"title":"Orchestra of Exiles","plot":"Some stories get lost in the turmoil of their times. It is often only in retrospect that we can discover the true shapers of history. One such man is the prodigious Polish violinist Bronislaw Huberman. Orchestra of Exiles explores this great man's 4-year odyssey, which culminates in the founding of the orchestra that would become the Israel Philharmonic. His fascinating story touches many of the major themes of the 20th century and the unfolding drama of his life is riveting. During the darkest days of a Europe being torn apart by anti- Semitism and Nazi aggression, Huberman's extraordinary efforts saved hundreds of Jewish families from the approaching holocaust and his achievements changed the landscape of cultural history. Before the Nazis came to power Huberman was focused only on building his own monumental career but witnessing Hitler's agenda was a call to action that Huberman could not ignore. Huberman's personal transformation and subsequent heroic struggle to get Jewish musicians out of Europe to found this orchestra will be at the heart of this film.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Some","stori","get","lost","in","the","turmoil","of","their","time",".","It","is","often","onli","in","retrospect","that","we","can","discov","the","true","shaper","of","histori",".","One","such","man","is","the","prodigi","Polish","violinist","Bronislaw","Huberman",".","Orchestra","of","Exile","explor","this","great","man","'s","4-year","odyssey",",","which","culmin","in","the","found","of","the","orchestra","that","would","becom","the","Israel","Philharmon",".","His","fascin","stori","touch","mani","of","the","major","theme","of","the","20th","centuri","and","the","unfold","drama","of","his","life","is","rivet",".","Dure","the","darkest","day","of","a","Europ","be","torn","apart","by","anti-","Semit","and","Nazi","aggress",",","Huberman","'s","extraordinari","effort","save","hundr","of","Jewish","famili","from","the","approach","holocaust","and","his","achiev","chang","the","landscap","of","cultur","histori",".","Befor","the","Nazi","came","to","power","Huberman","was","focus","onli","on","build","his","own","monument","career","but","wit","Hitler","'s","agenda","was","a","call","to","action","that","Huberman","could","not","ignor",".","Huberman","'s","person","transform","and","subsequ","heroic","struggl","to","get","Jewish","musician","out","of","Europ","to","found","this","orchestra","will","be","at","the","heart","of","this","film","."],"lemmas":["some","story","get","lose","in","the","turmoil","of","they","time",".","it","be","often","only","in","retrospect","that","we","can","discover","the","true","shaper","of","history",".","one","such","man","be","the","prodigious","polish","violinist","Bronislaw","Huberman",".","Orchestra","of","Exiles","explore","this","great","man","'s","4-year","odyssey",",","which","culminate","in","the","founding","of","the","orchestra","that","would","become","the","Israel","Philharmonic",".","he","fascinating","story","touch","many","of","the","major","theme","of","the","20th","century","and","the","unfold","drama","of","he","life","be","riveting",".","during","the","darkest","day","of","a","Europe","be","tear","apart","by","anti-","Semitism","and","Nazi","aggression",",","Huberman","'s","extraordinary","effort","save","hundred","of","jewish","family","from","the","approach","holocaust","and","he","achievement","change","the","landscape","of","cultural","history",".","before","the","Nazis","come","to","power","Huberman","be","focus","only","on","build","he","own","monumental","career","but","witness","Hitler","'s","agenda","be","a","call","to","action","that","Huberman","could","not","ignore",".","Huberman","'s","personal","transformation","and","subsequent","heroic","struggle","to","get","jewish","musician","out","of","Europe","to","find","this","orchestra","will","be","at","the","heart","of","this","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Some

{"title":"Hated","plot":"When a young punk rock band starts out in the underground music scene, the only thing they have is each other. But when a childhood friend - with complicated connections to the group - leverages her P.R. skills to get them noticed, they suddenly find themselves on the verge of making it big. The only question is how far they're willing to go in the pursuit of fame and fortune, and who they're willing to leave behind to get there. HATED explores the dark, smoke-filled corners where human nature and the contemporary music industry meet.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","a","young","punk","rock","band","start","out","in","the","underground","music","scene",",","the","onli","thing","they","have","is","each","other",".","But","when","a","childhood","friend","-","with","complic","connect","to","the","group","-","leverag","her","P.R.","skill","to","get","them","notic",",","they","sudden","find","themselv","on","the","verg","of","make","it","big",".","The","onli","question","is","how","far","they","re","will","to","go","in","the","pursuit","of","fame","and","fortun",",","and","who","they","re","will","to","leav","behind","to","get","there",".","HATED","explor","the","dark",",","smoke-fil","corner","where","human","natur","and","the","contemporari","music","industri","meet","."],"lemmas":["when","a","young","punk","rock","band","start","out","in","the","underground","music","scene",",","the","only","thing","they","have","be","each","other",".","but","when","a","childhood","friend","-","with","complicated","connection","to","the","group","-","leverage","she","p.r.","skill","to","get","they","notice",",","they","suddenly","find","themselves","on","the","verge","of","make","it","big",".","the","only","question","be","how","far","they","be","willing","to","go","in","the","pursuit","of","fame","and","fortune",",","and","who","they","be","willing","to","leave","behind","to","get","there",".","hated","explore","the","dark",",","smoke-filled","corner","where","human","nature","and","the","contemporary","music","industry","meet","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["When a young","a young punk","young punk rock","punk rock band","rock band starts","band starts out","starts out in","out in the","in the underground","the underground music","underground music scene","music scene ,","scene , the",", the only","the only thing","only thing they","thing they have","they have is","have is each","is each other","But when a","when a childhood","a childhood friend","childhood friend -","friend - with","- with complicated","with complicated connections","complicated connections to","connections to the","to the group","the group -","group - leverages","- leverages her","leverages her P.R.","her P.R. skills","P.R. skills to","skills to get","to get them","get them noticed","them noticed ,","noticed , they",", they suddenly","they suddenly find","suddenly find themselves","find themselves on","themselves on the","on the verge","the verge of","verge of making","of making it","making it big","The only question","only question is","question is how","is how far","how far they","far they 're","they 're willing","'re willing to","willing to go","to go in","go in the","in the pursuit","the pursuit of","pursuit of fame","of fame and","fame and fortune","and fortune ,","fortune , and",", and who","and who they","who they 're","they 're willing","'re willing to","willing to leave","to leave behind","leave behind to","behind to get","to get there","HATED explores the","explores the dark","the dark ,","dark , smoke-filled",", smoke-filled corners","smoke-filled corners where","corners where human","where human nature","human nature and","nature and the","and the contemporary","the contemporary music","contemporary music industry","music industry meet"],"2grams":["When a","a young","young punk","punk rock","rock band","band starts","starts out","out in","in the","the underground","underground music","music scene","scene ,",", the","the only","only thing","thing they","they have","have is","is each","each other","But when","when a","a childhood","childhood friend","friend -","- with","with complicated","complicated connections","connections to","to the","the group","group -","- leverages","leverages her","her P.R.","P.R. skills","skills to","to get","get them","them noticed","noticed ,",", they","they suddenly","suddenly find","find themselves","themselves on","on the","the verge","verge of","of making","making it","it big","The only","only question","question is","is how","how far","far they","they 're","'re willing","willing to","to go","go in","in the","the pursuit","pursuit of","of fame","fame and","and fortune","fortune ,",", and","and who","who they","they 're","'re willing","willing to","to leave","leave behind","behind to","to get","get there","HATED explores","explores the","the dark","dark ,",", smoke-filled","smoke-filled corners","corners where","where human","human nature","nature and","and the","the contemporary","contemporary music","music industry","industry meet"]}

{"title":"Common Threads: The Rasta/Shigley Project","plot":"The collaboration between professional free surfer and environmentalist, Dave Rastovich and San Diegan based artist, Neil Shigley. In August of 2009, Neil was commissioned to do a portrait of Dave using his 'Invisible People' motif, which includes in no particular order, carving, painting, photography, drawing, and printing. This is the journey of a piece of art, from sketches on a pad to a signature in the corner, that also helps to shed light on Dave Rastovich's environmental causes along with Neil Shigley's helping the homeless endeavors.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","collabor","between","profession","free","surfer","and","environmentalist",",","Dave","Rastovich","and","San","Diegan","base","artist",",","Neil","Shigley",".","In","August","of","2009",",","Neil","was","commiss","to","do","a","portrait","of","Dave","use","his","'","Invisibl","Peopl","'","motif",",","which","includ","in","no","particular","order",",","carv",",","paint",",","photographi",",","draw",",","and","print",".","This","is","the","journey","of","a","piec","of","art",",","from","sketch","on","a","pad","to","a","signatur","in","the","corner",",","that","also","help","to","shed","light","on","Dave","Rastovich","'s","environment","caus","along","with","Neil","Shigley","'s","help","the","homeless","endeavor","."],"lemmas":["the","collaboration","between","professional","free","surfer","and","environmentalist",",","Dave","Rastovich","and","San","Diegan","based","artist",",","Neil","Shigley",".","in","August","of","2009",",","Neil","be","commission","to","do","a","portrait","of","Dave","use","he","'","invisible","people","'","motif",",","which","include","in","no","particular","order",",","carve",",","painting",",","photography",",","drawing",",","and","printing",".","this","be","the","journey","of","a","piece","of","art",",","from","sketch","on","a","pad","to","a","signature","in","the","corner",",","that","also","help","to","shed","light","on","Dave","Rastovich","'s","environmental","cause","along","with","Neil","Shigley","'s","help","the","homeless","endeavor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The collaboration between","collaboration between professional","between professional free","professional free surfer","free surfer and","surfer and environmentalist","and environmentalist ,","environmentalist , Dave",", Dave Rastovich","Dave Rastovich and","Rastovich and San","and San Diegan","San Diegan based","Diegan based artist","based artist ,","artist , Neil",", Neil Shigley","In August of","August of 2009","of 2009 ,","2009 , Neil",", Neil was","Neil was commissioned","was commissioned to","commissioned to do","to do a","do a portrait","a portrait of","portrait of Dave","of Dave using","Dave using his","using his '","his ' Invisible","' Invisible People","Invisible People '","People ' motif","' motif ,","motif , which",", which includes","which includes in","includes in no","in no particular","no particular order","particular order ,","order , carving",", carving ,","carving , painting",", painting ,","painting , photography",", photography ,","photography , drawing",", drawing ,","drawing , and",", and printing","This is the","is the journey","the journey of","journey of a","of a piece","a piece of","piece of art","of art ,","art , from",", from sketches","from sketches on","sketches on a","on a pad","a pad to","pad to a","to a signature","a signature in","signature in the","in the corner","the corner ,","corner , that",", that also","that also helps","also helps to","helps to shed","to shed light","shed light on","light on Dave","on Dave Rastovich","Dave Rastovich 's","Rastovich 's environmental","'s environmental causes","environmental causes along","causes along with","along with Neil","with Neil Shigley","Neil Shigley 's","Shigley 's helping","'s helping the","helping the homeless","the homeless endeavors"],"2grams":["The collaboration","collaboration between","between professional","professional free","free surfer","surfer and","and environmentalist","environmentalist ,",", Dave","Dave Rastovich","Rastovich and","and San","San Diegan","Diegan based","based artist","artist ,",", Neil","Neil Shigley","In August","August of","of 2009","2009 ,",", Neil","Neil was","was commissioned","commissioned to","to do","do a","a portrait","portrait of","of Dave","Dave using","using his","his '","' Invisible","Invisible People","People '","' motif","motif ,",", which","which includes","includes in","in no","no particular","particular order","order ,",", carving","carving ,",", painting","painting ,",", photography","photography ,",", drawing","drawing ,",", and","and printing","This is","is the","the journey","journey of","of a","a piece","piece of","of art","art ,",", from","from sketches","sketches on","on a","a pad","pad to","to a","a signature","signature in","in the","the corner","corner ,",", that","that also","also helps","helps to","to shed","shed light","light on","on Dave","Dave Rastovich","Rastovich 's","'s environmental","environmental causes","causes along","along with","with Neil","Neil Shigley","Shigley 's","'s helping","helping the","the homeless","homeless endeavors"]}

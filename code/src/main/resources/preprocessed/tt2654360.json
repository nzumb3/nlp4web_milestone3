{"title":"Deceptive Practice: The Mysteries and Mentors of Ricky Jay","plot":"Ricky Jay is a world-renowned magician, author, historian and actor (often a mischievous presence in the films of David Mamet and Paul Thomas Anderson) -- and a performer who regularly provokes astonishment from even the most jaded audiences. Deceptive Practice traces Jay's achievements and influences, from his apprenticeship at age 4 with his grandfather, to such now-forgotten legends as Al Flosso, Slydini, Cardini and his primary mentors, Dai Vernon and Charlie Miller. Featuring rare footage from his 1970s TV appearances (doing 3-card Monte with Steve Martin on The Dinah Shore Show) and told in Jay's inimitable voice, this is a remarkable journey inside the secretive world of magic and the small circle of eccentrics who are its perpetual devotees.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Ricki","Jay","is","a","world-renown","magician",",","author",",","historian","and","actor","(","often","a","mischiev","presenc","in","the","film","of","David","Mamet","and","Paul","Thoma","Anderson",")","--","and","a","perform","who","regular","provok","astonish","from","even","the","most","jade","audienc",".","Decept","Practic","trace","Jay","'s","achiev","and","influenc",",","from","his","apprenticeship","at","age","4","with","his","grandfath",",","to","such","now-forgotten","legend","as","Al","Flosso",",","Slydini",",","Cardini","and","his","primari","mentor",",","Dai","Vernon","and","Charli","Miller",".","Featur","rare","footag","from","his","1970s","TV","appear","(","do","3-card","Mont","with","Steve","Martin","on","The","Dinah","Shore","Show",")","and","told","in","Jay","'s","inimit","voic",",","this","is","a","remark","journey","insid","the","secret","world","of","magic","and","the","small","circl","of","eccentr","who","are","it","perpetu","devote","."],"lemmas":["Ricky","Jay","be","a","world-renowned","magician",",","author",",","historian","and","actor","-lrb-","often","a","mischievous","presence","in","the","film","of","David","Mamet","and","Paul","Thomas","Anderson","-rrb-","--","and","a","performer","who","regularly","provoke","astonishment","from","even","the","most","jaded","audience",".","deceptive","practice","trace","Jay","'s","achievement","and","influence",",","from","he","apprenticeship","at","age","4","with","he","grandfather",",","to","such","now-forgotten","legend","as","Al","Flosso",",","Slydini",",","Cardini","and","he","primary","mentor",",","Dai","Vernon","and","Charlie","Miller",".","feature","rare","footage","from","he","1970s","tv","appearance","-lrb-","do","3-card","Monte","with","Steve","Martin","on","The","Dinah","Shore","Show","-rrb-","and","tell","in","Jay","'s","inimitable","voice",",","this","be","a","remarkable","journey","inside","the","secretive","world","of","magic","and","the","small","circle","of","eccentric","who","be","its","perpetual","devotee","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ricky

{"title":"At Home in Utopia","plot":"During the economic boom of the 1920s, thousands of immigrant Jewish factory workers managed to build the house of their dreams, a cooperative apartment complex at the edge of Bronx Park. Then they were hit by the Great Depression. At Home in Utopia bears witness to an epic social experiment across two generations in the Coops - a place known as \"little Moscow\" - where people tried to change the American dream into one that included racial justice and workers' rights.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Dure","the","econom","boom","of","the","1920s",",","thousand","of","immigr","Jewish","factori","worker","manag","to","build","the","hous","of","their","dream",",","a","cooper","apart","complex","at","the","edg","of","Bronx","Park",".","Then","they","were","hit","by","the","Great","Depress",".","At","Home","in","Utopia","bear","wit","to","an","epic","social","experi","across","two","generat","in","the","Coop","-","a","place","known","as","\"","littl","Moscow","\"","-","where","peopl","tri","to","chang","the","American","dream","into","one","that","includ","racial","justic","and","worker","'","right","."],"lemmas":["during","the","economic","boom","of","the","1920",",","thousand","of","immigrant","jewish","factory","worker","manage","to","build","the","house","of","they","dream",",","a","cooperative","apartment","complex","at","the","edge","of","Bronx","Park",".","then","they","be","hit","by","the","Great","Depression",".","at","Home","in","Utopia","bear","witness","to","a","epic","social","experiment","across","two","generation","in","the","Coops","-","a","place","know","as","``","little","Moscow","''","-","where","people","try","to","change","the","american","dream","into","one","that","include","racial","justice","and","worker","'","rights","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["During the economic","the economic boom","economic boom of","boom of the","of the 1920s","the 1920s ,","1920s , thousands",", thousands of","thousands of immigrant","of immigrant Jewish","immigrant Jewish factory","Jewish factory workers","factory workers managed","workers managed to","managed to build","to build the","build the house","the house of","house of their","of their dreams","their dreams ,","dreams , a",", a cooperative","a cooperative apartment","cooperative apartment complex","apartment complex at","complex at the","at the edge","the edge of","edge of Bronx","of Bronx Park","Then they were","they were hit","were hit by","hit by the","by the Great","the Great Depression","At Home in","Home in Utopia","in Utopia bears","Utopia bears witness","bears witness to","witness to an","to an epic","an epic social","epic social experiment","social experiment across","experiment across two","across two generations","two generations in","generations in the","in the Coops","the Coops -","Coops - a","- a place","a place known","place known as","known as \"","as \" little","\" little Moscow","little Moscow \"","Moscow \" -","\" - where","- where people","where people tried","people tried to","tried to change","to change the","change the American","the American dream","American dream into","dream into one","into one that","one that included","that included racial","included racial justice","racial justice and","justice and workers","and workers '","workers ' rights"],"2grams":["During the","the economic","economic boom","boom of","of the","the 1920s","1920s ,",", thousands","thousands of","of immigrant","immigrant Jewish","Jewish factory","factory workers","workers managed","managed to","to build","build the","the house","house of","of their","their dreams","dreams ,",", a","a cooperative","cooperative apartment","apartment complex","complex at","at the","the edge","edge of","of Bronx","Bronx Park","Then they","they were","were hit","hit by","by the","the Great","Great Depression","At Home","Home in","in Utopia","Utopia bears","bears witness","witness to","to an","an epic","epic social","social experiment","experiment across","across two","two generations","generations in","in the","the Coops","Coops -","- a","a place","place known","known as","as \"","\" little","little Moscow","Moscow \"","\" -","- where","where people","people tried","tried to","to change","change the","the American","American dream","dream into","into one","one that","that included","included racial","racial justice","justice and","and workers","workers '","' rights"]}

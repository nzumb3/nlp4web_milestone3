{"title":"Downside Up","plot":"\"Downside UP\" is about America's largest museum of contemporary art, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (MASS MoCA), which opened in 1999 in an enormous abandoned factory in the filmmaker's hometown, North Adams, Massachusetts. This first person documentary captures the struggle of the people of North Adams in their redefinition of their community and puzzling with their role in an alien form of expression: contemporary art. Told primarily through the eyes of the filmmaker and her family, most of whom worked in the factory before it closed, \"Downside UP\" renders the subtle changes in the spirit of a region from the intimate view of the kitchen table. The film does not cheer-lead. It is about hope, however - the tentative, dangerous notion of hope in a town that was widely viewed as hopeless.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Downsid","UP","\"","is","about","America","'s","largest","museum","of","contemporari","art",",","the","Massachusett","Museum","of","Contemporari","Art","(","MASS","MoCA",")",",","which","open","in","1999","in","an","enorm","abandon","factori","in","the","filmmak","'s","hometown",",","North","Adam",",","Massachusett",".","This","first","person","documentari","captur","the","struggl","of","the","peopl","of","North","Adam","in","their","redefinit","of","their","communiti","and","puzzl","with","their","role","in","an","alien","form","of","express",":","contemporari","art",".","Told","primarili","through","the","eye","of","the","filmmak","and","her","famili",",","most","of","whom","work","in","the","factori","befor","it","close",",","\"","Downsid","UP","\"","render","the","subtl","chang","in","the","spirit","of","a","region","from","the","intim","view","of","the","kitchen","tabl",".","The","film","doe","not","cheer-lead",".","It","is","about","hope",",","howev","-","the","tentat",",","danger","notion","of","hope","in","a","town","that","was","wide","view","as","hopeless","."],"lemmas":["``","downside","up","''","be","about","America","'s","largest","museum","of","contemporary","art",",","the","Massachusetts","Museum","of","Contemporary","Art","-lrb-","MASS","moca","-rrb-",",","which","open","in","1999","in","a","enormous","abandoned","factory","in","the","filmmaker","'s","hometown",",","North","Adams",",","Massachusetts",".","this","first","person","documentary","capture","the","struggle","of","the","people","of","North","Adams","in","they","redefinition","of","they","community","and","puzzling","with","they","role","in","a","alien","form","of","expression",":","contemporary","art",".","tell","primarily","through","the","eye","of","the","filmmaker","and","she","family",",","most","of","whom","work","in","the","factory","before","it","close",",","``","downside","up","''","render","the","subtle","change","in","the","spirit","of","a","region","from","the","intimate","view","of","the","kitchen","table",".","the","film","do","not","cheer-lead",".","it","be","about","hope",",","however","-","the","tentative",",","dangerous","notion","of","hope","in","a","town","that","be","widely","view","as","hopeless","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" Downside UP","Downside UP \"","UP \" is","\" is about","is about America","about America 's","America 's largest","'s largest museum","largest museum of","museum of contemporary","of contemporary art","contemporary art ,","art , the",", the Massachusetts","the Massachusetts Museum","Massachusetts Museum of","Museum of Contemporary","of Contemporary Art","Contemporary Art (","Art ( MASS","( MASS MoCA","MASS MoCA )","MoCA ) ,",") , which",", which opened","which opened in","opened in 1999","in 1999 in","1999 in an","in an enormous","an enormous abandoned","enormous abandoned factory","abandoned factory in","factory in the","in the filmmaker","the filmmaker 's","filmmaker 's hometown","'s hometown ,","hometown , North",", North Adams","North Adams ,","Adams , Massachusetts","This first person","first person documentary","person documentary captures","documentary captures the","captures the struggle","the struggle of","struggle of the","of the people","the people of","people of North","of North Adams","North Adams in","Adams in their","in their redefinition","their redefinition of","redefinition of their","of their community","their community and","community and puzzling","and puzzling with","puzzling with their","with their role","their role in","role in an","in an alien","an alien form","alien form of","form of expression","of expression :","expression : contemporary",": contemporary art","Told primarily through","primarily through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of the","of the filmmaker","the filmmaker and","filmmaker and her","and her family","her family ,","family , most",", most of","most of whom","of whom worked","whom worked in","worked in the","in the factory","the factory before","factory before it","before it closed","it closed ,","closed , \"",", \" Downside","\" Downside UP","Downside UP \"","UP \" renders","\" renders the","renders the subtle","the subtle changes","subtle changes in","changes in the","in the spirit","the spirit of","spirit of a","of a region","a region from","region from the","from the intimate","the intimate view","intimate view of","view of the","of the kitchen","the kitchen table","The film does","film does not","does not cheer-lead","It is about","is about hope","about hope ,","hope , however",", however -","however -

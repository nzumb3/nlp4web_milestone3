{"title":"Love, Marilyn","plot":"Of all the stars in Hollywood's history, no one had a more potent mix of glamor and tragedy than Marilyn Monroe. Through performed readings of her personal papers, this film explores the life and personal thoughts of this seminal movie star and how she achieved her dream with determination and audacity. Furthermore, through additional readings and interviews of her colleagues and acquaintances, we also follow her emotional self-destruction under the sexist pressures of Hollywood until her premature death in 1962.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Of","all","the","star","in","Hollywood","'s","histori",",","no","one","had","a","more","potent","mix","of","glamor","and","tragedi","than","Marilyn","Monro",".","Through","perform","read","of","her","person","paper",",","this","film","explor","the","life","and","person","thought","of","this","semin","movi","star","and","how","she","achiev","her","dream","with","determin","and","audac",".","Furthermor",",","through","addit","read","and","interview","of","her","colleagu","and","acquaint",",","we","also","follow","her","emot","self-destruct","under","the","sexist","pressur","of","Hollywood","until","her","prematur","death","in","1962","."],"lemmas":["of","all","the","star","in","Hollywood","'s","history",",","no","one","have","a","more","potent","mix","of","glamor","and","tragedy","than","Marilyn","Monroe",".","through","perform","reading","of","she","personal","papers",",","this","film","explore","the","life","and","personal","thought","of","this","seminal","movie","star","and","how","she","achieve","she","dream","with","determination","and","audacity",".","furthermore",",","through","additional","reading","and","interview","of","she","colleague","and","acquaintance",",","we","also","follow","she","emotional","self-destruction","under","the","sexist","pressure","of","Hollywood","until","she","premature","death","in","1962","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Of all the","all the stars","the stars in","stars in Hollywood","in Hollywood 's","Hollywood 's history","'s history ,","history , no",", no one","no one had","one had a","had a more","a more potent","more potent mix","potent mix of","mix of glamor","of glamor and","glamor and tragedy","and tragedy than","tragedy than Marilyn","than Marilyn Monroe","Through performed readings","performed readings of","readings of her","of her personal","her personal papers","personal papers ,","papers , this",", this film","this film explores","film explores the","explores the life","the life and","life and personal","and personal thoughts","personal thoughts of","thoughts of this","of this seminal","this seminal movie","seminal movie star","movie star and","star and how","and how she","how she achieved","she achieved her","achieved her dream","her dream with","dream with determination","with determination and","determination and audacity","Furthermore , through",", through additional","through additional readings","additional readings and","readings and interviews","and interviews of","interviews of her","of her colleagues","her colleagues and","colleagues and acquaintances","and acquaintances ,","acquaintances , we",", we also","we also follow","also follow her","follow her emotional","her emotional self-destruction","emotional self-destruction under","self-destruction under the","under the sexist","the sexist pressures","sexist pressures of","pressures of Hollywood","of Hollywood until","Hollywood until her","until her premature","her premature death","premature death in","death in 1962"],"2grams":["Of all","all the","the stars","stars in","in Hollywood","Hollywood 's","'s history","history ,",", no","no one","one had","had a","a more","more potent","potent mix","mix of","of glamor","glamor and","and tragedy","tragedy than","than Marilyn","Marilyn Monroe","Through performed","performed readings","readings of","of her","her personal","personal papers","papers ,",", this","this film","film explores","explores the","the life","life and","and personal","personal thoughts","thoughts of","of this","this seminal","seminal movie","movie star","star and","and how","how she","she achieved","achieved her","her dream","dream with","with determination","determination and","and audacity","Furthermore ,",", through","through additional","additional readings","readings and","and interviews","interviews of","of her","her colleagues","colleagues and","and acquaintances","acquaintances ,",", we","we also","also follow","follow her","her emotional","emotional self-destruction","self-destruction under","under the","the sexist","sexist pressures","pressures of","of Hollywood","Hollywood until","until her","her premature","premature death","death in","in 1962"]}

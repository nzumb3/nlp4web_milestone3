When Professor Jackson's colleague and best friend Dr. Frasier (Mike Mason) doesn't return from a scientific expedition in the deep woods, the Professor is sent to find and retrieve him. While searching, the Professor and Canoe Cops Sven (M. Scott Taulman) and Gustav (Mike Cook) stumble upon an enigmatic meteorite that may hold the answer to Dr. Frasier's disappearance - and something far more cataclysmic than they could ever imagine!

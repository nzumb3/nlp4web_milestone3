{"title":"Theatre of the Deranged","plot":"Andy the Arsonist wishes you the warmest of welcomes to his Theatre Of The Deranged for a wild night of thrills, chills and spills. Under the eerie light of his dusty projector, your host and resident pyromaniac will treat you to five short films from some of the best horror writer/directors in the indie scene. He'll take you on a demented adventure across the English countryside, through surreal backyards and nightmarish homemade homicides, only to be eaten alive by award-winning adult film sensation Sophie Dee. But first, for the sickest of amusements, he'll pay your admission to a sinister carnival along with horror legend Shawn C. Phillips. As you witness fortunes told and fates sealed, you'll wonder when this dark, mysterious venue opened for business, and whether you'll ever escape.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["Andi","the","Arsonist","wish","you","the","warmest","of","welcom","to","his","Theatr","Of","The","Derang","for","a","wild","night","of","thrill",",","chill","and","spill",".","Under","the","eeri","light","of","his","dusti","projector",",","your","host","and","resid","pyromaniac","will","treat","you","to","five","short","film","from","some","of","the","best","horror","writer/director","in","the","indi","scene",".","He","ll","take","you","on","a","dement","adventur","across","the","English","countrysid",",","through","surreal","backyard","and","nightmarish","homemad","homicid",",","onli","to","be","eaten","aliv","by","award-win","adult","film","sensat","Sophi","Dee",".","But","first",",","for","the","sickest","of","amus",",","he","ll","pay","your","admiss","to","a","sinist","carniv","along","with","horror","legend","Shawn","C.","Phillip",".","As","you","wit","fortun","told","and","fate","seal",",","you","ll","wonder","when","this","dark",",","mysteri","venu","open","for","busi",",","and","whether","you","ll","ever","escap","."],"lemmas":["Andy","the","Arsonist","wish","you","the","warmest","of","welcome","to","he","Theatre","of","the","Deranged","for","a","wild","night","of","thrill",",","chill","and","spill",".","under","the","eerie","light","of","he","dusty","projector",",","you","host","and","resident","pyromaniac","will","treat","you","to","five","short","film","from","some","of","the","best","horror","writer/directors","in","the","indie","scene",".","he","will","take","you","on","a","demented","adventure","across","the","English","countryside",",","through","surreal","backyard","and","nightmarish","homemade","homicide",",","only","to","be","eat","alive","by","award-winning","adult","film","sensation","Sophie","Dee",".","but","first",",","for","the","sickest","of","amusement",",","he","will","pay","you","admission","to","a","sinister","carnival","along","with","horror","legend","Shawn","C.","Phillips",".","as","you","witness","fortune","tell","and","fate","sealed",",","you","will","wonder","when","this","dark",",","mysterious","venue","open","for","business",",","and","whether","you","will","ever","escape","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Andy the Arsonist","the Arsonist wishes","Arsonist wishes you","wishes you the","you the warmest","the warmest of","warmest of welcomes","of welcomes to","welcomes to his","to his Theatre","his Theatre Of","Theatre Of The","Of The Deranged","The Deranged for","Deranged for a","for a wild","a wild night","wild night of","night of thrills","of thrills ,","thrills , chills",", chills and","chills and spills","Under the eerie","the eerie light","eerie light of","light of his","of his dusty","his dusty projector","dusty projector ,","projector , your",", your host","your host and","host and resident","and resident pyromaniac","resident pyromaniac will","pyromaniac will treat","will treat you","treat you to","you to five","to five short","five short films","short films from","films from some","from some of","some of the","of the best","the best horror","best horror writer/directors","horror writer/directors in","writer/directors in the","in the indie","the indie scene","He 'll take","'ll take you","take you on","you on a","on a demented","a demented adventure","demented adventure across","adventure across the","across the English","the English countryside","English countryside ,","countryside , through",", through surreal","through surreal backyards","surreal backyards and","backyards and nightmarish","and nightmarish homemade","nightmarish homemade homicides","homemade homicides ,","homicides , only",", only to","only to be","to be eaten","be eaten alive","eaten alive by","alive by award-winning","by award-winning adult","award-winning adult film","adult film sensation","film sensation Sophie","sensation Sophie Dee","But first ,","first , for",", for the","for the sickest","the sickest of","sickest of amusements","of amusements ,","amusements , he",", he 'll","he 'll pay","'ll pay your","pay your admission","your admission to","admission to a","to a sinister","a sinister carnival","sinister carnival along","carnival along with","along with horror","with horror legend","horror legend Shawn","legend Shawn C.","Shawn C.

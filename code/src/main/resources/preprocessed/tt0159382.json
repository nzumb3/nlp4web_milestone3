{"title":"Croupier","plot":"Jack Manfred is an aspiring writer going nowhere fast. To make ends meet, and against his better judgement, he takes a job as a croupier. He finds himself drawn into the casino world and the job gradually takes over his life; his relationship with girlfriend Marion begins to deteriorate. One gambler in particular catches his attention: Jani, whom he starts to see outside of working hours - a serious violation of casino rules. Jani is down on her luck; under pressure from her creditors she approaches Jack, asking him to be the inside man for a planned heist at the casino. Jack carefully considers the odds; it all looks so simple, but even a professional like Jack can't predict the cards he will be dealt.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Jack","Manfr","is","an","aspir","writer","go","nowher","fast",".","To","make","end","meet",",","and","against","his","better","judgement",",","he","take","a","job","as","a","croupier",".","He","find","himself","drawn","into","the","casino","world","and","the","job","gradual","take","over","his","life",";","his","relationship","with","girlfriend","Marion","begin","to","deterior",".","One","gambler","in","particular","catch","his","attent",":","Jani",",","whom","he","start","to","see","outsid","of","work","hour","-","a","serious","violat","of","casino","rule",".","Jani","is","down","on","her","luck",";","under","pressur","from","her","creditor","she","approach","Jack",",","ask","him","to","be","the","insid","man","for","a","plan","heist","at","the","casino",".","Jack","care","consid","the","odd",";","it","all","look","so","simpl",",","but","even","a","profession","like","Jack","ca","n't","predict","the","card","he","will","be","dealt","."],"lemmas":["Jack","Manfred","be","a","aspiring","writer","go","nowhere","fast",".","to","make","end","meet",",","and","against","he","better","judgement",",","he","take","a","job","as","a","croupier",".","he","find","himself","draw","into","the","casino","world","and","the","job","gradually","take","over","he","life",";","he","relationship","with","girlfriend","Marion","begin","to","deteriorate",".","one","gambler","in","particular","catch","he","attention",":","Jani",",","whom","he","start","to","see","outside","of","work","hour","-","a","serious","violation","of","casino","rule",".","Jani","be","down","on","she","luck",";","under","pressure","from","she","creditor","she","approach","Jack",",","ask","he","to","be","the","inside","man","for","a","planned","heist","at","the","casino",".","Jack","carefully","consider","the","odds",";","it","all","look","so","simple",",","but","even","a","professional","like","Jack","can","not","predict","the","card","he","will","be","deal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jack Manfred is","Manfred is an","is an aspiring","an aspiring writer","aspiring writer going","writer going nowhere","going nowhere fast","To make ends","make ends meet","ends meet ,","meet , and",", and against","and against his","against his better","his better judgement","better judgement ,","judgement , he",", he takes","he takes a","takes a job","a job as","job as a","as a croupier","He finds himself","finds himself drawn","himself drawn into","drawn into the","into the casino","the casino world","casino world and","world and the","and the job","the job gradually","job gradually takes","gradually takes over","takes over his","over his life","his life ;","life ;

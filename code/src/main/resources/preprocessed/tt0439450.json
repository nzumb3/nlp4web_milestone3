{"title":"Channels of Rage","plot":"This documentary tells the story of the arms-length relationship between the Jewish-Israeli rapper Subliminal and the Arab-Israeli rapper Tamer Nafar. Both are pioneers in Israeli rap music, but from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Subliminal presents a nationalistic Jewish message against Arab violence and terrorism, while Tamer's songs are about Palestinian oppression under the Israeli occupation and the hardships of Arab-Israeli life within Israel.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["This","documentari","tell","the","stori","of","the","arms-length","relationship","between","the","Jewish-Isra","rapper","Sublimin","and","the","Arab-Isra","rapper","Tamer","Nafar",".","Both","are","pioneer","in","Israeli","rap","music",",","but","from","opposit","end","of","the","polit","spectrum",".","Sublimin","present","a","nationalist","Jewish","messag","against","Arab","violenc","and","terror",",","while","Tamer","'s","song","are","about","Palestinian","oppress","under","the","Israeli","occup","and","the","hardship","of","Arab-Isra","life","within","Israel","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","tell","the","story","of","the","arms-length","relationship","between","the","jewish-israeli","rapper","subliminal","and","the","arab-israeli","rapper","Tamer","Nafar",".","both","be","pioneer","in","israeli","rap","music",",","but","from","opposite","end","of","the","political","spectrum",".","subliminal","present","a","nationalistic","jewish","message","against","Arab","violence","and","terrorism",",","while","Tamer","'s","song","be","about","palestinian","oppression","under","the","israeli","occupation","and","the","hardship","of","arab-israeli","life","within","Israel","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary tells","documentary tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of the","of the arms-length","the arms-length relationship","arms-length relationship between","relationship between the","between the Jewish-Israeli","the Jewish-Israeli rapper","Jewish-Israeli rapper Subliminal","rapper Subliminal and","Subliminal and the","and the Arab-Israeli","the Arab-Israeli rapper","Arab-Israeli rapper Tamer","rapper Tamer Nafar","Both are pioneers","are pioneers in","pioneers in Israeli","in Israeli rap","Israeli rap music","rap music ,","music , but",", but from","but from opposite","from opposite ends","opposite ends of","ends of the","of the political","the political spectrum","Subliminal presents a","presents a nationalistic","a nationalistic Jewish","nationalistic Jewish message","Jewish message against","message against Arab","against Arab violence","Arab violence and","violence and terrorism","and terrorism ,","terrorism , while",", while Tamer","while Tamer 's","Tamer 's songs","'s songs are","songs are about","are about Palestinian","about Palestinian oppression","Palestinian oppression under","oppression under the","under the Israeli","the Israeli occupation","Israeli occupation and","occupation and the","and the hardships","the hardships of","hardships of Arab-Israeli","of Arab-Israeli life","Arab-Israeli life within","life within Israel"],"2grams":["This documentary","documentary tells","tells the","the story","story of","of the","the arms-length","arms-length relationship","relationship between","between the","the Jewish-Israeli","Jewish-Israeli rapper","rapper Subliminal","Subliminal and","and the","the Arab-Israeli","Arab-Israeli rapper","rapper Tamer","Tamer Nafar","Both are","are pioneers","pioneers in","in Israeli","Israeli rap","rap music","music ,",", but","but from","from opposite","opposite ends","ends of","of the","the political","political spectrum","Subliminal presents","presents a","a nationalistic","nationalistic Jewish","Jewish message","message against","against Arab","Arab violence","violence and","and terrorism","terrorism ,",", while","while Tamer","Tamer 's","'s songs","songs are","are about","about Palestinian","Palestinian oppression","oppression under","under the","the Israeli","Israeli occupation","occupation and","and the","the hardships","hardships of","of Arab-Israeli","Arab-Israeli life","life within","within Israel"]}

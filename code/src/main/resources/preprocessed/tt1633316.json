{"title":"Tales from the Land of Ovens","plot":"An ordinary title and an extraordinary story. These tales were secretly written by 30 prisoners of Auschwitz Concentration Camp. For their own children. They also illustrated them beautifully. These tales are the subject of the film. The concentration camp was so full of evil that one could start doubting the existence of good. But it survived, if only in seemingly trivial booklets about little chicks and flowers. There were about thirty daring men who wrote and illustrated them in the proximity of crematorium chimneys. That was when they decided to create tales for their children. These tales kept them alive. One of these prisoners was a director`s father.","genres":["Documentary","

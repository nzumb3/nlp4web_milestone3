{"title":"Slaughter","plot":"Faith is a young woman who is on the run from an abusive boyfriend, and who settles in Atlanta to make a new life for herself. While settling down, Faith meets Lola, a free spirited young woman who lives on a nearby rural farm with her family - her distant father, older brother, and younger brother. Faith moves in with Lola, who resides in the nearby barn on the farm, to help out with farm work. Every night, the two young women go into the city to party, and Lola brings home a different man to be with. But when the men start disappearing, Faith begins to suspect that Lola's family is killing the strangers in the nearby slaughter house they keep on the farm, and her quest for the truth uncovers some very disturbing facts about Lola's childhood that she seeks to keep a secret at ANY cost.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Faith","is","a","young","woman","who","is","on","the","run","from","an","abus","boyfriend",",","and","who","settl","in","Atlanta","to","make","a","new","life","for","herself",".","While","settl","down",",","Faith","meet","Lola",",","a","free","spirit","young","woman","who","live","on","a","nearbi","rural","farm","with","her","famili","-","her","distant","father",",","older","brother",",","and","younger","brother",".","Faith","move","in","with","Lola",",","who","resid","in","the","nearbi","barn","on","the","farm",",","to","help","out","with","farm","work",".","Everi","night",",","the","two","young","women","go","into","the","citi","to","parti",",","and","Lola","bring","home","a","differ","man","to","be","with",".","But","when","the","men","start","disappear",",","Faith","begin","to","suspect","that","Lola","'s","famili","is","kill","the","stranger","in","the","nearbi","slaughter","hous","they","keep","on","the","farm",",","and","her","quest","for","the","truth","uncov","some","veri","disturb","fact","about","Lola","'s","childhood","that","she","seek","to","keep","a","secret","at","ANi","cost","."],"lemmas":["faith","be","a","young","woman","who","be","on","the","run","from","a","abusive","boyfriend",",","and","who","settle","in","Atlanta","to","make","a","new","life","for","herself",".","while","settle","down",",","faith","meet","Lola",",","a","free","spirited","young","woman","who","live","on","a","nearby","rural","farm","with","she","family","-","she","distant","father",",","older","brother",",","and","younger","brother",".","faith","move","in","with","Lola",",","who","reside","in","the","nearby","barn","on","the","farm",",","to","help","out","with","farm","work",".","every","night",",","the","two","young","woman","go","into","the","city","to","party",",","and","Lola","bring","home","a","different","man","to","be","with",".","but","when","the","man","start","disappear",",","faith","begin","to","suspect","that","Lola","'s","family","be","kill","the","stranger","in","the","nearby","slaughter","house","they","keep","on","the","farm",",","and","she","quest","for","the","truth","uncover","some","very","disturbing","fact","about","Lola","'s","childhood","that","she","seek","to","keep","a","secret","at","any","cost","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Faith is a","is a young","a young woman","young woman who","woman who is","who is on","is on the","on the run","the run from","run from an","from an abusive","an abusive boyfriend","abusive boyfriend ,","boyfriend , and",", and who","and who settles","who settles in","settles in Atlanta","in Atlanta to","Atlanta to make","to make a","make a new","a new life","new life for","life for herself","While settling down","settling down ,","down , Faith",", Faith meets","Faith meets Lola","meets Lola ,","Lola , a",", a free","a free spirited","free spirited young","spirited young woman","young woman who","woman who lives","who lives on","lives on a","on a nearby","a nearby rural","nearby rural farm","rural farm with","farm with her","with her family","her family -","family -

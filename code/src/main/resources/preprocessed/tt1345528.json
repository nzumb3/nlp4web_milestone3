{"title":"No Escape from the Shadow","plot":"A young lawyer (Helena Dvoráková) receives a shocking task: her grandmother (Jaroslava Adamová) requests her to file divorce proceedings to dissolve her 60-year marriage from her grandfather (Pavel Landovský), who together with her helped raise the heroine in love and harmony. She does not wish to grant this request, but her grandmother is uncompromising. What is the strong reason? And why now? She proceeds as a detective, step-by-step, until finding the destructive power of long-past guilt. The marriage, lasting sixty years in spite of being affected by the tragedies of national intolerance, conceals a secret that is ultimately revealed.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","young","lawyer","(","Helena","Dvoráková",")","receiv","a","shock","task",":","her","grandmoth","(","Jaroslava","Adamová",")","request","her","to","file","divorc","proceed","to","dissolv","her","60-year","marriag","from","her","grandfath","(","Pavel","Landovský",")",",","who","togeth","with","her","help","rais","the","heroin","in","love","and","harmoni",".","She","doe","not","wish","to","grant","this","request",",","but","her","grandmoth","is","uncompromis",".","What","is","the","strong","reason","?","And","whi","now","?","She","proceed","as","a","detect",",","step-by-step",",","until","find","the","destruct","power","of","long-past","guilt",".","The","marriag",",","last","sixti","year","in","spite","of","be","affect","by","the","tragedi","of","nation","intoler",",","conceal","a","secret","that","is","ultim","reveal","."],"lemmas":["a","young","lawyer","-lrb-","Helena","Dvoráková","-rrb-","receive","a","shocking","task",":","she","grandmother","-lrb-","Jaroslava","Adamová","-rrb-","request","she","to","file","divorce","proceedings","to","dissolve","she","60-year","marriage","from","she","grandfather","-lrb-","Pavel","Landovský","-rrb-",",","who","together","with","she","help","raise","the","heroine","in","love","and","harmony",".","she","do","not","wish","to","grant","this","request",",","but","she","grandmother","be","uncompromising",".","what","be","the","strong","reason","?","and","why","now","?","she","proceed","as","a","detective",",","step-by-step",",","until","find","the","destructive","power","of","long-past","guilt",".","the","marriage",",","last","sixty","year","in","spite","of","be","affect","by","the","tragedy","of","national","intolerance",",","conceal","a","secret","that","be","ultimately","reveal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

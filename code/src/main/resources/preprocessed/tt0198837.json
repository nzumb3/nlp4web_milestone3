After the smoke has cleared, one robber, shot by his accomplice, and an innocent bystander, are dead. Three witnesses, including Helen, identify thug extraordinaire Leo Gaut as being the dead crook's trigger-happy colleague. Gaut soon threatens the three witnesses, and only Johan, the badge-wearing hero, can save them.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Crime"],"stems":["Johan","is","a","two-fist","Gothenburg","cop","who","find","himself","in","a","shoot-out","with","jewel","robber",".","After","the","smoke","has","clear",",","one","robber",",","shot","by","his","accomplic",",","and","an","innoc","bystand",",","are","dead",".","Three","wit",",","includ","Helen",",","identifi","thug","extraordinair","Leo","Gaut","as","be","the","dead","crook","'s","trigger-happi","colleagu",".","Gaut","soon","threaten","the","three","wit",",","and","onli","Johan",",","the","badge-wear","hero",",","can","save","them","."],"lemmas":["Johan","be","a","two-fisted","Gothenburg","cop","who","find","himself","in","a","shoot-out","with","jewel","robber",".","after","the","smoke","have","clear",",","one","robber",",","shoot","by","he","accomplice",",","and","a","innocent","bystander",",","be","dead",".","three","witness",",","include","Helen",",","identify","thug","extraordinaire","Leo","Gaut","as","be","the","dead","crook","'s","trigger-happy","colleague",".","Gaut","soon","threaten","the","three","witness",",","and","only","Johan",",","the","badge-wearing","hero",",","can","save","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Johan is a","is a two-fisted","a two-fisted Gothenburg","two-fisted Gothenburg cop","Gothenburg cop who","cop who finds","who finds himself","finds himself in","himself in a","in a shoot-out","a shoot-out with","shoot-out with jewel","with jewel robbers","After the smoke","the smoke has","smoke has cleared","has cleared ,","cleared , one",", one robber","one robber ,","robber , shot",", shot by","shot by his","by his accomplice","his accomplice ,","accomplice , and",", and an","and an innocent","an innocent bystander","innocent bystander ,","bystander , are",", are dead","Three witnesses ,","witnesses , including",", including Helen","including Helen ,","Helen , identify",", identify thug","identify thug extraordinaire","thug extraordinaire Leo","extraordinaire Leo Gaut","Leo Gaut as","Gaut as being","as being the","being the dead","the dead crook","dead crook 's","crook 's trigger-happy","'s trigger-happy colleague","Gaut soon threatens","soon threatens the","threatens the three","the three witnesses","three witnesses ,","witnesses , and",", and only","and only Johan","only Johan ,","Johan , the",", the badge-wearing","the badge-wearing hero","badge-wearing hero ,","hero , can",", can save","can save them"],"2grams":["Johan is","is a","a two-fisted","two-fisted Gothenburg","Gothenburg cop","cop who","who finds","finds himself","himself in","in a","a shoot-out","shoot-out with","with jewel","jewel robbers","After the","the smoke","smoke has","has cleared","cleared ,",", one","one robber","robber ,",", shot","shot by","by his","his accomplice","accomplice ,",", and","and an","an innocent","innocent bystander","bystander ,",", are","are dead","Three witnesses","witnesses ,",", including","including Helen","Helen ,",", identify","identify thug","thug extraordinaire","extraordinaire Leo","Leo Gaut","Gaut as","as being","being the","the dead","dead crook","crook 's","'s trigger-happy","trigger-happy colleague","Gaut soon","soon threatens","threatens the","the three","three witnesses","witnesses ,",", and","and only","only Johan","Johan ,",", the","the badge-wearing","badge-wearing hero","hero ,",", can","can save","save them"]}

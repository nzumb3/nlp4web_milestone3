{"title":"Skinning the Cat","plot":"Ned is a frustrated man with a troubled background. Early one summer morning, he kidnaps Bruce, a successful business man used to getting what he wants. Ned takes Bruce to an abandoned warehouse and begins an interrogation that reveals deep secrets kept by both men. They are both changed by their time together, but neither knows if this change is for the better or not. Skinning the Cat is about taking responsibility for the past. Whether it was something we did, or had done to us, can we come to terms with what has happened and move forward? Skinning the Cat offers no answers, only possibilities.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Ned","is","a","frustrat","man","with","a","troubl","background",".","Ear","one","summer","morn",",","he","kidnap","Bruce",",","a","success","busi","man","use","to","get","what","he","want",".","Ned","take","Bruce","to","an","abandon","warehous","and","begin","an","interrog","that","reveal","deep","secret","kept","by","both","men",".","They","are","both","chang","by","their","time","togeth",",","but","neither","know","if","this","chang","is","for","the","better","or","not",".","Skin","the","Cat","is","about","take","respons","for","the","past",".","Whether","it","was","someth","we","did",",","or","had","done","to","us",",","can","we","come","to","term","with","what","has","happen","and","move","forward","?","Skin","the","Cat","offer","no","answer",",","onli","possibl","."],"lemmas":["Ned","be","a","frustrated","man","with","a","troubled","background",".","early","one","summer","morning",",","he","kidnap","Bruce",",","a","successful","business","man","use","to","get","what","he","want",".","Ned","take","Bruce","to","a","abandoned","warehouse","and","begin","a","interrogation","that","reveal","deep","secret","keep","by","both","man",".","they","be","both","change","by","they","time","together",",","but","neither","know","if","this","change","be","for","the","better","or","not",".","skin","the","cat","be","about","take","responsibility","for","the","past",".","whether","it","be","something","we","do",",","or","have","do","to","we",",","can","we","come","to","term","with","what","have","happen","and","move","forward","?","skin","the","cat","offer","no","answer",",","only","possibility","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ned is a","is a frustrated","a frustrated man","frustrated man with","man with a","with a troubled","a troubled background","Early one summer","one summer morning","summer morning ,","morning , he",", he kidnaps","he kidnaps Bruce","kidnaps Bruce ,","Bruce , a",", a successful","a successful business","successful business man","business man used","man used to","used to getting","to getting what","getting what he","what he wants","Ned takes Bruce","takes Bruce to","Bruce to an","to an abandoned","an abandoned warehouse","abandoned warehouse and","warehouse and begins","and begins an","begins an interrogation","an interrogation that","interrogation that reveals","that reveals deep","reveals deep secrets","deep secrets kept","secrets kept by","kept by both","by both men","They are both","are both changed","both changed by","changed by their","by their time","their time together","time together ,","together , but",", but neither","but neither knows","neither knows if","knows if this","if this change","this change is","change is for","is for the","for the better","the better or","better or not","Skinning the Cat","the Cat is","Cat is about","is about taking","about taking responsibility","taking responsibility for","responsibility for the","for the past","Whether it was","it was something","was something we","something we did","we did ,","did , or",", or had","or had done","had done to","done to us","to us ,","us , can",", can we","can we come","we come to","come to terms","to terms with","terms with what","with what has","what has happened","has happened and","happened and move","and move forward","Skinning the Cat","the Cat offers","Cat offers no","offers no answers","no answers ,","answers , only",", only possibilities"],"2grams":["Ned is","is a","a frustrated","frustrated man","man with","with a","a troubled","troubled background","Early one","one summer","summer morning","morning ,",", he","he kidnaps","kidnaps Bruce","Bruce ,",", a","a successful","successful business","business man","man used","used to","to getting","getting what","what he","he wants","Ned takes","takes Bruce","Bruce to","to an","an abandoned","abandoned warehouse","warehouse and","and begins","begins an","an interrogation","interrogation that","that reveals","reveals deep","deep secrets","secrets kept","kept by","by both","both men","They are","are both","both changed","changed by","by their","their time","time together","together ,",", but","but neither","neither knows","knows if","if this","this change","change is","is for","for the","the better","better or","or not","Skinning the","the Cat","Cat is","is about","about taking","taking responsibility","responsibility for","for the","the past","Whether it","it was","was something","something we","we did","did ,",", or","or had","had done","done to","to us","us ,",", can","can we","we come","come to","to terms","terms with","with what","what has","has happened","happened and","and move","move forward","Skinning the","the Cat","Cat offers","offers no","no answers","answers ,",", only","only possibilities"]}

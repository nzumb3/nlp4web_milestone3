{"title":"The Early Years: Erik Nietzsche Part 1","plot":"Erik Nietzsche is an intelligent but in many ways inexperienced shy young man who is convinced that he wants to be a film director. In the late 1970s, Erik is accepted by the Danish National Film School where he enters a world of angry and unhelpful tutors, weird fellow students and unwritten rules. In this both exhilarating and angst-provoking period for him, Erik feels increasingly like a foreigner in the film industry. Frequently, he is merely an observer of the absurdities that surround him. He encounters trade union disputes, falls in love and experiences self-assured empowered women who refuse to make a commitment. The film is a drama full of comedy - a sharp portrait of a conceited but entertaining world of film which we suspect our dogged young director will eventually conquer with his vision.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Erik","Nietzsch","is","an","intellig","but","in","mani","way","inexperienc","shi","young","man","who","is","convinc","that","he","want","to","be","a","film","director",".","In","the","late","1970s",",","Erik","is","accept","by","the","Danish","Nation","Film","School","where","he","enter","a","world","of","angri","and","unhelp","tutor",",","weird","fellow","student","and","unwritten","rule",".","In","this","both","exhilar","and","angst-provok","period","for","him",",","Erik","feel","increas","like","a","foreign","in","the","film","industri",".","Frequent",",","he","is","mere","an","observ","of","the","absurd","that","surround","him",".","He","encount","trade","union","disput",",","fall","in","love","and","experi","self-assur","empow","women","who","refus","to","make","a","commit",".","The","film","is","a","drama","full","of","comedi","-","a","sharp","portrait","of","a","conceit","but","entertain","world","of","film","which","we","suspect","our","dog","young","director","will","eventu","conquer","with","his","vision","."],"lemmas":["Erik","Nietzsche","be","a","intelligent","but","in","many","way","inexperienced","shy","young","man","who","be","convinced","that","he","want","to","be","a","film","director",".","in","the","late","1970",",","Erik","be","accept","by","the","danish","National","Film","School","where","he","enter","a","world","of","angry","and","unhelpful","tutor",",","weird","fellow","student","and","unwritten","rule",".","in","this","both","exhilarating","and","angst-provoking","period","for","he",",","Erik","feel","increasingly","like","a","foreigner","in","the","film","industry",".","frequently",",","he","be","merely","a","observer","of","the","absurdity","that","surround","he",".","he","encounter","trade","union","dispute",",","fall","in","love","and","experience","self-assured","empower","woman","who","refuse","to","make","a","commitment",".","the","film","be","a","drama","full","of","comedy","-","a","sharp","portrait","of","a","conceited","but","entertaining","world","of","film","which","we","suspect","we","dogged","young","director","will","eventually","conquer","with","he","vision","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Erik Nietzsche is","Nietzsche is an","is an intelligent","an intelligent but","intelligent but in","but in many","in many ways","many ways inexperienced","ways inexperienced shy","inexperienced shy young","shy young man","young man who","man who is","who is convinced","is convinced that","convinced that he","that he wants","he wants to","wants to be","to be a","be a film","a film director","In the late","the late 1970s","late 1970s ,","1970s , Erik",", Erik is","Erik is accepted","is accepted by","accepted by the","by the Danish","the Danish National","Danish National Film","National Film School","Film School where","School where he","where he enters","he enters a","enters a world","a world of","world of angry","of angry and","angry and unhelpful","and unhelpful tutors","unhelpful tutors ,","tutors , weird",", weird fellow","weird fellow students","fellow students and","students and unwritten","and unwritten rules","In this both","this both exhilarating","both exhilarating and","exhilarating and angst-provoking","and angst-provoking period","angst-provoking period for","period for him","for him ,","him , Erik",", Erik feels","Erik feels increasingly","feels increasingly like","increasingly like a","like a foreigner","a foreigner in","foreigner in the","in the film","the film industry","Frequently , he",", he is","he is merely","is merely an","merely an observer","an observer of","observer of the","of the absurdities","the absurdities that","absurdities that surround","that surround him","He encounters trade","encounters trade union","trade union disputes","union disputes ,","disputes , falls",", falls in","falls in love","in love and","love and experiences","and experiences self-assured","experiences self-assured empowered","self-assured empowered women","empowered women who","women who refuse","who refuse to","refuse to make","to make a","make a commitment","The film is","film is a","is a drama","a drama full","drama full of","full of comedy","of comedy -","comedy -

{"title":"The Theatre Bizarre","plot":"Down a seedy city street in her neighborhood, young Enola Penny is obsessed with what appears to be a long abandoned theatre. One night, she sees that the front door is slightly ajar and impulsively decides to sneak inside. But there in the dark, decrepit auditorium, a show unlike any other unfolds before her eyes. Its host is an eerie human puppet named Peg Poett who will introduce Penny to six tales of the bizarre: A couple traveling in a remote part of the French Pyrenees cross paths with a lustful witch; A paranoid lover faces the wrath of a partner who has been pushed to her limit; The Freudian dreams of an unfaithful husband blur the lines between fantasy and reality; The horrors of the real world are interpreted through the mind of a child; A woman addicted to other people's memories gets her fix through the vitreous fluid of her victims' eyeballs; And a perverse obsession with sweets turns sour for a couple in too deep. But as the stories unfold, something much stranger is happening to Enola. Something irreversible and horrific. Something that awaits its next audience in THE THEATRE BIZARRE.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Down","a","seedi","citi","street","in","her","neighborhood",",","young","Enola","Penni","is","obsess","with","what","appear","to","be","a","long","abandon","theatr",".","One","night",",","she","see","that","the","front","door","is","slight","ajar","and","impuls","decid","to","sneak","insid",".","But","there","in","the","dark",",","decrepit","auditorium",",","a","show","unlik","ani","other","unfold","befor","her","eye",".","Its","host","is","an","eeri","human","puppet","name","Peg","Poett","who","will","introduc","Penni","to","six","tale","of","the","bizarr",":","A","coupl","travel","in","a","remot","part","of","the","French","Pyrene","cross","path","with","a","lust","witch",";","A","paranoid","lover","face","the","wrath","of","a","partner","who","has","been","push","to","her","limit",";","The","Freudian","dream","of","an","unfaith","husband","blur","the","line","between","fantasi","and","realiti",";","The","horror","of","the","real","world","are","interpret","through","the","mind","of","a","child",";","A","woman","addict","to","other","peopl","'s","memori","get","her","fix","through","the","vitreous","fluid","of","her","victim","'","eyebal",";","And","a","pervers","obsess","with","sweet","turn","sour","for","a","coupl","in","too","deep",".","But","as","the","stori","unfold",",","someth","much","stranger","is","happen","to","Enola",".","Someth","irrevers","and","horrif",".","Someth","that","await","it","next","audienc","in","THE","THEATRE","BIZARRE","."],"lemmas":["down","a","seedy","city","street","in","she","neighborhood",",","young","enola","penny","be","obsess","with","what","appear","to","be","a","long","abandoned","theatre",".","one","night",",","she","see","that","the","front","door","be","slightly","ajar","and","impulsively","decide","to","sneak","inside",".","but","there","in","the","dark",",","decrepit","auditorium",",","a","show","unlike","any","other","unfold","before","she","eye",".","its","host","be","a","eerie","human","puppet","name","Peg","Poett","who","will","introduce","Penny","to","six","tale","of","the","bizarre",":","a","couple","travel","in","a","remote","part","of","the","French","Pyrenees","cross","path","with","a","lustful","witch",";","a","paranoid","lover","face","the","wrath","of","a","partner","who","have","be","push","to","she","limit",";","the","freudian","dream","of","a","unfaithful","husband","blur","the","line","between","fantasy","and","reality",";","the","horror","of","the","real","world","be","interpret","through","the","mind","of","a","child",";","a","woman","addict","to","other","people","'s","memory","get","she","fix","through","the","vitreous","fluid","of","she","victim","'","eyeball",";","and","a","perverse","obsession","with","sweet","turn","sour","for","a","couple","in","too","deep",".","but","as","the","story","unfold",",","something","much","stranger","be","happen","to","enola",".","something","irreversible","and","horrific",".","something","that","await","its","next","audience","in","the","THEATRE","BIZARRE","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Down a seedy","a seedy city","seedy city street","city street in","street in her","in her neighborhood","her neighborhood ,","neighborhood , young",", young Enola","young Enola Penny","Enola Penny is","Penny is obsessed","is obsessed with","obsessed with what","with what appears","what appears to","appears to be","to be a","be a long","a long abandoned","long abandoned theatre","One night ,","night , she",", she sees","she sees that","sees that the","that the front","the front door","front door is","door is slightly","is slightly ajar","slightly ajar and","ajar and impulsively","and impulsively decides","impulsively decides to","decides to sneak","to sneak inside","But there in","there in the","in the dark","the dark ,","dark , decrepit",", decrepit auditorium","decrepit auditorium ,","auditorium , a",", a show","a show unlike","show unlike any","unlike any other","any other unfolds","other unfolds before","unfolds before her","before her eyes","Its host is","host is an","is an eerie","an eerie human","eerie human puppet","human puppet named","puppet named Peg","named Peg Poett","Peg Poett who","Poett who will","who will introduce","will introduce Penny","introduce Penny to","Penny to six","to six tales","six tales of","tales of the","of the bizarre","the bizarre :","bizarre : A",": A couple","A couple traveling","couple traveling in","traveling in a","in a remote","a remote part","remote part of","part of the","of the French","the French Pyrenees","French Pyrenees cross","Pyrenees cross paths","cross paths with","paths with a","with a lustful","a lustful witch","lustful witch ;","witch ;

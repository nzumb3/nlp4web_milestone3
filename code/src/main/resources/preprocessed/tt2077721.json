{"title":"Blackbird","plot":"This is a film about a troubled teen, Sean Randall, who is falsely accused of planning a Columbine shooting scenario. It all begins when an unlikely bond forms between Sean (Connor Jessup) and a preppy teenage girl named Deanna Roy (Alexia Fast). Deanna's boyfriend is deeply threatened by Sean and Deanna's friendship, resulting in a violent confrontation. Seeking to protect himself, Sean issues a death threat online - and is swiftly arrested. When the police raid Sean's home, they find rifles, shotguns, knives and ammunition - all property of Sean's father Ricky (Michael Buie), an avid hunter. They also find a supposed \"hit list\" with twenty names of people who have tormented Sean. The authorities and the media proclaim another Columbine has been narrowly averted, and soon Sean faces a terrifying imprisonment in a youth detention facility. Sean's only hope is to overcome his dark image, and prove his innocence to Deanna and to his community.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","is","a","film","about","a","troubl","teen",",","Sean","Randal",",","who","is","fals","accus","of","plan","a","Columbin","shoot","scenario",".","It","all","begin","when","an","unlik","bond","form","between","Sean","(","Connor","Jessup",")","and","a","preppi","teenag","girl","name","Deanna","Roy","(","Alexia","Fast",")",".","Deanna","'s","boyfriend","is","deepli","threaten","by","Sean","and","Deanna","'s","friendship",",","result","in","a","violent","confront",".","Seek","to","protect","himself",",","Sean","issu","a","death","threat","onlin","-","and","is","swift","arrest",".","When","the","polic","raid","Sean","'s","home",",","they","find","rifl",",","shotgun",",","knive","and","ammunit","-","all","properti","of","Sean","'s","father","Ricki","(","Michael","Buie",")",",","an","avid","hunter",".","They","also","find","a","suppos","\"","hit","list","\"","with","twenti","name","of","peopl","who","have","torment","Sean",".","The","author","and","the","media","proclaim","anoth","Columbin","has","been","narrowli","avert",",","and","soon","Sean","face","a","terrifi","imprison","in","a","youth","detent","facil",".","Sean","'s","onli","hope","is","to","overcom","his","dark","imag",",","and","prove","his","innoc","to","Deanna","and","to","his","communiti","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","film","about","a","troubled","teen",",","Sean","Randall",",","who","be","falsely","accuse","of","plan","a","Columbine","shooting","scenario",".","it","all","begin","when","a","unlikely","bond","form","between","Sean","-lrb-","Connor","Jessup","-rrb-","and","a","preppy","teenage","girl","name","Deanna","Roy","-lrb-","Alexia","fast","-rrb-",".","Deanna","'s","boyfriend","be","deeply","threaten","by","Sean","and","Deanna","'s","friendship",",","result","in","a","violent","confrontation",".","seek","to","protect","himself",",","Sean","issue","a","death","threat","online","-","and","be","swiftly","arrest",".","when","the","police","raid","Sean","'s","home",",","they","find","rifle",",","shotgun",",","knife","and","ammunition","-","all","property","of","Sean","'s","father","Ricky","-lrb-","Michael","Buie","-rrb-",",","a","avid","hunter",".","they","also","find","a","supposed","``","hit","list","''","with","twenty","name","of","people","who","have","torment","Sean",".","the","authority","and","the","media","proclaim","another","Columbine","have","be","narrowly","avert",",","and","soon","Sean","face","a","terrifying","imprisonment","in","a","youth","detention","facility",".","Sean","'s","only","hope","be","to","overcome","he","dark","image",",","and","prove","he","innocence","to","Deanna","and","to","he","community","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is a","is a film","a film about","film about a","about a troubled","a troubled teen","troubled teen ,","teen , Sean",", Sean Randall","Sean Randall ,","Randall , who",", who is","who is falsely","is falsely accused","falsely accused of","accused of planning","of planning a","planning a Columbine","a Columbine shooting","Columbine shooting scenario","It all begins","all begins when","begins when an","when an unlikely","an unlikely bond","unlikely bond forms","bond forms between","forms between Sean","between Sean (","Sean ( Connor","( Connor Jessup","Connor Jessup )","Jessup ) and",") and a","and a preppy","a preppy teenage","preppy teenage girl","teenage girl named","girl named Deanna","named Deanna Roy","Deanna Roy (","Roy ( Alexia","( Alexia Fast","Alexia Fast )","Deanna 's boyfriend","'s boyfriend is","boyfriend is deeply","is deeply threatened","deeply threatened by","threatened by Sean","by Sean and","Sean and Deanna","and Deanna 's","Deanna 's friendship","'s friendship ,","friendship , resulting",", resulting in","resulting in a","in a violent","a violent confrontation","Seeking to protect","to protect himself","protect himself ,","himself , Sean",", Sean issues","Sean issues a","issues a death","a death threat","death threat online","threat online -","online -

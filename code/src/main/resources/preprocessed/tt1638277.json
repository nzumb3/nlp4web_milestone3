{"title":"Mars et Avril","plot":"Montreal, the future. Elderly jazz musician Jacob Obus (Jacques Languirand) still draws in audiences with his mesmerizing performances, playing instruments based on female models, designed by his much younger pal Arthur (Paul Ahmarani). The latest model, intriguing artist Avril (Caroline Dhavernas), entices both Arthur and Jacob. In the resulting love triangle, the old musician is ultimately victorious and appears to be in love for the first time in his life. But then Avril is accidentally transported to Mars, where the first manned mission just happened to land. Enter Eugène Spaak (Robert Lepage), inventor, cosmologist and Arthur's father, who unveils a new theory about man's desire to reach Mars and helps Jacob find the true meaning of life and love.","genres":["Drama"," Music","

{"title":"Between Stone & Sky","plot":"The journey of an arctic river as it pours across the tundra into the arctic ocean. A meditative film of the remote and seemingly desolate landscape of the inland Canadian Arctic that at once reveals itself to be a dynamic place of stunning beauty and concentrated life. Shot hundreds of miles North of the nearest dirt road by a solitary crew of four traveling via canoe, the film neither belabors nor belies their presence. Instead, a persistent lens judiciously augmented with time-lapse, and location sound allows the landscape to transcend the exotic and become a place for reflection.","genres":["Adventure"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","journey","of","an","arctic","river","as","it","pour","across","the","tundra","into","the","arctic","ocean",".","A","medit","film","of","the","remot","and","seem","desol","landscap","of","the","inland","Canadian","Arctic","that","at","onc","reveal","itself","to","be","a","dynam","place","of","stun","beauti","and","concentr","life",".","Shot","hundr","of","mile","North","of","the","nearest","dirt","road","by","a","solitari","crew","of","four","travel","via","cano",",","the","film","neither","belabor","nor","beli","their","presenc",".","Instead",",","a","persist","len","judici","augment","with","time-laps",",","and","locat","sound","allow","the","landscap","to","transcend","the","exot","and","becom","a","place","for","reflect","."],"lemmas":["the","journey","of","a","arctic","river","as","it","pour","across","the","tundra","into","the","arctic","ocean",".","a","meditative","film","of","the","remote","and","seemingly","desolate","landscape","of","the","inland","Canadian","Arctic","that","at","once","reveal","itself","to","be","a","dynamic","place","of","stunning","beauty","and","concentrated","life",".","shot","hundred","of","mile","North","of","the","nearest","dirt","road","by","a","solitary","crew","of","four","travel","via","canoe",",","the","film","neither","belabor","nor","belie","they","presence",".","instead",",","a","persistent","lens","judiciously","augment","with","time-lapse",",","and","location","sound","allow","the","landscape","to","transcend","the","exotic","and","become","a","place","for","reflection","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The journey of","journey of an","of an arctic","an arctic river","arctic river as","river as it","as it pours","it pours across","pours across the","across the tundra","the tundra into","tundra into the","into the arctic","the arctic ocean","A meditative film","meditative film of","film of the","of the remote","the remote and","remote and seemingly","and seemingly desolate","seemingly desolate landscape","desolate landscape of","landscape of the","of the inland","the inland Canadian","inland Canadian Arctic","Canadian Arctic that","Arctic that at","that at once","at once reveals","once reveals itself","reveals itself to","itself to be","to be a","be a dynamic","a dynamic place","dynamic place of","place of stunning","of stunning beauty","stunning beauty and","beauty and concentrated","and concentrated life","Shot hundreds of","hundreds of miles","of miles North","miles North of","North of the","of the nearest","the nearest dirt","nearest dirt road","dirt road by","road by a","by a solitary","a solitary crew","solitary crew of","crew of four","of four traveling","four traveling via","traveling via canoe","via canoe ,","canoe , the",", the film","the film neither","film neither belabors","neither belabors nor","belabors nor belies","nor belies their","belies their presence","Instead , a",", a persistent","a persistent lens","persistent lens judiciously","lens judiciously augmented","judiciously augmented with","augmented with time-lapse","with time-lapse ,","time-lapse , and",", and location","and location sound","location sound allows","sound allows the","allows the landscape","the landscape to","landscape to transcend","to transcend the","transcend the exotic","the exotic and","exotic and become","and become a","become a place","a place for","place for reflection"],"2grams":["The journey","journey of","of an","an arctic","arctic river","river as","as it","it pours","pours across","across the","the tundra","tundra into","into the","the arctic","arctic ocean","A meditative","meditative film","film of","of the","the remote","remote and","and seemingly","seemingly desolate","desolate landscape","landscape of","of the","the inland","inland Canadian","Canadian Arctic","Arctic that","that at","at once","once reveals","reveals itself","itself to","to be","be a","a dynamic","dynamic place","place of","of stunning","stunning beauty","beauty and","and concentrated","concentrated life","Shot hundreds","hundreds of","of miles","miles North","North of","of the","the nearest","nearest dirt","dirt road","road by","by a","a solitary","solitary crew","crew of","of four","four traveling","traveling via","via canoe","canoe ,",", the","the film","film neither","neither belabors","belabors nor","nor belies","belies their","their presence","Instead ,",", a","a persistent","persistent lens","lens judiciously","judiciously augmented","augmented with","with time-lapse","time-lapse ,",", and","and location","location sound","sound allows","allows the","the landscape","landscape to","to transcend","transcend the","the exotic","exotic and","and become","become a","a place","place for","for reflection"]}

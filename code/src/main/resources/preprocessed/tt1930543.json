{"title":"Tzigari, una storia Rom","plot":"The Roma and Sinti cultures have no written history. Little is known of the roughly half a million gypsies who were killed in Europe between 1940-1945, nor of the thousands of Italian Roma and Sinti nomads who were interned in the 80 concentration camps established by the Fascist regime. A time of suffering that some nomads do not want humanity to forget, leading them to tell the story of their holocaust to the \"gaje\" or non-gypsies. Tzigari, an authentic spokesperson of the Romany people has come forward with his personal testimony. Built around his story, the documentary film reveals an undisclosed and exclusive scenario of WW2, shedding new light on some of the darkest pages that have been removed from the annals of human history.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Roma","and","Sinti","cultur","have","no","written","histori",".","Littl","is","known","of","the","rough","half","a","million","gypsi","who","were","kill","in","Europ","between","1940-1945",",","nor","of","the","thousand","of","Italian","Roma","and","Sinti","nomad","who","were","intern","in","the","80","concentr","camp","establish","by","the","Fascist","regim",".","A","time","of","suffer","that","some","nomad","do","not","want","human","to","forget",",","lead","them","to","tell","the","stori","of","their","holocaust","to","the","\"","gaje","\"","or","non-gypsi",".","Tzigari",",","an","authent","spokesperson","of","the","Romani","peopl","has","come","forward","with","his","person","testimoni",".","Built","around","his","stori",",","the","documentari","film","reveal","an","undisclos","and","exclus","scenario","of","WW2",",","shed","new","light","on","some","of","the","darkest","page","that","have","been","remov","from","the","annal","of","human","histori","."],"lemmas":["the","Roma","and","Sinti","culture","have","no","write","history",".","little","be","know","of","the","roughly","half","a","million","gypsy","who","be","kill","in","Europe","between","1940-1945",",","nor","of","the","thousand","of","Italian","Roma","and","Sinti","nomad","who","be","intern","in","the","80","concentration","camp","establish","by","the","fascist","regime",".","a","time","of","suffer","that","some","nomad","do","not","want","humanity","to","forget",",","lead","they","to","tell","the","story","of","they","holocaust","to","the","``","gaje","''","or","non-gypsy",".","Tzigari",",","a","authentic","spokesperson","of","the","Romany","people","have","come","forward","with","he","personal","testimony",".","build","around","he","story",",","the","documentary","film","reveal","a","undisclosed","and","exclusive","scenario","of","ww2",",","shed","new","light","on","some","of","the","darkest","page","that","have","be","remove","from","the","annals","of","human","history","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

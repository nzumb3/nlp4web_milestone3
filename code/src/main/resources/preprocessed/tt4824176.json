{"title":"El Corredor","plot":"ULTRAMAN is the improbable story of the Chilean Erwin Valdebenito. Every morning, he runs from his house in San Benardo to his work in Santiago - a distance of around fourteen miles. A daily half marathon along the highway, insulted by passers-by and sometimes run off the road by passing motorists. There is so much lead in the air that his face turns red and stays that way for the first hour on the job. His son, who works in the same office, finds it hard to understand his father's behavior. He simply takes a bus every morning. But Erwin Valdebenito will not hear of it. By running so obsessively, he looks for the boundaries he cannot find at work. By day, he works as a civil servant at the distinctly Kafkaesque Institute of Provisional Standardisation, where he repetitively replaces roles of paper in machines. After work, he trains for another hour in the park. And every 1250 miles, he replaces his running shoes. And all this in preparation for the Ultra-marathon, an event over 83 miles in which most contestants do not even reach the finish line. But Valdebenito has won it four times already.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["ULTRAMAN","is","the","improb","stori","of","the","Chilean","Erwin","Valdebenito",".","Everi","morn",",","he","run","from","his","hous","in","San","Benardo","to","his","work","in","Santiago","-","a","distanc","of","around","fourteen","mile",".","A","daili","half","marathon","along","the","highway",",","insult","by","passers-bi","and","sometim","run","off","the","road","by","pass","motorist",".","There","is","so","much","lead","in","the","air","that","his","face","turn","red","and","stay","that","way","for","the","first","hour","on","the","job",".","His","son",",","who","work","in","the","same","offic",",","find","it","hard","to","understand","his","father","'s","behavior",".","He","simpli","take","a","bus","everi","morn",".","But","Erwin","Valdebenito","will","not","hear","of","it",".","By","run","so","obsess",",","he","look","for","the","boundari","he","can","not","find","at","work",".","By","day",",","he","work","as","a","civil","servant","at","the","distinct","Kafkaesqu","Institut","of","Provision","Standardis",",","where","he","repetit","replac","role","of","paper","in","machin",".","After","work",",","he","train","for","anoth","hour","in","the","park",".","And","everi","1250","mile",",","he","replac","his","run","shoe",".","And","all","this","in","prepar","for","the","Ultra-marathon",",","an","event","over","83","mile","in","which","most","contest","do","not","even","reach","the","finish","line",".","But","Valdebenito","has","won","it","four","time","alreadi","."],"lemmas":["ULTRAMAN","be","the","improbable","story","of","the","chilean","Erwin","Valdebenito",".","every","morning",",","he","run","from","he","house","in","San","Benardo","to","he","work","in","Santiago","-","a","distance","of","around","fourteen","mile",".","a","daily","half","marathon","along","the","highway",",","insult","by","passer-by","and","sometimes","run","off","the","road","by","pass","motorist",".","there","be","so","much","lead","in","the","air","that","he","face","turn","red","and","stay","that","way","for","the","first","hour","on","the","job",".","he","son",",","who","work","in","the","same","office",",","find","it","hard","to","understand","he","father","'s","behavior",".","he","simply","take","a","bus","every","morning",".","but","Erwin","Valdebenito","will","not","hear","of","it",".","by","run","so","obsessively",",","he","look","for","the","boundary","he","can","not","find","at","work",".","by","day",",","he","work","as","a","civil","servant","at","the","distinctly","Kafkaesque","Institute","of","Provisional","Standardisation",",","where","he","repetitively","replace","role","of","paper","in","machine",".","after","work",",","he","train","for","another","hour","in","the","park",".","and","every","1250","mile",",","he","replace","he","run","shoe",".","and","all","this","in","preparation","for","the","ultra-marathon",",","a","event","over","83","mile","in","which","most","contestant","do","not","even","reach","the","finish","line",".","but","Valdebenito","have","win","it","four","time","already","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["ULTRAMAN

{"title":"Gayby","plot":"Jenn and Matt are best friends from college who are now in their thirties. Single by choice, Jenn spends her days teaching hot yoga and running errands for her boss. Matt suffers from comic-book writer's block and can't get over his ex-boyfriend. They decide to fulfill a promise to have a child together... the old fashioned way. Can they navigate the serious and unexpected snags they hit as they attempt to get their careers and dating lives back on track in preparation for parenthood? 'Gayboy' is an irreverent comedy about friendship, sex, loneliness, and the family you choose.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Jenn","and","Matt","are","best","friend","from","colleg","who","are","now","in","their","thirti",".","Singl","by","choic",",","Jenn","spend","her","day","teach","hot","yoga","and","run","errand","for","her","boss",".","Matt","suffer","from","comic-book","writer","'s","block","and","ca","n't","get","over","his","ex-boyfriend",".","They","decid","to","fulfil","a","promis","to","have","a","child","togeth","...","the","old","fashion","way",".","Can","they","navig","the","serious","and","unexpect","snag","they","hit","as","they","attempt","to","get","their","career","and","date","live","back","on","track","in","prepar","for","parenthood","?","'","Gayboy","'","is","an","irrever","comedi","about","friendship",",","sex",",","loneli",",","and","the","famili","you","choos","."],"lemmas":["Jenn","and","Matt","be","best","friend","from","college","who","be","now","in","they","thirty",".","single","by","choice",",","Jenn","spend","she","day","teach","hot","yoga","and","run","errand","for","she","boss",".","Matt","suffer","from","comic-book","writer","'s","block","and","can","not","get","over","he","ex-boyfriend",".","they","decide","to","fulfill","a","promise","to","have","a","child","together","...","the","old","fashion","way",".","can","they","navigate","the","serious","and","unexpected","snag","they","hit","as","they","attempt","to","get","they","career","and","date","life","back","on","track","in","preparation","for","parenthood","?","'","gayboy","'","be","a","irreverent","comedy","about","friendship",",","sex",",","loneliness",",","and","the","family","you","choose","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jenn and Matt","and Matt are","Matt are best","are best friends","best friends from","friends from college","from college who","college who are","who are now","are now in","now in their","in their thirties","Single by choice","by choice ,","choice , Jenn",", Jenn spends","Jenn spends her","spends her days","her days teaching","days teaching hot","teaching hot yoga","hot yoga and","yoga and running","and running errands","running errands for","errands for her","for her boss","Matt suffers from","suffers from comic-book","from comic-book writer","comic-book writer 's","writer 's block","'s block and","block and ca","and ca n't","ca n't get","n't get over","get over his","over his ex-boyfriend","They decide to","decide to fulfill","to fulfill a","fulfill a promise","a promise to","promise to have","to have a","have a child","a child together","child together ...","together ... the","... the old","the old fashioned","old fashioned way","Can they navigate","they navigate the","navigate the serious","the serious and","serious and unexpected","and unexpected snags","unexpected snags they","snags they hit","they hit as","hit as they","as they attempt","they attempt to","attempt to get","to get their","get their careers","their careers and","careers and dating","and dating lives","dating lives back","lives back on","back on track","on track in","track in preparation","in preparation for","preparation for parenthood","for parenthood ?","parenthood ?

{"title":"Mona Lisa Smile","plot":"Katherine Ann Watson has accepted a position teaching art history at the prestigious Wellesley College. Watson is a very modern woman, particularly for the 1950s, and has a passion not only for art but for her students. For the most part, the students all seem to be biding their time, waiting to find the right man to marry. The students are all very bright and Watson feels they are not reaching their potential. Altough a strong bond is formed between teacher and student, Watson's views are incompatible with the dominant culture of the college.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Katherin","Ann","Watson","has","accept","a","posit","teach","art","histori","at","the","prestigi","Wellesley","Colleg",".","Watson","is","a","veri","modern","woman",",","particular","for","the","1950s",",","and","has","a","passion","not","onli","for","art","but","for","her","student",".","For","the","most","part",",","the","student","all","seem","to","be","bide","their","time",",","wait","to","find","the","right","man","to","marri",".","The","student","are","all","veri","bright","and","Watson","feel","they","are","not","reach","their","potenti",".","Altough","a","strong","bond","is","form","between","teacher","and","student",",","Watson","'s","view","are","incompat","with","the","domin","cultur","of","the","colleg","."],"lemmas":["Katherine","Ann","Watson","have","accept","a","position","teaching","art","history","at","the","prestigious","Wellesley","College",".","Watson","be","a","very","modern","woman",",","particularly","for","the","1950",",","and","have","a","passion","not","only","for","art","but","for","she","student",".","for","the","most","part",",","the","student","all","seem","to","be","bide","they","time",",","wait","to","find","the","right","man","to","marry",".","the","student","be","all","very","bright","and","Watson","feel","they","be","not","reach","they","potential",".","altough","a","strong","bond","be","form","between","teacher","and","student",",","Watson","'s","view","be","incompatible","with","the","dominant","culture","of","the","college","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Katherine Ann Watson","Ann Watson has","Watson has accepted","has accepted a","accepted a position","a position teaching","position teaching art","teaching art history","art history at","history at the","at the prestigious","the prestigious Wellesley","prestigious Wellesley College","Watson is a","is a very","a very modern","very modern woman","modern woman ,","woman , particularly",", particularly for","particularly for the","for the 1950s","the 1950s ,","1950s , and",", and has","and has a","has a passion","a passion not","passion not only","not only for","only for art","for art but","art but for","but for her","for her students","For the most","the most part","most part ,","part , the",", the students","the students all","students all seem","all seem to","seem to be","to be biding","be biding their","biding their time","their time ,","time , waiting",", waiting to","waiting to find","to find the","find the right","the right man","right man to","man to marry","The students are","students are all","are all very","all very bright","very bright and","bright and Watson","and Watson feels","Watson feels they","feels they are","they are not","are not reaching","not reaching their","reaching their potential","Altough a strong","a strong bond","strong bond is","bond is formed","is formed between","formed between teacher","between teacher and","teacher and student","and student ,","student , Watson",", Watson 's","Watson 's views","'s views are","views are incompatible","are incompatible with","incompatible with the","with the dominant","the dominant culture","dominant culture of","culture of the","of the college"],"2grams":["Katherine Ann","Ann Watson","Watson has","has accepted","accepted a","a position","position teaching","teaching art","art history","history at","at the","the prestigious","prestigious Wellesley","Wellesley College","Watson is","is a","a very","very modern","modern woman","woman ,",", particularly","particularly for","for the","the 1950s","1950s ,",", and","and has","has a","a passion","passion not","not only","only for","for art","art but","but for","for her","her students","For the","the most","most part","part ,",", the","the students","students all","all seem","seem to","to be","be biding","biding their","their time","time ,",", waiting","waiting to","to find","find the","the right","right man","man to","to marry","The students","students are","are all","all very","very bright","bright and","and Watson","Watson feels","feels they","they are","are not","not reaching","reaching their","their potential","Altough a","a strong","strong bond","bond is","is formed","formed between","between teacher","teacher and","and student","student ,",", Watson","Watson 's","'s views","views are","are incompatible","incompatible with","with the","the dominant","dominant culture","culture of","of the","the college"]}

{"title":"InBetween","plot":"A severely disturbed teenager obsessed by the topic of murder comes across a theory in Psychology stating there are only Five types of murder in existence. To disprove this, he decides on murdering his best friend. Unlike every other film with the topic of murder and teenagers, we aren't trying to find out who the killer is or who will die next- we know who dies and who kills them within the films first few minutes. The goal of this film was to take a different approach and ask... Why? Why do killers kill, and what effects does murder have on those closest to the victim?","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["A","sever","disturb","teenag","obsess","by","the","topic","of","murder","come","across","a","theori","in","Psycholog","state","there","are","onli","Five","type","of","murder","in","exist",".","To","disprov","this",",","he","decid","on","murder","his","best","friend",".","Unlike","everi","other","film","with","the","topic","of","murder","and","teenag",",","we","are","n't","tri","to","find","out","who","the","killer","is","or","who","will","die","next","-","we","know","who","die","and","who","kill","them","within","the","film","first","few","minut",".","The","goal","of","this","film","was","to","take","a","differ","approach","and","ask","...","Whi","?","Whi","do","killer","kill",",","and","what","effect","doe","murder","have","on","those","closest","to","the","victim","?"],"lemmas":["a","severely","disturbed","teenager","obsess","by","the","topic","of","murder","come","across","a","theory","in","Psychology","state","there","be","only","five","type","of","murder","in","existence",".","to","disprove","this",",","he","decide","on","murder","he","best","friend",".","unlike","every","other","film","with","the","topic","of","murder","and","teenager",",","we","be","not","try","to","find","out","who","the","killer","be","or","who","will","die","next","-","we","know","who","die","and","who","kill","they","within","the","film","first","few","minute",".","the","goal","of","this","film","be","to","take","a","different","approach","and","ask","...","why","?","why","do","killer","kill",",","and","what","effect","do","murder","have","on","those","closest","to","the","victim","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A severely disturbed","severely disturbed teenager","disturbed teenager obsessed","teenager obsessed by","obsessed by the","by the topic","the topic of","topic of murder","of murder comes","murder comes across","comes across a","across a theory","a theory in","theory in Psychology","in Psychology stating","Psychology stating there","stating there are","there are only","are only Five","only Five types","Five types of","types of murder","of murder in","murder in existence","To disprove this","disprove this ,","this , he",", he decides","he decides on","decides on murdering","on murdering his","murdering his best","his best friend","Unlike every other","every other film","other film with","film with the","with the topic","the topic of","topic of murder","of murder and","murder and teenagers","and teenagers ,","teenagers , we",", we are","we are n't","are n't trying","n't trying to","trying to find","to find out","find out who","out who the","who the killer","the killer is","killer is or","is or who","or who will","who will die","will die next","die next -","next - we","- we know","we know who","know who dies","who dies and","dies and who","and who kills","who kills them","kills them within","them within the","within the films","the films first","films first few","first few minutes","The goal of","goal of this","of this film","this film was","film was to","was to take","to take a","take a different","a different approach","different approach and","approach and ask","and ask ...","ask ...

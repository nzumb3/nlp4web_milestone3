Shot digitally, the film elaborates the atmosphere of their burgeoning emotional bond but focuses above all on creating an intimately authentic portrayal of the protagonists. The music of Ivan Král adds an important texture to the movie.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["A","simpl","low","budget","piec","about","the","relationship","between","a","young","musician","(","make","a","live","as","a","garbag","collector",")","and","the","traumat","girl","he","find","'","on","a","trash","heap",".","'","Shot","digit",",","the","film","elabor","the","atmospher","of","their","burgeon","emot","bond","but","focus","abov","all","on","creat","an","intim","authent","portray","of","the","protagonist",".","The","music","of","Ivan","Král","add","an","import","textur","to","the","movi","."],"lemmas":["a","simple","low","budget","piece","about","the","relationship","between","a","young","musician","-lrb-","make","a","living","as","a","garbage","collector","-rrb-","and","the","traumatize","girl","he","find","'","on","a","trash","heap",".","'","shoot","digitally",",","the","film","elaborate","the","atmosphere","of","they","burgeon","emotional","bond","but","focus","above","all","on","create","a","intimately","authentic","portrayal","of","the","protagonist",".","the","music","of","Ivan","Král","add","a","important","texture","to","the","movie","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["A simple low","simple low budget","low budget piece","budget piece about","piece about the","about the relationship","the relationship between","relationship between a","between a young","a young musician","young musician (","musician ( making","( making a","making a living","a living as","living as a","as a garbage","a garbage collector","garbage collector )","collector ) and",") and the","and the traumatized","the traumatized girl","traumatized girl he","girl he finds","he finds '","finds ' on","' on a","on a trash","a trash heap","trash heap .","heap .

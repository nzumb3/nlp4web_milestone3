{"title":"Gut Instincts","plot":"Gut Instincts contains four horrific little tales. Call Me is about a man who thinks a night of passion is in store, but when he gets home, what awaits him is far from passion. In Patterson Road, a group of teens ventures to a wooded area rumored to have a hidden cemetery. They should have been careful what they asked for because in this case, that's exactly what they got. Speaking Ill of the Dead has a basic theme that karma is a bitch. And Trip has Terra, a struggling alcoholic looking for anything to decrease her stress. In all of these tales, characters had a bad feeling, a gut instinct, about what they were doing, but they didn't listen and paid the ultimate price.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Gut","Instinct","contain","four","horrif","littl","tale",".","Call","Me","is","about","a","man","who","think","a","night","of","passion","is","in","store",",","but","when","he","get","home",",","what","await","him","is","far","from","passion",".","In","Patterson","Road",",","a","group","of","teen","ventur","to","a","wood","area","rumor","to","have","a","hidden","cemeteri",".","They","should","have","been","care","what","they","ask","for","becaus","in","this","case",",","that","'s","exact","what","they","got",".","Speak","Ill","of","the","Dead","has","a","basic","theme","that","karma","is","a","bitch",".","And","Trip","has","Terra",",","a","struggl","alcohol","look","for","anyth","to","decreas","her","stress",".","In","all","of","these","tale",",","charact","had","a","bad","feel",",","a","gut","instinct",",","about","what","they","were","do",",","but","they","did","n't","listen","and","paid","the","ultim","price","."],"lemmas":["gut","instinct","contain","four","horrific","little","tale",".","call","I","be","about","a","man","who","think","a","night","of","passion","be","in","store",",","but","when","he","get","home",",","what","await","he","be","far","from","passion",".","in","Patterson","Road",",","a","group","of","teens","venture","to","a","wooded","area","rumor","to","have","a","hidden","cemetery",".","they","should","have","be","careful","what","they","ask","for","because","in","this","case",",","that","be","exactly","what","they","get",".","speak","Ill","of","the","Dead","have","a","basic","theme","that","karma","be","a","bitch",".","and","Trip","have","Terra",",","a","struggle","alcoholic","look","for","anything","to","decrease","she","stress",".","in","all","of","these","tale",",","character","have","a","bad","feeling",",","a","gut","instinct",",","about","what","they","be","do",",","but","they","do","not","listen","and","pay","the","ultimate","price","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Gut

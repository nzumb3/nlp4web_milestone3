{"title":"Inventing the Abbotts","plot":"Set in the 1950s, Inventing the Abbotts is a dramatic look at the life of two boys from the wrong side of the tracks and their interaction with the three daughters of local aristocrat Lloyd Abbott. The boys, Jacey and Doug Holt, have only three things in common: their family, table tennis and chasing the beautiful Abbott sisters. Their father, a reckless risk-taker, lost his life through a wager with Lloyd Abbott, his then business partner.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Set","in","the","1950s",",","Invent","the","Abbott","is","a","dramat","look","at","the","life","of","two","boy","from","the","wrong","side","of","the","track","and","their","interact","with","the","three","daughter","of","local","aristocrat","Lloyd","Abbott",".","The","boy",",","Jacey","and","Doug","Holt",",","have","onli","three","thing","in","common",":","their","famili",",","tabl","tenni","and","chase","the","beauti","Abbott","sister",".","Their","father",",","a","reckless","risk-tak",",","lost","his","life","through","a","wager","with","Lloyd","Abbott",",","his","then","busi","partner","."],"lemmas":["set","in","the","1950s",",","invent","the","Abbotts","be","a","dramatic","look","at","the","life","of","two","boy","from","the","wrong","side","of","the","track","and","they","interaction","with","the","three","daughter","of","local","aristocrat","Lloyd","Abbott",".","the","boy",",","Jacey","and","Doug","Holt",",","have","only","three","thing","in","common",":","they","family",",","table","tennis","and","chase","the","beautiful","Abbott","sister",".","they","father",",","a","reckless","risk-taker",",","lose","he","life","through","a","wager","with","Lloyd","Abbott",",","he","then","business","partner","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Set in the","in the 1950s","the 1950s ,","1950s , Inventing",", Inventing the","Inventing the Abbotts","the Abbotts is","Abbotts is a","is a dramatic","a dramatic look","dramatic look at","look at the","at the life","the life of","life of two","of two boys","two boys from","boys from the","from the wrong","the wrong side","wrong side of","side of the","of the tracks","the tracks and","tracks and their","and their interaction","their interaction with","interaction with the","with the three","the three daughters","three daughters of","daughters of local","of local aristocrat","local aristocrat Lloyd","aristocrat Lloyd Abbott","The boys ,","boys , Jacey",", Jacey and","Jacey and Doug","and Doug Holt","Doug Holt ,","Holt , have",", have only","have only three","only three things","three things in","things in common","in common :","common : their",": their family","their family ,","family , table",", table tennis","table tennis and","tennis and chasing","and chasing the","chasing the beautiful","the beautiful Abbott","beautiful Abbott sisters","Their father ,","father , a",", a reckless","a reckless risk-taker","reckless risk-taker ,","risk-taker , lost",", lost his","lost his life","his life through","life through a","through a wager","a wager with","wager with Lloyd","with Lloyd Abbott","Lloyd Abbott ,","Abbott , his",", his then","his then business","then business partner"],"2grams":["Set in","in the","the 1950s","1950s ,",", Inventing","Inventing the","the Abbotts","Abbotts is","is a","a dramatic","dramatic look","look at","at the","the life","life of","of two","two boys","boys from","from the","the wrong","wrong side","side of","of the","the tracks","tracks and","and their","their interaction","interaction with","with the","the three","three daughters","daughters of","of local","local aristocrat","aristocrat Lloyd","Lloyd Abbott","The boys","boys ,",", Jacey","Jacey and","and Doug","Doug Holt","Holt ,",", have","have only","only three","three things","things in","in common","common :",": their","their family","family ,",", table","table tennis","tennis and","and chasing","chasing the","the beautiful","beautiful Abbott","Abbott sisters","Their father","father ,",", a","a reckless","reckless risk-taker","risk-taker ,",", lost","lost his","his life","life through","through a","a wager","wager with","with Lloyd","Lloyd Abbott","Abbott ,",", his","his then","then business","business partner"]}

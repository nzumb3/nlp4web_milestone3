{"title":"A Confident Man","plot":"When Steve loses his job, his money, and his apartment, he drunkenly turns to a life of crime. Determined to rob a bank, Steve discovers he's not the only bank robber in town and certainly not the most dangerous. But when they mistake him for one of their own, Steve might just pull off the robbery of the century; unless corrupt cops, a dangerous lunatic, the mob, and a renegade bank robber with a dark secret catch him first.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["When","Steve","lose","his","job",",","his","money",",","and","his","apart",",","he","drunken","turn","to","a","life","of","crime",".","Determin","to","rob","a","bank",",","Steve","discov","he","'s","not","the","onli","bank","robber","in","town","and","certain","not","the","most","danger",".","But","when","they","mistak","him","for","one","of","their","own",",","Steve","might","just","pull","off","the","robberi","of","the","centuri",";","unless","corrupt","cop",",","a","danger","lunat",",","the","mob",",","and","a","renegad","bank","robber","with","a","dark","secret","catch","him","first","."],"lemmas":["when","Steve","lose","he","job",",","he","money",",","and","he","apartment",",","he","drunkenly","turn","to","a","life","of","crime",".","determine","to","rob","a","bank",",","Steve","discover","he","be","not","the","only","bank","robber","in","town","and","certainly","not","the","most","dangerous",".","but","when","they","mistake","he","for","one","of","they","own",",","Steve","might","just","pull","off","the","robbery","of","the","century",";","unless","corrupt","cop",",","a","dangerous","lunatic",",","the","mob",",","and","a","renegade","bank","robber","with","a","dark","secret","catch","he","first","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Steve loses","Steve loses his","loses his job","his job ,","job , his",", his money","his money ,","money , and",", and his","and his apartment","his apartment ,","apartment , he",", he drunkenly","he drunkenly turns","drunkenly turns to","turns to a","to a life","a life of","life of crime","Determined to rob","to rob a","rob a bank","a bank ,","bank , Steve",", Steve discovers","Steve discovers he","discovers he 's","he 's not","'s not the","not the only","the only bank","only bank robber","bank robber in","robber in town","in town and","town and certainly","and certainly not","certainly not the","not the most","the most dangerous","But when they","when they mistake","they mistake him","mistake him for","him for one","for one of","one of their","of their own","their own ,","own , Steve",", Steve might","Steve might just","might just pull","just pull off","pull off the","off the robbery","the robbery of","robbery of the","of the century","the century ;","century ; unless","; unless corrupt","unless corrupt cops","corrupt cops ,","cops , a",", a dangerous","a dangerous lunatic","dangerous lunatic ,","lunatic , the",", the mob","the mob ,","mob , and",", and a","and a renegade","a renegade bank","renegade bank robber","bank robber with","robber with a","with a dark","a dark secret","dark secret catch","secret catch him","catch him first"],"2grams":["When Steve","Steve loses","loses his","his job","job ,",", his","his money","money ,",", and","and his","his apartment","apartment ,",", he","he drunkenly","drunkenly turns","turns to","to a","a life","life of","of crime","Determined to","to rob","rob a","a bank","bank ,",", Steve","Steve discovers","discovers he","he 's","'s not","not the","the only","only bank","bank robber","robber in","in town","town and","and certainly","certainly not","not the","the most","most dangerous","But when","when they","they mistake","mistake him","him for","for one","one of","of their","their own","own ,",", Steve","Steve might","might just","just pull","pull off","off the","the robbery","robbery of","of the","the century","century ;","; unless","unless corrupt","corrupt cops","cops ,",", a","a dangerous","dangerous lunatic","lunatic ,",", the","the mob","mob ,",", and","and a","a renegade","renegade bank","bank robber","robber with","with a","a dark","dark secret","secret catch","catch him","him first"]}

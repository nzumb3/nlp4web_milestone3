{"title":"Kitchen","plot":"It is Mo-rae and Sang-in's one-year wedding anniversary. Mo-rae starts the day by preparing a special breakfast, but her practical husband begins his day by watering the withering plants. After an uneventful day at her parasol shop, Mo-rae visits a ceramic exhibit where she meets a handsome young man. In a cascade of events, the two end up hiding together in a narrow space. Meanwhile Sang-in, deciding to follow his passion for cooking, quits his money market job to start a restaurant. Although Sang-in loves to cook, the man with the true culinary gift is Du-re, a 23 year-old Korean-Frenchman. Sang-in invites Du-re to live with him and his wife in order to learn to cook like a culinary genius; however, he doesn't know that Du-re is the man who seduced his wife on their anniversary. What's worse, Du-re's feelings for Mo-rae aren't fading. In this fashion, a love triangle unfolds. Mo-rae must decide whether to stay with her steadfast husband and childhood friend or start anew with the spontaneous and imaginative stranger.","genres":["Drama","

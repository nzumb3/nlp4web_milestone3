When a Native Australian man is accused of murdering a white woman, three white men (The Fanatic, The Follower and The Veteran) are given the mission of capturing him with the help of an experienced Native Australian (The Tracker). So they start their quest in the outback, not knowing that their inner wrestles against and for racism will be more dangerous that the actual hunting for the accused.","genres":["Drama"," Western"," History"],"stems":["It","'s","1922",";","somewher","in","Australia",".","When","a","Nativ","Australian","man","is","accus","of","murder","a","white","woman",",","three","white","men","(","The","Fanat",",","The","Follow","and","The","Veteran",")","are","given","the","mission","of","captur","him","with","the","help","of","an","experienc","Nativ","Australian","(","The","Tracker",")",".","So","they","start","their","quest","in","the","outback",",","not","know","that","their","inner","wrestl","against","and","for","racism","will","be","more","danger","that","the","actual","hunt","for","the","accus","."],"lemmas":["it","be","1922",";","somewhere","in","Australia",".","when","a","native","australian","man","be","accuse","of","murder","a","white","woman",",","three","white","man","-lrb-","the","Fanatic",",","The","Follower","and","the","veteran","-rrb-","be","give","the","mission","of","capture","he","with","the","help","of","a","experienced","native","australian","-lrb-","the","tracker","-rrb-",".","so","they","start","they","quest","in","the","outback",",","not","know","that","they","inner","wrestle","against","and","for","racism","will","be","more","dangerous","that","the","actual","hunting","for","the","accuse","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["It 's 1922","'s 1922 ;","1922 ; somewhere","; somewhere in","somewhere in Australia","When a Native","a Native Australian","Native Australian man","Australian man is","man is accused","is accused of","accused of murdering","of murdering a","murdering a white","a white woman","white woman ,","woman , three",", three white","three white men","white men (","men ( The","( The Fanatic","The Fanatic ,","Fanatic , The",", The Follower","The Follower and","Follower and The","and The Veteran","The Veteran )","Veteran ) are",") are given","are given the","given the mission","the mission of","mission of capturing","of capturing him","capturing him with","him with the","with the help","the help of","help of an","of an experienced","an experienced Native","experienced Native Australian","Native Australian (","Australian ( The","( The Tracker","The Tracker )","So they start","they start their","start their quest","their quest in","quest in the","in the outback","the outback ,","outback , not",", not knowing","not knowing that","knowing that their","that their inner","their inner wrestles","inner wrestles against","wrestles against and","against and for","and for racism","for racism will","racism will be","will be more","be more dangerous","more dangerous that","dangerous that the","that the actual","the actual hunting","actual hunting for","hunting for the","for the accused"],"2grams":["It 's","'s 1922","1922 ;","; somewhere","somewhere in","in Australia","When a","a Native","Native Australian","Australian man","man is","is accused","accused of","of murdering","murdering a","a white","white woman","woman ,",", three","three white","white men","men (","( The","The Fanatic","Fanatic ,",", The","The Follower","Follower and","and The","The Veteran","Veteran )",") are","are given","given the","the mission","mission of","of capturing","capturing him","him with","with the","the help","help of","of an","an experienced","experienced Native","Native Australian","Australian (","( The","The Tracker","Tracker )","So they","they start","start their","their quest","quest in","in the","the outback","outback ,",", not","not knowing","knowing that","that their","their inner","inner wrestles","wrestles against","against and","and for","for racism","racism will","will be","be more","more dangerous","dangerous that","that the","the actual","actual hunting","hunting for","for the","the accused"]}

Neighborhoods are Quadrants that closely monitored by the supervisors of the Projects and these are led by a man named BLAS. Productivity at all costs is at the core of the new society. Against this backdrop, ROSA Santos, a university student, falls in love with DANIEL, another student from a lesser Quadrant, much to the dismay of her mother. Rosa's mother will stop at nothing to better hers and her daughter's life including forcing her to marry an influential member of the Supervisors, Stefano GRAVELLI, a move that unleashes a series of events that will drag Rosa and Daniel into a conflict of political intrigue and danger.","genres":["Action"," Drama","

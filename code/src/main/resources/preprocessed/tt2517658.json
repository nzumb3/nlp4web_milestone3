{"title":"The Canal","plot":"Film archivist David (Rupert Evans) has been having a rough time lately, as he suspects that his wife Alice (Hannah Hoekstra) has been cheating on him with Alex (Carl Shaaban), one of her work clients. This stress is compounded when David's work partner Claire (Antonia Campbell-Hughes) gives him a reel of to-be-archived footage that shows that his house was the setting for a brutal murder in 1902. Becoming progressively more unsettled and unhinged, David begins to believe that a spectral presence is in his house and ends up following his wife to a nearby canal, where he discovers that she is indeed having an affair with Alex. When Alice goes missing shortly afterwards, David contacts the police- only to become the prime suspect in her disappearance. As the police grow more convinced that David has murdered his wife, he struggles to find proof of his growing suspicion that something otherworldly was instead responsible.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Film","archivist","David","(","Rupert","Evan",")","has","been","have","a","rough","time","late",",","as","he","suspect","that","his","wife","Alice","(","Hannah","Hoekstra",")","has","been","cheat","on","him","with","Alex","(","Carl","Shaaban",")",",","one","of","her","work","client",".","This","stress","is","compound","when","David","'s","work","partner","Clair","(","Antonia","Campbell-Hugh",")","give","him","a","reel","of","to-be-archiv","footag","that","show","that","his","hous","was","the","set","for","a","brutal","murder","in","1902",".","Becom","progress","more","unsettl","and","unhing",",","David","begin","to","believ","that","a","spectral","presenc","is","in","his","hous","and","end","up","follow","his","wife","to","a","nearbi","canal",",","where","he","discov","that","she","is","inde","have","an","affair","with","Alex.","When","Alice","goe","miss","short","afterward",",","David","contact","the","polic","-","onli","to","becom","the","prime","suspect","in","her","disappear",".","As","the","polic","grow","more","convinc","that","David","has","murder","his","wife",",","he","struggl","to","find","proof","of","his","grow","suspicion","that","someth","otherworld","was","instead","respons","."],"lemmas":["Film","archivist","David","-lrb-","Rupert","Evans","-rrb-","have","be","have","a","rough","time","lately",",","as","he","suspect","that","he","wife","Alice","-lrb-","Hannah","Hoekstra","-rrb-","have","be","cheat","on","he","with","Alex","-lrb-","Carl","Shaaban","-rrb-",",","one","of","she","work","client",".","this","stress","be","compound","when","David","'s","work","partner","Claire","-lrb-","Antonia","Campbell-Hughes","-rrb-","give","he","a","reel","of","to-be-archived","footage","that","show","that","he","house","be","the","setting","for","a","brutal","murder","in","1902",".","become","progressively","more","unsettled","and","unhinge",",","David","begin","to","believe","that","a","spectral","presence","be","in","he","house","and","end","up","follow","he","wife","to","a","nearby","canal",",","where","he","discover","that","she","be","indeed","have","a","affair","with","Alex.","when","Alice","go","miss","shortly","afterwards",",","David","contact","the","police","-","only","to","become","the","prime","suspect","in","she","disappearance",".","as","the","police","grow","more","convinced","that","David","have","murder","he","wife",",","he","struggle","to","find","proof","of","he","grow","suspicion","that","something","otherworldly","be","instead","responsible","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Film archivist David","archivist David (","David ( Rupert","( Rupert Evans","Rupert Evans )","Evans ) has",") has been","has been having","been having a","having a rough","a rough time","rough time lately","time lately ,","lately , as",", as he","as he suspects","he suspects that","suspects that his","that his wife","his wife Alice","wife Alice (","Alice ( Hannah","( Hannah Hoekstra","Hannah Hoekstra )","Hoekstra ) has",") has been","has been cheating","been cheating on","cheating on him","on him with","him with Alex","with Alex (","Alex ( Carl","( Carl Shaaban","Carl Shaaban )","Shaaban ) ,",") , one",", one of","one of her","of her work","her work clients","This stress is","stress is compounded","is compounded when","compounded when David","when David 's","David 's work","'s work partner","work partner Claire","partner Claire (","Claire ( Antonia","( Antonia Campbell-Hughes","Antonia Campbell-Hughes )","Campbell-Hughes ) gives",") gives him","gives him a","him a reel","a reel of","reel of to-be-archived","of to-be-archived footage","to-be-archived footage that","footage that shows","that shows that","shows that his","that his house","his house was","house was the","was the setting","the setting for","setting for a","for a brutal","a brutal murder","brutal murder in","murder in 1902","Becoming progressively more","progressively more unsettled","more unsettled and","unsettled and unhinged","and unhinged ,","unhinged , David",", David begins","David begins to","begins to believe","to believe that","believe that a","that a spectral","a spectral presence","spectral presence is","presence is in","is in his","in his house","his house and","house and ends","and ends up","ends up following","up following his","following his wife","his wife to","wife to a","to a nearby","a nearby canal","nearby canal ,","canal , where",", where he","where he discovers","he discovers that","discovers that she","that she is","she is indeed","is indeed having","indeed having an","having an affair","an affair with","affair with Alex.","with Alex.

{"title":"Black Harvest","plot":"Joe Leahy is the half-caste son of one of the first explorers of the Papua New Guinean interior. His relations with the local Ganiga tribe who work his coffee plantation on their land are difficult at times. However he has successfully managed to get them to agree to open a second plantation in partnership with him. Things are looking up until the international coffee market hits rough times and conflict seems imminent between the Ganiga and their neighbouring traditional enemies.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Joe","Leahi","is","the","half-cast","son","of","one","of","the","first","explor","of","the","Papua","New","Guinean","interior",".","His","relat","with","the","local","Ganiga","tribe","who","work","his","coffe","plantat","on","their","land","are","difficult","at","time",".","Howev","he","has","success","manag","to","get","them","to","agre","to","open","a","second","plantat","in","partnership","with","him",".","Thing","are","look","up","until","the","intern","coffe","market","hit","rough","time","and","conflict","seem","immin","between","the","Ganiga","and","their","neighbour","tradit","enemi","."],"lemmas":["Joe","Leahy","be","the","half-caste","son","of","one","of","the","first","explorer","of","the","Papua","New","Guinean","interior",".","he","relation","with","the","local","Ganiga","tribe","who","work","he","coffee","plantation","on","they","land","be","difficult","at","time",".","however","he","have","successfully","manage","to","get","they","to","agree","to","open","a","second","plantation","in","partnership","with","he",".","thing","be","look","up","until","the","international","coffee","market","hit","rough","time","and","conflict","seem","imminent","between","the","Ganiga","and","they","neighbouring","traditional","enemy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Joe Leahy is","Leahy is the","is the half-caste","the half-caste son","half-caste son of","son of one","of one of","one of the","of the first","the first explorers","first explorers of","explorers of the","of the Papua","the Papua New","Papua New Guinean","New Guinean interior","His relations with","relations with the","with the local","the local Ganiga","local Ganiga tribe","Ganiga tribe who","tribe who work","who work his","work his coffee","his coffee plantation","coffee plantation on","plantation on their","on their land","their land are","land are difficult","are difficult at","difficult at times","However he has","he has successfully","has successfully managed","successfully managed to","managed to get","to get them","get them to","them to agree","to agree to","agree to open","to open a","open a second","a second plantation","second plantation in","plantation in partnership","in partnership with","partnership with him","Things are looking","are looking up","looking up until","up until the","until the international","the international coffee","international coffee market","coffee market hits","market hits rough","hits rough times","rough times and","times and conflict","and conflict seems","conflict seems imminent","seems imminent between","imminent between the","between the Ganiga","the Ganiga and","Ganiga and their","and their neighbouring","their neighbouring traditional","neighbouring traditional enemies"],"2grams":["Joe Leahy","Leahy is","is the","the half-caste","half-caste son","son of","of one","one of","of the","the first","first explorers","explorers of","of the","the Papua","Papua New","New Guinean","Guinean interior","His relations","relations with","with the","the local","local Ganiga","Ganiga tribe","tribe who","who work","work his","his coffee","coffee plantation","plantation on","on their","their land","land are","are difficult","difficult at","at times","However he","he has","has successfully","successfully managed","managed to","to get","get them","them to","to agree","agree to","to open","open a","a second","second plantation","plantation in","in partnership","partnership with","with him","Things are","are looking","looking up","up until","until the","the international","international coffee","coffee market","market hits","hits rough","rough times","times and","and conflict","conflict seems","seems imminent","imminent between","between the","the Ganiga","Ganiga and","and their","their neighbouring","neighbouring traditional","traditional enemies"]}

{"title":"The Tall Man","plot":"This film is about a legend that has been started by the town folk of Cold Rock. Since the children in the town have been going missing, people have said it's an entity known as 'The Tall Man' who has been taking them. Julia Denning (Jssica Biel) is the local nurse whose husband died years earlier. She is soon personally involved as her child is taken. She tries to track down where the child is taken, but finds that there's more to what's happening than she knew. The towns-folk start to turn on her and the truth comes out. But there's still more to the story - who is 'The Tall Man'? And what is the truth behind the disappearances?","genres":["Crime"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["This","film","is","about","a","legend","that","has","been","start","by","the","town","folk","of","Cold","Rock",".","Sinc","the","children","in","the","town","have","been","go","miss",",","peopl","have","said","it","'s","an","entiti","known","as","'","The","Tall","Man","'","who","has","been","take","them",".","Julia","Den","(","Jssica","Biel",")","is","the","local","nurs","whose","husband","die","year","earlier",".","She","is","soon","person","involv","as","her","child","is","taken",".","She","tri","to","track","down","where","the","child","is","taken",",","but","find","that","there","'s","more","to","what","'s","happen","than","she","knew",".","The","towns-folk","start","to","turn","on","her","and","the","truth","come","out",".","But","there","'s","still","more","to","the","stori","-","who","is","'","The","Tall","Man","'","?","And","what","is","the","truth","behind","the","disappear","?"],"lemmas":["this","film","be","about","a","legend","that","have","be","start","by","the","town","folk","of","Cold","Rock",".","since","the","child","in","the","town","have","be","go","miss",",","people","have","say","it","be","a","entity","know","as","'","the","tall","man","'","who","have","be","take","they",".","Julia","Denning","-lrb-","Jssica","Biel","-rrb-","be","the","local","nurse","whose","husband","die","year","earlier",".","she","be","soon","personally","involve","as","she","child","be","take",".","she","try","to","track","down","where","the","child","be","take",",","but","find","that","there","be","more","to","what","be","happen","than","she","know",".","the","towns-folk","start","to","turn","on","she","and","the","truth","come","out",".","but","there","be","still","more","to","the","story","-","who","be","'","the","tall","man","'","?","and","what","be","the","truth","behind","the","disappearance","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film is","film is about","is about a","about a legend","a legend that","legend that has","that has been","has been started","been started by","started by the","by the town","the town folk","town folk of","folk of Cold","of Cold Rock","Since the children","the children in","children in the","in the town","the town have","town have been","have been going","been going missing","going missing ,","missing , people",", people have","people have said","have said it","said it 's","it 's an","'s an entity","an entity known","entity known as","known as '","as ' The","' The Tall","The Tall Man","Tall Man '","Man ' who","' who has","who has been","has been taking","been taking them","Julia Denning (","Denning ( Jssica","( Jssica Biel","Jssica Biel )","Biel ) is",") is the","is the local","the local nurse","local nurse whose","nurse whose husband","whose husband died","husband died years","died years earlier","She is soon","is soon personally","soon personally involved","personally involved as","involved as her","as her child","her child is","child is taken","She tries to","tries to track","to track down","track down where","down where the","where the child","the child is","child is taken","is taken ,","taken , but",", but finds","but finds that","finds that there","that there 's","there 's more","'s more to","more to what","to what 's","what 's happening","'s happening than","happening than she","than she knew","The towns-folk start","towns-folk start to","start to turn","to turn on","turn on her","on her and","her and the","and the truth","the truth comes","truth comes out","But there 's","there 's still","'s still more","still more to","more to the","to the story","the story -","story -

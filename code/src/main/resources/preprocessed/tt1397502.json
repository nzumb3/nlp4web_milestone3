{"title":"Grown Up Movie Star","plot":"Grown Up Movie Star tells the story of disgraced NHL star Ray and his precocious daughters Ruby and Rose. Once the town hero, Ray has returned home to Newfoundland from the US following a drug conviction, only to have his wife Lillian leave him for another man and aspirations of stardom. With Lillian gone, Ray flails from woman to woman trying to find a replacement for her, while struggling against a growing awareness of his homosexuality. At loose ends for lack of guidance, Ruby is becoming increasingly curious about her own sexuality and, in a desperate plea for attention, putting herself in increasingly risky situations. Ruby begins spending more and more time with Ray's best friend Stuart, confined to a wheelchair following an accident involving Ray. When Stuart finds himself attracted to Ruby, dangerously motivated by fear and anger, he leads the three of them towards a heartbreaking conclusion.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Grown","Up","Movi","Star","tell","the","stori","of","disgrac","NHL","star","Ray","and","his","precoci","daughter","Rubi","and","Rose",".","Once","the","town","hero",",","Ray","has","return","home","to","Newfoundland","from","the","US","follow","a","drug","convict",",","onli","to","have","his","wife","Lillian","leav","him","for","anoth","man","and","aspir","of","stardom",".","With","Lillian","gone",",","Ray","flail","from","woman","to","woman","tri","to","find","a","replac","for","her",",","while","struggl","against","a","grow","awar","of","his","homosexu",".","At","loos","end","for","lack","of","guidanc",",","Rubi","is","becom","increas","curious","about","her","own","sexual","and",",","in","a","desper","plea","for","attent",",","put","herself","in","increas","riski","situat",".","Rubi","begin","spend","more","and","more","time","with","Ray","'s","best","friend","Stuart",",","confin","to","a","wheelchair","follow","an","accid","involv","Ray",".","When","Stuart","find","himself","attract","to","Rubi",",","danger","motiv","by","fear","and","anger",",","he","lead","the","three","of","them","toward","a","heartbreak","conclus","."],"lemmas":["grow","up","Movie","Star","tell","the","story","of","disgraced","nhl","star","Ray","and","he","precocious","daughter","Ruby","and","Rose",".","once","the","town","hero",",","Ray","have","return","home","to","Newfoundland","from","the","US","follow","a","drug","conviction",",","only","to","have","he","wife","Lillian","leave","he","for","another","man","and","aspiration","of","stardom",".","with","Lillian","go",",","Ray","flail","from","woman","to","woman","try","to","find","a","replacement","for","she",",","while","struggle","against","a","grow","awareness","of","he","homosexuality",".","at","loose","end","for","lack","of","guidance",",","Ruby","be","become","increasingly","curious","about","she","own","sexuality","and",",","in","a","desperate","plea","for","attention",",","put","herself","in","increasingly","risky","situation",".","Ruby","begin","spend","more","and","more","time","with","Ray","'s","best","friend","Stuart",",","confine","to","a","wheelchair","follow","a","accident","involve","Ray",".","when","Stuart","find","himself","attract","to","Ruby",",","dangerously","motivate","by","fear","and","anger",",","he","lead","the","three","of","they","towards","a","heartbreaking","conclusion","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Grown

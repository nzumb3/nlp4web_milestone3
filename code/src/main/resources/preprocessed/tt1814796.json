{"title":"Minds, Adolescents","plot":"MINDS, ADOLESCENTS is about these fraternal twin brothers who get separated at birth. Michael knows he has a brother but Nathan doesn't know anything about his past. We see their stories unfold in the film and how opposite they really are from one another even though they're linked by blood. The question we are faced with is if their lives will cross paths and if they do, how will they react to one another?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["MINDS",",","ADOLESCENTS","is","about","these","fratern","twin","brother","who","get","separ","at","birth",".","Michael","know","he","has","a","brother","but","Nathan","doe","n't","know","anyth","about","his","past",".","We","see","their","stori","unfold","in","the","film","and","how","opposit","they","realli","are","from","one","anoth","even","though","they","re","link","by","blood",".","The","question","we","are","face","with","is","if","their","live","will","cross","path","and","if","they","do",",","how","will","they","react","to","one","anoth","?"],"lemmas":["mind",",","adolescent","be","about","these","fraternal","twin","brother","who","get","separate","at","birth",".","Michael","know","he","have","a","brother","but","Nathan","do","not","know","anything","about","he","past",".","we","see","they","story","unfold","in","the","film","and","how","opposite","they","really","be","from","one","another","even","though","they","be","link","by","blood",".","the","question","we","be","face","with","be","if","they","life","will","cross","path","and","if","they","do",",","how","will","they","react","to","one","another","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["MINDS , ADOLESCENTS",", ADOLESCENTS is","ADOLESCENTS is about","is about these","about these fraternal","these fraternal twin","fraternal twin brothers","twin brothers who","brothers who get","who get separated","get separated at","separated at birth","Michael knows he","knows he has","he has a","has a brother","a brother but","brother but Nathan","but Nathan does","Nathan does n't","does n't know","n't know anything","know anything about","anything about his","about his past","We see their","see their stories","their stories unfold","stories unfold in","unfold in the","in the film","the film and","film and how","and how opposite","how opposite they","opposite they really","they really are","really are from","are from one","from one another","one another even","another even though","even though they","though they 're","they 're linked","'re linked by","linked by blood","The question we","question we are","we are faced","are faced with","faced with is","with is if","is if their","if their lives","their lives will","lives will cross","will cross paths","cross paths and","paths and if","and if they","if they do","they do ,","do , how",", how will","how will they","will they react","they react to","react to one","to one another"],"2grams":["MINDS ,",", ADOLESCENTS","ADOLESCENTS is","is about","about these","these fraternal","fraternal twin","twin brothers","brothers who","who get","get separated","separated at","at birth","Michael knows","knows he","he has","has a","a brother","brother but","but Nathan","Nathan does","does n't","n't know","know anything","anything about","about his","his past","We see","see their","their stories","stories unfold","unfold in","in the","the film","film and","and how","how opposite","opposite they","they really","really are","are from","from one","one another","another even","even though","though they","they 're","'re linked","linked by","by blood","The question","question we","we are","are faced","faced with","with is","is if","if their","their lives","lives will","will cross","cross paths","paths and","and if","if they","they do","do ,",", how","how will","will they","they react","react to","to one","one another"]}

{"title":"Under Suspicion","plot":"In 1959 Brighton, disgraced cop turned private detective Tony Aaron works largely on falsifying adulteries for use as evidence in divorce cases. He involves his wife as the fictional co-respondent for painter Carlo Stasio but the pair are shot dead in the hotel room. In charge of the case is Frank, Tony's ex-partner still on the Brighton force. His most likely suspects are Angeline, Stasio's mistress who is set to inherit his house and pictures, and Tony himself, parts of whose story don't seem to add up.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["In","1959","Brighton",",","disgrac","cop","turn","privat","detect","Toni","Aaron","work","larg","on","falsifi","adulteri","for","use","as","evid","in","divorc","case",".","He","involv","his","wife","as","the","fiction","co-respond","for","painter","Carlo","Stasio","but","the","pair","are","shot","dead","in","the","hotel","room",".","In","charg","of","the","case","is","Frank",",","Toni","'s","ex-partn","still","on","the","Brighton","forc",".","His","most","like","suspect","are","Angelin",",","Stasio","'s","mistress","who","is","set","to","inherit","his","hous","and","pictur",",","and","Toni","himself",",","part","of","whose","stori","do","n't","seem","to","add","up","."],"lemmas":["in","1959","Brighton",",","disgraced","cop","turn","private","detective","Tony","Aaron","work","largely","on","falsify","adultery","for","use","as","evidence","in","divorce","case",".","he","involve","he","wife","as","the","fictional","co-respondent","for","painter","Carlo","Stasio","but","the","pair","be","shoot","dead","in","the","hotel","room",".","in","charge","of","the","case","be","Frank",",","Tony","'s","ex-partner","still","on","the","Brighton","force",".","he","most","likely","suspect","be","Angeline",",","Stasio","'s","mistress","who","be","set","to","inherit","he","house","and","picture",",","and","Tony","himself",",","part","of","whose","story","do","not","seem","to","add","up","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1959 Brighton","1959 Brighton ,","Brighton , disgraced",", disgraced cop","disgraced cop turned","cop turned private","turned private detective","private detective Tony","detective Tony Aaron","Tony Aaron works","Aaron works largely","works largely on","largely on falsifying","on falsifying adulteries","falsifying adulteries for","adulteries for use","for use as","use as evidence","as evidence in","evidence in divorce","in divorce cases","He involves his","involves his wife","his wife as","wife as the","as the fictional","the fictional co-respondent","fictional co-respondent for","co-respondent for painter","for painter Carlo","painter Carlo Stasio","Carlo Stasio but","Stasio but the","but the pair","the pair are","pair are shot","are shot dead","shot dead in","dead in the","in the hotel","the hotel room","In charge of","charge of the","of the case","the case is","case is Frank","is Frank ,","Frank , Tony",", Tony 's","Tony 's ex-partner","'s ex-partner still","ex-partner still on","still on the","on the Brighton","the Brighton force","His most likely","most likely suspects","likely suspects are","suspects are Angeline","are Angeline ,","Angeline , Stasio",", Stasio 's","Stasio 's mistress","'s mistress who","mistress who is","who is set","is set to","set to inherit","to inherit his","inherit his house","his house and","house and pictures","and pictures ,","pictures , and",", and Tony","and Tony himself","Tony himself ,","himself , parts",", parts of","parts of whose","of whose story","whose story do","story do n't","do n't seem","n't seem to","seem to add","to add up"],"2grams":["In 1959","1959 Brighton","Brighton ,",", disgraced","disgraced cop","cop turned","turned private","private detective","detective Tony","Tony Aaron","Aaron works","works largely","largely on","on falsifying","falsifying adulteries","adulteries for","for use","use as","as evidence","evidence in","in divorce","divorce cases","He involves","involves his","his wife","wife as","as the","the fictional","fictional co-respondent","co-respondent for","for painter","painter Carlo","Carlo Stasio","Stasio but","but the","the pair","pair are","are shot","shot dead","dead in","in the","the hotel","hotel room","In charge","charge of","of the","the case","case is","is Frank","Frank ,",", Tony","Tony 's","'s ex-partner","ex-partner still","still on","on the","the Brighton","Brighton force","His most","most likely","likely suspects","suspects are","are Angeline","Angeline ,",", Stasio","Stasio 's","'s mistress","mistress who","who is","is set","set to","to inherit","inherit his","his house","house and","and pictures","pictures ,",", and","and Tony","Tony himself","himself ,",", parts","parts of","of whose","whose story","story do","do n't","n't seem","seem to","to add","add up"]}

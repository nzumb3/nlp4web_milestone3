{"title":"The Scapegoat","plot":"There is something strange - some would even say abnormal - about the Malaussène family. But if you take a closer look, no one could be happier than this cheerfully chaotic family, even though their mother is usually off on one romantic adventure or another. Life is never a bore for Benjamin Malaussène, professional scapegoat and the older brother responsible for this horde of kids. But when incidents happen wherever he goes, police and colleagues begin to eye him suspiciously. It soon becomes a matter of life and death to find out what is going on and who is so interested in ruining his life.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["There","is","someth","strang","-","some","would","even","say","abnorm","-","about","the","Malaussèn","famili",".","But","if","you","take","a","closer","look",",","no","one","could","be","happier","than","this","cheer","chaotic","famili",",","even","though","their","mother","is","usual","off","on","one","romant","adventur","or","anoth",".","Life","is","never","a","bore","for","Benjamin","Malaussèn",",","profession","scapegoat","and","the","older","brother","respons","for","this","hord","of","kid",".","But","when","incid","happen","wherev","he","goe",",","polic","and","colleagu","begin","to","eye","him","suspici",".","It","soon","becom","a","matter","of","life","and","death","to","find","out","what","is","go","on","and","who","is","so","interest","in","ruin","his","life","."],"lemmas":["there","be","something","strange","-","some","would","even","say","abnormal","-","about","the","Malaussène","family",".","but","if","you","take","a","closer","look",",","no","one","could","be","happier","than","this","cheerfully","chaotic","family",",","even","though","they","mother","be","usually","off","on","one","romantic","adventure","or","another",".","Life","be","never","a","bear","for","Benjamin","Malaussène",",","professional","scapegoat","and","the","older","brother","responsible","for","this","horde","of","kid",".","but","when","incident","happen","wherever","he","go",",","police","and","colleague","begin","to","eye","he","suspiciously",".","it","soon","become","a","matter","of","life","and","death","to","find","out","what","be","go","on","and","who","be","so","interested","in","ruin","he","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["There is something","is something strange","something strange -","strange -

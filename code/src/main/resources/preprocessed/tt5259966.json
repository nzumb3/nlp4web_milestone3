{"title":"No Manches Frida","plot":"NO MANCHES FRIDA is the story of Zequi, a recently released bank robber who goes to recover stolen money buried by his ditzy accomplice before going to jail. They return to the site only to find that Frida Kahlo High has built a gymnasium over the loot. To get the money, he poses as a substitute teacher for a school that can't seem to keep any teachers around. Zequi comes in ready to lay down the law- but he quickly finds out that life on the inside may have been easier to deal with than a school full of wild and rebellious teenagers.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["NO","MANCHES","FRIDA","is","the","stori","of","Zequi",",","a","recent","releas","bank","robber","who","goe","to","recov","stolen","money","buri","by","his","ditzi","accomplic","befor","go","to","jail",".","They","return","to","the","site","onli","to","find","that","Frida","Kahlo","High","has","built","a","gymnasium","over","the","loot",".","To","get","the","money",",","he","pose","as","a","substitut","teacher","for","a","school","that","ca","n't","seem","to","keep","ani","teacher","around",".","Zequi","come","in","readi","to","lay","down","the","law","-","but","he","quick","find","out","that","life","on","the","insid","may","have","been","easier","to","deal","with","than","a","school","full","of","wild","and","rebelli","teenag","."],"lemmas":["no","MANCHES","FRIDA","be","the","story","of","Zequi",",","a","recently","release","bank","robber","who","go","to","recover","stolen","money","bury","by","he","ditzy","accomplice","before","go","to","jail",".","they","return","to","the","site","only","to","find","that","Frida","Kahlo","High","have","build","a","gymnasium","over","the","loot",".","to","get","the","money",",","he","pose","as","a","substitute","teacher","for","a","school","that","can","not","seem","to","keep","any","teacher","around",".","Zequi","come","in","ready","to","lay","down","the","law","-","but","he","quickly","find","out","that","life","on","the","inside","may","have","be","easier","to","deal","with","than","a","school","full","of","wild","and","rebellious","teenager","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["NO MANCHES FRIDA","MANCHES FRIDA is","FRIDA is the","is the story","the story of","story of Zequi","of Zequi ,","Zequi , a",", a recently","a recently released","recently released bank","released bank robber","bank robber who","robber who goes","who goes to","goes to recover","to recover stolen","recover stolen money","stolen money buried","money buried by","buried by his","by his ditzy","his ditzy accomplice","ditzy accomplice before","accomplice before going","before going to","going to jail","They return to","return to the","to the site","the site only","site only to","only to find","to find that","find that Frida","that Frida Kahlo","Frida Kahlo High","Kahlo High has","High has built","has built a","built a gymnasium","a gymnasium over","gymnasium over the","over the loot","To get the","get the money","the money ,","money , he",", he poses","he poses as","poses as a","as a substitute","a substitute teacher","substitute teacher for","teacher for a","for a school","a school that","school that ca","that ca n't","ca n't seem","n't seem to","seem to keep","to keep any","keep any teachers","any teachers around","Zequi comes in","comes in ready","in ready to","ready to lay","to lay down","lay down the","down the law","the law -","law - but","- but he","but he quickly","he quickly finds","quickly finds out","finds out that","out that life","that life on","life on the","on the inside","the inside may","inside may have","may have been","have been easier","been easier to","easier to deal","to deal with","deal with than","with than a","than a school","a school full","school full of","full of wild","of wild and","wild and rebellious","and rebellious teenagers"],"2grams":["NO MANCHES","MANCHES FRIDA","FRIDA is","is the","the story","story of","of Zequi","Zequi ,",", a","a recently","recently released","released bank","bank robber","robber who","who goes","goes to","to recover","recover stolen","stolen money","money buried","buried by","by his","his ditzy","ditzy accomplice","accomplice before","before going","going to","to jail","They return","return to","to the","the site","site only","only to","to find","find that","that Frida","Frida Kahlo","Kahlo High","High has","has built","built a","a gymnasium","gymnasium over","over the","the loot","To get","get the","the money","money ,",", he","he poses","poses as","as a","a substitute","substitute teacher","teacher for","for a","a school","school that","that ca","ca n't","n't seem","seem to","to keep","keep any","any teachers","teachers around","Zequi comes","comes in","in ready","ready to","to lay","lay down","down the","the law","law -","- but","but he","he quickly","quickly finds","finds out","out that","that life","life on","on the","the inside","inside may","may have","have been","been easier","easier to","to deal","deal with","with than","than a","a school","school full","full of","of wild","wild and","and rebellious","rebellious teenagers"]}

{"title":"Painting the Future","plot":"On the second floor of a low-income apartment complex lives Jonathan Page, a formerly successful artist who stopped painting after the tragic loss of his eyesight (along with myriad irreplaceable trappings of his former of life). Having established himself as the building's resident curmudgeon, the embittered Jonathan is taken by surprise when Lupe, a 10-year-old girl with unflappable optimism, moves into the apartment next door with her grandparents. As an unlikely friendship blossoms between the two, shocking and painful secrets are revealed about both their lives. Ron Marasco's performance as Jonathan Page is, quite simply, acting at its finest. Tanya Ramero as Lupe will break your heart. Based on the writings of Louise Hay and her contributions to the gay community.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["On","the","second","floor","of","a","low-incom","apart","complex","live","Jonathan","Page",",","a","former","success","artist","who","stop","paint","after","the","tragic","loss","of","his","eyesight","(","along","with","myriad","irreplac","trap","of","his","former","of","life",")",".","Have","establish","himself","as","the","build","'s","resid","curmudgeon",",","the","embitt","Jonathan","is","taken","by","surpris","when","Lupe",",","a","10-year-old","girl","with","unflapp","optim",",","move","into","the","apart","next","door","with","her","grandpar",".","As","an","unlik","friendship","blossom","between","the","two",",","shock","and","pain","secret","are","reveal","about","both","their","live",".","Ron","Marasco","'s","perform","as","Jonathan","Page","is",",","quit","simpli",",","act","at","it","finest",".","Tanya","Ramero","as","Lupe","will","break","your","heart",".","Base","on","the","write","of","Louis","Hay","and","her","contribut","to","the","gay","communiti","."],"lemmas":["on","the","second","floor","of","a","low-income","apartment","complex","live","Jonathan","Page",",","a","formerly","successful","artist","who","stop","painting","after","the","tragic","loss","of","he","eyesight","-lrb-","along","with","myriad","irreplaceable","trappings","of","he","former","of","life","-rrb-",".","have","establish","himself","as","the","building","'s","resident","curmudgeon",",","the","embittered","Jonathan","be","take","by","surprise","when","Lupe",",","a","10-year-old","girl","with","unflappable","optimism",",","move","into","the","apartment","next","door","with","she","grandparent",".","as","a","unlikely","friendship","blossom","between","the","two",",","shocking","and","painful","secret","be","reveal","about","both","they","life",".","Ron","Marasco","'s","performance","as","Jonathan","Page","be",",","quite","simply",",","act","at","its","finest",".","Tanya","Ramero","as","Lupe","will","break","you","heart",".","base","on","the","writings","of","Louise","Hay","and","she","contribution","to","the","gay","community","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On

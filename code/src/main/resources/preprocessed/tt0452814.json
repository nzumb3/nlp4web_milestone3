{"title":"Loop","plot":"Norwegian documentary about humans relations to time, and what happens when someone decide to jump off the time loop, to find themselves. Some seeks out excitement and discoveries, others want piece and quite. Isn't this two things which are all about the same? Finding your own balance in life, where you chose to do with your life what you want to do? With this as a starting point, this documentary meets people who have found themselves outside the modern, and outside the traditional life, which others might find strange.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Norwegian","documentari","about","human","relat","to","time",",","and","what","happen","when","someon","decid","to","jump","off","the","time","loop",",","to","find","themselv",".","Some","seek","out","excit","and","discoveri",",","other","want","piec","and","quit",".","Is","n't","this","two","thing","which","are","all","about","the","same","?","Find","your","own","balanc","in","life",",","where","you","chose","to","do","with","your","life","what","you","want","to","do","?","With","this","as","a","start","point",",","this","documentari","meet","peopl","who","have","found","themselv","outsid","the","modern",",","and","outsid","the","tradit","life",",","which","other","might","find","strang","."],"lemmas":["norwegian","documentary","about","human","relation","to","time",",","and","what","happen","when","someone","decide","to","jump","off","the","time","loop",",","to","find","themselves",".","some","seek","out","excitement","and","discovery",",","other","want","piece","and","quite",".","be","not","this","two","thing","which","be","all","about","the","same","?","find","you","own","balance","in","life",",","where","you","choose","to","do","with","you","life","what","you","want","to","do","?","with","this","as","a","start","point",",","this","documentary","meet","people","who","have","find","themselves","outside","the","modern",",","and","outside","the","traditional","life",",","which","other","might","find","strange","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Norwegian documentary about","documentary about humans","about humans relations","humans relations to","relations to time","to time ,","time , and",", and what","and what happens","what happens when","happens when someone","when someone decide","someone decide to","decide to jump","to jump off","jump off the","off the time","the time loop","time loop ,","loop , to",", to find","to find themselves","Some seeks out","seeks out excitement","out excitement and","excitement and discoveries","and discoveries ,","discoveries , others",", others want","others want piece","want piece and","piece and quite","Is n't this","n't this two","this two things","two things which","things which are","which are all","are all about","all about the","about the same","Finding your own","your own balance","own balance in","balance in life","in life ,","life , where",", where you","where you chose","you chose to","chose to do","to do with","do with your","with your life","your life what","life what you","what you want","you want to","want to do","With this as","this as a","as a starting","a starting point","starting point ,","point , this",", this documentary","this documentary meets","documentary meets people","meets people who","people who have","who have found","have found themselves","found themselves outside","themselves outside the","outside the modern","the modern ,","modern , and",", and outside","and outside the","outside the traditional","the traditional life","traditional life ,","life , which",", which others","which others might","others might find","might find strange"],"2grams":["Norwegian documentary","documentary about","about humans","humans relations","relations to","to time","time ,",", and","and what","what happens","happens when","when someone","someone decide","decide to","to jump","jump off","off the","the time","time loop","loop ,",", to","to find","find themselves","Some seeks","seeks out","out excitement","excitement and","and discoveries","discoveries ,",", others","others want","want piece","piece and","and quite","Is n't","n't this","this two","two things","things which","which are","are all","all about","about the","the same","Finding your","your own","own balance","balance in","in life","life ,",", where","where you","you chose","chose to","to do","do with","with your","your life","life what","what you","you want","want to","to do","With this","this as","as a","a starting","starting point","point ,",", this","this documentary","documentary meets","meets people","people who","who have","have found","found themselves","themselves outside","outside the","the modern","modern ,",", and","and outside","outside the","the traditional","traditional life","life ,",", which","which others","others might","might find","find strange"]}

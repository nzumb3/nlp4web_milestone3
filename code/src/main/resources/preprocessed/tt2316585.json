{"title":"Shadow of a Hero","plot":"Laurits Munch-Petersen sets out to discover how the death of his grandfather in the Spanish Civil War could split up the entire family for three generations. \"Shadow of a Hero\" is a universal story about the consequences of war. A personal story about a war hero who chose to volunteer in the international brigades for his idealistic beliefs - like many other intellectuals at the time - but he left his pregnant wife and little daugther in the middle of the night without saying goodbye. Was he a hero or a coward? It's a story about the other side of the medal. The grandchild and director of the film takes us on a journey through the family secrets of three generations - a story of a wife left behind and children being abandoned by their devastated mother. All a consequence of the heroic deeds of the grandfather and his early death. Since childhood Laurits heard about his famous grandfather, but as a modern family man Laurits decides to break the taboo in order to reunite his family. Oscar nominated documentarist Anders \"Burma VJ\" Østergaard and Student Oscar winning director Laurits Munch-Petersen wrote the script for this modern genre mix of documentary, reenactments and archive material.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["Laurit","Munch-Petersen","set","out","to","discov","how","the","death","of","his","grandfath","in","the","Spanish","Civil","War","could","split","up","the","entir","famili","for","three","generat",".","\"","Shadow","of","a","Hero","\"","is","a","univers","stori","about","the","consequ","of","war",".","A","person","stori","about","a","war","hero","who","chose","to","volunt","in","the","intern","brigad","for","his","idealist","belief","-","like","mani","other","intellectu","at","the","time","-","but","he","left","his","pregnant","wife","and","littl","daugther","in","the","middl","of","the","night","without","say","goodby",".","Was","he","a","hero","or","a","coward","?","It","'s","a","stori","about","the","other","side","of","the","medal",".","The","grandchild","and","director","of","the","film","take","us","on","a","journey","through","the","famili","secret","of","three","generat","-","a","stori","of","a","wife","left","behind","and","children","be","abandon","by","their","devast","mother",".","All","a","consequ","of","the","heroic","deed","of","the","grandfath","and","his","earli","death",".","Sinc","childhood","Laurit","heard","about","his","famous","grandfath",",","but","as","a","modern","famili","man","Laurit","decid","to","break","the","taboo","in","order","to","reunit","his","famili",".","Oscar","nomin","documentarist","Ander","\"","Burma","VJ","\"","Østergaard","and","Student","Oscar","win","director","Laurit","Munch-Petersen","wrote","the","script","for","this","modern","genr","mix","of","documentari",",","reenact","and","archiv","materi","."],"lemmas":["Laurits","Munch-Petersen","set","out","to","discover","how","the","death","of","he","grandfather","in","the","Spanish","Civil","War","could","split","up","the","entire","family","for","three","generation",".","``","Shadow","of","a","hero","''","be","a","universal","story","about","the","consequence","of","war",".","a","personal","story","about","a","war","hero","who","choose","to","volunteer","in","the","international","brigade","for","he","idealistic","belief","-","like","many","other","intellectual","at","the","time","-","but","he","leave","he","pregnant","wife","and","little","daugther","in","the","middle","of","the","night","without","say","goodbye",".","be","he","a","hero","or","a","coward","?","it","be","a","story","about","the","other","side","of","the","medal",".","the","grandchild","and","director","of","the","film","take","we","on","a","journey","through","the","family","secret","of","three","generation","-","a","story","of","a","wife","leave","behind","and","child","be","abandon","by","they","devastate","mother",".","all","a","consequence","of","the","heroic","deed","of","the","grandfather","and","he","early","death",".","since","childhood","Laurits","hear","about","he","famous","grandfather",",","but","as","a","modern","family","man","Laurits","decide","to","break","the","taboo","in","order","to","reunite","he","family",".","Oscar","nominate","documentarist","Anders","``","burma","vj","''","Østergaard","and","Student","Oscar","win","director","Laurits","Munch-Petersen","write","the","script","for","this","modern","genre","mix","of","documentary",",","reenactment","and","archive","material","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Laurits Munch-Petersen sets","Munch-Petersen sets out","sets out to","out to discover","to discover how","discover how the","how the death","the death of","death of his","of his grandfather","his grandfather in","grandfather in the","in the Spanish","the Spanish Civil","Spanish Civil War","Civil War could","War could split","could split up","split up the","up the entire","the entire family","entire family for","family for three","for three generations","\" Shadow of","Shadow of a","of a Hero","a Hero \"","Hero \" is","\" is a","is a universal","a universal story","universal story about","story about the","about the consequences","the consequences of","consequences of war","A personal story","personal story about","story about a","about a war","a war hero","war hero who","hero who chose","who chose to","chose to volunteer","to volunteer in","volunteer in the","in the international","the international brigades","international brigades for","brigades for his","for his idealistic","his idealistic beliefs","idealistic beliefs -","beliefs -

{"title":"Chloroplasts: Genes on the Move","plot":"Genetic information in cells does not only exist in the nucleus, but also in chloroplasts and mitochondria. Between the latter two, there appears to be quite a lively exchange of genes. Plant scientists investigate how genes can migrate from the chloroplasts to the nucleus, thus simulating evolution in the laboratory.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Genet","inform","in","cell","doe","not","onli","exist","in","the","nucleus",",","but","also","in","chloroplast","and","mitochondria",".","Between","the","latter","two",",","there","appear","to","be","quit","a","live","exchang","of","gene",".","Plant","scientist","investig","how","gene","can","migrat","from","the","chloroplast","to","the","nucleus",",","thus","simul","evolut","in","the","laboratori","."],"lemmas":["genetic","information","in","cell","do","not","only","exist","in","the","nucleus",",","but","also","in","chloroplast","and","mitochondria",".","between","the","latter","two",",","there","appear","to","be","quite","a","lively","exchange","of","gene",".","plant","scientist","investigate","how","gene","can","migrate","from","the","chloroplast","to","the","nucleus",",","thus","simulate","evolution","in","the","laboratory","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Genetic information in","information in cells","in cells does","cells does not","does not only","not only exist","only exist in","exist in the","in the nucleus","the nucleus ,","nucleus , but",", but also","but also in","also in chloroplasts","in chloroplasts and","chloroplasts and mitochondria","Between the latter","the latter two","latter two ,","two , there",", there appears","there appears to","appears to be","to be quite","be quite a","quite a lively","a lively exchange","lively exchange of","exchange of genes","Plant scientists investigate","scientists investigate how","investigate how genes","how genes can","genes can migrate","can migrate from","migrate from the","from the chloroplasts","the chloroplasts to","chloroplasts to the","to the nucleus","the nucleus ,","nucleus , thus",", thus simulating","thus simulating evolution","simulating evolution in","evolution in the","in the laboratory"],"2grams":["Genetic information","information in","in cells","cells does","does not","not only","only exist","exist in","in the","the nucleus","nucleus ,",", but","but also","also in","in chloroplasts","chloroplasts and","and mitochondria","Between the","the latter","latter two","two ,",", there","there appears","appears to","to be","be quite","quite a","a lively","lively exchange","exchange of","of genes","Plant scientists","scientists investigate","investigate how","how genes","genes can","can migrate","migrate from","from the","the chloroplasts","chloroplasts to","to the","the nucleus","nucleus ,",", thus","thus simulating","simulating evolution","evolution in","in the","the laboratory"]}

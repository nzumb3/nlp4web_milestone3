{"title":"Karobaar: The Business of Love","plot":"Wealthy Rajiv Sinha and middle-classed Amar Saxena are two childhood friends, with similar likes, and tastes. Their similar habits lead them to being in love with the same woman - Seema, who loves Amar, and is willing to marry him no matter what. Rajiv attempts to offer money to Sapna's guardian so that he can marry her, in vain though. When Rajiv attempts to convince Amar that Sapna is being brought up by a prostitute by the name of Ratnabai, Amar is adamant, and marries Sapna, and takes her home to his brother and his family, where they are not welcomed, and asked to leave. Rajiv and Amar stop seeing each other, and regard each other as bitter enemies. Amar and Seema manage to exist, with Amar going on to become a successful prosecution attorney. Then they get the news that Rajiv has been charged with killing a young woman named Neelam Mehta. Amar is delighted for he will be given a chance to teach Rajiv a lesson, and possibly sentence him to death. During the trial, Rajiv's only defense is that he was with another woman when this murder was committed, but refuses to name this woman. While the judge is pronouncing the sentence, the court proceedings are interrupted when Rajiv's defense lawyer produces the woman who was with Rajiv that entire night - Mrs. Seema Saxena.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Wealthi","Rajiv","Sinha","and","middle-class","Amar","Saxena","are","two","childhood","friend",",","with","similar","like",",","and","tast",".","Their","similar","habit","lead","them","to","be","in","love","with","the","same","woman","-","Seema",",","who","love","Amar",",","and","is","will","to","marri","him","no","matter","what",".","Rajiv","attempt","to","offer","money","to","Sapna","'s","guardian","so","that","he","can","marri","her",",","in","vain","though",".","When","Rajiv","attempt","to","convinc","Amar","that","Sapna","is","be","brought","up","by","a","prostitut","by","the","name","of","Ratnabai",",","Amar","is","adam",",","and","marri","Sapna",",","and","take","her","home","to","his","brother","and","his","famili",",","where","they","are","not","welcom",",","and","ask","to","leav",".","Rajiv","and","Amar","stop","see","each","other",",","and","regard","each","other","as","bitter","enemi",".","Amar","and","Seema","manag","to","exist",",","with","Amar","go","on","to","becom","a","success","prosecut","attorney",".","Then","they","get","the","news","that","Rajiv","has","been","charg","with","kill","a","young","woman","name","Neelam","Mehta",".","Amar","is","delight","for","he","will","be","given","a","chanc","to","teach","Rajiv","a","lesson",",","and","possibl","sentenc","him","to","death",".","Dure","the","trial",",","Rajiv","'s","onli","defens","is","that","he","was","with","anoth","woman","when","this","murder","was","commit",",","but","refus","to","name","this","woman",".","While","the","judg","is","pronounc","the","sentenc",",","the","court","proceed","are","interrupt","when","Rajiv","'s","defens","lawyer","produc","the","woman","who","was","with","Rajiv","that","entir","night","-","Mrs.","Seema","Saxena","."],"lemmas":["Wealthy","Rajiv","Sinha","and","middle-classed","Amar","Saxena","be","two","childhood","friend",",","with","similar","likes",",","and","taste",".","they","similar","habit","lead","they","to","be","in","love","with","the","same","woman","-","Seema",",","who","love","Amar",",","and","be","willing","to","marry","he","no","matter","what",".","Rajiv","attempt","to","offer","money","to","Sapna","'s","guardian","so","that","he","can","marry","she",",","in","vain","though",".","when","Rajiv","attempt","to","convince","Amar","that","Sapna","be","be","bring","up","by","a","prostitute","by","the","name","of","Ratnabai",",","Amar","be","adamant",",","and","marry","Sapna",",","and","take","she","home","to","he","brother","and","he","family",",","where","they","be","not","welcome",",","and","ask","to","leave",".","Rajiv","and","Amar","stop","see","each","other",",","and","regard","each","other","as","bitter","enemy",".","Amar","and","Seema","manage","to","exist",",","with","Amar","go","on","to","become","a","successful","prosecution","attorney",".","then","they","get","the","news","that","Rajiv","have","be","charge","with","kill","a","young","woman","name","Neelam","Mehta",".","Amar","be","delighted","for","he","will","be","give","a","chance","to","teach","Rajiv","a","lesson",",","and","possibly","sentence","he","to","death",".","during","the","trial",",","Rajiv","'s","only","defense","be","that","he","be","with","another","woman","when","this","murder","be","commit",",","but","refuse","to","name","this","woman",".","while","the","judge","be","pronounce","the","sentence",",","the","court","proceedings","be","interrupt","when","Rajiv","'s","defense","lawyer","produce","the","woman","who","be","with","Rajiv","that","entire","night","-","Mrs.","Seema","Saxena","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wealthy Rajiv Sinha","Rajiv Sinha and","Sinha and middle-classed","and middle-classed Amar","middle-classed Amar Saxena","Amar Saxena are","Saxena are two","are two childhood","two childhood friends","childhood friends ,","friends , with",", with similar","with similar likes","similar likes ,","likes , and",", and tastes","Their similar habits","similar habits lead","habits lead them","lead them to","them to being","to being in","being in love","in love with","love with the","with the same","the same woman","same woman -","woman -

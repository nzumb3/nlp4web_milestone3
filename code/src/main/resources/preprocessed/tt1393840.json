{"title":"Desire","plot":"Writer Ralph sits at the top of his London house, crippled by agoraphobia, emasculated by the success of his soap-star wife Phoebe, unable to complete the screenplay that will rescue his reputation and his family. With a deadline looming, he invites French student Nene to look after the children, little guessing where it will lead. Nene takes her place in the home, but is she carer, muse, lover or thief? As Ralph succumbs to his desire, Nene embarks on a passionate relationship with both husband and wife which leads all three into areas of emotional and creative transgression. Who is using whom? Who is writing the film called Desire? And where will it end?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Writer","Ralph","sit","at","the","top","of","his","London","hous",",","crippl","by","agoraphobia",",","emascul","by","the","success","of","his","soap-star","wife","Phoeb",",","unabl","to","complet","the","screenplay","that","will","rescu","his","reput","and","his","famili",".","With","a","deadlin","loom",",","he","invit","French","student","Nene","to","look","after","the","children",",","littl","guess","where","it","will","lead",".","Nene","take","her","place","in","the","home",",","but","is","she","carer",",","muse",",","lover","or","thief","?","As","Ralph","succumb","to","his","desir",",","Nene","embark","on","a","passion","relationship","with","both","husband","and","wife","which","lead","all","three","into","area","of","emot","and","creativ","transgress",".","Who","is","use","whom","?","Who","is","write","the","film","call","Desir","?","And","where","will","it","end","?"],"lemmas":["Writer","Ralph","sit","at","the","top","of","he","London","house",",","cripple","by","agoraphobia",",","emasculate","by","the","success","of","he","soap-star","wife","Phoebe",",","unable","to","complete","the","screenplay","that","will","rescue","he","reputation","and","he","family",".","with","a","deadline","loom",",","he","invite","french","student","Nene","to","look","after","the","child",",","little","guess","where","it","will","lead",".","Nene","take","she","place","in","the","home",",","but","be","she","carer",",","muse",",","lover","or","thief","?","as","Ralph","succumb","to","he","desire",",","Nene","embark","on","a","passionate","relationship","with","both","husband","and","wife","which","lead","all","three","into","area","of","emotional","and","creative","transgression",".","who","be","use","whom","?","who","be","write","the","film","call","Desire","?","and","where","will","it","end","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Writer

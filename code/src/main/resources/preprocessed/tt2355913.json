{"title":"The Tale of the Voodoo Prostitute","plot":"In the Tale of the Voodoo Prostitute, a master manipulator and hustler by the name of Fleetwood Deville dispenses heinous wrong-doings to nearly everyone that crosses his path. One particular female managed to meet and exceed any expectation of evil. She cursed Fleetwood to a fate even worse than death: impotence. With his harem of beautiful women and killers, Fleetwood must rival neighboring pimps to free himself from a curse that if left undone would not only take his manhood, but possibly his life. This film is based in the mean streets and interminglings of the Dallas/Ft. Worth area.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["In","the","Tale","of","the","Voodoo","Prostitut",",","a","master","manipul","and","hustler","by","the","name","of","Fleetwood","Devill","dispens","heinous","wrong-do","to","near","everyon","that","cross","his","path",".","One","particular","femal","manag","to","meet","and","exceed","ani","expect","of","evil",".","She","curs","Fleetwood","to","a","fate","even","wors","than","death",":","impot",".","With","his","harem","of","beauti","women","and","killer",",","Fleetwood","must","rival","neighbor","pimp","to","free","himself","from","a","curs","that","if","left","undon","would","not","onli","take","his","manhood",",","but","possibl","his","life",".","This","film","is","base","in","the","mean","street","and","intermingl","of","the","Dallas/Ft",".","Worth","area","."],"lemmas":["in","the","tale","of","the","Voodoo","Prostitute",",","a","master","manipulator","and","hustler","by","the","name","of","Fleetwood","Deville","dispense","heinous","wrong-doings","to","nearly","everyone","that","cross","he","path",".","one","particular","female","manage","to","meet","and","exceed","any","expectation","of","evil",".","she","curse","Fleetwood","to","a","fate","even","worse","than","death",":","impotence",".","with","he","harem","of","beautiful","woman","and","killer",",","Fleetwood","must","rival","neighboring","pimp","to","free","himself","from","a","curse","that","if","left","undo","would","not","only","take","he","manhood",",","but","possibly","he","life",".","this","film","be","base","in","the","mean","street","and","intermingling","of","the","dallas/ft",".","worth","area","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the Tale","the Tale of","Tale of the","of the Voodoo","the Voodoo Prostitute","Voodoo Prostitute ,","Prostitute , a",", a master","a master manipulator","master manipulator and","manipulator and hustler","and hustler by","hustler by the","by the name","the name of","name of Fleetwood","of Fleetwood Deville","Fleetwood Deville dispenses","Deville dispenses heinous","dispenses heinous wrong-doings","heinous wrong-doings to","wrong-doings to nearly","to nearly everyone","nearly everyone that","everyone that crosses","that crosses his","crosses his path","One particular female","particular female managed","female managed to","managed to meet","to meet and","meet and exceed","and exceed any","exceed any expectation","any expectation of","expectation of evil","She cursed Fleetwood","cursed Fleetwood to","Fleetwood to a","to a fate","a fate even","fate even worse","even worse than","worse than death","than death :","death : impotence","With his harem","his harem of","harem of beautiful","of beautiful women","beautiful women and","women and killers","and killers ,","killers , Fleetwood",", Fleetwood must","Fleetwood must rival","must rival neighboring","rival neighboring pimps","neighboring pimps to","pimps to free","to free himself","free himself from","himself from a","from a curse","a curse that","curse that if","that if left","if left undone","left undone would","undone would not","would not only","not only take","only take his","take his manhood","his manhood ,","manhood , but",", but possibly","but possibly his","possibly his life","This film is","film is based","is based in","based in the","in the mean","the mean streets","mean streets and","streets and interminglings","and interminglings of","interminglings of the","of the Dallas/Ft"],"2grams":["In the","the Tale","Tale of","of the","the Voodoo","Voodoo Prostitute","Prostitute ,",", a","a master","master manipulator","manipulator and","and hustler","hustler by","by the","the name","name of","of Fleetwood","Fleetwood Deville","Deville dispenses","dispenses heinous","heinous wrong-doings","wrong-doings to","to nearly","nearly everyone","everyone that","that crosses","crosses his","his path","One particular","particular female","female managed","managed to","to meet","meet and","and exceed","exceed any","any expectation","expectation of","of evil","She cursed","cursed Fleetwood","Fleetwood to","to a","a fate","fate even","even worse","worse than","than death","death :",": impotence","With his","his harem","harem of","of beautiful","beautiful women","women and","and killers","killers ,",", Fleetwood","Fleetwood must","must rival","rival neighboring","neighboring pimps","pimps to","to free","free himself","himself from","from a","a curse","curse that","that if","if left","left undone","undone would","would not","not only","only take","take his","his manhood","manhood ,",", but","but possibly","possibly his","his life","This film","film is","is based","based in","in the","the mean","mean streets","streets and","and interminglings","interminglings of","of the","the Dallas/Ft","Worth area"]}

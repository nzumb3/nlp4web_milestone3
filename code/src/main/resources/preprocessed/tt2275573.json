{"title":"C'est la vie: The Chris J. Melnychuk Story","plot":"C'est La Vie: The Chris J. Melnychuk Story documents the award-winning animators battle with tongue cancer. Building on live footage from Chris's last, unfinished film, C'est La Vie was created posthumously through the collaboration of 19 animators from Quickdraw Animation Society in Calgary Canada. To honor Chris's legacy, all proceeds from the project go towards supporting the Chris J. Melnychuk Memorial Scholarship - encouraging emerging animators to develop their artistic practice.","genres":["Animation"," Documentary"," Biography"],"stems":["C'est","La","Vie",":","The","Chris","J.","Melnychuk","Stori","document","the","award-win","anim","battl","with","tongu","cancer",".","Build","on","live","footag","from","Chris","'s","last",",","unfinish","film",",","C'est","La","Vie","was","creat","posthum","through","the","collabor","of","19","anim","from","Quickdraw","Animat","Societi","in","Calgari","Canada",".","To","honor","Chris","'s","legaci",",","all","proceed","from","the","project","go","toward","support","the","Chris","J.","Melnychuk","Memori","Scholarship","-","encourag","emerg","anim","to","develop","their","artist","practic","."],"lemmas":["c'est","La","Vie",":","The","Chris","J.","Melnychuk","Story","document","the","award-winning","animator","battle","with","tongue","cancer",".","building","on","live","footage","from","Chris","'s","last",",","unfinished","film",",","C'est","La","Vie","be","create","posthumously","through","the","collaboration","of","19","animator","from","Quickdraw","Animation","Society","in","Calgary","Canada",".","to","honor","Chris","'s","legacy",",","all","proceeds","from","the","project","go","towards","support","the","Chris","J.","Melnychuk","Memorial","Scholarship","-","encouraging","emerge","animator","to","develop","they","artistic","practice","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["C'est La Vie","La Vie :","Vie : The",": The Chris","The Chris J.","Chris J.

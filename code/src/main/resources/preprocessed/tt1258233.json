{"title":"River of No Return","plot":"Frances Daingangan is a 45-year old mother of three who comes from the remote community of Ramingining in North East Arnhem land. Like many young girls, Frances dreamed of being a movie star - a dream that came true when Rolf de Heer cast her in the lead female role of Nowalingu in Ten Canoes. Her journey from traditional tribal life to red carpets and awards ceremonies is unlike any other. It's a fascinating and unique story as Frances learns to overcome huge personal and cultural challenges. River of No Return is a story of change and transformation as Frances learns to move between the ancient life of the Yolgnu and modern world of the balanda (white culture).","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Franc","Daingangan","is","a","45-year","old","mother","of","three","who","come","from","the","remot","communiti","of","Ramingin","in","North","East","Arnhem","land",".","Like","mani","young","girl",",","Franc","dream","of","be","a","movi","star","-","a","dream","that","came","true","when","Rolf","de","Heer","cast","her","in","the","lead","femal","role","of","Nowalingu","in","Ten","Cano",".","Her","journey","from","tradit","tribal","life","to","red","carpet","and","award","ceremoni","is","unlik","ani","other",".","It","'s","a","fascin","and","uniqu","stori","as","Franc","learn","to","overcom","huge","person","and","cultur","challeng",".","River","of","No","Return","is","a","stori","of","chang","and","transform","as","Franc","learn","to","move","between","the","ancient","life","of","the","Yolgnu","and","modern","world","of","the","balanda","(","white","cultur",")","."],"lemmas":["Frances","Daingangan","be","a","45-year","old","mother","of","three","who","come","from","the","remote","community","of","Ramingining","in","North","East","Arnhem","land",".","like","many","young","girl",",","Frances","dream","of","be","a","movie","star","-","a","dream","that","come","true","when","Rolf","de","Heer","cast","she","in","the","lead","female","role","of","Nowalingu","in","ten","canoe",".","she","journey","from","traditional","tribal","life","to","red","carpet","and","award","ceremony","be","unlike","any","other",".","it","be","a","fascinating","and","unique","story","as","Frances","learn","to","overcome","huge","personal","and","cultural","challenge",".","river","of","no","return","be","a","story","of","change","and","transformation","as","Frances","learn","to","move","between","the","ancient","life","of","the","Yolgnu","and","modern","world","of","the","balanda","-lrb-","white","culture","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Frances Daingangan is","Daingangan is a","is a 45-year","a 45-year old","45-year old mother","old mother of","mother of three","of three who","three who comes","who comes from","comes from the","from the remote","the remote community","remote community of","community of Ramingining","of Ramingining in","Ramingining in North","in North East","North East Arnhem","East Arnhem land","Like many young","many young girls","young girls ,","girls , Frances",", Frances dreamed","Frances dreamed of","dreamed of being","of being a","being a movie","a movie star","movie star -","star -

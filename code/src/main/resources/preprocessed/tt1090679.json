{"title":"Running on Empty Dreams","plot":"Young and athletic Sydney Harris finds out that she has six months to live unless she and her husband can come up with the money for her medical treatment. Sounds simple enough; get the money, save her life. But her underpaid, working class husband can't afford the treatment. And time is ticking away. As Sydney begins to seek out a means to save her life, she begins to question her existence and does some soul searching, only to find herself falling in love with a single mom in the neighborhood that Sydney and her family have just moved into. Sydney is then forced to choose between her religious upbringing, her husband and son, and a love that she hides, all while fighting a losing battle to save her own life.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Young","and","athlet","Sydney","Harri","find","out","that","she","has","six","month","to","live","unless","she","and","her","husband","can","come","up","with","the","money","for","her","medic","treatment",".","Sound","simpl","enough",";","get","the","money",",","save","her","life",".","But","her","underpaid",",","work","class","husband","ca","n't","afford","the","treatment",".","And","time","is","tick","away",".","As","Sydney","begin","to","seek","out","a","mean","to","save","her","life",",","she","begin","to","question","her","exist","and","doe","some","soul","search",",","onli","to","find","herself","fall","in","love","with","a","singl","mom","in","the","neighborhood","that","Sydney","and","her","famili","have","just","move","into",".","Sydney","is","then","forc","to","choos","between","her","religi","upbring",",","her","husband","and","son",",","and","a","love","that","she","hide",",","all","while","fight","a","lose","battl","to","save","her","own","life","."],"lemmas":["young","and","athletic","Sydney","Harris","find","out","that","she","have","six","month","to","live","unless","she","and","she","husband","can","come","up","with","the","money","for","she","medical","treatment",".","sound","simple","enough",";","get","the","money",",","save","she","life",".","but","she","underpaid",",","work","class","husband","can","not","afford","the","treatment",".","and","time","be","tick","away",".","as","Sydney","begin","to","seek","out","a","means","to","save","she","life",",","she","begin","to","question","she","existence","and","do","some","soul","search",",","only","to","find","herself","fall","in","love","with","a","single","mom","in","the","neighborhood","that","Sydney","and","she","family","have","just","move","into",".","Sydney","be","then","force","to","choose","between","she","religious","upbringing",",","she","husband","and","son",",","and","a","love","that","she","hide",",","all","while","fight","a","lose","battle","to","save","she","own","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Young and athletic","and athletic Sydney","athletic Sydney Harris","Sydney Harris finds","Harris finds out","finds out that","out that she","that she has","she has six","has six months","six months to","months to live","to live unless","live unless she","unless she and","she and her","and her husband","her husband can","husband can come","can come up","come up with","up with the","with the money","the money for","money for her","for her medical","her medical treatment","Sounds simple enough","simple enough ;","enough ;

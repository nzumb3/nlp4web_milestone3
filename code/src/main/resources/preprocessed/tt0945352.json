{"title":"Junction","plot":"Michaela, a lost and lonely young woman, gets a mysterious message from the father she never knew, sending her on a journey to discover twisted family secrets. As she uncovers each piece of the puzzle, she descends even deeper into their warped world of pilgrims and pyromania. Dragged out to the desert, and pushed to the very edge, Michaela is forced to make a choice: preserve the delicate web that history has woven for her family, or strike out on her own and destroy the cycle of evil in her blood. That is, if she can survive the fire.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Michaela",",","a","lost","and","lone","young","woman",",","get","a","mysteri","messag","from","the","father","she","never","knew",",","send","her","on","a","journey","to","discov","twist","famili","secret",".","As","she","uncov","each","piec","of","the","puzzl",",","she","descend","even","deeper","into","their","warp","world","of","pilgrim","and","pyromania",".","Drag","out","to","the","desert",",","and","push","to","the","veri","edg",",","Michaela","is","forc","to","make","a","choic",":","preserv","the","delic","web","that","histori","has","woven","for","her","famili",",","or","strike","out","on","her","own","and","destroy","the","cycl","of","evil","in","her","blood",".","That","is",",","if","she","can","surviv","the","fire","."],"lemmas":["Michaela",",","a","lost","and","lonely","young","woman",",","get","a","mysterious","message","from","the","father","she","never","know",",","send","she","on","a","journey","to","discover","twisted","family","secret",".","as","she","uncover","each","piece","of","the","puzzle",",","she","descend","even","deeper","into","they","warped","world","of","pilgrim","and","pyromania",".","drag","out","to","the","desert",",","and","push","to","the","very","edge",",","Michaela","be","force","to","make","a","choice",":","preserve","the","delicate","web","that","history","have","weave","for","she","family",",","or","strike","out","on","she","own","and","destroy","the","cycle","of","evil","in","she","blood",".","that","be",",","if","she","can","survive","the","fire","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Michaela , a",", a lost","a lost and","lost and lonely","and lonely young","lonely young woman","young woman ,","woman , gets",", gets a","gets a mysterious","a mysterious message","mysterious message from","message from the","from the father","the father she","father she never","she never knew","never knew ,","knew , sending",", sending her","sending her on","her on a","on a journey","a journey to","journey to discover","to discover twisted","discover twisted family","twisted family secrets","As she uncovers","she uncovers each","uncovers each piece","each piece of","piece of the","of the puzzle","the puzzle ,","puzzle , she",", she descends","she descends even","descends even deeper","even deeper into","deeper into their","into their warped","their warped world","warped world of","world of pilgrims","of pilgrims and","pilgrims and pyromania","Dragged out to","out to the","to the desert","the desert ,","desert , and",", and pushed","and pushed to","pushed to the","to the very","the very edge","very edge ,","edge , Michaela",", Michaela is","Michaela is forced","is forced to","forced to make","to make a","make a choice","a choice :","choice : preserve",": preserve the","preserve the delicate","the delicate web","delicate web that","web that history","that history has","history has woven","has woven for","woven for her","for her family","her family ,","family , or",", or strike","or strike out","strike out on","out on her","on her own","her own and","own and destroy","and destroy the","destroy the cycle","the cycle of","cycle of evil","of evil in","evil in her","in her blood","That is ,","is , if",", if she","if she can","she can survive","can survive the","survive the fire"],"2grams":["Michaela ,",", a","a lost","lost and","and lonely","lonely young","young woman","woman ,",", gets","gets a","a mysterious","mysterious message","message from","from the","the father","father she","she never","never knew","knew ,",", sending","sending her","her on","on a","a journey","journey to","to discover","discover twisted","twisted family","family secrets","As she","she uncovers","uncovers each","each piece","piece of","of the","the puzzle","puzzle ,",", she","she descends","descends even","even deeper","deeper into","into their","their warped","warped world","world of","of pilgrims","pilgrims and","and pyromania","Dragged out","out to","to the","the desert","desert ,",", and","and pushed","pushed to","to the","the very","very edge","edge ,",", Michaela","Michaela is","is forced","forced to","to make","make a","a choice","choice :",": preserve","preserve the","the delicate","delicate web","web that","that history","history has","has woven","woven for","for her","her family","family ,",", or","or strike","strike out","out on","on her","her own","own and","and destroy","destroy the","the cycle","cycle of","of evil","evil in","in her","her blood","That is","is ,",", if","if she","she can","can survive","survive the","the fire"]}

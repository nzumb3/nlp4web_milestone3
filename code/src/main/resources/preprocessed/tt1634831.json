{"title":"Our School","plot":"Labeled segregation by opponents and equal opportunity by supporters, OUR SCHOOL is the story of the establishment of Canada's first Africentric School in Toronto that divided a city and unleashed a fury of emotions. At the center of the story is the struggle of two women, Donna Harrow and Angela Wilson, to make the school a reality. On a broader level, the film takes a look at the underlying issues of discrimination and racism in a newly emerging multi-racial society. The documentary forces us to look at our past and our own prejudices to understand the raison d'etre for an africentric school.","genres":["Documentary"," History","

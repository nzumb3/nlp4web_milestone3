{"title":"Il suono instabile della libert√†","plot":"'The Instabile sound of freedom' is about music dressed in ideals, values and utopia: the Italian Instabile Orchestra is a band without a leader, no conductor, it was born free and lives free as the music they play. Dragged into a road movie following the Orchestra in an ideal tour, the audience take part not only in concerts but also in conflicts and confrontation discovering that this kind of free democracy makes Instabile theatrical, folk, jazz rough, rigorous, formal, solemn, fun, with swing... it depends only on who is driving the bus at this stage through the streets of the world.","genres":["Documentary","

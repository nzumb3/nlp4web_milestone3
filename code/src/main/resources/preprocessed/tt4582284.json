{"title":"Jeff Lynne's ELO at Hyde Park","plot":"On a sunny day in September, Jeff Lynne, head honcho of 70s hit-making band ELO took to the stage in London's Hyde Park and, with the help of his backing band and the strings of the BBC Concert Orchestra, brought to a close Radio 2's Live in Hyde Park annual festival. After an absence from the live stage for 28 years, this headline set by Jeff Lynne's ELO was a much-anticipated and talked-about event and... he did not disappoint. In front of 50,000 people, Jeff Lynne delivered a rousing and crowd-pleasing string of the Electric Light Orchestra's chart-topping hits, including Livin' Thing, Sweet Talkin' Woman, Don't Bring Me Down, Mr Blue Sky, and Roll Over Beethoven. And there was also a special treat, Jeff's touching tribute to his band buddies from the ultimate supergroup of all time, Traveling Wilburys, with his performance of their 1988 hit Handle With Care All in all, a memorable night and a fantastic return to the live arena for Mr Jeff Lynne's ELO!","genres":["Music"],"stems":["On","a","sunni","day","in","Septemb",",","Jeff","Lynn",",","head","honcho","of","70s","hit-mak","band","ELO","took","to","the","stage","in","London","'s","Hyde","Park","and",",","with","the","help","of","his","back","band","and","the","string","of","the","BBC","Concert","Orchestra",",","brought","to","a","close","Radio","2","'s","Live","in","Hyde","Park","annual","festiv",".","After","an","absenc","from","the","live","stage","for","28","year",",","this","headlin","set","by","Jeff","Lynn","'s","ELO","was","a","much-anticip","and","talked-about","event","and","...","he","did","not","disappoint",".","In","front","of","50,000","peopl",",","Jeff","Lynn","deliv","a","rous","and","crowd-pleas","string","of","the","Electric","Light","Orchestra","'s","chart-top","hit",",","includ","Livin","'","Thing",",","Sweet","Talkin","'","Woman",",","Do","n't","Bring","Me","Down",",","Mr","Blue","Ski",",","and","Roll","Over","Beethoven",".","And","there","was","also","a","special","treat",",","Jeff","'s","touch","tribut","to","his","band","buddi","from","the","ultim","supergroup","of","all","time",",","Travel","Wilburi",",","with","his","perform","of","their","1988","hit","Handl","With","Care","All","in","all",",","a","memor","night","and","a","fantast","return","to","the","live","arena","for","Mr","Jeff","Lynn","'s","ELO","!"],"lemmas":["on","a","sunny","day","in","September",",","Jeff","Lynne",",","head","honcho","of","70s","hit-making","band","ELO","take","to","the","stage","in","London","'s","Hyde","Park","and",",","with","the","help","of","he","backing","band","and","the","string","of","the","BBC","Concert","Orchestra",",","bring","to","a","close","Radio","2","'s","Live","in","Hyde","Park","annual","festival",".","after","a","absence","from","the","live","stage","for","28","year",",","this","headline","set","by","Jeff","Lynne","'s","ELO","be","a","much-anticipated","and","talked-about","event","and","...","he","do","not","disappoint",".","in","front","of","50,000","people",",","Jeff","Lynne","deliver","a","rousing","and","crowd-pleasing","string","of","the","Electric","Light","Orchestra","'s","chart-topping","hit",",","include","Livin","'","Thing",",","Sweet","Talkin","'","Woman",",","do","not","bring","Me","Down",",","Mr","Blue","Sky",",","and","Roll","Over","Beethoven",".","and","there","be","also","a","special","treat",",","Jeff","'s","touch","tribute","to","he","band","buddy","from","the","ultimate","supergroup","of","all","time",",","travel","Wilburys",",","with","he","performance","of","they","1988","hit","handle","with","Care","All","in","all",",","a","memorable","night","and","a","fantastic","return","to","the","live","arena","for","Mr","Jeff","Lynne","'s","ELO","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On

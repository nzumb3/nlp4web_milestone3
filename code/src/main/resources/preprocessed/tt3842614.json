{"title":"The Intent","plot":"Gunz (Dylan Duffus) is thrust into a world of excitement when he joins the TIC crew. The crew, led by the ruthless Hoodz (Scorcher), goes from low level weed peddling to full on armed robberies within a fortnight. Their new found infamy affords them a life of guns, drugs, and girls but they also catch the attention of the police and a rival gang. To make matters worse they have been infiltrated by an undercover police officer. Does he have \"THE INTENT\" to remain a criminal or abide by his oath to the force?","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Gunz","(","Dylan","Duffus",")","is","thrust","into","a","world","of","excit","when","he","join","the","TIC","crew",".","The","crew",",","led","by","the","ruthless","Hoodz","(","Scorcher",")",",","goe","from","low","level","weed","peddl","to","full","on","arm","robberi","within","a","fortnight",".","Their","new","found","infami","afford","them","a","life","of","gun",",","drug",",","and","girl","but","they","also","catch","the","attent","of","the","polic","and","a","rival","gang",".","To","make","matter","wors","they","have","been","infiltr","by","an","undercov","polic","offic",".","Doe","he","have","\"","THE","INTENT","\"","to","remain","a","crimin","or","abid","by","his","oath","to","the","forc","?"],"lemmas":["Gunz","-lrb-","Dylan","Duffus","-rrb-","be","thrust","into","a","world","of","excitement","when","he","join","the","TIC","crew",".","the","crew",",","lead","by","the","ruthless","Hoodz","-lrb-","Scorcher","-rrb-",",","go","from","low","level","weed","peddle","to","full","on","armed","robbery","within","a","fortnight",".","they","new","find","infamy","afford","they","a","life","of","gun",",","drug",",","and","girl","but","they","also","catch","the","attention","of","the","police","and","a","rival","gang",".","to","make","matter","worse","they","have","be","infiltrate","by","a","undercover","police","officer",".","do","he","have","``","the","intent","''","to","remain","a","criminal","or","abide","by","he","oath","to","the","force","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gunz ( Dylan","( Dylan Duffus","Dylan Duffus )","Duffus ) is",") is thrust","is thrust into","thrust into a","into a world","a world of","world of excitement","of excitement when","excitement when he","when he joins","he joins the","joins the TIC","the TIC crew","The crew ,","crew , led",", led by","led by the","by the ruthless","the ruthless Hoodz","ruthless Hoodz (","Hoodz ( Scorcher","( Scorcher )","Scorcher ) ,",") , goes",", goes from","goes from low","from low level","low level weed","level weed peddling","weed peddling to","peddling to full","to full on","full on armed","on armed robberies","armed robberies within","robberies within a","within a fortnight","Their new found","new found infamy","found infamy affords","infamy affords them","affords them a","them a life","a life of","life of guns","of guns ,","guns , drugs",", drugs ,","drugs , and",", and girls","and girls but","girls but they","but they also","they also catch","also catch the","catch the attention","the attention of","attention of the","of the police","the police and","police and a","and a rival","a rival gang","To make matters","make matters worse","matters worse they","worse they have","they have been","have been infiltrated","been infiltrated by","infiltrated by an","by an undercover","an undercover police","undercover police officer","Does he have","he have \"","have \" THE","\" THE INTENT","THE INTENT \"","INTENT \" to","\" to remain","to remain a","remain a criminal","a criminal or","criminal or abide","or abide by","abide by his","by his oath","his oath to","oath to the","to the force"],"2grams":["Gunz (","( Dylan","Dylan Duffus","Duffus )",") is","is thrust","thrust into","into a","a world","world of","of excitement","excitement when","when he","he joins","joins the","the TIC","TIC crew","The crew","crew ,",", led","led by","by the","the ruthless","ruthless Hoodz","Hoodz (","( Scorcher","Scorcher )",") ,",", goes","goes from","from low","low level","level weed","weed peddling","peddling to","to full","full on","on armed","armed robberies","robberies within","within a","a fortnight","Their new","new found","found infamy","infamy affords","affords them","them a","a life","life of","of guns","guns ,",", drugs","drugs ,",", and","and girls","girls but","but they","they also","also catch","catch the","the attention","attention of","of the","the police","police and","and a","a rival","rival gang","To make","make matters","matters worse","worse they","they have","have been","been infiltrated","infiltrated by","by an","an undercover","undercover police","police officer","Does he","he have","have \"","\" THE","THE INTENT","INTENT \"","\" to","to remain","remain a","a criminal","criminal or","or abide","abide by","by his","his oath","oath to","to the","the force"]}

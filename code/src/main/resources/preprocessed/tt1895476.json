{"title":"Memories in March","plot":"Delhi-based Arati Mishra believed her worst day was when she was divorced from her U.S.-based husband, Suresh, until she got the news that her Kolkata-based son, Siddhartha, had been killed in a vehicular accident. She travels to Kolkata; is received at the airport by her son's co-worker, Sahana Choudhury, and accompanies her to the crematorium. After the cremation, she is then taken to the guest-house where her son used to live, and told that Siddhartha had been at a party, had not only consumed considerable alcohol but had also insisted on driving, and met with a fatal accident. The next day, she accompanies Sahana to her son's place of employment where she meets some of the staff and signs some documents, but ends up distressed when she is not permitted to take her son's belongings. Quite upset, blaming the office workers' for letting her son drive under the influence, she does not realize that she will be in for more shocks and surprises when she will find that her son had a secret life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Delhi-bas","Arati","Mishra","believ","her","worst","day","was","when","she","was","divorc","from","her","U.S.-base","husband",",","Suresh",",","until","she","got","the","news","that","her","Kolkata-bas","son",",","Siddhartha",",","had","been","kill","in","a","vehicular","accid",".","She","travel","to","Kolkata",";","is","receiv","at","the","airport","by","her","son","'s","co-work",",","Sahana","Choudhuri",",","and","accompani","her","to","the","crematorium",".","After","the","cremat",",","she","is","then","taken","to","the","guest-hous","where","her","son","use","to","live",",","and","told","that","Siddhartha","had","been","at","a","parti",",","had","not","onli","consum","consider","alcohol","but","had","also","insist","on","drive",",","and","met","with","a","fatal","accid",".","The","next","day",",","she","accompani","Sahana","to","her","son","'s","place","of","employ","where","she","meet","some","of","the","staff","and","sign","some","document",",","but","end","up","distress","when","she","is","not","permit","to","take","her","son","'s","belong",".","Quit","upset",",","blame","the","offic","worker","'","for","let","her","son","drive","under","the","influenc",",","she","doe","not","realiz","that","she","will","be","in","for","more","shock","and","surpris","when","she","will","find","that","her","son","had","a","secret","life","."],"lemmas":["delhi-based","Arati","Mishra","believe","she","worst","day","be","when","she","be","divorce","from","she","u.s.-based","husband",",","Suresh",",","until","she","get","the","news","that","she","kolkata-based","son",",","Siddhartha",",","have","be","kill","in","a","vehicular","accident",".","she","travel","to","Kolkata",";","be","receive","at","the","airport","by","she","son","'s","co-worker",",","Sahana","Choudhury",",","and","accompany","she","to","the","crematorium",".","after","the","cremation",",","she","be","then","take","to","the","guest-house","where","she","son","use","to","live",",","and","tell","that","Siddhartha","have","be","at","a","party",",","have","not","only","consume","considerable","alcohol","but","have","also","insist","on","driving",",","and","meet","with","a","fatal","accident",".","the","next","day",",","she","accompany","Sahana","to","she","son","'s","place","of","employment","where","she","meet","some","of","the","staff","and","sign","some","document",",","but","end","up","distressed","when","she","be","not","permit","to","take","she","son","'s","belongings",".","quite","upset",",","blame","the","office","worker","'","for","let","she","son","drive","under","the","influence",",","she","do","not","realize","that","she","will","be","in","for","more","shock","and","surprise","when","she","will","find","that","she","son","have","a","secret","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Delhi-based Arati Mishra","Arati Mishra believed","Mishra believed her","believed her worst","her worst day","worst day was","day was when","was when she","when she was","she was divorced","was divorced from","divorced from her","from her U.S.-based","her U.S.-based husband","U.S.-based husband ,","husband , Suresh",", Suresh ,","Suresh , until",", until she","until she got","she got the","got the news","the news that","news that her","that her Kolkata-based","her Kolkata-based son","Kolkata-based son ,","son , Siddhartha",", Siddhartha ,","Siddhartha , had",", had been","had been killed","been killed in","killed in a","in a vehicular","a vehicular accident","She travels to","travels to Kolkata","to Kolkata ;","Kolkata ;

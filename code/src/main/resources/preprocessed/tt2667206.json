{"title":"Bukit Brown Voices","plot":"Singapore's oldest cemetery is in an area known as BUKIT BROWN. In 2011, the Singapore Government announced that the construction of an 8-lane roadway cutting through the heart of the area would begin in two years. In its final year as an intact cemetery - during the grave-sweeping festival of Qing Ming - we speak to the descendants of those buried in Bukit Brown's jungled hills and witness age-old rituals passed down through generations. Through their voices, we see the cemetery, not as a place of the dead, but a site filled with memories and living heritage. Revealed too is the unexpected beauty of a Singapore that visitors rarely see - a secret garden hidden behind the gleaming towers of this Asian metropolis.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Singapor","'s","oldest","cemeteri","is","in","an","area","known","as","BUKIT","BROWN",".","In","2011",",","the","Singapor","Govern","announc","that","the","construct","of","an","8-lane","roadway","cut","through","the","heart","of","the","area","would","begin","in","two","year",".","In","it","final","year","as","an","intact","cemeteri","-","dure","the","grave-sweep","festiv","of","Qing","Ming","-","we","speak","to","the","descend","of","those","buri","in","Bukit","Brown","'s","jungl","hill","and","wit","age-old","ritual","pass","down","through","generat",".","Through","their","voic",",","we","see","the","cemeteri",",","not","as","a","place","of","the","dead",",","but","a","site","fill","with","memori","and","live","heritag",".","Reveal","too","is","the","unexpect","beauti","of","a","Singapor","that","visitor","rare","see","-","a","secret","garden","hidden","behind","the","gleam","tower","of","this","Asian","metropoli","."],"lemmas":["Singapore","'s","oldest","cemetery","be","in","a","area","know","as","BUKIT","BROWN",".","in","2011",",","the","Singapore","Government","announce","that","the","construction","of","a","8-lane","roadway","cut","through","the","heart","of","the","area","would","begin","in","two","year",".","in","its","final","year","as","a","intact","cemetery","-","during","the","grave-sweeping","festival","of","Qing","Ming","-","we","speak","to","the","descendant","of","those","bury","in","Bukit","Brown","'s","jungled","hill","and","witness","age-old","ritual","pass","down","through","generation",".","through","they","voice",",","we","see","the","cemetery",",","not","as","a","place","of","the","dead",",","but","a","site","fill","with","memory","and","live","heritage",".","reveal","too","be","the","unexpected","beauty","of","a","Singapore","that","visitor","rarely","see","-","a","secret","garden","hide","behind","the","gleaming","tower","of","this","asian","metropolis","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Singapore 's oldest","'s oldest cemetery","oldest cemetery is","cemetery is in","is in an","in an area","an area known","area known as","known as BUKIT","as BUKIT BROWN","In 2011 ,","2011 , the",", the Singapore","the Singapore Government","Singapore Government announced","Government announced that","announced that the","that the construction","the construction of","construction of an","of an 8-lane","an 8-lane roadway","8-lane roadway cutting","roadway cutting through","cutting through the","through the heart","the heart of","heart of the","of the area","the area would","area would begin","would begin in","begin in two","in two years","In its final","its final year","final year as","year as an","as an intact","an intact cemetery","intact cemetery -","cemetery -

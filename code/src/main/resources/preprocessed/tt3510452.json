{"title":"Misunderstood","plot":"Rome, 1984, Aria is nine-year-old girl. On the verge of divorce, Aria's infantile and selfish parents are too preoccupied with their careers and extra-marital affairs to properly tend to any of Aria's needs. While her two older sisters are pampered, Aria is treated with cold indifference. Yet she yearns to love and to be loved. At school, Aria excels academically but is considered a misfit by everyone. She is misunderstood. Aria finds comfort in her cat - Dac and in her best friend - Angelica. Thrown out of both parents' homes, abandoned by all, even her best friend, Aria finally reaches the limit of what she can bear. She makes an unexpected decision in her life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Rome",",","1984",",","Aria","is","nine-year-old","girl",".","On","the","verg","of","divorc",",","Aria","'s","infantil","and","selfish","parent","are","too","preoccupi","with","their","career","and","extra-marit","affair","to","proper","tend","to","ani","of","Aria","'s","need",".","While","her","two","older","sister","are","pamper",",","Aria","is","treat","with","cold","indiffer",".","Yet","she","yearn","to","love","and","to","be","love",".","At","school",",","Aria","excel","academ","but","is","consid","a","misfit","by","everyon",".","She","is","misunderstood",".","Aria","find","comfort","in","her","cat","-","Dac","and","in","her","best","friend","-","Angelica",".","Thrown","out","of","both","parent","'","home",",","abandon","by","all",",","even","her","best","friend",",","Aria","final","reach","the","limit","of","what","she","can","bear",".","She","make","an","unexpect","decis","in","her","life","."],"lemmas":["Rome",",","1984",",","aria","be","nine-year-old","girl",".","on","the","verge","of","divorce",",","Aria","'s","infantile","and","selfish","parent","be","too","preoccupy","with","they","career","and","extra-marital","affair","to","properly","tend","to","any","of","Aria","'s","need",".","while","she","two","older","sister","be","pampered",",","Aria","be","treat","with","cold","indifference",".","yet","she","yearn","to","love","and","to","be","love",".","at","school",",","aria","excel","academically","but","be","consider","a","misfit","by","everyone",".","she","be","misunderstand",".","aria","find","comfort","in","she","cat","-","dac","and","in","she","best","friend","-","Angelica",".","throw","out","of","both","parent","'","home",",","abandon","by","all",",","even","she","best","friend",",","aria","finally","reach","the","limit","of","what","she","can","bear",".","she","make","a","unexpected","decision","in","she","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Rome , 1984",", 1984 ,","1984 , Aria",", Aria is","Aria is nine-year-old","is nine-year-old girl","On the verge","the verge of","verge of divorce","of divorce ,","divorce , Aria",", Aria 's","Aria 's infantile","'s infantile and","infantile and selfish","and selfish parents","selfish parents are","parents are too","are too preoccupied","too preoccupied with","preoccupied with their","with their careers","their careers and","careers and extra-marital","and extra-marital affairs","extra-marital affairs to","affairs to properly","to properly tend","properly tend to","tend to any","to any of","any of Aria","of Aria 's","Aria 's needs","While her two","her two older","two older sisters","older sisters are","sisters are pampered","are pampered ,","pampered , Aria",", Aria is","Aria is treated","is treated with","treated with cold","with cold indifference","Yet she yearns","she yearns to","yearns to love","to love and","love and to","and to be","to be loved","At school ,","school , Aria",", Aria excels","Aria excels academically","excels academically but","academically but is","but is considered","is considered a","considered a misfit","a misfit by","misfit by everyone","She is misunderstood","Aria finds comfort","finds comfort in","comfort in her","in her cat","her cat -","cat -

{"title":"The Midwife's Tale","plot":"A mom who's had to work an extra shift gets home to find her daughter, a girl of about eight or nine, waiting for a story about a knightess. She tells a 14th- or 15th-century tale of Lady Eleanor. The church, with the tacit approval of Eleanor's husband, William, is cracking down on folk festivities and on the curative work of an aging midwife. Eleanor, with a new-found friend and servant woman, Gwenyth, who is the midwife's understudy, tries to save the woman from execution. Suspicion falls on the young women, and Gwenyth is in danger. Eleanor also finds herself pregnant, but fears childbirth and the life that awaits her baby. Does Eleanor have any choices?","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["A","mom","who","'s","had","to","work","an","extra","shift","get","home","to","find","her","daughter",",","a","girl","of","about","eight","or","nine",",","wait","for","a","stori","about","a","knightess",".","She","tell","a","14th","-","or","15th-centuri","tale","of","Ladi","Eleanor",".","The","church",",","with","the","tacit","approv","of","Eleanor","'s","husband",",","William",",","is","crack","down","on","folk","festiv","and","on","the","curat","work","of","an","age","midwif",".","Eleanor",",","with","a","new-found","friend","and","servant","woman",",","Gwenyth",",","who","is","the","midwif","'s","understudi",",","tri","to","save","the","woman","from","execut",".","Suspicion","fall","on","the","young","women",",","and","Gwenyth","is","in","danger",".","Eleanor","also","find","herself","pregnant",",","but","fear","childbirth","and","the","life","that","await","her","babi",".","Doe","Eleanor","have","ani","choic","?"],"lemmas":["a","mom","who","be","have","to","work","a","extra","shift","get","home","to","find","she","daughter",",","a","girl","of","about","eight","or","nine",",","wait","for","a","story","about","a","knightess",".","she","tell","a","14th","-","or","15th-century","tale","of","Lady","Eleanor",".","the","church",",","with","the","tacit","approval","of","Eleanor","'s","husband",",","William",",","be","crack","down","on","folk","festivity","and","on","the","curative","work","of","a","aging","midwife",".","Eleanor",",","with","a","new-found","friend","and","servant","woman",",","Gwenyth",",","who","be","the","midwife","'s","understudy",",","try","to","save","the","woman","from","execution",".","suspicion","fall","on","the","young","woman",",","and","Gwenyth","be","in","danger",".","Eleanor","also","find","herself","pregnant",",","but","fear","childbirth","and","the","life","that","await","she","baby",".","Does","Eleanor","have","any","choice","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A mom who","mom who 's","who 's had","'s had to","had to work","to work an","work an extra","an extra shift","extra shift gets","shift gets home","gets home to","home to find","to find her","find her daughter","her daughter ,","daughter , a",", a girl","a girl of","girl of about","of about eight","about eight or","eight or nine","or nine ,","nine , waiting",", waiting for","waiting for a","for a story","a story about","story about a","about a knightess","She tells a","tells a 14th","a 14th -","14th -

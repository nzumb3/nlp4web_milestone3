{"title":"Lets Roll","plot":"In July 2011, six Los Angeles firefighters bicycle 3,300 miles in 45 days across America to honor those lost on September 11Th. Staying in firehouses along the way, they battle severe weather, physical injuries, and group conflict, which causes them to question if they can actually make it to New York. They thought firefighting was tough until they embarked on 'The Ride for 9/11.' This ride raised funds for the Leary Firefighters Foundation and the Wounded Warrior Project.","genres":["Action"," Documentary"," Adventure"],"stems":["In","Juli","2011",",","six","Los","Angele","firefight","bicycl","3,300","mile","in","45","day","across","America","to","honor","those","lost","on","Septemb","11Th",".","Stay","in","firehous","along","the","way",",","they","battl","sever","weather",",","physic","injuri",",","and","group","conflict",",","which","caus","them","to","question","if","they","can","actual","make","it","to","New","York",".","They","thought","firefight","was","tough","until","they","embark","on","'","The","Ride","for","9/11",".","'","This","ride","rais","fund","for","the","Leari","Firefight","Foundat","and","the","Wound","Warrior","Project","."],"lemmas":["in","July","2011",",","six","Los","Angeles","firefighter","bicycle","3,300","mile","in","45","day","across","America","to","honor","those","lose","on","September","11Th",".","stay","in","firehouse","along","the","way",",","they","battle","severe","weather",",","physical","injury",",","and","group","conflict",",","which","cause","they","to","question","if","they","can","actually","make","it","to","New","York",".","they","think","firefighting","be","tough","until","they","embark","on","'","the","ride","for","9/11",".","'","this","ride","raise","fund","for","the","Leary","Firefighters","Foundation","and","the","Wounded","Warrior","Project","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In July 2011","July 2011 ,","2011 , six",", six Los","six Los Angeles","Los Angeles firefighters","Angeles firefighters bicycle","firefighters bicycle 3,300","bicycle 3,300 miles","3,300 miles in","miles in 45","in 45 days","45 days across","days across America","across America to","America to honor","to honor those","honor those lost","those lost on","lost on September","on September 11Th","Staying in firehouses","in firehouses along","firehouses along the","along the way","the way ,","way , they",", they battle","they battle severe","battle severe weather","severe weather ,","weather , physical",", physical injuries","physical injuries ,","injuries , and",", and group","and group conflict","group conflict ,","conflict , which",", which causes","which causes them","causes them to","them to question","to question if","question if they","if they can","they can actually","can actually make","actually make it","make it to","it to New","to New York","They thought firefighting","thought firefighting was","firefighting was tough","was tough until","tough until they","until they embarked","they embarked on","embarked on '","on ' The","' The Ride","The Ride for","Ride for 9/11","for 9/11 .","9/11 .

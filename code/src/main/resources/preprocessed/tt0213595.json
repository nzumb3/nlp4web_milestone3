{"title":"Everything's Fine, We're Leaving","plot":"Three French sisters have their lives interrupted and their relationship called into question when their father returns to visit 15 years after having abandoned them and their now-deceased mother. Each responds differently to his return according to how her character evolved from her relation with him and his unexpected departure. They eventually realize, though, that the somewhat elderly father is quickly losing his memory and his ability to function, and the youngest daughter's decision to accept him again while she can ends up permanently changing her family ties with her sisters.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Three","French","sister","have","their","live","interrupt","and","their","relationship","call","into","question","when","their","father","return","to","visit","15","year","after","have","abandon","them","and","their","now-deceas","mother",".","Each","respond","differ","to","his","return","accord","to","how","her","charact","evolv","from","her","relat","with","him","and","his","unexpect","departur",".","They","eventu","realiz",",","though",",","that","the","somewhat","elder","father","is","quick","lose","his","memori","and","his","abil","to","function",",","and","the","youngest","daughter","'s","decis","to","accept","him","again","while","she","can","end","up","perman","chang","her","famili","tie","with","her","sister","."],"lemmas":["three","french","sister","have","they","life","interrupt","and","they","relationship","call","into","question","when","they","father","return","to","visit","15","year","after","have","abandon","they","and","they","now-deceased","mother",".","each","respond","differently","to","he","return","accord","to","how","she","character","evolve","from","she","relation","with","he","and","he","unexpected","departure",".","they","eventually","realize",",","though",",","that","the","somewhat","elderly","father","be","quickly","lose","he","memory","and","he","ability","to","function",",","and","the","youngest","daughter","'s","decision","to","accept","he","again","while","she","can","end","up","permanently","change","she","family","tie","with","she","sister","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Three French sisters","French sisters have","sisters have their","have their lives","their lives interrupted","lives interrupted and","interrupted and their","and their relationship","their relationship called","relationship called into","called into question","into question when","question when their","when their father","their father returns","father returns to","returns to visit","to visit 15","visit 15 years","15 years after","years after having","after having abandoned","having abandoned them","abandoned them and","them and their","and their now-deceased","their now-deceased mother","Each responds differently","responds differently to","differently to his","to his return","his return according","return according to","according to how","to how her","how her character","her character evolved","character evolved from","evolved from her","from her relation","her relation with","relation with him","with him and","him and his","and his unexpected","his unexpected departure","They eventually realize","eventually realize ,","realize , though",", though ,","though , that",", that the","that the somewhat","the somewhat elderly","somewhat elderly father","elderly father is","father is quickly","is quickly losing","quickly losing his","losing his memory","his memory and","memory and his","and his ability","his ability to","ability to function","to function ,","function , and",", and the","and the youngest","the youngest daughter","youngest daughter 's","daughter 's decision","'s decision to","decision to accept","to accept him","accept him again","him again while","again while she","while she can","she can ends","can ends up","ends up permanently","up permanently changing","permanently changing her","changing her family","her family ties","family ties with","ties with her","with her sisters"],"2grams":["Three French","French sisters","sisters have","have their","their lives","lives interrupted","interrupted and","and their","their relationship","relationship called","called into","into question","question when","when their","their father","father returns","returns to","to visit","visit 15","15 years","years after","after having","having abandoned","abandoned them","them and","and their","their now-deceased","now-deceased mother","Each responds","responds differently","differently to","to his","his return","return according","according to","to how","how her","her character","character evolved","evolved from","from her","her relation","relation with","with him","him and","and his","his unexpected","unexpected departure","They eventually","eventually realize","realize ,",", though","though ,",", that","that the","the somewhat","somewhat elderly","elderly father","father is","is quickly","quickly losing","losing his","his memory","memory and","and his","his ability","ability to","to function","function ,",", and","and the","the youngest","youngest daughter","daughter 's","'s decision","decision to","to accept","accept him","him again","again while","while she","she can","can ends","ends up","up permanently","permanently changing","changing her","her family","family ties","ties with","with her","her sisters"]}

{"title":"Caged Heat II: Stripped of Freedom","plot":"King Lim is the oppressive ruler of a country on the verge of revolution. The CIA arranges a fake assassination to get him safely out of the country, but his daughter is captured in the ensuing melee and sent to The Rock, an island penitentiary known for its harshness. Agent Amanda commits a local crime in order to infiltrate the prison and rescue Princess Marga. Within, she predictably encounters official corruption, shifting allegiances, and a sleazy warden that make her task more challenging.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Crime"],"stems":["King","Lim","is","the","oppress","ruler","of","a","countri","on","the","verg","of","revolut",".","The","CIA","arrang","a","fake","assassin","to","get","him","safe","out","of","the","countri",",","but","his","daughter","is","captur","in","the","ensu","mele","and","sent","to","The","Rock",",","an","island","penitentiari","known","for","it","harsh",".","Agent","Amanda","commit","a","local","crime","in","order","to","infiltr","the","prison","and","rescu","Princess","Marga",".","Within",",","she","predict","encount","offici","corrupt",",","shift","allegi",",","and","a","sleazi","warden","that","make","her","task","more","challeng","."],"lemmas":["King","Lim","be","the","oppressive","ruler","of","a","country","on","the","verge","of","revolution",".","the","CIA","arrange","a","fake","assassination","to","get","he","safely","out","of","the","country",",","but","he","daughter","be","capture","in","the","ensue","melee","and","send","to","the","Rock",",","a","island","penitentiary","know","for","its","harshness",".","Agent","Amanda","commit","a","local","crime","in","order","to","infiltrate","the","prison","and","rescue","Princess","Marga",".","within",",","she","predictably","encounter","official","corruption",",","shift","allegiance",",","and","a","sleazy","warden","that","make","she","task","more","challenging","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["King Lim is","Lim is the","is the oppressive","the oppressive ruler","oppressive ruler of","ruler of a","of a country","a country on","country on the","on the verge","the verge of","verge of revolution","The CIA arranges","CIA arranges a","arranges a fake","a fake assassination","fake assassination to","assassination to get","to get him","get him safely","him safely out","safely out of","out of the","of the country","the country ,","country , but",", but his","but his daughter","his daughter is","daughter is captured","is captured in","captured in the","in the ensuing","the ensuing melee","ensuing melee and","melee and sent","and sent to","sent to The","to The Rock","The Rock ,","Rock , an",", an island","an island penitentiary","island penitentiary known","penitentiary known for","known for its","for its harshness","Agent Amanda commits","Amanda commits a","commits a local","a local crime","local crime in","crime in order","in order to","order to infiltrate","to infiltrate the","infiltrate the prison","the prison and","prison and rescue","and rescue Princess","rescue Princess Marga","Within , she",", she predictably","she predictably encounters","predictably encounters official","encounters official corruption","official corruption ,","corruption , shifting",", shifting allegiances","shifting allegiances ,","allegiances , and",", and a","and a sleazy","a sleazy warden","sleazy warden that","warden that make","that make her","make her task","her task more","task more challenging"],"2grams":["King Lim","Lim is","is the","the oppressive","oppressive ruler","ruler of","of a","a country","country on","on the","the verge","verge of","of revolution","The CIA","CIA arranges","arranges a","a fake","fake assassination","assassination to","to get","get him","him safely","safely out","out of","of the","the country","country ,",", but","but his","his daughter","daughter is","is captured","captured in","in the","the ensuing","ensuing melee","melee and","and sent","sent to","to The","The Rock","Rock ,",", an","an island","island penitentiary","penitentiary known","known for","for its","its harshness","Agent Amanda","Amanda commits","commits a","a local","local crime","crime in","in order","order to","to infiltrate","infiltrate the","the prison","prison and","and rescue","rescue Princess","Princess Marga","Within ,",", she","she predictably","predictably encounters","encounters official","official corruption","corruption ,",", shifting","shifting allegiances","allegiances ,",", and","and a","a sleazy","sleazy warden","warden that","that make","make her","her task","task more","more challenging"]}

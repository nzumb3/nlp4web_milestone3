Following the shooting of Amadou Diallo by 4 members of the NY City Police Department these chants rose from the streets by heartbroken and enraged voices. However, there are two sides to every story and the truth is often found where you least expect it. \"If I Die Tonight\" reflects on the lives and stories of those who survive on both sides of an impenetrable divide.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","No","Justic","!","\"","\"","No","Peac","!","\"","This","rise","chant","from","the","street","escal","in","answer","to","the","seem","endless","incid","of","polic","brutal","throughout","this","great","nation",".","Follow","the","shoot","of","Amadou","Diallo","by","4","member","of","the","NY","Citi","Polic","Depart","these","chant","rose","from","the","street","by","heartbroken","and","enrag","voic",".","Howev",",","there","are","two","side","to","everi","stori","and","the","truth","is","often","found","where","you","least","expect","it",".","\"","If","I","Die","Tonight","\"","reflect","on","the","live","and","stori","of","those","who","surviv","on","both","side","of","an","impenetr","divid","."],"lemmas":["``","no","justice","!","''","``","no","peace","!","''","this","rise","chant","from","the","street","escalate","in","answer","to","the","seemingly","endless","incident","of","police","brutality","throughout","this","great","nation",".","follow","the","shooting","of","Amadou","Diallo","by","4","member","of","the","NY","City","Police","Department","these","chant","rise","from","the","street","by","heartbroken","and","enraged","voice",".","however",",","there","be","two","side","to","every","story","and","the","truth","be","often","find","where","you","least","expect","it",".","``","if","I","die","Tonight","''","reflect","on","the","life","and","story","of","those","who","survive","on","both","side","of","a","impenetrable","divide","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["\" No Justice","No Justice !","Justice ! \"","\" No Peace","No Peace !","Peace ! \"","This rising chant","rising chant from","chant from the","from the streets","the streets escalated","streets escalated in","escalated in answer","in answer to","answer to the","to the seemingly","the seemingly endless","seemingly endless incidents","endless incidents of","incidents of police","of police brutality","police brutality throughout","brutality throughout this","throughout this great","this great nation","Following the shooting","the shooting of","shooting of Amadou","of Amadou Diallo","Amadou Diallo by","Diallo by 4","by 4 members","4 members of","members of the","of the NY","the NY City","NY City Police","City Police Department","Police Department these","Department these chants","these chants rose","chants rose from","rose from the","from the streets","the streets by","streets by heartbroken","by heartbroken and","heartbroken and enraged","and enraged voices","However , there",", there are","there are two","are two sides","two sides to","sides to every","to every story","every story and","story and the","and the truth","the truth is","truth is often","is often found","often found where","found where you","where you least","you least expect","least expect it","\" If I","If I Die","I Die Tonight","Die Tonight \"","Tonight \" reflects","\" reflects on","reflects on the","on the lives","the lives and","lives and stories","and stories of","stories of those","of those who","those who survive","who survive on","survive on both","on both sides","both sides of","sides of an","of an impenetrable","an impenetrable divide"],"2grams":["\" No","No Justice","Justice !","! \"","\" No","No Peace","Peace !","! \"","This rising","rising chant","chant from","from the","the streets","streets escalated","escalated in","in answer","answer to","to the","the seemingly","seemingly endless","endless incidents","incidents of","of police","police brutality","brutality throughout","throughout this","this great","great nation","Following the","the shooting","shooting of","of Amadou","Amadou Diallo","Diallo by","by 4","4 members","members of","of the","the NY","NY City","City Police","Police Department","Department these","these chants","chants rose","rose from","from the","the streets","streets by","by heartbroken","heartbroken and","and enraged","enraged voices","However ,",", there","there are","are two","two sides","sides to","to every","every story","story and","and the","the truth","truth is","is often","often found","found where","where you","you least","least expect","expect it","\" If","If I","I Die","Die Tonight","Tonight \"","\" reflects","reflects on","on the","the lives","lives and","and stories","stories of","of those","those who","who survive","survive on","on both","both sides","sides of","of an","an impenetrable","impenetrable divide"]}

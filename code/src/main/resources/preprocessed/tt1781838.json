{"title":"Isi Life Mein...!","plot":"After emerging as a topper - not only in Sophia Senior Secondary School but also in Rajasthan - Ajmer-born Rajnandini Khandelwal, who lives a conservative lifestyle with a joint family - including her parents, grandmother, as well as an uncle and aunt - is now taught basic cooking, while her father, Ravimohan, a devout Hindu, looks for a suitable groom. Her mother wants her to learn western cuisine and arranges for her stay in Mumbai with her sister, Shubha, and brother-in-law, Mukul. Once there, she is allowed to attend Modern College where she enlists in The Dramatics Society, and is selected to play the role of 'Kate' in Shakeshpeare's 'Taming of the Shrew'. She adapts to her new lifestyle, gains confidence, has her hair styled, wears revealing western dresses, and is attracted to fellow-collegian Vivaan. Then a surprise visit from Ravimohan will turn the tables against her. She will not only be admonished, but also be taken back to Ajmer where her marriage has been arranged with the son of a Delhi-based businessman, Nareshchand.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["After","emerg","as","a","topper","-","not","onli","in","Sophia","Senior","Secondari","School","but","also","in","Rajasthan","-","Ajmer-born","Rajnandini","Khandelw",",","who","live","a","conserv","lifestyl","with","a","joint","famili","-","includ","her","parent",",","grandmoth",",","as","well","as","an","uncl","and","aunt","-","is","now","taught","basic","cook",",","while","her","father",",","Ravimohan",",","a","devout","Hindu",",","look","for","a","suitabl","groom",".","Her","mother","want","her","to","learn","western","cuisin","and","arrang","for","her","stay","in","Mumbai","with","her","sister",",","Shubha",",","and","brother-in-law",",","Mukul",".","Once","there",",","she","is","allow","to","attend","Modern","Colleg","where","she","enlist","in","The","Dramat","Societi",",","and","is","select","to","play","the","role","of","'","Kate","'","in","Shakeshpear","'s","'","Tame","of","the","Shrew","'",".","She","adapt","to","her","new","lifestyl",",","gain","confid",",","has","her","hair","style",",","wear","reveal","western","dress",",","and","is","attract","to","fellow-collegian","Vivaan",".","Then","a","surpris","visit","from","Ravimohan","will","turn","the","tabl","against","her",".","She","will","not","onli","be","admonish",",","but","also","be","taken","back","to","Ajmer","where","her","marriag","has","been","arrang","with","the","son","of","a","Delhi-bas","businessman",",","Nareshchand","."],"lemmas":["after","emerge","as","a","topper","-","not","only","in","Sophia","Senior","secondary","school","but","also","in","Rajasthan","-","ajmer-born","Rajnandini","Khandelwal",",","who","live","a","conservative","lifestyle","with","a","joint","family","-","include","she","parent",",","grandmother",",","as","well","as","a","uncle","and","aunt","-","be","now","teach","basic","cooking",",","while","she","father",",","Ravimohan",",","a","devout","Hindu",",","look","for","a","suitable","groom",".","she","mother","want","she","to","learn","western","cuisine","and","arrange","for","she","stay","in","Mumbai","with","she","sister",",","Shubha",",","and","brother-in-law",",","Mukul",".","once","there",",","she","be","allow","to","attend","Modern","College","where","she","enlist","in","the","Dramatics","Society",",","and","be","select","to","play","the","role","of","'","Kate","'","in","Shakeshpeare","'s","'","tame","of","the","Shrew","'",".","she","adapt","to","she","new","lifestyle",",","gain","confidence",",","have","she","hair","style",",","wear","reveal","western","dress",",","and","be","attract","to","fellow-collegian","Vivaan",".","then","a","surprise","visit","from","Ravimohan","will","turn","the","table","against","she",".","she","will","not","only","be","admonish",",","but","also","be","take","back","to","Ajmer","where","she","marriage","have","be","arrange","with","the","son","of","a","delhi-based","businessman",",","Nareshchand","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["After emerging as","emerging as a","as a topper","a topper -","topper -

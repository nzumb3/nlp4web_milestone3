{"title":"Neba","plot":"Neba draws the portrait of Mamadou Touré who comes back home, looking for his roots. This documentary concerns on this young man living in France and in Mali: both home ports between which ones his own identity is pulled about. NéBa, 'my mother' in language Bambara, is a story of family, a mother who wants to revise its son and a son who wants to bury his father. A story of immigration which transforms into tragedy by the force of laws. It is also the history of a friendship between an alien who returns to the country after eight unsatisfied quest years in Europe and a French who dreams Africa as the paradise lost. A film, a trip on traces of the journey which had behaved Mamadou Touré to cross a part of Africa and Europe to arrive until to France.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Neba","draw","the","portrait","of","Mamadou","Touré","who","come","back","home",",","look","for","his","root",".","This","documentari","concern","on","this","young","man","live","in","Franc","and","in","Mali",":","both","home","port","between","which","one","his","own","ident","is","pull","about",".","NéBa",",","'","my","mother","'","in","languag","Bambara",",","is","a","stori","of","famili",",","a","mother","who","want","to","revis","it","son","and","a","son","who","want","to","buri","his","father",".","A","stori","of","immigr","which","transform","into","tragedi","by","the","forc","of","law",".","It","is","also","the","histori","of","a","friendship","between","an","alien","who","return","to","the","countri","after","eight","unsatisfi","quest","year","in","Europ","and","a","French","who","dream","Africa","as","the","paradis","lost",".","A","film",",","a","trip","on","trace","of","the","journey","which","had","behav","Mamadou","Touré","to","cross","a","part","of","Africa","and","Europ","to","arriv","until","to","Franc","."],"lemmas":["Neba","draw","the","portrait","of","Mamadou","Touré","who","come","back","home",",","look","for","he","root",".","this","documentary","concern","on","this","young","man","live","in","France","and","in","Mali",":","both","home","port","between","which","one","he","own","identity","be","pull","about",".","néba",",","'","my","mother","'","in","language","Bambara",",","be","a","story","of","family",",","a","mother","who","want","to","revise","its","son","and","a","son","who","want","to","bury","he","father",".","a","story","of","immigration","which","transform","into","tragedy","by","the","force","of","law",".","it","be","also","the","history","of","a","friendship","between","a","alien","who","return","to","the","country","after","eight","unsatisfied","quest","year","in","Europe","and","a","French","who","dream","Africa","as","the","paradise","lose",".","a","film",",","a","trip","on","trace","of","the","journey","which","have","behave","Mamadou","Touré","to","cross","a","part","of","Africa","and","Europe","to","arrive","until","to","France","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Neba

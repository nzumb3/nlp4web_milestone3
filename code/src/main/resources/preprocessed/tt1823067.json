{"title":"Always Sunset on Third Street '64","plot":"The Tokyo Olympics are about to open, and Rynosuke Chagawa is excited to receive a new TV set to watch the upcoming events. His wife Hiromi is pregnant and he has built a second level on his shop to provide his adopted son Junnosuke with a private space to study for entrance to Tokyo University to set up a career with a major company. He dreams of sparing Junnosuke the struggles that he has faced as a writer. The family continues to rely upon Hiromi's income from her bar. Meanwhile a rival story, The Virus, by a new writer has appeared in the periodical that has been publishing his stories \"Boy's Adventure Book\" and he fears the new competition. Norifumi Suzuki also receives a new TV, but more of a deluxe model. Mutsuko Hoshino (Roku) is still the principal mechanic in the Suzuki family's auto repair shop, but she dresses up some mornings to go to a nearby street with the hope of a \"chance\" meeting with Dr. Kikuchi, who earlier treated a burn on her arm. High school student Ippei Suzuki dreams of becoming a rock star. All the residents on Third Street in the shadow of Tolyo Tower feel a great sense of pride in Japan's hosting of the Olympics.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","Tokyo","Olympic","are","about","to","open",",","and","Rynosuk","Chagawa","is","excit","to","receiv","a","new","TV","set","to","watch","the","upcom","event",".","His","wife","Hiromi","is","pregnant","and","he","has","built","a","second","level","on","his","shop","to","provid","his","adopt","son","Junnosuk","with","a","privat","space","to","studi","for","entranc","to","Tokyo","Univers","to","set","up","a","career","with","a","major","compani",".","He","dream","of","spare","Junnosuk","the","struggl","that","he","has","face","as","a","writer",".","The","famili","continu","to","reli","upon","Hiromi","'s","incom","from","her","bar",".","Meanwhil","a","rival","stori",",","The","Virus",",","by","a","new","writer","has","appear","in","the","period","that","has","been","publish","his","stori","\"","Boy","'s","Adventur","Book","\"","and","he","fear","the","new","competit",".","Norifumi","Suzuki","also","receiv","a","new","TV",",","but","more","of","a","delux","model",".","Mutsuko","Hoshino","(","Roku",")","is","still","the","princip","mechan","in","the","Suzuki","famili","'s","auto","repair","shop",",","but","she","dress","up","some","morn","to","go","to","a","nearbi","street","with","the","hope","of","a","\"","chanc","\"","meet","with","Dr.","Kikuchi",",","who","earlier","treat","a","burn","on","her","arm",".","High","school","student","Ippei","Suzuki","dream","of","becom","a","rock","star",".","All","the","resid","on","Third","Street","in","the","shadow","of","Tolyo","Tower","feel","a","great","sens","of","pride","in","Japan","'s","host","of","the","Olympic","."],"lemmas":["the","Tokyo","Olympics","be","about","to","open",",","and","Rynosuke","Chagawa","be","excite","to","receive","a","new","tv","set","to","watch","the","upcoming","event",".","he","wife","Hiromi","be","pregnant","and","he","have","build","a","second","level","on","he","shop","to","provide","he","adopted","son","junnosuke","with","a","private","space","to","study","for","entrance","to","Tokyo","University","to","set","up","a","career","with","a","major","company",".","he","dream","of","spare","Junnosuke","the","struggle","that","he","have","face","as","a","writer",".","the","family","continue","to","rely","upon","Hiromi","'s","income","from","she","bar",".","meanwhile","a","rival","story",",","the","virus",",","by","a","new","writer","have","appear","in","the","periodical","that","have","be","publish","he","story","``","boy","'s","adventure","book","''","and","he","fear","the","new","competition",".","Norifumi","Suzuki","also","receive","a","new","tv",",","but","more","of","a","deluxe","model",".","Mutsuko","Hoshino","-lrb-","Roku","-rrb-","be","still","the","principal","mechanic","in","the","Suzuki","family","'s","auto","repair","shop",",","but","she","dress","up","some","morning","to","go","to","a","nearby","street","with","the","hope","of","a","``","chance","''","meeting","with","Dr.","Kikuchi",",","who","earlier","treat","a","burn","on","she","arm",".","high","school","student","Ippei","Suzuki","dream","of","become","a","rock","star",".","all","the","resident","on","Third","Street","in","the","shadow","of","Tolyo","Tower","feel","a","great","sense","of","pride","in","Japan","'s","host","of","the","Olympics","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

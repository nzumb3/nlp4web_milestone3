{"title":"Louise-Michel","plot":"What to do when the workers of a factory have been laid off overnight? Louise has an original idea: why not pool the compensation money to ... hire a hit man and to liquidate the boss? Motion accepted so Louise goes in search of the gem they need and unfortunately comes across Michel, a stinky security specialist. Michel, who is busted, gladly accepts the deal but proves so inept that he sub-contracts the job to improbable novices. Moreover, as the factory was a mere branch of a multinational company, it is no bed of roses to find the one who actually made the decision to outsource its activities. But Louise will not give up so easily.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["What","to","do","when","the","worker","of","a","factori","have","been","laid","off","overnight","?","Louis","has","an","origin","idea",":","whi","not","pool","the","compens","money","to","...","hire","a","hit","man","and","to","liquid","the","boss","?","Motion","accept","so","Louis","goe","in","search","of","the","gem","they","need","and","unfortun","come","across","Michel",",","a","stinki","secur","specialist",".","Michel",",","who","is","bust",",","glad","accept","the","deal","but","prove","so","inept","that","he","sub-contract","the","job","to","improb","novic",".","Moreov",",","as","the","factori","was","a","mere","branch","of","a","multin","compani",",","it","is","no","bed","of","rose","to","find","the","one","who","actual","made","the","decis","to","outsourc","it","activ",".","But","Louis","will","not","give","up","so","easili","."],"lemmas":["what","to","do","when","the","worker","of","a","factory","have","be","lay","off","overnight","?","Louise","have","a","original","idea",":","why","not","pool","the","compensation","money","to","...","hire","a","hit","man","and","to","liquidate","the","boss","?","Motion","accept","so","Louise","go","in","search","of","the","gem","they","need","and","unfortunately","come","across","Michel",",","a","stinky","security","specialist",".","Michel",",","who","be","bust",",","gladly","accept","the","deal","but","prove","so","inept","that","he","sub-contract","the","job","to","improbable","novice",".","moreover",",","as","the","factory","be","a","mere","branch","of","a","multinational","company",",","it","be","no","bed","of","rose","to","find","the","one","who","actually","make","the","decision","to","outsource","its","activity",".","but","Louise","will","not","give","up","so","easily","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What

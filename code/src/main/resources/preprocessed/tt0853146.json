{"title":"Requiem for Billy the Kid","plot":"Requiem for Billy the Kid recounts the life of Billy the Kid. The premise of the film is an investigation into the often-challenged circumstances that led to the death of the 21-year old outlaw in the hands of sheriff Pat Garrett on July 14, 1881. As we follow the modern sheriff on camera, off camera Billy the Kid, played by Kris Kristofferson, gives his own account of the events. Part poetic evocation, part road-movie, Requiem for Billy the Kid is essentially homage to the western genre and to the people who today still live up to that life.","genres":["Biography"," Western"," Documentary"],"stems":["Requiem","for","Billi","the","Kid","recount","the","life","of","Billi","the","Kid",".","The","premis","of","the","film","is","an","investig","into","the","often-challeng","circumst","that","led","to","the","death","of","the","21-year","old","outlaw","in","the","hand","of","sheriff","Pat","Garrett","on","Juli","14",",","1881",".","As","we","follow","the","modern","sheriff","on","camera",",","off","camera","Billi","the","Kid",",","play","by","Kris","Kristofferson",",","give","his","own","account","of","the","event",".","Part","poetic","evoc",",","part","road-movi",",","Requiem","for","Billi","the","Kid","is","essenti","homag","to","the","western","genr","and","to","the","peopl","who","today","still","live","up","to","that","life","."],"lemmas":["Requiem","for","Billy","the","Kid","recount","the","life","of","Billy","the","kid",".","the","premise","of","the","film","be","a","investigation","into","the","often-challenged","circumstance","that","lead","to","the","death","of","the","21-year","old","outlaw","in","the","hand","of","sheriff","Pat","Garrett","on","July","14",",","1881",".","as","we","follow","the","modern","sheriff","on","camera",",","off","camera","Billy","the","Kid",",","play","by","Kris","Kristofferson",",","give","he","own","account","of","the","event",".","part","poetic","evocation",",","part","road-movie",",","Requiem","for","Billy","the","Kid","be","essentially","homage","to","the","western","genre","and","to","the","people","who","today","still","live","up","to","that","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Requiem for Billy","for Billy the","Billy the Kid","the Kid recounts","Kid recounts the","recounts the life","the life of","life of Billy","of Billy the","Billy the Kid","The premise of","premise of the","of the film","the film is","film is an","is an investigation","an investigation into","investigation into the","into the often-challenged","the often-challenged circumstances","often-challenged circumstances that","circumstances that led","that led to","led to the","to the death","the death of","death of the","of the 21-year","the 21-year old","21-year old outlaw","old outlaw in","outlaw in the","in the hands","the hands of","hands of sheriff","of sheriff Pat","sheriff Pat Garrett","Pat Garrett on","Garrett on July","on July 14","July 14 ,","14 , 1881","As we follow","we follow the","follow the modern","the modern sheriff","modern sheriff on","sheriff on camera","on camera ,","camera , off",", off camera","off camera Billy","camera Billy the","Billy the Kid","the Kid ,","Kid , played",", played by","played by Kris","by Kris Kristofferson","Kris Kristofferson ,","Kristofferson , gives",", gives his","gives his own","his own account","own account of","account of the","of the events","Part poetic evocation","poetic evocation ,","evocation , part",", part road-movie","part road-movie ,","road-movie , Requiem",", Requiem for","Requiem for Billy","for Billy the","Billy the Kid","the Kid is","Kid is essentially","is essentially homage","essentially homage to","homage to the","to the western","the western genre","western genre and","genre and to","and to the","to the people","the people who","people who today","who today still","today still live","still live up","live up to","up to that","to that life"],"2grams":["Requiem for","for Billy","Billy the","the Kid","Kid recounts","recounts the","the life","life of","of Billy","Billy the","the Kid","The premise","premise of","of the","the film","film is","is an","an investigation","investigation into","into the","the often-challenged","often-challenged circumstances","circumstances that","that led","led to","to the","the death","death of","of the","the 21-year","21-year old","old outlaw","outlaw in","in the","the hands","hands of","of sheriff","sheriff Pat","Pat Garrett","Garrett on","on July","July 14","14 ,",", 1881","As we","we follow","follow the","the modern","modern sheriff","sheriff on","on camera","camera ,",", off","off camera","camera Billy","Billy the","the Kid","Kid ,",", played","played by","by Kris","Kris Kristofferson","Kristofferson ,",", gives","gives his","his own","own account","account of","of the","the events","Part poetic","poetic evocation","evocation ,",", part","part road-movie","road-movie ,",", Requiem","Requiem for","for Billy","Billy the","the Kid","Kid is","is essentially","essentially homage","homage to","to the","the western","western genre","genre and","and to","to the","the people","people who","who today","today still","still live","live up","up to","to that","that life"]}

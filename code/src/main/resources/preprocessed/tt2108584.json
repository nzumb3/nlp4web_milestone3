{"title":"Village at the End of the World","plot":"Shot over the course of a year in Northern Greenland, the film intrudes audiences to a remote village with more dogs than people. The film focuses on four townsfolk from the tiny population of 59 - Lars, the only teenager; Karl, the huntsman who has never acknowledged that Lars is his son; Ilanngauq, the outsider who moved to Niaqornat after meeting his wife on-line; and Annie, the elder who remembers the ways of the Shaman and a time when the lights were fueled by seal blubber. In this astutely constructed real-life drama, we see how the economic and ecological future of the community is more fragile than its hardy inhabitants.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," Family"],"stems":["Shot","over","the","cours","of","a","year","in","Northern","Greenland",",","the","film","intrud","audienc","to","a","remot","villag","with","more","dog","than","peopl",".","The","film","focus","on","four","townsfolk","from","the","tini","popul","of","59","-","Lar",",","the","onli","teenag",";","Karl",",","the","huntsman","who","has","never","acknowledg","that","Lar","is","his","son",";","Ilanngauq",",","the","outsid","who","move","to","Niaqornat","after","meet","his","wife","on-lin",";","and","Annie",",","the","elder","who","rememb","the","way","of","the","Shaman","and","a","time","when","the","light","were","fuel","by","seal","blubber",".","In","this","astut","construct","real-lif","drama",",","we","see","how","the","econom","and","ecolog","futur","of","the","communiti","is","more","fragil","than","it","hardi","inhabit","."],"lemmas":["shot","over","the","course","of","a","year","in","Northern","Greenland",",","the","film","intrude","audience","to","a","remote","village","with","more","dog","than","people",".","the","film","focus","on","four","townsfolk","from","the","tiny","population","of","59","-","lar",",","the","only","teenager",";","Karl",",","the","huntsman","who","have","never","acknowledge","that","Lars","be","he","son",";","Ilanngauq",",","the","outsider","who","move","to","Niaqornat","after","meet","he","wife","on-line",";","and","Annie",",","the","elder","who","remember","the","way","of","the","shaman","and","a","time","when","the","light","be","fuel","by","seal","blubber",".","in","this","astutely","construct","real-life","drama",",","we","see","how","the","economic","and","ecological","future","of","the","community","be","more","fragile","than","its","hardy","inhabitant","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Shot over the","over the course","the course of","course of a","of a year","a year in","year in Northern","in Northern Greenland","Northern Greenland ,","Greenland , the",", the film","the film intrudes","film intrudes audiences","intrudes audiences to","audiences to a","to a remote","a remote village","remote village with","village with more","with more dogs","more dogs than","dogs than people","The film focuses","film focuses on","focuses on four","on four townsfolk","four townsfolk from","townsfolk from the","from the tiny","the tiny population","tiny population of","population of 59","of 59 -","59 - Lars","- Lars ,","Lars , the",", the only","the only teenager","only teenager ;","teenager ;

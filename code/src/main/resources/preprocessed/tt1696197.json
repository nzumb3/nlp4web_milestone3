Having nowhere else to turn, he eventually teams up with another of his students to fight back. This student, a young girl, is feared school-wide because of a dark family reputation. She also has an unfortunate nickname grafted to her due to her predilection for smoking discarded cigarettes. Bonded in battle, the student and teacher form a friendship that stretches the use of the word inappropriate.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["WUSS","is","the","stori","of","a","high","school","teacher","who","face","constant","ridicul","after","he","'s","repeat","beaten","up","by","sever","of","his","own","student",".","Have","nowher","els","to","turn",",","he","eventu","team","up","with","anoth","of","his","student","to","fight","back",".","This","student",",","a","young","girl",",","is","fear","school-wid","becaus","of","a","dark","famili","reput",".","She","also","has","an","unfortun","nicknam","graft","to","her","due","to","her","predilect","for","smoke","discard","cigarett",".","Bond","in","battl",",","the","student","and","teacher","form","a","friendship","that","stretch","the","use","of","the","word","inappropri","."],"lemmas":["wuss","be","the","story","of","a","high","school","teacher","who","face","constant","ridicule","after","he","be","repeatedly","beat","up","by","several","of","he","own","student",".","have","nowhere","else","to","turn",",","he","eventually","team","up","with","another","of","he","student","to","fight","back",".","this","student",",","a","young","girl",",","be","fear","school-wide","because","of","a","dark","family","reputation",".","she","also","have","a","unfortunate","nickname","graft","to","she","due","to","she","predilection","for","smoking","discard","cigarette",".","bond","in","battle",",","the","student","and","teacher","form","a","friendship","that","stretch","the","use","of","the","word","inappropriate","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["WUSS is the","is the story","the story of","story of a","of a high","a high school","high school teacher","school teacher who","teacher who faces","who faces constant","faces constant ridicule","constant ridicule after","ridicule after he","after he 's","he 's repeatedly","'s repeatedly beaten","repeatedly beaten up","beaten up by","up by several","by several of","several of his","of his own","his own students","Having nowhere else","nowhere else to","else to turn","to turn ,","turn , he",", he eventually","he eventually teams","eventually teams up","teams up with","up with another","with another of","another of his","of his students","his students to","students to fight","to fight back","This student ,","student , a",", a young","a young girl","young girl ,","girl , is",", is feared","is feared school-wide","feared school-wide because","school-wide because of","because of a","of a dark","a dark family","dark family reputation","She also has","also has an","has an unfortunate","an unfortunate nickname","unfortunate nickname grafted","nickname grafted to","grafted to her","to her due","her due to","due to her","to her predilection","her predilection for","predilection for smoking","for smoking discarded","smoking discarded cigarettes","Bonded in battle","in battle ,","battle , the",", the student","the student and","student and teacher","and teacher form","teacher form a","form a friendship","a friendship that","friendship that stretches","that stretches the","stretches the use","the use of","use of the","of the word","the word inappropriate"],"2grams":["WUSS is","is the","the story","story of","of a","a high","high school","school teacher","teacher who","who faces","faces constant","constant ridicule","ridicule after","after he","he 's","'s repeatedly","repeatedly beaten","beaten up","up by","by several","several of","of his","his own","own students","Having nowhere","nowhere else","else to","to turn","turn ,",", he","he eventually","eventually teams","teams up","up with","with another","another of","of his","his students","students to","to fight","fight back","This student","student ,",", a","a young","young girl","girl ,",", is","is feared","feared school-wide","school-wide because","because of","of a","a dark","dark family","family reputation","She also","also has","has an","an unfortunate","unfortunate nickname","nickname grafted","grafted to","to her","her due","due to","to her","her predilection","predilection for","for smoking","smoking discarded","discarded cigarettes","Bonded in","in battle","battle ,",", the","the student","student and","and teacher","teacher form","form a","a friendship","friendship that","that stretches","stretches the","the use","use of","of the","the word","word inappropriate"]}

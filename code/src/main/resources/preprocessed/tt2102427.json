{"title":"Street Kids, Drifters and Dogs","plot":"Every night, thousands of homeless kids sleep on the street. Fiercely independent, hardened by a tough life, these kids drift from place to place, often alone, and will rarely admit to the hard lives they live. Many street kids turn to dogs for the companionship and unconditional love they do not find elsewhere. Spending every minute of every day with their pets, street kids often take better care of their dogs than they do of themselves. For many of these kids, their dog is the only family they have. In an otherwise dangerous and lonely world, their dog might be their only friend, the only constant in a volatile and unpredictable life.","genres":["Documentary","

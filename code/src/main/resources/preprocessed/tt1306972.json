{"title":"Enlighten Up!","plot":"Film-maker Kate Churchill is determined to prove that yoga can transform anyone. Nick Rosen is skeptical but agrees to be her guinea pig. Kate immerses Nick in yoga, and follows him around the world as he examines the good, the bad and the ugly of yoga. The two encounter celebrity yogis, true believers, kooks and world-renowned gurus. Tensions run high as Nick's transformative progress lags and Kate's plan crumbles. Ultimately, what they find is not what they expected.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Film-mak","Kate","Churchil","is","determin","to","prove","that","yoga","can","transform","anyon",".","Nick","Rosen","is","skeptic","but","agre","to","be","her","guinea","pig",".","Kate","immers","Nick","in","yoga",",","and","follow","him","around","the","world","as","he","examin","the","good",",","the","bad","and","the","ugli","of","yoga",".","The","two","encount","celebr","yogi",",","true","believ",",","kook","and","world-renown","gurus",".","Tension","run","high","as","Nick","'s","transform","progress","lag","and","Kate","'s","plan","crumbl",".","Ultimat",",","what","they","find","is","not","what","they","expect","."],"lemmas":["film-maker","Kate","Churchill","be","determine","to","prove","that","yoga","can","transform","anyone",".","Nick","Rosen","be","skeptical","but","agree","to","be","she","guinea","pig",".","Kate","immerse","Nick","in","yoga",",","and","follow","he","around","the","world","as","he","examine","the","good",",","the","bad","and","the","ugly","of","yoga",".","the","two","encounter","celebrity","yogi",",","true","believer",",","kook","and","world-renowned","guru",".","tension","run","high","as","Nick","'s","transformative","progress","lag","and","Kate","'s","plan","crumble",".","ultimately",",","what","they","find","be","not","what","they","expect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Film-maker Kate Churchill","Kate Churchill is","Churchill is determined","is determined to","determined to prove","to prove that","prove that yoga","that yoga can","yoga can transform","can transform anyone","Nick Rosen is","Rosen is skeptical","is skeptical but","skeptical but agrees","but agrees to","agrees to be","to be her","be her guinea","her guinea pig","Kate immerses Nick","immerses Nick in","Nick in yoga","in yoga ,","yoga , and",", and follows","and follows him","follows him around","him around the","around the world","the world as","world as he","as he examines","he examines the","examines the good","the good ,","good , the",", the bad","the bad and","bad and the","and the ugly","the ugly of","ugly of yoga","The two encounter","two encounter celebrity","encounter celebrity yogis","celebrity yogis ,","yogis , true",", true believers","true believers ,","believers , kooks",", kooks and","kooks and world-renowned","and world-renowned gurus","Tensions run high","run high as","high as Nick","as Nick 's","Nick 's transformative","'s transformative progress","transformative progress lags","progress lags and","lags and Kate","and Kate 's","Kate 's plan","'s plan crumbles","Ultimately , what",", what they","what they find","they find is","find is not","is not what","not what they","what they expected"],"2grams":["Film-maker Kate","Kate Churchill","Churchill is","is determined","determined to","to prove","prove that","that yoga","yoga can","can transform","transform anyone","Nick Rosen","Rosen is","is skeptical","skeptical but","but agrees","agrees to","to be","be her","her guinea","guinea pig","Kate immerses","immerses Nick","Nick in","in yoga","yoga ,",", and","and follows","follows him","him around","around the","the world","world as","as he","he examines","examines the","the good","good ,",", the","the bad","bad and","and the","the ugly","ugly of","of yoga","The two","two encounter","encounter celebrity","celebrity yogis","yogis ,",", true","true believers","believers ,",", kooks","kooks and","and world-renowned","world-renowned gurus","Tensions run","run high","high as","as Nick","Nick 's","'s transformative","transformative progress","progress lags","lags and","and Kate","Kate 's","'s plan","plan crumbles","Ultimately ,",", what","what they","they find","find is","is not","not what","what they","they expected"]}

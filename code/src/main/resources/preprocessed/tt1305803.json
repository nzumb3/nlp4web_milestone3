{"title":"King","plot":"After Coimbatore-based Ravichandra Verma passes away, his young son, Raja, assumes the responsibility of running the family business as well as ensuring that his brother, Ajay, gets a good education - much to the chagrin of three of his uncles. Years later, while on a trip to Uttaranchal, despite of warnings from a Pandit, he gets killed by a female assassin, but his family is informed that he is missing. Shortly thereafter, Gyaneshwar Kale and his sister, Sravani/Shivani, will inform the family that Raja is still alive but is handicapped and suffers from memory loss. The family is overjoyed but are not aware that Raja is actually a hoodlum/extortionist known as Bottu Seenu/Raghu Rokda.","genres":["Action"," Crime"," Comedy"],"stems":["After","Coimbatore-bas","Ravichandra","Verma","pass","away",",","his","young","son",",","Raja",",","assum","the","respons","of","run","the","famili","busi","as","well","as","ensur","that","his","brother",",","Ajay",",","get","a","good","educ","-","much","to","the","chagrin","of","three","of","his","uncl",".","Year","later",",","while","on","a","trip","to","Uttaranch",",","despit","of","warn","from","a","Pandit",",","he","get","kill","by","a","femal","assassin",",","but","his","famili","is","inform","that","he","is","miss",".","Short","thereaft",",","Gyaneshwar","Kale","and","his","sister",",","Sravani/Shivani",",","will","inform","the","famili","that","Raja","is","still","aliv","but","is","handicap","and","suffer","from","memori","loss",".","The","famili","is","overjoy","but","are","not","awar","that","Raja","is","actual","a","hoodlum/extortionist","known","as","Bottu","Seenu/Raghu","Rokda","."],"lemmas":["after","coimbatore-based","Ravichandra","Verma","pass","away",",","he","young","son",",","Raja",",","assume","the","responsibility","of","run","the","family","business","as","well","as","ensure","that","he","brother",",","Ajay",",","get","a","good","education","-","much","to","the","chagrin","of","three","of","he","uncle",".","year","later",",","while","on","a","trip","to","Uttaranchal",",","despite","of","warning","from","a","Pandit",",","he","get","kill","by","a","female","assassin",",","but","he","family","be","inform","that","he","be","miss",".","shortly","thereafter",",","Gyaneshwar","Kale","and","he","sister",",","Sravani/Shivani",",","will","inform","the","family","that","Raja","be","still","alive","but","be","handicap","and","suffer","from","memory","loss",".","the","family","be","overjoy","but","be","not","aware","that","Raja","be","actually","a","hoodlum/extortionist","know","as","Bottu","Seenu/Raghu","Rokda","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After Coimbatore-based Ravichandra","Coimbatore-based Ravichandra Verma","Ravichandra Verma passes","Verma passes away","passes away ,","away , his",", his young","his young son","young son ,","son , Raja",", Raja ,","Raja , assumes",", assumes the","assumes the responsibility","the responsibility of","responsibility of running","of running the","running the family","the family business","family business as","business as well","as well as","well as ensuring","as ensuring that","ensuring that his","that his brother","his brother ,","brother , Ajay",", Ajay ,","Ajay , gets",", gets a","gets a good","a good education","good education -","education -

{"title":"Last Day at Lambeau","plot":"What if the pride of a community hinged on the demise of their greatest hero? Brett Favre was the pride of Wisconsin for sixteen years until he left after a messy conflict with the Green Bay Packers. When he sought the opportunity to play for the Packers' arch-nemisis, the Minnesota Vikings, the people of Wisconsin turned from adoration of Favre to hatred. LAST DAY AT LAMBEAU explores this complex relationship between fans and pro athletes and the specific events which defined the war between Brett Favre, the Packers and Packers Nation.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["What","if","the","pride","of","a","communiti","hing","on","the","demis","of","their","greatest","hero","?","Brett","Favr","was","the","pride","of","Wisconsin","for","sixteen","year","until","he","left","after","a","messi","conflict","with","the","Green","Bay","Packer",".","When","he","sought","the","opportun","to","play","for","the","Packer","'","arch-nemisi",",","the","Minnesota","Vike",",","the","peopl","of","Wisconsin","turn","from","ador","of","Favr","to","hatr",".","LAST","DAi","AT","LAMBEAU","explor","this","complex","relationship","between","fan","and","pro","athlet","and","the","specif","event","which","defin","the","war","between","Brett","Favr",",","the","Packer","and","Packer","Nation","."],"lemmas":["what","if","the","pride","of","a","community","hinge","on","the","demise","of","they","greatest","hero","?","Brett","Favre","be","the","pride","of","Wisconsin","for","sixteen","year","until","he","leave","after","a","messy","conflict","with","the","Green","Bay","Packers",".","when","he","seek","the","opportunity","to","play","for","the","Packers","'","arch-nemisis",",","the","Minnesota","Vikings",",","the","people","of","Wisconsin","turn","from","adoration","of","Favre","to","hatred",".","LAST","DAY","AT","LAMBEAU","explore","this","complex","relationship","between","fan","and","pro","athlete","and","the","specific","event","which","define","the","war","between","Brett","Favre",",","the","Packers","and","Packers","Nation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["What if the","if the pride","the pride of","pride of a","of a community","a community hinged","community hinged on","hinged on the","on the demise","the demise of","demise of their","of their greatest","their greatest hero","Brett Favre was","Favre was the","was the pride","the pride of","pride of Wisconsin","of Wisconsin for","Wisconsin for sixteen","for sixteen years","sixteen years until","years until he","until he left","he left after","left after a","after a messy","a messy conflict","messy conflict with","conflict with the","with the Green","the Green Bay","Green Bay Packers","When he sought","he sought the","sought the opportunity","the opportunity to","opportunity to play","to play for","play for the","for the Packers","the Packers '","Packers ' arch-nemisis","' arch-nemisis ,","arch-nemisis , the",", the Minnesota","the Minnesota Vikings","Minnesota Vikings ,","Vikings , the",", the people","the people of","people of Wisconsin","of Wisconsin turned","Wisconsin turned from","turned from adoration","from adoration of","adoration of Favre","of Favre to","Favre to hatred","LAST DAY AT","DAY AT LAMBEAU","AT LAMBEAU explores","LAMBEAU explores this","explores this complex","this complex relationship","complex relationship between","relationship between fans","between fans and","fans and pro","and pro athletes","pro athletes and","athletes and the","and the specific","the specific events","specific events which","events which defined","which defined the","defined the war","the war between","war between Brett","between Brett Favre","Brett Favre ,","Favre , the",", the Packers","the Packers and","Packers and Packers","and Packers Nation"],"2grams":["What if","if the","the pride","pride of","of a","a community","community hinged","hinged on","on the","the demise","demise of","of their","their greatest","greatest hero","Brett Favre","Favre was","was the","the pride","pride of","of Wisconsin","Wisconsin for","for sixteen","sixteen years","years until","until he","he left","left after","after a","a messy","messy conflict","conflict with","with the","the Green","Green Bay","Bay Packers","When he","he sought","sought the","the opportunity","opportunity to","to play","play for","for the","the Packers","Packers '","' arch-nemisis","arch-nemisis ,",", the","the Minnesota","Minnesota Vikings","Vikings ,",", the","the people","people of","of Wisconsin","Wisconsin turned","turned from","from adoration","adoration of","of Favre","Favre to","to hatred","LAST DAY","DAY AT","AT LAMBEAU","LAMBEAU explores","explores this","this complex","complex relationship","relationship between","between fans","fans and","and pro","pro athletes","athletes and","and the","the specific","specific events","events which","which defined","defined the","the war","war between","between Brett","Brett Favre","Favre ,",", the","the Packers","Packers and","and Packers","Packers Nation"]}

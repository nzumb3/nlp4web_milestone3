{"title":"Entity","plot":"In 1998, thirty four unidentified bodies were found in shallow graves in a remote Siberian forest. After subsequent investigations, no official explanation by the Russian authorities was ever offered about the circumstances of the deaths. The case was closed. In 2010, a small English TV crew from the show 'Darkest Secrets' set out for the Siberian forest. 'Darkest Secrets' focuses on revisiting the sites of unsolved crimes and they employ the gifts of a psychic whose extraordinary powers may help shed new light on cold cases. The last communication to their production office in London stated that they were approaching the Siberian region where the bodies were found. Nothing was heard from them again. 'Entity' is the story of what happened to them. The forest was only the beginning....","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["In","1998",",","thirti","four","unidentifi","bodi","were","found","in","shallow","grave","in","a","remot","Siberian","forest",".","After","subsequ","investig",",","no","offici","explan","by","the","Russian","author","was","ever","offer","about","the","circumst","of","the","death",".","The","case","was","close",".","In","2010",",","a","small","English","TV","crew","from","the","show","'","Darkest","Secret","'","set","out","for","the","Siberian","forest",".","'","Darkest","Secret","'","focus","on","revisit","the","site","of","unsolv","crime","and","they","employ","the","gift","of","a","psychic","whose","extraordinari","power","may","help","shed","new","light","on","cold","case",".","The","last","communic","to","their","product","offic","in","London","state","that","they","were","approach","the","Siberian","region","where","the","bodi","were","found",".","Noth","was","heard","from","them","again",".","'","Entiti","'","is","the","stori","of","what","happen","to","them",".","The","forest","was","onli","the","begin","...."],"lemmas":["in","1998",",","thirty","four","unidentified","body","be","find","in","shallow","grave","in","a","remote","siberian","forest",".","after","subsequent","investigation",",","no","official","explanation","by","the","russian","authority","be","ever","offer","about","the","circumstance","of","the","death",".","the","case","be","close",".","in","2010",",","a","small","english","tv","crew","from","the","show","'","darkest","secret","'","set","out","for","the","siberian","forest",".","'","darkest","secret","'","focus","on","revisit","the","site","of","unsolved","crime","and","they","employ","the","gift","of","a","psychic","whose","extraordinary","power","may","help","shed","new","light","on","cold","case",".","the","last","communication","to","they","production","office","in","London","state","that","they","be","approach","the","siberian","region","where","the","body","be","find",".","nothing","be","hear","from","they","again",".","'","entity","'","be","the","story","of","what","happen","to","they",".","the","forest","be","only","the","begin","...."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1998 ,","1998 , thirty",", thirty four","thirty four unidentified","four unidentified bodies","unidentified bodies were","bodies were found","were found in","found in shallow","in shallow graves","shallow graves in","graves in a","in a remote","a remote Siberian","remote Siberian forest","After subsequent investigations","subsequent investigations ,","investigations , no",", no official","no official explanation","official explanation by","explanation by the","by the Russian","the Russian authorities","Russian authorities was","authorities was ever","was ever offered","ever offered about","offered about the","about the circumstances","the circumstances of","circumstances of the","of the deaths","The case was","case was closed","In 2010 ,","2010 , a",", a small","a small English","small English TV","English TV crew","TV crew from","crew from the","from the show","the show '","show ' Darkest","' Darkest Secrets","Darkest Secrets '","Secrets ' set","' set out","set out for","out for the","for the Siberian","the Siberian forest","Siberian forest .","forest .

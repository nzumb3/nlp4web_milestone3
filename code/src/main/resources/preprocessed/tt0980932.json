{"title":"Maybe","plot":"In March of 2003, a young Basque poet and four friends-three musicians and an artist-came to New York City almost by chance, to do a half dozen bilingual poetry evenings, with music. \"The six or seven hundred thousand Basque speakers in the world today \"can fit into a New York neighborhood,\" the poet, Kirmen Uribe, says in AGIAN / MAYBE. \"So what does a community that fits into a neighborhood have to offer the world? Or in that city that's the center of the world, what can it offer?\" What the five discovered there surprised them. AGIAN / MAYBE shows how something that seemed to begin in New York in 2003 in fact had its origins long before. AGIAN / MAYBE is a ping-pong contemplation, with music, of the five histories behind the whole, and makes a guess of its own at possible outcomes.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","March","of","2003",",","a","young","Basqu","poet","and","four","friends-thre","musician","and","an","artist-cam","to","New","York","Citi","almost","by","chanc",",","to","do","a","half","dozen","bilingu","poetri","even",",","with","music",".","\"","The","six","or","seven","hundr","thousand","Basqu","speaker","in","the","world","today","\"","can","fit","into","a","New","York","neighborhood",",","\"","the","poet",",","Kirmen","Uribe",",","say","in","AGIAN","/","MAYBE",".","\"","So","what","doe","a","communiti","that","fit","into","a","neighborhood","have","to","offer","the","world","?","Or","in","that","citi","that","'s","the","center","of","the","world",",","what","can","it","offer","?","\"","What","the","five","discov","there","surpris","them",".","AGIAN","/","MAYBE","show","how","someth","that","seem","to","begin","in","New","York","in","2003","in","fact","had","it","origin","long","befor",".","AGIAN","/","MAYBE","is","a","ping-pong","contempl",",","with","music",",","of","the","five","histori","behind","the","whole",",","and","make","a","guess","of","it","own","at","possibl","outcom","."],"lemmas":["in","March","of","2003",",","a","young","basque","poet","and","four","friends-three","musician","and","a","artist-came","to","New","York","City","almost","by","chance",",","to","do","a","half","dozen","bilingual","poetry","evening",",","with","music",".","``","the","six","or","seven","hundred","thousand","basque","speaker","in","the","world","today","''","can","fit","into","a","New","York","neighborhood",",","``","the","poet",",","Kirmen","Uribe",",","say","in","AGIAN","/","MAYBE",".","''","so","what","do","a","community","that","fit","into","a","neighborhood","have","to","offer","the","world","?","or","in","that","city","that","be","the","center","of","the","world",",","what","can","it","offer","?","``","what","the","five","discover","there","surprise","they",".","agian","/","maybe","show","how","something","that","seem","to","begin","in","New","York","in","2003","in","fact","have","its","origin","long","before",".","AGIAN","/","MAYBE","be","a","ping-pong","contemplation",",","with","music",",","of","the","five","history","behind","the","whole",",","and","make","a","guess","of","its","own","at","possible","outcome","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

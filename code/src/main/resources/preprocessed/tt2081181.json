{"title":"Beagle Boogie Babe","plot":"Have you ever had a dream that something horrible happened to someone you know and then it came true? That is what happened to Director Paul Gorman. In his second feature documentary, Beagle Boogie Babe, Paul Gorman attempts to unlock the mystery of a dream that has haunted him for years. In doing so he hoped to learn what drove Joan Carson to take up skydiving and continue on after suffering two serious accidents and to understand the events that led up to her death. 'Beagle Boogie Babe is first hand, refreshing, honest and is from Joan, not me. I acted as a conduit as I pursued my vision. The result is a thought provoking and unique film' -- Paul Gorman","genres":["Documentary"," Mystery"," Drama"],"stems":["Have","you","ever","had","a","dream","that","someth","horribl","happen","to","someon","you","know","and","then","it","came","true","?","That","is","what","happen","to","Director","Paul","Gorman",".","In","his","second","featur","documentari",",","Beagl","Boogi","Babe",",","Paul","Gorman","attempt","to","unlock","the","mysteri","of","a","dream","that","has","haunt","him","for","year",".","In","do","so","he","hope","to","learn","what","drove","Joan","Carson","to","take","up","skydiv","and","continu","on","after","suffer","two","serious","accid","and","to","understand","the","event","that","led","up","to","her","death",".","'","Beagl","Boogi","Babe","is","first","hand",",","refresh",",","honest","and","is","from","Joan",",","not","me",".","I","act","as","a","conduit","as","I","pursu","my","vision",".","The","result","is","a","thought","provok","and","uniqu","film","'","--","Paul","Gorman"],"lemmas":["have","you","ever","have","a","dream","that","something","horrible","happen","to","someone","you","know","and","then","it","come","true","?","that","be","what","happen","to","Director","Paul","Gorman",".","in","he","second","feature","documentary",",","Beagle","Boogie","Babe",",","Paul","Gorman","attempt","to","unlock","the","mystery","of","a","dream","that","have","haunt","he","for","year",".","in","do","so","he","hope","to","learn","what","drive","Joan","Carson","to","take","up","skydiving","and","continue","on","after","suffer","two","serious","accident","and","to","understand","the","event","that","lead","up","to","she","death",".","'","Beagle","Boogie","Babe","be","first","hand",",","refreshing",",","honest","and","be","from","Joan",",","not","I",".","I","act","as","a","conduit","as","I","pursue","my","vision",".","the","result","be","a","thought","provoke","and","unique","film","'","--","Paul","Gorman"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Have you ever","you ever had","ever had a","had a dream","a dream that","dream that something","that something horrible","something horrible happened","horrible happened to","happened to someone","to someone you","someone you know","you know and","know and then","and then it","then it came","it came true","That is what","is what happened","what happened to","happened to Director","to Director Paul","Director Paul Gorman","In his second","his second feature","second feature documentary","feature documentary ,","documentary , Beagle",", Beagle Boogie","Beagle Boogie Babe","Boogie Babe ,","Babe , Paul",", Paul Gorman","Paul Gorman attempts","Gorman attempts to","attempts to unlock","to unlock the","unlock the mystery","the mystery of","mystery of a","of a dream","a dream that","dream that has","that has haunted","has haunted him","haunted him for","him for years","In doing so","doing so he","so he hoped","he hoped to","hoped to learn","to learn what","learn what drove","what drove Joan","drove Joan Carson","Joan Carson to","Carson to take","to take up","take up skydiving","up skydiving and","skydiving and continue","and continue on","continue on after","on after suffering","after suffering two","suffering two serious","two serious accidents","serious accidents and","accidents and to","and to understand","to understand the","understand the events","the events that","events that led","that led up","led up to","up to her","to her death","her death .","death .

{"title":"The Invention of Dr. Nakamats","plot":"The film is about the utterly fantastic and eccentric 80-year-old Japanese inventor responsible for 3,357 inventions, including the floppy disk. NakaMats is an unlikely character made for the movies, with his deadpan English and impeccable comic timing providing nonstop laughs. About his Love Jet potion, he says: \"I've tested more than 10,000 women. Of course, I'm not doing the sex. I'm checking meters.\" At a conference, he leads a sing-along of a ditty he penned to memorialize the seven hours of snow shoveling he once did to get to a university class. Utterly nutty, but also a paean to the spirit of human invention.","genres":["Comedy","

{"title":"True Story","plot":"Mark has no job, lives with his mom and has a psycho girlfriend and she just got pregnant. He wants to leave her, but she won't let him. Jimmy is a cop who has marriage problems and breaks the law occasionally. Jerry is a whipped husband who seems to always have a lot of money even though he fixes air conditioners. Junior is a part time worker who pursues single moms. Johnny is a married man who seems to be the only one who has his stuff together. Put them altogether and you have one damn good true story.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Mark","has","no","job",",","live","with","his","mom","and","has","a","psycho","girlfriend","and","she","just","got","pregnant",".","He","want","to","leav","her",",","but","she","wo","n't","let","him",".","Jimmi","is","a","cop","who","has","marriag","problem","and","break","the","law","occasion",".","Jerri","is","a","whip","husband","who","seem","to","alway","have","a","lot","of","money","even","though","he","fix","air","condition",".","Junior","is","a","part","time","worker","who","pursu","singl","mom",".","Johnni","is","a","marri","man","who","seem","to","be","the","onli","one","who","has","his","stuff","togeth",".","Put","them","altogeth","and","you","have","one","damn","good","true","stori","."],"lemmas":["Mark","have","no","job",",","live","with","he","mom","and","have","a","psycho","girlfriend","and","she","just","get","pregnant",".","he","want","to","leave","she",",","but","she","will","not","let","he",".","Jimmy","be","a","cop","who","have","marriage","problem","and","break","the","law","occasionally",".","Jerry","be","a","whip","husband","who","seem","to","always","have","a","lot","of","money","even","though","he","fix","air","conditioner",".","Junior","be","a","part","time","worker","who","pursue","single","mom",".","Johnny","be","a","married","man","who","seem","to","be","the","only","one","who","have","he","stuff","together",".","put","they","altogether","and","you","have","one","damn","good","true","story","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mark has no","has no job","no job ,","job , lives",", lives with","lives with his","with his mom","his mom and","mom and has","and has a","has a psycho","a psycho girlfriend","psycho girlfriend and","girlfriend and she","and she just","she just got","just got pregnant","He wants to","wants to leave","to leave her","leave her ,","her , but",", but she","but she wo","she wo n't","wo n't let","n't let him","Jimmy is a","is a cop","a cop who","cop who has","who has marriage","has marriage problems","marriage problems and","problems and breaks","and breaks the","breaks the law","the law occasionally","Jerry is a","is a whipped","a whipped husband","whipped husband who","husband who seems","who seems to","seems to always","to always have","always have a","have a lot","a lot of","lot of money","of money even","money even though","even though he","though he fixes","he fixes air","fixes air conditioners","Junior is a","is a part","a part time","part time worker","time worker who","worker who pursues","who pursues single","pursues single moms","Johnny is a","is a married","a married man","married man who","man who seems","who seems to","seems to be","to be the","be the only","the only one","only one who","one who has","who has his","has his stuff","his stuff together","Put them altogether","them altogether and","altogether and you","and you have","you have one","have one damn","one damn good","damn good true","good true story"],"2grams":["Mark has","has no","no job","job ,",", lives","lives with","with his","his mom","mom and","and has","has a","a psycho","psycho girlfriend","girlfriend and","and she","she just","just got","got pregnant","He wants","wants to","to leave","leave her","her ,",", but","but she","she wo","wo n't","n't let","let him","Jimmy is","is a","a cop","cop who","who has","has marriage","marriage problems","problems and","and breaks","breaks the","the law","law occasionally","Jerry is","is a","a whipped","whipped husband","husband who","who seems","seems to","to always","always have","have a","a lot","lot of","of money","money even","even though","though he","he fixes","fixes air","air conditioners","Junior is","is a","a part","part time","time worker","worker who","who pursues","pursues single","single moms","Johnny is","is a","a married","married man","man who","who seems","seems to","to be","be the","the only","only one","one who","who has","has his","his stuff","stuff together","Put them","them altogether","altogether and","and you","you have","have one","one damn","damn good","good true","true story"]}

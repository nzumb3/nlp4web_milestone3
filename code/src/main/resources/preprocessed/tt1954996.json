{"title":"This Is My Sister","plot":"\"This Is My Sister\" is a journey of Love, Strength and Commitment, all taught by example, by Earl & Marion Fischer to their three daughters. In 1957, when nearly all babies born with developmental disabilities were institutionalized, Earl & Marion said, \"No, not Mary,\" even as the doctors said Mary would not even know their name or may even harm their family. The sisters take Earl & Marion's example of what unconditional love is, redefining it evermore. \"This Is My Sister\" is a rare, life-affirming journey from those who have been in the shadows, doing the hard work of everyday living. They are the eternal flame of dignity and grace. They ask for nothing and give everything without pause.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","This","Is","My","Sister","\"","is","a","journey","of","Love",",","Strength","and","Commit",",","all","taught","by","exampl",",","by","Earl","&","Marion","Fischer","to","their","three","daughter",".","In","1957",",","when","near","all","babi","born","with","development","disabl","were","institution",",","Earl","&","Marion","said",",","\"","No",",","not","Mari",",","\"","even","as","the","doctor","said","Mari","would","not","even","know","their","name","or","may","even","harm","their","famili",".","The","sister","take","Earl","&","Marion","'s","exampl","of","what","uncondit","love","is",",","redefin","it","evermor",".","\"","This","Is","My","Sister","\"","is","a","rare",",","life-affirm","journey","from","those","who","have","been","in","the","shadow",",","do","the","hard","work","of","everyday","live",".","They","are","the","etern","flame","of","digniti","and","grace",".","They","ask","for","noth","and","give","everyth","without","paus","."],"lemmas":["``","this","be","my","sister","''","be","a","journey","of","love",",","strength","and","commitment",",","all","teach","by","example",",","by","Earl","&","Marion","Fischer","to","they","three","daughter",".","in","1957",",","when","nearly","all","baby","bear","with","developmental","disability","be","institutionalize",",","Earl","&","Marion","say",",","``","no",",","not","Mary",",","''","even","as","the","doctor","say","Mary","would","not","even","know","they","name","or","may","even","harm","they","family",".","the","sister","take","Earl","&","Marion","'s","example","of","what","unconditional","love","be",",","redefine","it","evermore",".","``","this","be","my","sister","''","be","a","rare",",","life-affirming","journey","from","those","who","have","be","in","the","shadow",",","do","the","hard","work","of","everyday","living",".","they","be","the","eternal","flame","of","dignity","and","grace",".","they","ask","for","nothing","and","give","everything","without","pause","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["\"

{"title":"Culebraico","plot":"The story of a mystic man from the city, saturated by the world's twisted ways. He needs to search in the ancient Peruvian history, looking for the mythology of the ancient mountain spirits that ruled and invigorated all beings in the past. There he finds Pariacaca, the reformer from the old days, great yet forgotten and defeated by the cross. He gets his heavy backpack and walks directly into the old sanctuary of the mountain. There he finds the remnants of the extinct cult to the sacred mountains. Finally, he gets to the same mountain, to whom he speaks and begs until he is done speaking, hoping to return to his city with the strength of a new shining purpose.","genres":["History"],"stems":["The","stori","of","a","mystic","man","from","the","citi",",","satur","by","the","world","'s","twist","way",".","He","need","to","search","in","the","ancient","Peruvian","histori",",","look","for","the","mytholog","of","the","ancient","mountain","spirit","that","rule","and","invigor","all","be","in","the","past",".","There","he","find","Pariacaca",",","the","reform","from","the","old","day",",","great","yet","forgotten","and","defeat","by","the","cross",".","He","get","his","heavi","backpack","and","walk","direct","into","the","old","sanctuari","of","the","mountain",".","There","he","find","the","remnant","of","the","extinct","cult","to","the","sacr","mountain",".","Final",",","he","get","to","the","same","mountain",",","to","whom","he","speak","and","beg","until","he","is","done","speak",",","hope","to","return","to","his","citi","with","the","strength","of","a","new","shine","purpos","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","a","mystic","man","from","the","city",",","saturate","by","the","world","'s","twisted","way",".","he","need","to","search","in","the","ancient","peruvian","history",",","look","for","the","mythology","of","the","ancient","mountain","spirit","that","rule","and","invigorate","all","being","in","the","past",".","there","he","find","Pariacaca",",","the","reformer","from","the","old","day",",","great","yet","forget","and","defeat","by","the","cross",".","he","get","he","heavy","backpack","and","walk","directly","into","the","old","sanctuary","of","the","mountain",".","there","he","find","the","remnant","of","the","extinct","cult","to","the","sacred","mountain",".","finally",",","he","get","to","the","same","mountain",",","to","whom","he","speak","and","beg","until","he","be","do","speak",",","hope","to","return","to","he","city","with","the","strength","of","a","new","shine","purpose","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The

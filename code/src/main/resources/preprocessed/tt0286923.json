{"title":"Japanese Devils","plot":"A documentary recording the testimony of fourteen former Japanese soldiers as they recount atrocities and war crimes committed during the Second World War, including the infamous Unit 731 medical experimentation group. Having been trained by their country to be nothing but killers, the soldiers claim to have become morally numb and unable to see non-Japanese as even human. Perhaps feeling some remorse for what they have done, they now choose to tell their stories for the world to hear.","genres":["Documentary"," War"],"stems":["A","documentari","record","the","testimoni","of","fourteen","former","Japanes","soldier","as","they","recount","atroc","and","war","crime","commit","dure","the","Second","World","War",",","includ","the","infam","Unit","731","medic","experiment","group",".","Have","been","train","by","their","countri","to","be","noth","but","killer",",","the","soldier","claim","to","have","becom","moral","numb","and","unabl","to","see","non-Japanes","as","even","human",".","Perhap","feel","some","remors","for","what","they","have","done",",","they","now","choos","to","tell","their","stori","for","the","world","to","hear","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","record","the","testimony","of","fourteen","former","japanese","soldier","as","they","recount","atrocity","and","war","crime","commit","during","the","Second","World","War",",","include","the","infamous","unit","731","medical","experimentation","group",".","have","be","train","by","they","country","to","be","nothing","but","killer",",","the","soldier","claim","to","have","become","morally","numb","and","unable","to","see","non-japanese","as","even","human",".","perhaps","feel","some","remorse","for","what","they","have","do",",","they","now","choose","to","tell","they","story","for","the","world","to","hear","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A documentary recording","documentary recording the","recording the testimony","the testimony of","testimony of fourteen","of fourteen former","fourteen former Japanese","former Japanese soldiers","Japanese soldiers as","soldiers as they","as they recount","they recount atrocities","recount atrocities and","atrocities and war","and war crimes","war crimes committed","crimes committed during","committed during the","during the Second","the Second World","Second World War","World War ,","War , including",", including the","including the infamous","the infamous Unit","infamous Unit 731","Unit 731 medical","731 medical experimentation","medical experimentation group","Having been trained","been trained by","trained by their","by their country","their country to","country to be","to be nothing","be nothing but","nothing but killers","but killers ,","killers , the",", the soldiers","the soldiers claim","soldiers claim to","claim to have","to have become","have become morally","become morally numb","morally numb and","numb and unable","and unable to","unable to see","to see non-Japanese","see non-Japanese as","non-Japanese as even","as even human","Perhaps feeling some","feeling some remorse","some remorse for","remorse for what","for what they","what they have","they have done","have done ,","done , they",", they now","they now choose","now choose to","choose to tell","to tell their","tell their stories","their stories for","stories for the","for the world","the world to","world to hear"],"2grams":["A documentary","documentary recording","recording the","the testimony","testimony of","of fourteen","fourteen former","former Japanese","Japanese soldiers","soldiers as","as they","they recount","recount atrocities","atrocities and","and war","war crimes","crimes committed","committed during","during the","the Second","Second World","World War","War ,",", including","including the","the infamous","infamous Unit","Unit 731","731 medical","medical experimentation","experimentation group","Having been","been trained","trained by","by their","their country","country to","to be","be nothing","nothing but","but killers","killers ,",", the","the soldiers","soldiers claim","claim to","to have","have become","become morally","morally numb","numb and","and unable","unable to","to see","see non-Japanese","non-Japanese as","as even","even human","Perhaps feeling","feeling some","some remorse","remorse for","for what","what they","they have","have done","done ,",", they","they now","now choose","choose to","to tell","tell their","their stories","stories for","for the","the world","world to","to hear"]}

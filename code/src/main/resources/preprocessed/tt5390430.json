{"title":"Accidental Courtesy: Daryl Davis, Race & America","plot":"Daryl Davis is an accomplished musician who was played all over the world. He also has an unusual hobby, particularly for a middle aged black man. When not displaying his musical chops, Daryl likes to meet and befriend members of the Ku Klux Klan. When many of these people eventually leave the Klan with Daryl's support, Daryl keeps their robes and hoods; building his collection piece by piece, story by story, person by person, in hopes of one day opening a museum of the Klan.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Daryl","Davi","is","an","accomplish","musician","who","was","play","all","over","the","world",".","He","also","has","an","unusu","hobbi",",","particular","for","a","middl","age","black","man",".","When","not","display","his","music","chop",",","Daryl","like","to","meet","and","befriend","member","of","the","Ku","Klux","Klan",".","When","mani","of","these","peopl","eventu","leav","the","Klan","with","Daryl","'s","support",",","Daryl","keep","their","robe","and","hood",";","build","his","collect","piec","by","piec",",","stori","by","stori",",","person","by","person",",","in","hope","of","one","day","open","a","museum","of","the","Klan","."],"lemmas":["Daryl","Davis","be","a","accomplished","musician","who","be","play","all","over","the","world",".","he","also","have","a","unusual","hobby",",","particularly","for","a","middle","aged","black","man",".","when","not","display","he","musical","chop",",","Daryl","like","to","meet","and","befriend","member","of","the","Ku","Klux","Klan",".","when","many","of","these","people","eventually","leave","the","Klan","with","Daryl","'s","support",",","Daryl","keep","they","robe","and","hood",";","build","he","collection","piece","by","piece",",","story","by","story",",","person","by","person",",","in","hope","of","one","day","open","a","museum","of","the","Klan","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Daryl Davis is","Davis is an","is an accomplished","an accomplished musician","accomplished musician who","musician who was","who was played","was played all","played all over","all over the","over the world","He also has","also has an","has an unusual","an unusual hobby","unusual hobby ,","hobby , particularly",", particularly for","particularly for a","for a middle","a middle aged","middle aged black","aged black man","When not displaying","not displaying his","displaying his musical","his musical chops","musical chops ,","chops , Daryl",", Daryl likes","Daryl likes to","likes to meet","to meet and","meet and befriend","and befriend members","befriend members of","members of the","of the Ku","the Ku Klux","Ku Klux Klan","When many of","many of these","of these people","these people eventually","people eventually leave","eventually leave the","leave the Klan","the Klan with","Klan with Daryl","with Daryl 's","Daryl 's support","'s support ,","support , Daryl",", Daryl keeps","Daryl keeps their","keeps their robes","their robes and","robes and hoods","and hoods ;","hoods ; building","; building his","building his collection","his collection piece","collection piece by","piece by piece","by piece ,","piece , story",", story by","story by story","by story ,","story , person",", person by","person by person","by person ,","person , in",", in hopes","in hopes of","hopes of one","of one day","one day opening","day opening a","opening a museum","a museum of","museum of the","of the Klan"],"2grams":["Daryl Davis","Davis is","is an","an accomplished","accomplished musician","musician who","who was","was played","played all","all over","over the","the world","He also","also has","has an","an unusual","unusual hobby","hobby ,",", particularly","particularly for","for a","a middle","middle aged","aged black","black man","When not","not displaying","displaying his","his musical","musical chops","chops ,",", Daryl","Daryl likes","likes to","to meet","meet and","and befriend","befriend members","members of","of the","the Ku","Ku Klux","Klux Klan","When many","many of","of these","these people","people eventually","eventually leave","leave the","the Klan","Klan with","with Daryl","Daryl 's","'s support","support ,",", Daryl","Daryl keeps","keeps their","their robes","robes and","and hoods","hoods ;","; building","building his","his collection","collection piece","piece by","by piece","piece ,",", story","story by","by story","story ,",", person","person by","by person","person ,",", in","in hopes","hopes of","of one","one day","day opening","opening a","a museum","museum of","of the","the Klan"]}

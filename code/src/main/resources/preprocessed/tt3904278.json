{"title":"We Go On","plot":"Paralyzed by his fear of dying, Miles Grissom takes out an advert offering 30000 dollars in reward money to the first person who can show him evidence of an angel, a demon, or prove that ghosts exist - anything to prove to him that we go on after our deaths. He narrows the responses down to three viable candidates - a scientist, a medium, and a worldly entrepreneur. Along with his protective mother, he embarks on an adventure through Los Angeles that will spiral into an unthinkable nightmare.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["Paralyz","by","his","fear","of","die",",","Mile","Grissom","take","out","an","advert","offer","30000","dollar","in","reward","money","to","the","first","person","who","can","show","him","evid","of","an","angel",",","a","demon",",","or","prove","that","ghost","exist","-","anyth","to","prove","to","him","that","we","go","on","after","our","death",".","He","narrow","the","respons","down","to","three","viabl","candid","-","a","scientist",",","a","medium",",","and","a","world","entrepreneur",".","Along","with","his","protect","mother",",","he","embark","on","an","adventur","through","Los","Angele","that","will","spiral","into","an","unthink","nightmar","."],"lemmas":["paralyze","by","he","fear","of","die",",","Miles","Grissom","take","out","a","advert","offer","30000","dollar","in","reward","money","to","the","first","person","who","can","show","he","evidence","of","a","angel",",","a","demon",",","or","prove","that","ghost","exist","-","anything","to","prove","to","he","that","we","go","on","after","we","death",".","he","narrow","the","response","down","to","three","viable","candidate","-","a","scientist",",","a","medium",",","and","a","worldly","entrepreneur",".","along","with","he","protective","mother",",","he","embark","on","a","adventure","through","Los","Angeles","that","will","spiral","into","a","unthinkable","nightmare","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Paralyzed by his","by his fear","his fear of","fear of dying","of dying ,","dying , Miles",", Miles Grissom","Miles Grissom takes","Grissom takes out","takes out an","out an advert","an advert offering","advert offering 30000","offering 30000 dollars","30000 dollars in","dollars in reward","in reward money","reward money to","money to the","to the first","the first person","first person who","person who can","who can show","can show him","show him evidence","him evidence of","evidence of an","of an angel","an angel ,","angel , a",", a demon","a demon ,","demon , or",", or prove","or prove that","prove that ghosts","that ghosts exist","ghosts exist -","exist - anything","- anything to","anything to prove","to prove to","prove to him","to him that","him that we","that we go","we go on","go on after","on after our","after our deaths","He narrows the","narrows the responses","the responses down","responses down to","down to three","to three viable","three viable candidates","viable candidates -","candidates - a","- a scientist","a scientist ,","scientist , a",", a medium","a medium ,","medium , and",", and a","and a worldly","a worldly entrepreneur","Along with his","with his protective","his protective mother","protective mother ,","mother , he",", he embarks","he embarks on","embarks on an","on an adventure","an adventure through","adventure through Los","through Los Angeles","Los Angeles that","Angeles that will","that will spiral","will spiral into","spiral into an","into an unthinkable","an unthinkable nightmare"],"2grams":["Paralyzed by","by his","his fear","fear of","of dying","dying ,",", Miles","Miles Grissom","Grissom takes","takes out","out an","an advert","advert offering","offering 30000","30000 dollars","dollars in","in reward","reward money","money to","to the","the first","first person","person who","who can","can show","show him","him evidence","evidence of","of an","an angel","angel ,",", a","a demon","demon ,",", or","or prove","prove that","that ghosts","ghosts exist","exist -","- anything","anything to","to prove","prove to","to him","him that","that we","we go","go on","on after","after our","our deaths","He narrows","narrows the","the responses","responses down","down to","to three","three viable","viable candidates","candidates -","- a","a scientist","scientist ,",", a","a medium","medium ,",", and","and a","a worldly","worldly entrepreneur","Along with","with his","his protective","protective mother","mother ,",", he","he embarks","embarks on","on an","an adventure","adventure through","through Los","Los Angeles","Angeles that","that will","will spiral","spiral into","into an","an unthinkable","unthinkable nightmare"]}

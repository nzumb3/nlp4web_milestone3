{"title":"The Flower of Evil","plot":"Anne runs for re-election to the town council, shepherded by Matthieu, her fellow candidate and campaign manager. Her husband, Gérard, a businessman and philanderer, hates the campaign and feels vindication when a nasty leaflet circulates about their family history. His son, François, just back from the U.S., is in love with his step-sister Michèle, and she with him, although something is amiss besides their being cousins. Watching it all is their elderly Aunt Line, who has her own haunting memories. A death in World War II and a death on election night collapse time in the perpetual present and bring unexpected expiation. There's a lot to celebrate.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Anne","run","for","re-elect","to","the","town","council",",","shepherd","by","Matthieu",",","her","fellow","candid","and","campaign","manag",".","Her","husband",",","Gérard",",","a","businessman","and","philander",",","hate","the","campaign","and","feel","vindic","when","a","nasti","leaflet","circul","about","their","famili","histori",".","His","son",",","Françoi",",","just","back","from","the","U.S.",",","is","in","love","with","his","step-sist","Michèl",",","and","she","with","him",",","although","someth","is","amiss","besid","their","be","cousin",".","Watch","it","all","is","their","elder","Aunt","Line",",","who","has","her","own","haunt","memori",".","A","death","in","World","War","II","and","a","death","on","elect","night","collaps","time","in","the","perpetu","present","and","bring","unexpect","expiat",".","There","'s","a","lot","to","celebr","."],"lemmas":["Anne","run","for","re-election","to","the","town","council",",","shepherd","by","Matthieu",",","she","fellow","candidate","and","campaign","manager",".","she","husband",",","Gérard",",","a","businessman","and","philanderer",",","hate","the","campaign","and","feel","vindication","when","a","nasty","leaflet","circulate","about","they","family","history",".","he","son",",","François",",","just","back","from","the","U.S.",",","be","in","love","with","he","step-sister","Michèle",",","and","she","with","he",",","although","something","be","amiss","besides","they","be","cousin",".","watch","it","all","be","they","elderly","Aunt","Line",",","who","have","she","own","haunting","memory",".","a","death","in","World","War","II","and","a","death","on","election","night","collapse","time","in","the","perpetual","present","and","bring","unexpected","expiation",".","there","be","a","lot","to","celebrate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Anne

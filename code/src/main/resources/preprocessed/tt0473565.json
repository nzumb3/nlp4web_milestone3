{"title":"Without Mercy","plot":"A young woman reporter passes through Skidmore, Missouri on her way back to Washington, DC. where her life is interrupted along the way by an act of violence. Based on a true story, the film examines the life of sex predator Ken McElroy - the self-proclaimed \"King of Nodaway County.\" Known for his violence and penchant for young girls, McElroy constantly challenged the little town of Skidmore. \"I am everything and you are nothing. I can make you do anything I want!\" On a hot summer day, in the mistaken belief that he had raped and killed a young girl, McElroy was shot dead on the main street of Skidmore, Missouri. 55 people watched, no indictments followed, no trial was ever held, no one came forward to reveal his killers. To this day the killing at Skidmore remains an unsolved murder. This award winning film examines the last six days in the life of Ken Rex McElroy - the most hated man in Missouri.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["A","young","woman","report","pass","through","Skidmor",",","Missouri","on","her","way","back","to","Washington",",","DC",".","where","her","life","is","interrupt","along","the","way","by","an","act","of","violenc",".","Base","on","a","true","stori",",","the","film","examin","the","life","of","sex","predat","Ken","McElroy","-","the","self-proclaim","\"","King","of","Nodaway","Counti",".","\"","Known","for","his","violenc","and","penchant","for","young","girl",",","McElroy","constant","challeng","the","littl","town","of","Skidmor",".","\"","I","am","everyth","and","you","are","noth",".","I","can","make","you","do","anyth","I","want","!","\"","On","a","hot","summer","day",",","in","the","mistaken","belief","that","he","had","rape","and","kill","a","young","girl",",","McElroy","was","shot","dead","on","the","main","street","of","Skidmor",",","Missouri",".","55","peopl","watch",",","no","indict","follow",",","no","trial","was","ever","held",",","no","one","came","forward","to","reveal","his","killer",".","To","this","day","the","kill","at","Skidmor","remain","an","unsolv","murder",".","This","award","win","film","examin","the","last","six","day","in","the","life","of","Ken","Rex","McElroy","-","the","most","hate","man","in","Missouri","."],"lemmas":["a","young","woman","reporter","pass","through","Skidmore",",","Missouri","on","she","way","back","to","Washington",",","DC",".","where","she","life","be","interrupt","along","the","way","by","a","act","of","violence",".","base","on","a","true","story",",","the","film","examine","the","life","of","sex","predator","Ken","McElroy","-","the","self-proclaimed","``","King","of","Nodaway","County",".","''","know","for","he","violence","and","penchant","for","young","girl",",","McElroy","constantly","challenge","the","little","town","of","Skidmore",".","``","I","be","everything","and","you","be","nothing",".","I","can","make","you","do","anything","I","want","!","''","on","a","hot","summer","day",",","in","the","mistaken","belief","that","he","have","rape","and","kill","a","young","girl",",","McElroy","be","shoot","dead","on","the","main","street","of","Skidmore",",","Missouri",".","55","people","watch",",","no","indictment","follow",",","no","trial","be","ever","hold",",","no","one","come","forward","to","reveal","he","killer",".","to","this","day","the","killing","at","Skidmore","remain","a","unsolved","murder",".","this","award","win","film","examine","the","last","six","day","in","the","life","of","Ken","Rex","McElroy","-","the","most","hated","man","in","Missouri","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A young woman","young woman reporter","woman reporter passes","reporter passes through","passes through Skidmore","through Skidmore ,","Skidmore , Missouri",", Missouri on","Missouri on her","on her way","her way back","way back to","back to Washington","to Washington ,","Washington , DC","where her life","her life is","life is interrupted","is interrupted along","interrupted along the","along the way","the way by","way by an","by an act","an act of","act of violence","Based on a","on a true","a true story","true story ,","story , the",", the film","the film examines","film examines the","examines the life","the life of","life of sex","of sex predator","sex predator Ken","predator Ken McElroy","Ken McElroy -","McElroy - the","- the self-proclaimed","the self-proclaimed \"","self-proclaimed \" King","\" King of","King of Nodaway","of Nodaway County","Nodaway County .","County . \"","Known for his","for his violence","his violence and","violence and penchant","and penchant for","penchant for young","for young girls","young girls ,","girls , McElroy",", McElroy constantly","McElroy constantly challenged","constantly challenged the","challenged the little","the little town","little town of","town of Skidmore","\" I am","I am everything","am everything and","everything and you","and you are","you are nothing","I can make","can make you","make you do","you do anything","do anything I","anything I want","I want !","want !

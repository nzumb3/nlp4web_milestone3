{"title":"Resilience","plot":"Myoung-ja, who has sent her son Brent (Sung-wook) abroad to be adopted meets him after 30 years and spends a special time with him. They meet for the first time on national TV, then part ways and meet repeatedly, trying to become a family again. Unfortunately, they are faced with problems that so many families with adopted children experience, such as the language barrier and the cultural gap. Myoung-ja takes part in a movement against international adoptions and tries to build a firm base for her life as she takes care of children born to single mothers. The process of becoming a mother and son unfolds dramatically through interviews and observations that take place over an extended period of time.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Myoung-ja",",","who","has","sent","her","son","Brent","(","Sung-wook",")","abroad","to","be","adopt","meet","him","after","30","year","and","spend","a","special","time","with","him",".","They","meet","for","the","first","time","on","nation","TV",",","then","part","way","and","meet","repeat",",","tri","to","becom","a","famili","again",".","Unfortun",",","they","are","face","with","problem","that","so","mani","famili","with","adopt","children","experi",",","such","as","the","languag","barrier","and","the","cultur","gap",".","Myoung-ja","take","part","in","a","movement","against","intern","adopt","and","tri","to","build","a","firm","base","for","her","life","as","she","take","care","of","children","born","to","singl","mother",".","The","process","of","becom","a","mother","and","son","unfold","dramat","through","interview","and","observ","that","take","place","over","an","extend","period","of","time","."],"lemmas":["myoung-ja",",","who","have","send","she","son","Brent","-lrb-","sung-wook","-rrb-","abroad","to","be","adopt","meet","he","after","30","year","and","spend","a","special","time","with","he",".","they","meet","for","the","first","time","on","national","tv",",","then","part","way","and","meet","repeatedly",",","try","to","become","a","family","again",".","unfortunately",",","they","be","face","with","problem","that","so","many","family","with","adopted","child","experience",",","such","as","the","language","barrier","and","the","cultural","gap",".","myoung-ja","take","part","in","a","movement","against","international","adoption","and","try","to","build","a","firm","base","for","she","life","as","she","take","care","of","child","bear","to","single","mother",".","the","process","of","become","a","mother","and","son","unfold","dramatically","through","interview","and","observation","that","take","place","over","a","extended","period","of","time","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Myoung-ja

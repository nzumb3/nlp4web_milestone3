The young man finds himself serving as librarian to the Great Emperor in exile, whom he deeply hates, yet soon begins recording Napoleon's memoirs, getting to know and learning to value the man behind the myth. Among seductions and affairs, expectations and fears, he will craft a precise portrait that nevertheless will not manage to hide a final, inevitable, disappointment.","genres":["Comedy"," War"," History"],"stems":["Elba","island",",","1814",".","Martino","is","a","young","teacher",",","idealist","and","strong","anti","Napoleon",",","in","love","with","the","beauti","and","nobl","Baro","Emili",".","The","young","man","find","himself","serv","as","librarian","to","the","Great","Emperor","in","exil",",","whom","he","deepli","hate",",","yet","soon","begin","record","Napoleon","'s","memoir",",","get","to","know","and","learn","to","valu","the","man","behind","the","myth",".","Among","seduct","and","affair",",","expect","and","fear",",","he","will","craft","a","precis","portrait","that","nevertheless","will","not","manag","to","hide","a","final",",","inevit",",","disappoint","."],"lemmas":["elba","island",",","1814",".","Martino","be","a","young","teacher",",","idealist","and","strongly","anti","Napoleon",",","in","love","with","the","beautiful","and","noble","Baroness","Emily",".","the","young","man","find","himself","serve","as","librarian","to","the","great","emperor","in","exile",",","whom","he","deeply","hate",",","yet","soon","begin","record","Napoleon","'s","memoirs",",","get","to","know","and","learn","to","value","the","man","behind","the","myth",".","among","seduction","and","affair",",","expectation","and","fear",",","he","will","craft","a","precise","portrait","that","nevertheless","will","not","manage","to","hide","a","final",",","inevitable",",","disappointment","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Elba island ,","island , 1814","Martino is a","is a young","a young teacher","young teacher ,","teacher , idealist",", idealist and","idealist and strongly","and strongly anti","strongly anti Napoleon","anti Napoleon ,","Napoleon , in",", in love","in love with","love with the","with the beautiful","the beautiful and","beautiful and noble","and noble Baroness","noble Baroness Emily","The young man","young man finds","man finds himself","finds himself serving","himself serving as","serving as librarian","as librarian to","librarian to the","to the Great","the Great Emperor","Great Emperor in","Emperor in exile","in exile ,","exile , whom",", whom he","whom he deeply","he deeply hates","deeply hates ,","hates , yet",", yet soon","yet soon begins","soon begins recording","begins recording Napoleon","recording Napoleon 's","Napoleon 's memoirs","'s memoirs ,","memoirs , getting",", getting to","getting to know","to know and","know and learning","and learning to","learning to value","to value the","value the man","the man behind","man behind the","behind the myth","Among seductions and","seductions and affairs","and affairs ,","affairs , expectations",", expectations and","expectations and fears","and fears ,","fears , he",", he will","he will craft","will craft a","craft a precise","a precise portrait","precise portrait that","portrait that nevertheless","that nevertheless will","nevertheless will not","will not manage","not manage to","manage to hide","to hide a","hide a final","a final ,","final , inevitable",", inevitable ,","inevitable , disappointment"],"2grams":["Elba island","island ,",", 1814","Martino is","is a","a young","young teacher","teacher ,",", idealist","idealist and","and strongly","strongly anti","anti Napoleon","Napoleon ,",", in","in love","love with","with the","the beautiful","beautiful and","and noble","noble Baroness","Baroness Emily","The young","young man","man finds","finds himself","himself serving","serving as","as librarian","librarian to","to the","the Great","Great Emperor","Emperor in","in exile","exile ,",", whom","whom he","he deeply","deeply hates","hates ,",", yet","yet soon","soon begins","begins recording","recording Napoleon","Napoleon 's","'s memoirs","memoirs ,",", getting","getting to","to know","know and","and learning","learning to","to value","value the","the man","man behind","behind the","the myth","Among seductions","seductions and","and affairs","affairs ,",", expectations","expectations and","and fears","fears ,",", he","he will","will craft","craft a","a precise","precise portrait","portrait that","that nevertheless","nevertheless will","will not","not manage","manage to","to hide","hide a","a final","final ,",", inevitable","inevitable ,",", disappointment"]}

{"title":"Wild Man Blues","plot":"Academy Award-winner Barbara Kopple directs this documentary portrait of Academy Award and Golden Globe-winner Woody Allen, seen traveling with friends and fellow musicians during their New Orleans jazz band's 1996 European tour. Allen's relationship with his wife Soon-Yi Previn is captured on film here for the first time, and others on the European jaunt include Allen's sister Letty Aronson. Followed by press, paparazzi, and gushing admirers, Allen returns home to face a more realistic critical assessment during \"the lunch from hell\" with his aged parents.","genres":["Documentary"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["Academi","Award-winn","Barbara","Koppl","direct","this","documentari","portrait","of","Academi","Award","and","Golden","Globe-winn","Woodi","Allen",",","seen","travel","with","friend","and","fellow","musician","dure","their","New","Orlean","jazz","band","'s","1996","European","tour",".","Allen","'s","relationship","with","his","wife","Soon-Yi","Previn","is","captur","on","film","here","for","the","first","time",",","and","other","on","the","European","jaunt","includ","Allen","'s","sister","Letti","Aronson",".","Follow","by","press",",","paparazzi",",","and","gush","admir",",","Allen","return","home","to","face","a","more","realist","critic","assess","dure","\"","the","lunch","from","hell","\"","with","his","age","parent","."],"lemmas":["Academy","award-winner","Barbara","Kopple","direct","this","documentary","portrait","of","academy","award","and","Golden","globe-winner","Woody","Allen",",","see","travel","with","friend","and","fellow","musician","during","they","New","Orleans","jazz","band","'s","1996","european","tour",".","Allen","'s","relationship","with","he","wife","Soon-Yi","Previn","be","capture","on","film","here","for","the","first","time",",","and","other","on","the","european","jaunt","include","Allen","'s","sister","Letty","Aronson",".","follow","by","press",",","paparazzi",",","and","gush","admirer",",","Allen","return","home","to","face","a","more","realistic","critical","assessment","during","``","the","lunch","from","hell","''","with","he","aged","parent","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Academy Award-winner Barbara","Award-winner Barbara Kopple","Barbara Kopple directs","Kopple directs this","directs this documentary","this documentary portrait","documentary portrait of","portrait of Academy","of Academy Award","Academy Award and","Award and Golden","and Golden Globe-winner","Golden Globe-winner Woody","Globe-winner Woody Allen","Woody Allen ,","Allen , seen",", seen traveling","seen traveling with","traveling with friends","with friends and","friends and fellow","and fellow musicians","fellow musicians during","musicians during their","during their New","their New Orleans","New Orleans jazz","Orleans jazz band","jazz band 's","band 's 1996","'s 1996 European","1996 European tour","Allen 's relationship","'s relationship with","relationship with his","with his wife","his wife Soon-Yi","wife Soon-Yi Previn","Soon-Yi Previn is","Previn is captured","is captured on","captured on film","on film here","film here for","here for the","for the first","the first time","first time ,","time , and",", and others","and others on","others on the","on the European","the European jaunt","European jaunt include","jaunt include Allen","include Allen 's","Allen 's sister","'s sister Letty","sister Letty Aronson","Followed by press","by press ,","press , paparazzi",", paparazzi ,","paparazzi , and",", and gushing","and gushing admirers","gushing admirers ,","admirers , Allen",", Allen returns","Allen returns home","returns home to","home to face","to face a","face a more","a more realistic","more realistic critical","realistic critical assessment","critical assessment during","assessment during \"","during \" the","\" the lunch","the lunch from","lunch from hell","from hell \"","hell \" with","\" with his","with his aged","his aged parents"],"2grams":["Academy Award-winner","Award-winner Barbara","Barbara Kopple","Kopple directs","directs this","this documentary","documentary portrait","portrait of","of Academy","Academy Award","Award and","and Golden","Golden Globe-winner","Globe-winner Woody","Woody Allen","Allen ,",", seen","seen traveling","traveling with","with friends","friends and","and fellow","fellow musicians","musicians during","during their","their New","New Orleans","Orleans jazz","jazz band","band 's","'s 1996","1996 European","European tour","Allen 's","'s relationship","relationship with","with his","his wife","wife Soon-Yi","Soon-Yi Previn","Previn is","is captured","captured on","on film","film here","here for","for the","the first","first time","time ,",", and","and others","others on","on the","the European","European jaunt","jaunt include","include Allen","Allen 's","'s sister","sister Letty","Letty Aronson","Followed by","by press","press ,",", paparazzi","paparazzi ,",", and","and gushing","gushing admirers","admirers ,",", Allen","Allen returns","returns home","home to","to face","face a","a more","more realistic","realistic critical","critical assessment","assessment during","during \"","\" the","the lunch","lunch from","from hell","hell \"","\" with","with his","his aged","aged parents"]}

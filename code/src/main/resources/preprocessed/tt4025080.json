{"title":"Spiral Bound","plot":"Spiral Bound is a documentary about the unlikely union of eight creative high school students from a youth development program and a group of liberal arts college students over the course of one summer. Together, these education activists are seeking social justice not only in the public school system but also in the higher education arena. On this journey, both groups learn the power of the arts in giving a voice to those who need it the most, including themselves. From the inner city streets of Charlotte and the quaint college town of Davidson to the bustling steps of the US Capitol, these young people stand together to change the face of education through their courageous narratives.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Spiral","Bound","is","a","documentari","about","the","unlik","union","of","eight","creativ","high","school","student","from","a","youth","develop","program","and","a","group","of","liber","art","colleg","student","over","the","cours","of","one","summer",".","Togeth",",","these","educ","activist","are","seek","social","justic","not","onli","in","the","public","school","system","but","also","in","the","higher","educ","arena",".","On","this","journey",",","both","group","learn","the","power","of","the","art","in","give","a","voic","to","those","who","need","it","the","most",",","includ","themselv",".","From","the","inner","citi","street","of","Charlott","and","the","quaint","colleg","town","of","Davidson","to","the","bustl","step","of","the","US","Capitol",",","these","young","peopl","stand","togeth","to","chang","the","face","of","educ","through","their","courag","narrat","."],"lemmas":["spiral","bind","be","a","documentary","about","the","unlikely","union","of","eight","creative","high","school","student","from","a","youth","development","program","and","a","group","of","liberal","art","college","student","over","the","course","of","one","summer",".","together",",","these","education","activist","be","seek","social","justice","not","only","in","the","public","school","system","but","also","in","the","higher","education","arena",".","on","this","journey",",","both","group","learn","the","power","of","the","art","in","give","a","voice","to","those","who","need","it","the","most",",","include","themselves",".","from","the","inner","city","street","of","Charlotte","and","the","quaint","college","town","of","Davidson","to","the","bustling","step","of","the","US","Capitol",",","these","young","people","stand","together","to","change","the","face","of","education","through","they","courageous","narrative","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Spiral

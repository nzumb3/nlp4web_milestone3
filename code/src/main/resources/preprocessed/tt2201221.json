{"title":"Some Girl(s)","plot":"Based on his play by the same name, Neil LaBute's script follows a nameless and successful but misanthropic and narcissistic writer who, on the eve of his wedding, travels across the country to meet up with ex-lovers in an attempt to make amends for past relationship transgressions. Crisscrossing from Seattle to Boston, he reunites with high school sweetheart Sam in Seattle, sexually free-spirited Tyler in Chicago, married English college professor Lindsay in Boston, his best friend's little sister Reggie in Seattle, and \"the one that got away\" Bobbi in Los Angeles. A modern-day Candide stumbling through a landscape familiar to most men-messy breakups.","genres":["Comedy","

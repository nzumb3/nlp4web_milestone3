{"title":"Monkey Dance","plot":"MONKEY DANCE is a documentary film about three teens coming of age in Lowell, Massachusetts. Children of Cambodian refugees, they inhabit a tough, working class world shadowed by their parents' nightmares of the Khmer Rouge. Traditional Cambodian dance links them to their parents' culture, but fast cars, hip consumerism, and good times often pull harder. For the parents, Lowell held the hope of safety, employment, and a chance to finally rebuild some of what was shattered by the Khmer Rouge. But for their children, the city offers a dizzying array of choices - many of them risky. Monkey Dance is the story of how three kids navigate the confusing landscape of urban adolescence and ultimately start to make good on their parents' dreams.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["MONKEi","DANCE","is","a","documentari","film","about","three","teen","come","of","age","in","Lowel",",","Massachusett",".","Children","of","Cambodian","refuge",",","they","inhabit","a","tough",",","work","class","world","shadow","by","their","parent","'","nightmar","of","the","Khmer","Roug",".","Tradit","Cambodian","danc","link","them","to","their","parent","'","cultur",",","but","fast","car",",","hip","consumer",",","and","good","time","often","pull","harder",".","For","the","parent",",","Lowel","held","the","hope","of","safeti",",","employ",",","and","a","chanc","to","final","rebuild","some","of","what","was","shatter","by","the","Khmer","Roug",".","But","for","their","children",",","the","citi","offer","a","dizzi","array","of","choic","-","mani","of","them","riski",".","Monkey","Danc","is","the","stori","of","how","three","kid","navig","the","confus","landscap","of","urban","adolesc","and","ultim","start","to","make","good","on","their","parent","'","dream","."],"lemmas":["monkey","dance","be","a","documentary","film","about","three","teens","come","of","age","in","Lowell",",","Massachusetts",".","child","of","cambodian","refugee",",","they","inhabit","a","tough",",","work","class","world","shadow","by","they","parent","'","nightmare","of","the","Khmer","Rouge",".","traditional","cambodian","dance","link","they","to","they","parent","'","culture",",","but","fast","car",",","hip","consumerism",",","and","good","time","often","pull","harder",".","for","the","parent",",","Lowell","hold","the","hope","of","safety",",","employment",",","and","a","chance","to","finally","rebuild","some","of","what","be","shatter","by","the","Khmer","Rouge",".","but","for","they","child",",","the","city","offer","a","dizzying","array","of","choice","-","many","of","they","risky",".","Monkey","Dance","be","the","story","of","how","three","kid","navigate","the","confusing","landscape","of","urban","adolescence","and","ultimately","start","to","make","good","on","they","parent","'","dream","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["MONKEY DANCE is","DANCE is a","is a documentary","a documentary film","documentary film about","film about three","about three teens","three teens coming","teens coming of","coming of age","of age in","age in Lowell","in Lowell ,","Lowell , Massachusetts","Children of Cambodian","of Cambodian refugees","Cambodian refugees ,","refugees , they",", they inhabit","they inhabit a","inhabit a tough","a tough ,","tough , working",", working class","working class world","class world shadowed","world shadowed by","shadowed by their","by their parents","their parents '","parents ' nightmares","' nightmares of","nightmares of the","of the Khmer","the Khmer Rouge","Traditional Cambodian dance","Cambodian dance links","dance links them","links them to","them to their","to their parents","their parents '","parents ' culture","' culture ,","culture , but",", but fast","but fast cars","fast cars ,","cars , hip",", hip consumerism","hip consumerism ,","consumerism , and",", and good","and good times","good times often","times often pull","often pull harder","For the parents","the parents ,","parents , Lowell",", Lowell held","Lowell held the","held the hope","the hope of","hope of safety","of safety ,","safety , employment",", employment ,","employment , and",", and a","and a chance","a chance to","chance to finally","to finally rebuild","finally rebuild some","rebuild some of","some of what","of what was","what was shattered","was shattered by","shattered by the","by the Khmer","the Khmer Rouge","But for their","for their children","their children ,","children , the",", the city","the city offers","city offers a","offers a dizzying","a dizzying array","dizzying array of","array of choices","of choices -","choices -

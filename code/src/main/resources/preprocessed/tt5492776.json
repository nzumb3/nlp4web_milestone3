{"title":"Borderlines","plot":"Set against a background of farming, saw-milling and moonshining activities during the Depression, Borderlines focuses on a small portion of the Cumberland Plateau along the Kentucky-Tennessee border. Local historical and social conditions beginning with the Civil War have created an atmosphere in which violence has become an acceptable method of handling disagreements. But to an outsider, schoolteacher Larlee Sanders sent in from the county seat, the deadly behavior can only be considered murder. Although Larlee gradually solidifies relationships with members of the community - including Cilla Hatcher, her matter-of-fact landlady, Calvin Jones, a sawmill worker, and her quiet pupil Ought Dobbs - she is reluctant to accept their community's way of living and dying. But one night at a box supper, the familiar combination of moonshine, weapons and violent tempers erupt, and Larlee finds herself in the middle and is forced to accept, reject, or in some way attempt to change a deeply embedded social behavior.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Set","against","a","background","of","farm",",","saw-mil","and","moonshin","activ","dure","the","Depress",",","Borderlin","focus","on","a","small","portion","of","the","Cumberland","Plateau","along","the","Kentucky-Tennesse","border",".","Local","histor","and","social","condit","begin","with","the","Civil","War","have","creat","an","atmospher","in","which","violenc","has","becom","an","accept","method","of","handl","disagr",".","But","to","an","outsid",",","schoolteach","Larle","Sander","sent","in","from","the","counti","seat",",","the","dead","behavior","can","onli","be","consid","murder",".","Although","Larle","gradual","solidifi","relationship","with","member","of","the","communiti","-","includ","Cilla","Hatcher",",","her","matter-of-fact","landladi",",","Calvin","Jone",",","a","sawmil","worker",",","and","her","quiet","pupil","Ought","Dobb","-","she","is","reluct","to","accept","their","communiti","'s","way","of","live","and","die",".","But","one","night","at","a","box","supper",",","the","familiar","combin","of","moonshin",",","weapon","and","violent","temper","erupt",",","and","Larle","find","herself","in","the","middl","and","is","forc","to","accept",",","reject",",","or","in","some","way","attempt","to","chang","a","deepli","embed","social","behavior","."],"lemmas":["set","against","a","background","of","farming",",","saw-milling","and","moonshining","activity","during","the","Depression",",","Borderlines","focus","on","a","small","portion","of","the","Cumberland","Plateau","along","the","Kentucky-Tennessee","border",".","local","historical","and","social","condition","begin","with","the","Civil","War","have","create","a","atmosphere","in","which","violence","have","become","a","acceptable","method","of","handle","disagreement",".","but","to","a","outsider",",","schoolteacher","Larlee","Sanders","send","in","from","the","county","seat",",","the","deadly","behavior","can","only","be","consider","murder",".","although","Larlee","gradually","solidify","relationship","with","member","of","the","community","-","include","Cilla","Hatcher",",","she","matter-of-fact","landlady",",","Calvin","Jones",",","a","sawmill","worker",",","and","she","quiet","pupil","Ought","Dobbs","-","she","be","reluctant","to","accept","they","community","'s","way","of","live","and","die",".","but","one","night","at","a","box","supper",",","the","familiar","combination","of","moonshine",",","weapon","and","violent","temper","erupt",",","and","Larlee","find","herself","in","the","middle","and","be","force","to","accept",",","reject",",","or","in","some","way","attempt","to","change","a","deeply","embedded","social","behavior","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Set against a","against a background","a background of","background of farming","of farming ,","farming , saw-milling",", saw-milling and","saw-milling and moonshining","and moonshining activities","moonshining activities during","activities during the","during the Depression","the Depression ,","Depression , Borderlines",", Borderlines focuses","Borderlines focuses on","focuses on a","on a small","a small portion","small portion of","portion of the","of the Cumberland","the Cumberland Plateau","Cumberland Plateau along","Plateau along the","along the Kentucky-Tennessee","the Kentucky-Tennessee border","Local historical and","historical and social","and social conditions","social conditions beginning","conditions beginning with","beginning with the","with the Civil","the Civil War","Civil War have","War have created","have created an","created an atmosphere","an atmosphere in","atmosphere in which","in which violence","which violence has","violence has become","has become an","become an acceptable","an acceptable method","acceptable method of","method of handling","of handling disagreements","But to an","to an outsider","an outsider ,","outsider , schoolteacher",", schoolteacher Larlee","schoolteacher Larlee Sanders","Larlee Sanders sent","Sanders sent in","sent in from","in from the","from the county","the county seat","county seat ,","seat , the",", the deadly","the deadly behavior","deadly behavior can","behavior can only","can only be","only be considered","be considered murder","Although Larlee gradually","Larlee gradually solidifies","gradually solidifies relationships","solidifies relationships with","relationships with members","with members of","members of the","of the community","the community -","community -

{"title":"PremGranth","plot":"Professionally qualified as a lawyer, Somen lives a wealthy lifestyle with his mom, Parvati, and dad, Dharam Bhushan, who presides over the town of Shripuri as an upper caste Hindu Priest. During the Dassera fest, Somen meets with village belle, Kajri, and falls in love with her despite of the fact that she is of a much lower caste. After seeking his mom's permission, he goes to bring Kajri to meet her, but finds out that she has left for an unknown destination. Unable to stand his dad's hypocrisy and Bhagwan Shri Ram's temple being misused by Kedar Nath, Somen leaves home to go to the city but is unable to get Kajri out of his mind. A year later he returns home to the same fest, but is still unable to locate Kajri. When his dad insists that he marry Kedar's daughter, Somen not only refuses but leaves home to go and stay with his paternal uncle, Nandlal, who runs a Dairy farm. This is where he meets with Kajri and both rekindle their romance. Somen returns home, convinces his mom initially to approve of Kajri, and is pleasantly surprised to find that even his dad has given his approval. On the day of the marriage, Somen's world is turned upside down when his dad accuses Kajri of being a woman of ill repute as well as an unwed mother. The question remains: Are Bhushan's allegations true, and if so, will Somen accept Kajri now, or will he reject her and marry Kedar's daughter?","genres":["Drama"," Romance","

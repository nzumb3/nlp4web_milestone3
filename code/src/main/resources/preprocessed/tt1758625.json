{"title":"Hollywood","plot":"Fifteen women around a man who cannot leave his house. A mixture of comedy and drama about Felix, a neurotic, depressive and agoraphobic writer, while writing a screenplay about his pathetic existence. Hollywood is about movies and life, an update, somehow ironic and indie to FELLINI's 8 and 1/2, a NINE whose only music is the water in the sink. With a style based on dialogs in the mood of Eric Rohmer or Noah Baumbach films, HOLLYWOOD faces the main character up to fifteen different types of women: the girlfriend, the ex-girlfriend, the maid, the elderly neighbor, the student... and is a touching story of love and loneliness.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Fifteen","women","around","a","man","who","can","not","leav","his","hous",".","A","mixtur","of","comedi","and","drama","about","Felix",",","a","neurot",",","depress","and","agoraphob","writer",",","while","write","a","screenplay","about","his","pathet","exist",".","Hollywood","is","about","movi","and","life",",","an","updat",",","somehow","iron","and","indi","to","FELLINI","'s","8","and","1/2",",","a","NINE","whose","onli","music","is","the","water","in","the","sink",".","With","a","style","base","on","dialog","in","the","mood","of","Eric","Rohmer","or","Noah","Baumbach","film",",","HOLLYWOOD","face","the","main","charact","up","to","fifteen","differ","type","of","women",":","the","girlfriend",",","the","ex-girlfriend",",","the","maid",",","the","elder","neighbor",",","the","student","...","and","is","a","touch","stori","of","love","and","loneli","."],"lemmas":["fifteen","woman","around","a","man","who","can","not","leave","he","house",".","a","mixture","of","comedy","and","drama","about","Felix",",","a","neurotic",",","depressive","and","agoraphobic","writer",",","while","write","a","screenplay","about","he","pathetic","existence",".","Hollywood","be","about","movie","and","life",",","a","update",",","somehow","ironic","and","indie","to","FELLINI","'s","8","and","1/2",",","a","nine","whose","only","music","be","the","water","in","the","sink",".","with","a","style","base","on","dialog","in","the","mood","of","Eric","Rohmer","or","Noah","Baumbach","film",",","HOLLYWOOD","face","the","main","character","up","to","fifteen","different","type","of","woman",":","the","girlfriend",",","the","ex-girlfriend",",","the","maid",",","the","elderly","neighbor",",","the","student","...","and","be","a","touch","story","of","love","and","loneliness","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Fifteen

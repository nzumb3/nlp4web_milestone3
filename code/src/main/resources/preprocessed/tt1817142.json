{"title":"Family Instinct","plot":"'Family Instinct' is a film about incest - an illegal act, social taboo and a violation of religious norms. Zanda is a 28-year-old woman, worn out by hard work. Surrounded by poverty and despair, she is trying to survive with her two children in a god-forsaken Latvian village. Her hardships can be traced back to living in a relationship with her brother Valdis. When Valdis is put in jail, the local community forces her to make a difficult choice: to stay with him or with her children. Despite her ill fortune, she manages to express her love for the children, still hoping to save her family. The film offers a tragicomic but highly authentic insight into the bleak reality of Latvian countryside today.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["'","Famili","Instinct","'","is","a","film","about","incest","-","an","illeg","act",",","social","taboo","and","a","violat","of","religi","norm",".","Zanda","is","a","28-year-old","woman",",","worn","out","by","hard","work",".","Surround","by","poverti","and","despair",",","she","is","tri","to","surviv","with","her","two","children","in","a","god-forsaken","Latvian","villag",".","Her","hardship","can","be","trace","back","to","live","in","a","relationship","with","her","brother","Valdi",".","When","Valdi","is","put","in","jail",",","the","local","communiti","forc","her","to","make","a","difficult","choic",":","to","stay","with","him","or","with","her","children",".","Despit","her","ill","fortun",",","she","manag","to","express","her","love","for","the","children",",","still","hope","to","save","her","famili",".","The","film","offer","a","tragicom","but","high","authent","insight","into","the","bleak","realiti","of","Latvian","countrysid","today","."],"lemmas":["'","Family","Instinct","'","be","a","film","about","incest","-","a","illegal","act",",","social","taboo","and","a","violation","of","religious","norm",".","Zanda","be","a","28-year-old","woman",",","wear","out","by","hard","work",".","surround","by","poverty","and","despair",",","she","be","try","to","survive","with","she","two","child","in","a","god-forsaken","latvian","village",".","she","hardship","can","be","trace","back","to","live","in","a","relationship","with","she","brother","Valdis",".","when","Valdis","be","put","in","jail",",","the","local","community","force","she","to","make","a","difficult","choice",":","to","stay","with","he","or","with","she","child",".","despite","she","ill","fortune",",","she","manage","to","express","she","love","for","the","child",",","still","hope","to","save","she","family",".","the","film","offer","a","tragicomic","but","highly","authentic","insight","into","the","bleak","reality","of","latvian","countryside","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["' Family Instinct","Family Instinct '","Instinct ' is","' is a","is a film","a film about","film about incest","about incest -","incest -

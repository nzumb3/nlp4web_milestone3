{"title":"Zuretzako","plot":"When life repeats itself, we'll do anything to change our destiny. We'll toil and sacrifice for our families, without asking the cost on our children. To support his family in the Basque Country, Joaquin must herd sheep alone in America. Burning suns and blistering winds have made him a quiet and distant man. When his son joins him herding, years of separation and sacrifice come to a head. Together, they must battle the mountains, the isolation, and each other. The first American-made Basque-language film, Zuretzako tells the story of filmmaker and Princess Grace Award-Winner Javi Zubizarreta's grandfather. Starring Zubizarreta's own father and brother in the title roles, Zuretzako tells the story of the sacrifices that fathers make and the toll they take on their sons.","genres":["Biography"," Family","

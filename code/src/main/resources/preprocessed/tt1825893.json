{"title":"My Angel","plot":"Brad Curtis (Tim Blore) is a husband and father who struggles with forgiveness, which creates a distance between him and his family. One night, after experiencing some car trouble, Brad loses consciousness near the road and awakens in a world where his wife and son do not exist. As Brad searches for the family that only he can remember, he encounters a mysterious young girl (Sarah Rogerson), a surprisingly unconventional preacher (Dave Johnson), and several other characters who help him discover a truth he had not previously contemplated: no one is beyond falling. In the end, Brad is able to return to his family with this new understanding.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Brad","Curti","(","Tim","Blore",")","is","a","husband","and","father","who","struggl","with","forgiv",",","which","creat","a","distanc","between","him","and","his","famili",".","One","night",",","after","experienc","some","car","troubl",",","Brad","lose","conscious","near","the","road","and","awaken","in","a","world","where","his","wife","and","son","do","not","exist",".","As","Brad","search","for","the","famili","that","onli","he","can","rememb",",","he","encount","a","mysteri","young","girl","(","Sarah","Rogerson",")",",","a","surpris","unconvent","preacher","(","Dave","Johnson",")",",","and","sever","other","charact","who","help","him","discov","a","truth","he","had","not","previous","contempl",":","no","one","is","beyond","fall",".","In","the","end",",","Brad","is","abl","to","return","to","his","famili","with","this","new","understand","."],"lemmas":["Brad","Curtis","-lrb-","Tim","Blore","-rrb-","be","a","husband","and","father","who","struggle","with","forgiveness",",","which","create","a","distance","between","he","and","he","family",".","one","night",",","after","experience","some","car","trouble",",","Brad","lose","consciousness","near","the","road","and","awaken","in","a","world","where","he","wife","and","son","do","not","exist",".","as","Brad","search","for","the","family","that","only","he","can","remember",",","he","encounter","a","mysterious","young","girl","-lrb-","Sarah","Rogerson","-rrb-",",","a","surprisingly","unconventional","preacher","-lrb-","Dave","Johnson","-rrb-",",","and","several","other","character","who","help","he","discover","a","truth","he","have","not","previously","contemplate",":","no","one","be","beyond","fall",".","in","the","end",",","Brad","be","able","to","return","to","he","family","with","this","new","understanding","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Brad

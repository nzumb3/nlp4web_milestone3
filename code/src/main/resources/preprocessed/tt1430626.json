{"title":"The Pirates! Band of Misfits","plot":"After years of humiliation and failed attempts to win the coveted Pirate of the Year Award, Pirate Captain and his oddball crew take on the cream of the pirating crop - Black Bellamy, Peg Leg Hastings and Cutlass Liz - in a race to pillage the most booty. They soon cross paths with lovelorn scientist Charles Darwin, who persuades the Captain that the crew's prized 'parrot', Polly, could be the answer to the 'untold riches' they are searching for. Their adventure takes them to Victorian London where they meet Darwin's sidekick 'man-panzee' Mister Bobo, and the notorious pirate-hating Queen Victoria herself. It soon unfolds that Darwin's motives for helping the crew are not what they seem, and the Queen has an evil hidden agenda of her own. The Pirate Captain must choose between basking in the glory of being crowned Pirate of the Year, or staying faithful to his trusted crew.","genres":["Adventure"," Comedy"," Animation"],"stems":["After","year","of","humili","and","fail","attempt","to","win","the","covet","Pirat","of","the","Year","Award",",","Pirat","Captain","and","his","oddbal","crew","take","on","the","cream","of","the","pirat","crop","-","Black","Bellami",",","Peg","Leg","Hast","and","Cutlass","Liz","-","in","a","race","to","pillag","the","most","booti",".","They","soon","cross","path","with","lovelorn","scientist","Charl","Darwin",",","who","persuad","the","Captain","that","the","crew","'s","prize","'","parrot","'",",","Polli",",","could","be","the","answer","to","the","'","untold","rich","'","they","are","search","for",".","Their","adventur","take","them","to","Victorian","London","where","they","meet","Darwin","'s","sidekick","'","man-panze","'","Mister","Bobo",",","and","the","notori","pirate-h","Queen","Victoria","herself",".","It","soon","unfold","that","Darwin","'s","motiv","for","help","the","crew","are","not","what","they","seem",",","and","the","Queen","has","an","evil","hidden","agenda","of","her","own",".","The","Pirat","Captain","must","choos","between","bask","in","the","glori","of","be","crown","Pirat","of","the","Year",",","or","stay","faith","to","his","trust","crew","."],"lemmas":["after","year","of","humiliation","and","fail","attempt","to","win","the","coveted","Pirate","of","the","year","award",",","Pirate","Captain","and","he","oddball","crew","take","on","the","cream","of","the","pirate","crop","-","Black","Bellamy",",","Peg","Leg","Hastings","and","Cutlass","Liz","-","in","a","race","to","pillage","the","most","booty",".","they","soon","cross","path","with","lovelorn","scientist","Charles","Darwin",",","who","persuade","the","Captain","that","the","crew","'s","prize","'","parrot","'",",","Polly",",","could","be","the","answer","to","the","'","untold","riches","'","they","be","search","for",".","they","adventure","take","they","to","victorian","London","where","they","meet","Darwin","'s","sidekick","'","man-panzee","'","Mister","Bobo",",","and","the","notorious","pirate-hating","Queen","Victoria","herself",".","it","soon","unfold","that","Darwin","'s","motive","for","help","the","crew","be","not","what","they","seem",",","and","the","Queen","have","a","evil","hidden","agenda","of","she","own",".","the","Pirate","Captain","must","choose","between","bask","in","the","glory","of","be","crown","Pirate","of","the","year",",","or","stay","faithful","to","he","trust","crew","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After years of","years of humiliation","of humiliation and","humiliation and failed","and failed attempts","failed attempts to","attempts to win","to win the","win the coveted","the coveted Pirate","coveted Pirate of","Pirate of the","of the Year","the Year Award","Year Award ,","Award , Pirate",", Pirate Captain","Pirate Captain and","Captain and his","and his oddball","his oddball crew","oddball crew take","crew take on","take on the","on the cream","the cream of","cream of the","of the pirating","the pirating crop","pirating crop -","crop -

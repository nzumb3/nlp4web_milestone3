{"title":"Sur Nos Traces","plot":"Priests. Revolutionaries. Grandpas. In 1965, six priests in their 20s leave their native Spain to discover the World. As missionaries in Bolivia, they think they'll change mentalities; but they'll be the ones changed. Witnesses to great Latin-American revolutions, they rub shoulders with Che Guevara's guerrilleros, hide weapons and wounded men, preach for a Liberation theology. Kicked out of the country for their beliefs, they ended up splitting. Some married, had children. Now in their 70s, as aging bring worrying signs of Alzheimer and Cancer, they've decided to take back the trip that has changed their lives. The youngest's daughter, a filmmaker, has decided to follow them. A witty and joyful trip into memories, WE WERE THERE gives voice to six friends and their surprising destinies.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Priest",".","Revolutionari",".","Grandpa",".","In","1965",",","six","priest","in","their","20s","leav","their","nativ","Spain","to","discov","the","World",".","As","missionari","in","Bolivia",",","they","think","they","ll","chang","mental",";","but","they","ll","be","the","one","chang",".","Wit","to","great","Latin-American","revolut",",","they","rub","shoulder","with","Che","Guevara","'s","guerrillero",",","hide","weapon","and","wound","men",",","preach","for","a","Liber","theolog",".","Kick","out","of","the","countri","for","their","belief",",","they","end","up","split",".","Some","marri",",","had","children",".","Now","in","their","70s",",","as","age","bring","worri","sign","of","Alzheimer","and","Cancer",",","they","ve","decid","to","take","back","the","trip","that","has","chang","their","live",".","The","youngest","'s","daughter",",","a","filmmak",",","has","decid","to","follow","them",".","A","witti","and","joy","trip","into","memori",",","WE","WERE","THERE","give","voic","to","six","friend","and","their","surpris","destini","."],"lemmas":["priest",".","revolutionary",".","grandpa",".","in","1965",",","six","priest","in","they","20","leave","they","native","Spain","to","discover","the","World",".","as","missionary","in","Bolivia",",","they","think","they","will","change","mentality",";","but","they","will","be","the","one","change",".","witness","to","great","latin-american","revolution",",","they","rub","shoulder","with","Che","Guevara","'s","guerrillero",",","hide","weapon","and","wounded","man",",","preach","for","a","Liberation","theology",".","kick","out","of","the","country","for","they","belief",",","they","end","up","splitting",".","some","married",",","have","child",".","now","in","they","70",",","as","aging","bring","worrying","sign","of","Alzheimer","and","Cancer",",","they","have","decide","to","take","back","the","trip","that","have","change","they","life",".","the","youngest","'s","daughter",",","a","filmmaker",",","have","decide","to","follow","they",".","a","witty","and","joyful","trip","into","memory",",","WE","WERE","THERE","give","voice","to","six","friend","and","they","surprising","destiny","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1965 ,","1965 , six",", six priests","six priests in","priests in their","in their 20s","their 20s leave","20s leave their","leave their native","their native Spain","native Spain to","Spain to discover","to discover the","discover the World","As missionaries in","missionaries in Bolivia","in Bolivia ,","Bolivia , they",", they think","they think they","think they 'll","they 'll change","'ll change mentalities","change mentalities ;","mentalities ;

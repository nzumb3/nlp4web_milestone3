{"title":"Raw Faith","plot":"A Maine family with a child with Marfans syndrome decides to build a floating family compound in the form of a replica of a 16th century galleon that is also handicapped accessible. The project evolves from a family focused effort into a broader mission to take other families with handicapped members on sailing adventures. The pursuit of the mission triggers the dissolution of the family and the ship experiences adventure and tragedy including its tragic sinking in a December storm.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","Main","famili","with","a","child","with","Marfan","syndrom","decid","to","build","a","float","famili","compound","in","the","form","of","a","replica","of","a","16th","centuri","galleon","that","is","also","handicap","access",".","The","project","evolv","from","a","famili","focus","effort","into","a","broader","mission","to","take","other","famili","with","handicap","member","on","sail","adventur",".","The","pursuit","of","the","mission","trigger","the","dissolut","of","the","famili","and","the","ship","experi","adventur","and","tragedi","includ","it","tragic","sink","in","a","Decemb","storm","."],"lemmas":["a","Maine","family","with","a","child","with","Marfans","syndrome","decide","to","build","a","floating","family","compound","in","the","form","of","a","replica","of","a","16th","century","galleon","that","be","also","handicap","accessible",".","the","project","evolve","from","a","family","focused","effort","into","a","broader","mission","to","take","other","family","with","handicapped","member","on","sailing","adventure",".","the","pursuit","of","the","mission","trigger","the","dissolution","of","the","family","and","the","ship","experience","adventure","and","tragedy","include","its","tragic","sinking","in","a","December","storm","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A Maine family","Maine family with","family with a","with a child","a child with","child with Marfans","with Marfans syndrome","Marfans syndrome decides","syndrome decides to","decides to build","to build a","build a floating","a floating family","floating family compound","family compound in","compound in the","in the form","the form of","form of a","of a replica","a replica of","replica of a","of a 16th","a 16th century","16th century galleon","century galleon that","galleon that is","that is also","is also handicapped","also handicapped accessible","The project evolves","project evolves from","evolves from a","from a family","a family focused","family focused effort","focused effort into","effort into a","into a broader","a broader mission","broader mission to","mission to take","to take other","take other families","other families with","families with handicapped","with handicapped members","handicapped members on","members on sailing","on sailing adventures","The pursuit of","pursuit of the","of the mission","the mission triggers","mission triggers the","triggers the dissolution","the dissolution of","dissolution of the","of the family","the family and","family and the","and the ship","the ship experiences","ship experiences adventure","experiences adventure and","adventure and tragedy","and tragedy including","tragedy including its","including its tragic","its tragic sinking","tragic sinking in","sinking in a","in a December","a December storm"],"2grams":["A Maine","Maine family","family with","with a","a child","child with","with Marfans","Marfans syndrome","syndrome decides","decides to","to build","build a","a floating","floating family","family compound","compound in","in the","the form","form of","of a","a replica","replica of","of a","a 16th","16th century","century galleon","galleon that","that is","is also","also handicapped","handicapped accessible","The project","project evolves","evolves from","from a","a family","family focused","focused effort","effort into","into a","a broader","broader mission","mission to","to take","take other","other families","families with","with handicapped","handicapped members","members on","on sailing","sailing adventures","The pursuit","pursuit of","of the","the mission","mission triggers","triggers the","the dissolution","dissolution of","of the","the family","family and","and the","the ship","ship experiences","experiences adventure","adventure and","and tragedy","tragedy including","including its","its tragic","tragic sinking","sinking in","in a","a December","December storm"]}

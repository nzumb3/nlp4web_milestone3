{"title":"Geraldine's Fortune","plot":"Geraldine Elmhurst Liddle - Deen to her friends - is up against five other contestants for the $2 million jackpot on the game show \"Bring Home the Bacon!\". News of her upcoming appearance on the show takes her small New Brunswick hometown by storm. She practices and studies for the show, but her friends and family just assume she's going to win. Even her younger sisters Rose and Greta and her friend Tina - her \"three little piggies\" as they are referred to on the show who are supposed to answer any question she cannot - don't study on the assumption that Deen will do all the work. In addition to her three little piggies, her friends and family let her know what they could use with her winnings. Beyond what happens on the show, Deen's notoriety from this event brings out some skeletons from the Elmhurst family closet.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Geraldin","Elmhurst","Liddl","-","Deen","to","her","friend","-","is","up","against","five","other","contest","for","the","$","2","million","jackpot","on","the","game","show","\"","Bring","Home","the","Bacon","!","\"",".","New","of","her","upcom","appear","on","the","show","take","her","small","New","Brunswick","hometown","by","storm",".","She","practic","and","studi","for","the","show",",","but","her","friend","and","famili","just","assum","she","'s","go","to","win",".","Even","her","younger","sister","Rose","and","Greta","and","her","friend","Tina","-","her","\"","three","littl","piggi","\"","as","they","are","refer","to","on","the","show","who","are","suppos","to","answer","ani","question","she","can","not","-","do","n't","studi","on","the","assumpt","that","Deen","will","do","all","the","work",".","In","addit","to","her","three","littl","piggi",",","her","friend","and","famili","let","her","know","what","they","could","use","with","her","win",".","Beyond","what","happen","on","the","show",",","Deen","'s","notorieti","from","this","event","bring","out","some","skeleton","from","the","Elmhurst","famili","closet","."],"lemmas":["Geraldine","Elmhurst","Liddle","-","deen","to","she","friend","-","be","up","against","five","other","contestant","for","the","$","2","million","jackpot","on","the","game","show","``","bring","Home","the","Bacon","!","''",".","news","of","she","upcoming","appearance","on","the","show","take","she","small","New","Brunswick","hometown","by","storm",".","she","practice","and","study","for","the","show",",","but","she","friend","and","family","just","assume","she","be","go","to","win",".","even","she","younger","sister","Rose","and","Greta","and","she","friend","Tina","-","she","``","three","little","piggy","''","as","they","be","refer","to","on","the","show","who","be","suppose","to","answer","any","question","she","can","not","-","do","not","study","on","the","assumption","that","Deen","will","do","all","the","work",".","in","addition","to","she","three","little","piggy",",","she","friend","and","family","let","she","know","what","they","could","use","with","she","winnings",".","Beyond","what","happen","on","the","show",",","Deen","'s","notoriety","from","this","event","bring","out","some","skeleton","from","the","Elmhurst","family","closet","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Geraldine Elmhurst Liddle","Elmhurst Liddle -","Liddle - Deen","- Deen to","Deen to her","to her friends","her friends -","friends - is","- is up","is up against","up against five","against five other","five other contestants","other contestants for","contestants for the","for the $","the $ 2","$ 2 million","2 million jackpot","million jackpot on","jackpot on the","on the game","the game show","game show \"","show \" Bring","\" Bring Home","Bring Home the","Home the Bacon","the Bacon !","Bacon !

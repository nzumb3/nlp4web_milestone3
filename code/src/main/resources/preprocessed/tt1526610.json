{"title":"New Low","plot":"The worst thing about Wendell (Adam Bowers) isn't his slightly balding head, skinny frame, or thin lips; it's that he's a bit of an idiot. He just started dating Vicky (Jayme Ratzer), an angry drunk, who conveniently shares his lack of ambition and cleanliness. But he might prefer a relationship with Joanna (Valerie Jones) because she's a selfless social worker who doesn't have lip acne. Eventually, Wendell is going to have to decide who he really belongs with: the best girl he's ever known-or the worst.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["The","worst","thing","about","Wendel","(","Adam","Bower",")","is","n't","his","slight","bald","head",",","skinni","frame",",","or","thin","lip",";","it","'s","that","he","'s","a","bit","of","an","idiot",".","He","just","start","date","Vicki","(","Jaym","Ratzer",")",",","an","angri","drunk",",","who","conveni","share","his","lack","of","ambit","and","cleanli",".","But","he","might","prefer","a","relationship","with","Joanna","(","Valeri","Jone",")","becaus","she","'s","a","selfless","social","worker","who","doe","n't","have","lip","acn",".","Eventual",",","Wendel","is","go","to","have","to","decid","who","he","realli","belong","with",":","the","best","girl","he","'s","ever","known-or","the","worst","."],"lemmas":["the","worst","thing","about","Wendell","-lrb-","Adam","Bowers","-rrb-","be","not","he","slightly","bald","head",",","skinny","frame",",","or","thin","lip",";","it","be","that","he","be","a","bit","of","a","idiot",".","he","just","start","date","Vicky","-lrb-","Jayme","Ratzer","-rrb-",",","a","angry","drunk",",","who","conveniently","share","he","lack","of","ambition","and","cleanliness",".","but","he","might","prefer","a","relationship","with","Joanna","-lrb-","Valerie","Jones","-rrb-","because","she","be","a","selfless","social","worker","who","do","not","have","lip","acne",".","eventually",",","Wendell","be","go","to","have","to","decide","who","he","really","belong","with",":","the","best","girl","he","be","ever","known-or","the","worst","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The worst thing","worst thing about","thing about Wendell","about Wendell (","Wendell ( Adam","( Adam Bowers","Adam Bowers )","Bowers ) is",") is n't","is n't his","n't his slightly","his slightly balding","slightly balding head","balding head ,","head , skinny",", skinny frame","skinny frame ,","frame , or",", or thin","or thin lips","thin lips ;","lips ; it","; it 's","it 's that","'s that he","that he 's","he 's a","'s a bit","a bit of","bit of an","of an idiot","He just started","just started dating","started dating Vicky","dating Vicky (","Vicky ( Jayme","( Jayme Ratzer","Jayme Ratzer )","Ratzer ) ,",") , an",", an angry","an angry drunk","angry drunk ,","drunk , who",", who conveniently","who conveniently shares","conveniently shares his","shares his lack","his lack of","lack of ambition","of ambition and","ambition and cleanliness","But he might","he might prefer","might prefer a","prefer a relationship","a relationship with","relationship with Joanna","with Joanna (","Joanna ( Valerie","( Valerie Jones","Valerie Jones )","Jones ) because",") because she","because she 's","she 's a","'s a selfless","a selfless social","selfless social worker","social worker who","worker who does","who does n't","does n't have","n't have lip","have lip acne","Eventually , Wendell",", Wendell is","Wendell is going","is going to","going to have","to have to","have to decide","to decide who","decide who he","who he really","he really belongs","really belongs with","belongs with :","with : the",": the best","the best girl","best girl he","girl he 's","he 's ever","'s ever known-or","ever known-or the","known-or the worst"],"2grams":["The worst","worst thing","thing about","about Wendell","Wendell (","( Adam","Adam Bowers","Bowers )",") is","is n't","n't his","his slightly","slightly balding","balding head","head ,",", skinny","skinny frame","frame ,",", or","or thin","thin lips","lips ;","; it","it 's","'s that","that he","he 's","'s a","a bit","bit of","of an","an idiot","He just","just started","started dating","dating Vicky","Vicky (","( Jayme","Jayme Ratzer","Ratzer )",") ,",", an","an angry","angry drunk","drunk ,",", who","who conveniently","conveniently shares","shares his","his lack","lack of","of ambition","ambition and","and cleanliness","But he","he might","might prefer","prefer a","a relationship","relationship with","with Joanna","Joanna (","( Valerie","Valerie Jones","Jones )",") because","because she","she 's","'s a","a selfless","selfless social","social worker","worker who","who does","does n't","n't have","have lip","lip acne","Eventually ,",", Wendell","Wendell is","is going","going to","to have","have to","to decide","decide who","who he","he really","really belongs","belongs with","with :",": the","the best","best girl","girl he","he 's","'s ever","ever known-or","known-or the","the worst"]}

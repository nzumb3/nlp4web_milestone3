He tries to fake the murder and collect his payment, but is double-crossed and framed for the crime. On the run, and believing Divana dead, he chances upon her in New Orleans where he discovers the fake murder was just a diversion for her and the carney owner to steal a quarter of a million dollars in laundered casino money. In a seductive play for trust fueled by passion, Divana convinces Archie to take part in a new plot to steal the casino money and start a new life. In a twisted finale he discovers the true meaning of double-cross in a deadly collision of money and

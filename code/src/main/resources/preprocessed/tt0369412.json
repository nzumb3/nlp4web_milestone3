{"title":"Fading","plot":"With this film I wanted to engage people on some very dark levels. It was my goal to strip away your comfort zone in hopes to keep your emotions raw concerning the themes and topics of this film. This film was a very personal journey into my own soul in search of finding reasons for the how's and why's. After finishing this film I have realized that I'm no closer towards understanding. But perhaps this film was never supposed to supply answers than it was to keep our emotions raw. It is a very difficult film to watch. It was a very difficult film to make. But whether you agree or disagree with the film one thing remains true - atrocities like this happen constantly. And if we become numb to our atrocities we are truly lost.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["With","this","film","I","want","to","engag","peopl","on","some","veri","dark","level",".","It","was","my","goal","to","strip","away","your","comfort","zone","in","hope","to","keep","your","emot","raw","concern","the","theme","and","topic","of","this","film",".","This","film","was","a","veri","person","journey","into","my","own","soul","in","search","of","find","reason","for","the","how","'s","and","whi","'s",".","After","finish","this","film","I","have","realiz","that","I","'m","no","closer","toward","understand",".","But","perhap","this","film","was","never","suppos","to","suppli","answer","than","it","was","to","keep","our","emot","raw",".","It","is","a","veri","difficult","film","to","watch",".","It","was","a","veri","difficult","film","to","make",".","But","whether","you","agre","or","disagre","with","the","film","one","thing","remain","true","-","atroc","like","this","happen","constant",".","And","if","we","becom","numb","to","our","atroc","we","are","truli","lost","."],"lemmas":["with","this","film","I","want","to","engage","people","on","some","very","dark","level",".","it","be","my","goal","to","strip","away","you","comfort","zone","in","hope","to","keep","you","emotion","raw","concern","the","theme","and","topic","of","this","film",".","this","film","be","a","very","personal","journey","into","my","own","soul","in","search","of","find","reason","for","the","how","'s","and","why","'s",".","after","finish","this","film","I","have","realize","that","I","be","no","closer","towards","understanding",".","but","perhaps","this","film","be","never","suppose","to","supply","answer","than","it","be","to","keep","we","emotion","raw",".","it","be","a","very","difficult","film","to","watch",".","it","be","a","very","difficult","film","to","make",".","but","whether","you","agree","or","disagree","with","the","film","one","thing","remain","true","-","atrocity","like","this","happen","constantly",".","and","if","we","become","numb","to","we","atrocity","we","be","truly","lose","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["With this film","this film I","film I wanted","I wanted to","wanted to engage","to engage people","engage people on","people on some","on some very","some very dark","very dark levels","It was my","was my goal","my goal to","goal to strip","to strip away","strip away your","away your comfort","your comfort zone","comfort zone in","zone in hopes","in hopes to","hopes to keep","to keep your","keep your emotions","your emotions raw","emotions raw concerning","raw concerning the","concerning the themes","the themes and","themes and topics","and topics of","topics of this","of this film","This film was","film was a","was a very","a very personal","very personal journey","personal journey into","journey into my","into my own","my own soul","own soul in","soul in search","in search of","search of finding","of finding reasons","finding reasons for","reasons for the","for the how","the how 's","how 's and","'s and why","and why 's","After finishing this","finishing this film","this film I","film I have","I have realized","have realized that","realized that I","that I 'm","I 'm no","'m no closer","no closer towards","closer towards understanding","But perhaps this","perhaps this film","this film was","film was never","was never supposed","never supposed to","supposed to supply","to supply answers","supply answers than","answers than it","than it was","it was to","was to keep","to keep our","keep our emotions","our emotions raw","It is a","is a very","a very difficult","very difficult film","difficult film to","film to watch","It was a","was a very","a very difficult","very difficult film","difficult film to","film to make","But whether you","whether you agree","you agree or","agree or disagree","or disagree with","disagree with the","with the film","the film one","film one thing","one thing remains","thing remains true","remains true -","true -

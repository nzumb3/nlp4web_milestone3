{"title":"Full Tilt Boogie","plot":"A docu-drama about filming From Dusk Till Dawn (1996). Sarah Kelly takes a non-union film crew onto the set and on location near Barstow of this independent, non-union production. Camaraderie and a constant eye on the shooting schedule dominate interactions. Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney mug for Kelly's camera; Robert Rodriguez, Juliette Lewis and Fred Williamson talk about craft; we watch scenes being shot; and Kelly asks crew members why they do what they do. Also, the International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees protests the non-union status of 'From Dusk Till Dawn', executive producer Lawrence Bender tells his side, and Kelly talks to a Variety reporter and others. What's the nature of an indie film?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","docu-drama","about","film","From","Dusk","Till","Dawn","(","1996",")",".","Sarah","Kelli","take","a","non-union","film","crew","onto","the","set","and","on","locat","near","Barstow","of","this","independ",",","non-union","product",".","Camaraderi","and","a","constant","eye","on","the","shoot","schedul","domin","interact",".","Quentin","Tarantino","and","Georg","Clooney","mug","for","Kelli","'s","camera",";","Robert","Rodriguez",",","Juliett","Lewi","and","Fred","Williamson","talk","about","craft",";","we","watch","scene","be","shot",";","and","Kelli","ask","crew","member","whi","they","do","what","they","do",".","Also",",","the","Internat","Allianc","of","Theatric","Stage","Employe","protest","the","non-union","status","of","'","From","Dusk","Till","Dawn","'",",","execut","produc","Lawrenc","Bender","tell","his","side",",","and","Kelli","talk","to","a","Varieti","report","and","other",".","What","'s","the","natur","of","an","indi","film","?"],"lemmas":["a","docu-drama","about","film","from","dusk","till","dawn","-lrb-","1996","-rrb-",".","Sarah","Kelly","take","a","non-union","film","crew","onto","the","set","and","on","location","near","Barstow","of","this","independent",",","non-union","production",".","camaraderie","and","a","constant","eye","on","the","shooting","schedule","dominate","interaction",".","Quentin","Tarantino","and","George","Clooney","mug","for","Kelly","'s","camera",";","Robert","Rodriguez",",","Juliette","Lewis","and","Fred","Williamson","talk","about","craft",";","we","watch","scene","be","shoot",";","and","Kelly","ask","crew","member","why","they","do","what","they","do",".","also",",","the","International","Alliance","of","Theatrical","Stage","Employees","protest","the","non-union","status","of","'","from","dusk","till","dawn","'",",","executive","producer","Lawrence","Bender","tell","he","side",",","and","Kelly","talk","to","a","Variety","reporter","and","other",".","what","be","the","nature","of","a","indie","film","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A docu-drama about","docu-drama about filming","about filming From","filming From Dusk","From Dusk Till","Dusk Till Dawn","Till Dawn (","Dawn ( 1996","( 1996 )","Sarah Kelly takes","Kelly takes a","takes a non-union","a non-union film","non-union film crew","film crew onto","crew onto the","onto the set","the set and","set and on","and on location","on location near","location near Barstow","near Barstow of","Barstow of this","of this independent","this independent ,","independent , non-union",", non-union production","Camaraderie and a","and a constant","a constant eye","constant eye on","eye on the","on the shooting","the shooting schedule","shooting schedule dominate","schedule dominate interactions","Quentin Tarantino and","Tarantino and George","and George Clooney","George Clooney mug","Clooney mug for","mug for Kelly","for Kelly 's","Kelly 's camera","'s camera ;","camera ;

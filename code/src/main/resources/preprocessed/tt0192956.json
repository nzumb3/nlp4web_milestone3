{"title":"The Accountant","plot":"Daniel Bennett gets more than he bargained for after a night in the cells leads to a meeting with a man known to most as The Accountant. Forced in to a situation with looming debts and a unsupporting wife, Daniel soon finds that he cannot stand being in a position where his working life poses a threat to actually living. After plotting an audacious plan to take a large amount of money from his dirty employer Daniel soon realises that in order to steal from these people he'll have to act like them - and run faster than them.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["Daniel","Bennett","get","more","than","he","bargain","for","after","a","night","in","the","cell","lead","to","a","meet","with","a","man","known","to","most","as","The","Accountant",".","Forc","in","to","a","situat","with","loom","debt","and","a","unsupport","wife",",","Daniel","soon","find","that","he","can","not","stand","be","in","a","posit","where","his","work","life","pose","a","threat","to","actual","live",".","After","plot","an","audaci","plan","to","take","a","larg","amount","of","money","from","his","dirti","employ","Daniel","soon","realis","that","in","order","to","steal","from","these","peopl","he","ll","have","to","act","like","them","-","and","run","faster","than","them","."],"lemmas":["Daniel","Bennett","get","more","than","he","bargain","for","after","a","night","in","the","cell","lead","to","a","meeting","with","a","man","know","to","most","as","the","accountant",".","force","in","to","a","situation","with","loom","debt","and","a","unsupporting","wife",",","Daniel","soon","find","that","he","can","not","stand","be","in","a","position","where","he","work","life","pose","a","threat","to","actually","live",".","after","plot","a","audacious","plan","to","take","a","large","amount","of","money","from","he","dirty","employer","Daniel","soon","realise","that","in","order","to","steal","from","these","people","he","will","have","to","act","like","they","-","and","run","faster","than","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Daniel Bennett gets","Bennett gets more","gets more than","more than he","than he bargained","he bargained for","bargained for after","for after a","after a night","a night in","night in the","in the cells","the cells leads","cells leads to","leads to a","to a meeting","a meeting with","meeting with a","with a man","a man known","man known to","known to most","to most as","most as The","as The Accountant","Forced in to","in to a","to a situation","a situation with","situation with looming","with looming debts","looming debts and","debts and a","and a unsupporting","a unsupporting wife","unsupporting wife ,","wife , Daniel",", Daniel soon","Daniel soon finds","soon finds that","finds that he","that he can","he can not","can not stand","not stand being","stand being in","being in a","in a position","a position where","position where his","where his working","his working life","working life poses","life poses a","poses a threat","a threat to","threat to actually","to actually living","After plotting an","plotting an audacious","an audacious plan","audacious plan to","plan to take","to take a","take a large","a large amount","large amount of","amount of money","of money from","money from his","from his dirty","his dirty employer","dirty employer Daniel","employer Daniel soon","Daniel soon realises","soon realises that","realises that in","that in order","in order to","order to steal","to steal from","steal from these","from these people","these people he","people he 'll","he 'll have","'ll have to","have to act","to act like","act like them","like them -","them - and","- and run","and run faster","run faster than","faster than them"],"2grams":["Daniel Bennett","Bennett gets","gets more","more than","than he","he bargained","bargained for","for after","after a","a night","night in","in the","the cells","cells leads","leads to","to a","a meeting","meeting with","with a","a man","man known","known to","to most","most as","as The","The Accountant","Forced in","in to","to a","a situation","situation with","with looming","looming debts","debts and","and a","a unsupporting","unsupporting wife","wife ,",", Daniel","Daniel soon","soon finds","finds that","that he","he can","can not","not stand","stand being","being in","in a","a position","position where","where his","his working","working life","life poses","poses a","a threat","threat to","to actually","actually living","After plotting","plotting an","an audacious","audacious plan","plan to","to take","take a","a large","large amount","amount of","of money","money from","from his","his dirty","dirty employer","employer Daniel","Daniel soon","soon realises","realises that","that in","in order","order to","to steal","steal from","from these","these people","people he","he 'll","'ll have","have to","to act","act like","like them","them -","- and","and run","run faster","faster than","than them"]}

This highly emotional short film includes segments captured by the children themselves who were given handy-cams to document their arduous journey. The highlight of the films is the children's outrageous camp experiences in Camp Simcha-Camp Happiness. The camp features state of the art medical care, and an outrageous and dedicated volunteer and paid staff. The mini documentary featured two families, one from Maryland and the other in Philadelphia. Contains intense subject matter.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Direct","by","David","Jass",",","DMJ","produc","'","Two","Journey","'",",","a","stun","short","documentari","for","Chailifelin","on","Pediatr","cancer",".","This","high","emot","short","film","includ","segment","captur","by","the","children","themselv","who","were","given","handy-cam","to","document","their","arduous","journey",".","The","highlight","of","the","film","is","the","children","'s","outrag","camp","experi","in","Camp","Simcha-Camp","Happi",".","The","camp","featur","state","of","the","art","medic","care",",","and","an","outrag","and","dedic","volunt","and","paid","staff",".","The","mini","documentari","featur","two","famili",",","one","from","Maryland","and","the","other","in","Philadelphia",".","Contain","intens","subject","matter","."],"lemmas":["Directed","by","David","Jasse",",","DMJ","produce","'","two","journey","'",",","a","stunning","short","documentary","for","Chailifeline","on","Pediatric","cancer",".","this","highly","emotional","short","film","include","segment","capture","by","the","child","themselves","who","be","give","handy-cam","to","document","they","arduous","journey",".","the","highlight","of","the","film","be","the","child","'s","outrageous","camp","experience","in","Camp","Simcha-Camp","Happiness",".","the","camp","feature","state","of","the","art","medical","care",",","and","a","outrageous","and","dedicated","volunteer","and","pay","staff",".","the","mini","documentary","feature","two","family",",","one","from","Maryland","and","the","other","in","Philadelphia",".","contain","intense","subject","matter","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Directed by David","by David Jasse","David Jasse ,","Jasse , DMJ",", DMJ produced","DMJ produced '","produced ' Two","' Two Journeys","Two Journeys '","Journeys ' ,","' , a",", a stunning","a stunning short","stunning short documentary","short documentary for","documentary for Chailifeline","for Chailifeline on","Chailifeline on Pediatric","on Pediatric cancer","This highly emotional","highly emotional short","emotional short film","short film includes","film includes segments","includes segments captured","segments captured by","captured by the","by the children","the children themselves","children themselves who","themselves who were","who were given","were given handy-cams","given handy-cams to","handy-cams to document","to document their","document their arduous","their arduous journey","The highlight of","highlight of the","of the films","the films is","films is the","is the children","the children 's","children 's outrageous","'s outrageous camp","outrageous camp experiences","camp experiences in","experiences in Camp","in Camp Simcha-Camp","Camp Simcha-Camp Happiness","The camp features","camp features state","features state of","state of the","of the art","the art medical","art medical care","medical care ,","care , and",", and an","and an outrageous","an outrageous and","outrageous and dedicated","and dedicated volunteer","dedicated volunteer and","volunteer and paid","and paid staff","The mini documentary","mini documentary featured","documentary featured two","featured two families","two families ,","families , one",", one from","one from Maryland","from Maryland and","Maryland and the","and the other","the other in","other in Philadelphia","Contains intense subject","intense subject matter"],"2grams":["Directed by","by David","David Jasse","Jasse ,",", DMJ","DMJ produced","produced '","' Two","Two Journeys","Journeys '","' ,",", a","a stunning","stunning short","short documentary","documentary for","for Chailifeline","Chailifeline on","on Pediatric","Pediatric cancer","This highly","highly emotional","emotional short","short film","film includes","includes segments","segments captured","captured by","by the","the children","children themselves","themselves who","who were","were given","given handy-cams","handy-cams to","to document","document their","their arduous","arduous journey","The highlight","highlight of","of the","the films","films is","is the","the children","children 's","'s outrageous","outrageous camp","camp experiences","experiences in","in Camp","Camp Simcha-Camp","Simcha-Camp Happiness","The camp","camp features","features state","state of","of the","the art","art medical","medical care","care ,",", and","and an","an outrageous","outrageous and","and dedicated","dedicated volunteer","volunteer and","and paid","paid staff","The mini","mini documentary","documentary featured","featured two","two families","families ,",", one","one from","from Maryland","Maryland and","and the","the other","other in","in Philadelphia","Contains intense","intense subject","subject matter"]}

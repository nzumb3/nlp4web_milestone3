{"title":"Seoul Searching","plot":"During the 1980s, the Korean government created a special summer camp for \"gyopo\" or foreign born teenagers where they could spend their summer in Seoul to learn about their motherland. While the intentions of the program were honorable, the activities of the teens were not. The program was eventually cancelled after a few years because the government simply could not control the youth. Seoul Searching is a teen comedy and coming of age film, based on a true story about one of the summer camps that took place in 1986.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["Dure","the","1980s",",","the","Korean","govern","creat","a","special","summer","camp","for","\"","gyopo","\"","or","foreign","born","teenag","where","they","could","spend","their","summer","in","Seoul","to","learn","about","their","motherland",".","While","the","intent","of","the","program","were","honor",",","the","activ","of","the","teen","were","not",".","The","program","was","eventu","cancel","after","a","few","year","becaus","the","govern","simpli","could","not","control","the","youth",".","Seoul","Search","is","a","teen","comedi","and","come","of","age","film",",","base","on","a","true","stori","about","one","of","the","summer","camp","that","took","place","in","1986","."],"lemmas":["during","the","1980s",",","the","korean","government","create","a","special","summer","camp","for","``","gyopo","''","or","foreign","born","teenager","where","they","could","spend","they","summer","in","Seoul","to","learn","about","they","motherland",".","while","the","intention","of","the","program","be","honorable",",","the","activity","of","the","teens","be","not",".","the","program","be","eventually","cancel","after","a","few","year","because","the","government","simply","could","not","control","the","youth",".","Seoul","searching","be","a","teen","comedy","and","come","of","age","film",",","base","on","a","true","story","about","one","of","the","summer","camp","that","take","place","in","1986","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["During the 1980s","the 1980s ,","1980s , the",", the Korean","the Korean government","Korean government created","government created a","created a special","a special summer","special summer camp","summer camp for","camp for \"","for \" gyopo","\" gyopo \"","gyopo \" or","\" or foreign","or foreign born","foreign born teenagers","born teenagers where","teenagers where they","where they could","they could spend","could spend their","spend their summer","their summer in","summer in Seoul","in Seoul to","Seoul to learn","to learn about","learn about their","about their motherland","While the intentions","the intentions of","intentions of the","of the program","the program were","program were honorable","were honorable ,","honorable , the",", the activities","the activities of","activities of the","of the teens","the teens were","teens were not","The program was","program was eventually","was eventually cancelled","eventually cancelled after","cancelled after a","after a few","a few years","few years because","years because the","because the government","the government simply","government simply could","simply could not","could not control","not control the","control the youth","Seoul Searching is","Searching is a","is a teen","a teen comedy","teen comedy and","comedy and coming","and coming of","coming of age","of age film","age film ,","film , based",", based on","based on a","on a true","a true story","true story about","story about one","about one of","one of the","of the summer","the summer camps","summer camps that","camps that took","that took place","took place in","place in 1986"],"2grams":["During the","the 1980s","1980s ,",", the","the Korean","Korean government","government created","created a","a special","special summer","summer camp","camp for","for \"","\" gyopo","gyopo \"","\" or","or foreign","foreign born","born teenagers","teenagers where","where they","they could","could spend","spend their","their summer","summer in","in Seoul","Seoul to","to learn","learn about","about their","their motherland","While the","the intentions","intentions of","of the","the program","program were","were honorable","honorable ,",", the","the activities","activities of","of the","the teens","teens were","were not","The program","program was","was eventually","eventually cancelled","cancelled after","after a","a few","few years","years because","because the","the government","government simply","simply could","could not","not control","control the","the youth","Seoul Searching","Searching is","is a","a teen","teen comedy","comedy and","and coming","coming of","of age","age film","film ,",", based","based on","on a","a true","true story","story about","about one","one of","of the","the summer","summer camps","camps that","that took","took place","place in","in 1986"]}

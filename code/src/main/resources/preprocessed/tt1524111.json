{"title":"City of the Dawn","plot":"City of the Dawn is a documentary film exploring Auroville, an experimental city created to be a living embodiment of human unity. This laboratory for the future wants to transcend all that separates human beings, religion, politics, money, race, social position, creed, etc., and find new ways to coexist that benefit all. Here, citizens from 40 nations live their lives dedicated to this aspiration for a place where a more-conscious human family lives and shares and supports one another as part of one planet.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Citi","of","the","Dawn","is","a","documentari","film","explor","Aurovill",",","an","experiment","citi","creat","to","be","a","live","embodi","of","human","uniti",".","This","laboratori","for","the","futur","want","to","transcend","all","that","separ","human","be",",","religion",",","polit",",","money",",","race",",","social","posit",",","creed",",","etc.",",","and","find","new","way","to","coexist","that","benefit","all",".","Here",",","citizen","from","40","nation","live","their","live","dedic","to","this","aspir","for","a","place","where","a","more-consci","human","famili","live","and","share","and","support","one","anoth","as","part","of","one","planet","."],"lemmas":["city","of","the","Dawn","be","a","documentary","film","explore","Auroville",",","a","experimental","city","create","to","be","a","live","embodiment","of","human","unity",".","this","laboratory","for","the","future","want","to","transcend","all","that","separate","human","being",",","religion",",","politics",",","money",",","race",",","social","position",",","creed",",","etc.",",","and","find","new","way","to","coexist","that","benefit","all",".","here",",","citizen","from","40","nation","live","they","life","dedicate","to","this","aspiration","for","a","place","where","a","more-conscious","human","family","life","and","share","and","support","one","another","as","part","of","one","planet","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["City of the","of the Dawn","the Dawn is","Dawn is a","is a documentary","a documentary film","documentary film exploring","film exploring Auroville","exploring Auroville ,","Auroville , an",", an experimental","an experimental city","experimental city created","city created to","created to be","to be a","be a living","a living embodiment","living embodiment of","embodiment of human","of human unity","This laboratory for","laboratory for the","for the future","the future wants","future wants to","wants to transcend","to transcend all","transcend all that","all that separates","that separates human","separates human beings","human beings ,","beings , religion",", religion ,","religion , politics",", politics ,","politics , money",", money ,","money , race",", race ,","race , social",", social position","social position ,","position , creed",", creed ,","creed , etc.",", etc. ,","etc. , and",", and find","and find new","find new ways","new ways to","ways to coexist","to coexist that","coexist that benefit","that benefit all","Here , citizens",", citizens from","citizens from 40","from 40 nations","40 nations live","nations live their","live their lives","their lives dedicated","lives dedicated to","dedicated to this","to this aspiration","this aspiration for","aspiration for a","for a place","a place where","place where a","where a more-conscious","a more-conscious human","more-conscious human family","human family lives","family lives and","lives and shares","and shares and","shares and supports","and supports one","supports one another","one another as","another as part","as part of","part of one","of one planet"],"2grams":["City of","of the","the Dawn","Dawn is","is a","a documentary","documentary film","film exploring","exploring Auroville","Auroville ,",", an","an experimental","experimental city","city created","created to","to be","be a","a living","living embodiment","embodiment of","of human","human unity","This laboratory","laboratory for","for the","the future","future wants","wants to","to transcend","transcend all","all that","that separates","separates human","human beings","beings ,",", religion","religion ,",", politics","politics ,",", money","money ,",", race","race ,",", social","social position","position ,",", creed","creed ,",", etc.","etc. ,",", and","and find","find new","new ways","ways to","to coexist","coexist that","that benefit","benefit all","Here ,",", citizens","citizens from","from 40","40 nations","nations live","live their","their lives","lives dedicated","dedicated to","to this","this aspiration","aspiration for","for a","a place","place where","where a","a more-conscious","more-conscious human","human family","family lives","lives and","and shares","shares and","and supports","supports one","one another","another as","as part","part of","of one","one planet"]}

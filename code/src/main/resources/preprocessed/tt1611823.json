{"title":"Gallants","plot":"Weedy office worker Cheung is sent to a remote village to secure property rights for his real estate company. Two martial artists run the village's teahouse, which was once the kung-fu school of their teacher Master Law. Law is in fact lying unconscious upstairs in a three decades-long coma, but he awakes when gym boss and local landlord Pong attempts to secure the teahouse for redevelopment. Law mistakes Cheung for a former student and starts training him in preparation for a martial-arts tournament at Pong's gym that will decide all their fates.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Weedi","offic","worker","Cheung","is","sent","to","a","remot","villag","to","secur","properti","right","for","his","real","estat","compani",".","Two","martial","artist","run","the","villag","'s","teahous",",","which","was","onc","the","kung-fu","school","of","their","teacher","Master","Law",".","Law","is","in","fact","lie","unconsci","upstair","in","a","three","decades-long","coma",",","but","he","awak","when","gym","boss","and","local","landlord","Pong","attempt","to","secur","the","teahous","for","redevelop",".","Law","mistak","Cheung","for","a","former","student","and","start","train","him","in","prepar","for","a","martial-art","tournament","at","Pong","'s","gym","that","will","decid","all","their","fate","."],"lemmas":["weedy","office","worker","Cheung","be","send","to","a","remote","village","to","secure","property","rights","for","he","real","estate","company",".","two","martial","artist","run","the","village","'s","teahouse",",","which","be","once","the","kung-fu","school","of","they","teacher","Master","Law",".","law","be","in","fact","lie","unconscious","upstairs","in","a","three","decades-long","coma",",","but","he","awake","when","gym","boss","and","local","landlord","Pong","attempt","to","secure","the","teahouse","for","redevelopment",".","law","mistake","Cheung","for","a","former","student","and","start","train","he","in","preparation","for","a","martial-arts","tournament","at","Pong","'s","gym","that","will","decide","all","they","fate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Weedy office worker","office worker Cheung","worker Cheung is","Cheung is sent","is sent to","sent to a","to a remote","a remote village","remote village to","village to secure","to secure property","secure property rights","property rights for","rights for his","for his real","his real estate","real estate company","Two martial artists","martial artists run","artists run the","run the village","the village 's","village 's teahouse","'s teahouse ,","teahouse , which",", which was","which was once","was once the","once the kung-fu","the kung-fu school","kung-fu school of","school of their","of their teacher","their teacher Master","teacher Master Law","Law is in","is in fact","in fact lying","fact lying unconscious","lying unconscious upstairs","unconscious upstairs in","upstairs in a","in a three","a three decades-long","three decades-long coma","decades-long coma ,","coma , but",", but he","but he awakes","he awakes when","awakes when gym","when gym boss","gym boss and","boss and local","and local landlord","local landlord Pong","landlord Pong attempts","Pong attempts to","attempts to secure","to secure the","secure the teahouse","the teahouse for","teahouse for redevelopment","Law mistakes Cheung","mistakes Cheung for","Cheung for a","for a former","a former student","former student and","student and starts","and starts training","starts training him","training him in","him in preparation","in preparation for","preparation for a","for a martial-arts","a martial-arts tournament","martial-arts tournament at","tournament at Pong","at Pong 's","Pong 's gym","'s gym that","gym that will","that will decide","will decide all","decide all their","all their fates"],"2grams":["Weedy office","office worker","worker Cheung","Cheung is","is sent","sent to","to a","a remote","remote village","village to","to secure","secure property","property rights","rights for","for his","his real","real estate","estate company","Two martial","martial artists","artists run","run the","the village","village 's","'s teahouse","teahouse ,",", which","which was","was once","once the","the kung-fu","kung-fu school","school of","of their","their teacher","teacher Master","Master Law","Law is","is in","in fact","fact lying","lying unconscious","unconscious upstairs","upstairs in","in a","a three","three decades-long","decades-long coma","coma ,",", but","but he","he awakes","awakes when","when gym","gym boss","boss and","and local","local landlord","landlord Pong","Pong attempts","attempts to","to secure","secure the","the teahouse","teahouse for","for redevelopment","Law mistakes","mistakes Cheung","Cheung for","for a","a former","former student","student and","and starts","starts training","training him","him in","in preparation","preparation for","for a","a martial-arts","martial-arts tournament","tournament at","at Pong","Pong 's","'s gym","gym that","that will","will decide","decide all","all their","their fates"]}

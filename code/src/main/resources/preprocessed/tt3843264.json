{"title":"Broken Record","plot":"Broken Record is a poetic journey through Iraq in search of an Iraqi/Turkman song, which the filmmaker Parine Jaddo's mother used to sing, and recorded with her brothers in 1960. Though she knows the melody, she no longer remembers the lyrics and her curiosity takes her around the country in search of it, giving rare insight to Iraq's rich musical culture and heritage, much of which has been burnt and lost.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Broken","Record","is","a","poetic","journey","through","Iraq","in","search","of","an","Iraqi/Turkman","song",",","which","the","filmmak","Parin","Jaddo","'s","mother","use","to","sing",",","and","record","with","her","brother","in","1960",".","Though","she","know","the","melodi",",","she","no","longer","rememb","the","lyric","and","her","curios","take","her","around","the","countri","in","search","of","it",",","give","rare","insight","to","Iraq","'s","rich","music","cultur","and","heritag",",","much","of","which","has","been","burnt","and","lost","."],"lemmas":["Broken","Record","be","a","poetic","journey","through","Iraq","in","search","of","a","iraqi/turkman","song",",","which","the","filmmaker","Parine","Jaddo","'s","mother","use","to","sing",",","and","record","with","she","brother","in","1960",".","though","she","know","the","melody",",","she","no","longer","remember","the","lyric","and","she","curiosity","take","she","around","the","country","in","search","of","it",",","give","rare","insight","to","Iraq","'s","rich","musical","culture","and","heritage",",","much","of","which","have","be","burn","and","lose","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Broken Record is","Record is a","is a poetic","a poetic journey","poetic journey through","journey through Iraq","through Iraq in","Iraq in search","in search of","search of an","of an Iraqi/Turkman","an Iraqi/Turkman song","Iraqi/Turkman song ,","song , which",", which the","which the filmmaker","the filmmaker Parine","filmmaker Parine Jaddo","Parine Jaddo 's","Jaddo 's mother","'s mother used","mother used to","used to sing","to sing ,","sing , and",", and recorded","and recorded with","recorded with her","with her brothers","her brothers in","brothers in 1960","Though she knows","she knows the","knows the melody","the melody ,","melody , she",", she no","she no longer","no longer remembers","longer remembers the","remembers the lyrics","the lyrics and","lyrics and her","and her curiosity","her curiosity takes","curiosity takes her","takes her around","her around the","around the country","the country in","country in search","in search of","search of it","of it ,","it , giving",", giving rare","giving rare insight","rare insight to","insight to Iraq","to Iraq 's","Iraq 's rich","'s rich musical","rich musical culture","musical culture and","culture and heritage","and heritage ,","heritage , much",", much of","much of which","of which has","which has been","has been burnt","been burnt and","burnt and lost"],"2grams":["Broken Record","Record is","is a","a poetic","poetic journey","journey through","through Iraq","Iraq in","in search","search of","of an","an Iraqi/Turkman","Iraqi/Turkman song","song ,",", which","which the","the filmmaker","filmmaker Parine","Parine Jaddo","Jaddo 's","'s mother","mother used","used to","to sing","sing ,",", and","and recorded","recorded with","with her","her brothers","brothers in","in 1960","Though she","she knows","knows the","the melody","melody ,",", she","she no","no longer","longer remembers","remembers the","the lyrics","lyrics and","and her","her curiosity","curiosity takes","takes her","her around","around the","the country","country in","in search","search of","of it","it ,",", giving","giving rare","rare insight","insight to","to Iraq","Iraq 's","'s rich","rich musical","musical culture","culture and","and heritage","heritage ,",", much","much of","of which","which has","has been","been burnt","burnt and","and lost"]}

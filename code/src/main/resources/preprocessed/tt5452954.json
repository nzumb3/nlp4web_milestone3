{"title":"In Course of the Miraculous","plot":"The script is composed of three stories set in three different time periods and three different locations. One story takes place during an ascent of the Himalayas, another on a crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, while the third happens on an ocean-going fishing trip. The motivation/objective in every story is a quest, and hiding underneath under every motivation is the deepest level of human nature.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["The","script","is","compos","of","three","stori","set","in","three","differ","time","period","and","three","differ","locat",".","One","stori","take","place","dure","an","ascent","of","the","Himalaya",",","anoth","on","a","cross","of","the","Atlantic","Ocean",",","while","the","third","happen","on","an","ocean-go","fish","trip",".","The","motivation/object","in","everi","stori","is","a","quest",",","and","hide","underneath","under","everi","motiv","is","the","deepest","level","of","human","natur","."],"lemmas":["the","script","be","compose","of","three","story","set","in","three","different","time","period","and","three","different","location",".","one","story","take","place","during","a","ascent","of","the","Himalayas",",","another","on","a","cross","of","the","Atlantic","Ocean",",","while","the","third","happen","on","a","ocean-going","fishing","trip",".","the","motivation/objective","in","every","story","be","a","quest",",","and","hiding","underneath","under","every","motivation","be","the","deepest","level","of","human","nature","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The script is","script is composed","is composed of","composed of three","of three stories","three stories set","stories set in","set in three","in three different","three different time","different time periods","time periods and","periods and three","and three different","three different locations","One story takes","story takes place","takes place during","place during an","during an ascent","an ascent of","ascent of the","of the Himalayas","the Himalayas ,","Himalayas , another",", another on","another on a","on a crossing","a crossing of","crossing of the","of the Atlantic","the Atlantic Ocean","Atlantic Ocean ,","Ocean , while",", while the","while the third","the third happens","third happens on","happens on an","on an ocean-going","an ocean-going fishing","ocean-going fishing trip","The motivation/objective in","motivation/objective in every","in every story","every story is","story is a","is a quest","a quest ,","quest , and",", and hiding","and hiding underneath","hiding underneath under","underneath under every","under every motivation","every motivation is","motivation is the","is the deepest","the deepest level","deepest level of","level of human","of human nature"],"2grams":["The script","script is","is composed","composed of","of three","three stories","stories set","set in","in three","three different","different time","time periods","periods and","and three","three different","different locations","One story","story takes","takes place","place during","during an","an ascent","ascent of","of the","the Himalayas","Himalayas ,",", another","another on","on a","a crossing","crossing of","of the","the Atlantic","Atlantic Ocean","Ocean ,",", while","while the","the third","third happens","happens on","on an","an ocean-going","ocean-going fishing","fishing trip","The motivation/objective","motivation/objective in","in every","every story","story is","is a","a quest","quest ,",", and","and hiding","hiding underneath","underneath under","under every","every motivation","motivation is","is the","the deepest","deepest level","level of","of human","human nature"]}

{"title":"Villmark 2","plot":"An old sanatorium is deteriorating in an isolated forest in the mountains. The elderly janitor is still living there to ensure that no one access the dangerous building. Five contract workers have taken on the task of tracking the huge building for hazardous waste before it's demolished. Over 300 rooms and kilometres of pipelines have to be screened in three days. They realize that the job is more than a search for asbestos and mercury when they encounter the building's frightening past. Water is gushing from the old pipes, and brings the work to a halt. An attempt to close the water intake leads them to the dark cellar, where they discover the horrible secrets from the sanatoriums past. You can demolish a building, but never remove the past.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["An","old","sanatorium","is","deterior","in","an","isol","forest","in","the","mountain",".","The","elder","janitor","is","still","live","there","to","ensur","that","no","one","access","the","danger","build",".","Five","contract","worker","have","taken","on","the","task","of","track","the","huge","build","for","hazard","wast","befor","it","'s","demolish",".","Over","300","room","and","kilometr","of","pipelin","have","to","be","screen","in","three","day",".","They","realiz","that","the","job","is","more","than","a","search","for","asbesto","and","mercuri","when","they","encount","the","build","'s","frighten","past",".","Water","is","gush","from","the","old","pipe",",","and","bring","the","work","to","a","halt",".","An","attempt","to","close","the","water","intak","lead","them","to","the","dark","cellar",",","where","they","discov","the","horribl","secret","from","the","sanatorium","past",".","You","can","demolish","a","build",",","but","never","remov","the","past","."],"lemmas":["a","old","sanatorium","be","deteriorate","in","a","isolate","forest","in","the","mountain",".","the","elderly","janitor","be","still","live","there","to","ensure","that","no","one","access","the","dangerous","building",".","five","contract","worker","have","take","on","the","task","of","track","the","huge","building","for","hazardous","waste","before","it","be","demolish",".","over","300","room","and","kilometre","of","pipeline","have","to","be","screen","in","three","day",".","they","realize","that","the","job","be","more","than","a","search","for","asbestos","and","mercury","when","they","encounter","the","building","'s","frightening","past",".","Water","be","gush","from","the","old","pipe",",","and","bring","the","work","to","a","halt",".","a","attempt","to","close","the","water","intake","lead","they","to","the","dark","cellar",",","where","they","discover","the","horrible","secret","from","the","sanatorium","past",".","you","can","demolish","a","building",",","but","never","remove","the","past","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["An

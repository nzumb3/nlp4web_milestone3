When they have a chance to talk, the young American's name is Brad (Kevin Miranda). That chance meeting leads to their relationship but Brad seems an enigma, seeming aloof even to Claude's BFF Catherine (Florence D' Azemar). Things get worse on the day of Claude's birthday, when a group of friends surprise him at his home; one recognizes Brad.

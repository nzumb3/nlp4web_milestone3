{"title":"Ocean of an Old Man","plot":"Thomas is a teacher in a 1974-established Government-run Primary School in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, and lives with his wife, and a daughter. He has a number of students, including some who are disabled, who regularly attend his classes by boat from a number of nearby islands. Everything changes after the devastating December 2004 Tsunami strikes the islands - killing his entire family, as well as several students. Struggling with their loss, continuing to attend a now empty school, he keeps on searching for his students with hopes of finding someone still alive.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Thoma","is","a","teacher","in","a","1974-establish","Government-run","Primari","School","in","the","Andaman","&","Nicobar","Island",",","and","live","with","his","wife",",","and","a","daughter",".","He","has","a","number","of","student",",","includ","some","who","are","disabl",",","who","regular","attend","his","class","by","boat","from","a","number","of","nearbi","island",".","Everyth","chang","after","the","devast","Decemb","2004","Tsunami","strike","the","island","-","kill","his","entir","famili",",","as","well","as","sever","student",".","Struggl","with","their","loss",",","continu","to","attend","a","now","empti","school",",","he","keep","on","search","for","his","student","with","hope","of","find","someon","still","aliv","."],"lemmas":["Thomas","be","a","teacher","in","a","1974-established","government-run","primary","school","in","the","Andaman","&","Nicobar","Islands",",","and","live","with","he","wife",",","and","a","daughter",".","he","have","a","number","of","student",",","include","some","who","be","disabled",",","who","regularly","attend","he","class","by","boat","from","a","number","of","nearby","island",".","everything","change","after","the","devastating","December","2004","Tsunami","strike","the","island","-","kill","he","entire","family",",","as","well","as","several","student",".","struggle","with","they","loss",",","continue","to","attend","a","now","empty","school",",","he","keep","on","search","for","he","student","with","hope","of","find","someone","still","alive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Thomas is a","is a teacher","a teacher in","teacher in a","in a 1974-established","a 1974-established Government-run","1974-established Government-run Primary","Government-run Primary School","Primary School in","School in the","in the Andaman","the Andaman &","Andaman & Nicobar","& Nicobar Islands","Nicobar Islands ,","Islands , and",", and lives","and lives with","lives with his","with his wife","his wife ,","wife , and",", and a","and a daughter","He has a","has a number","a number of","number of students","of students ,","students , including",", including some","including some who","some who are","who are disabled","are disabled ,","disabled , who",", who regularly","who regularly attend","regularly attend his","attend his classes","his classes by","classes by boat","by boat from","boat from a","from a number","a number of","number of nearby","of nearby islands","Everything changes after","changes after the","after the devastating","the devastating December","devastating December 2004","December 2004 Tsunami","2004 Tsunami strikes","Tsunami strikes the","strikes the islands","the islands -","islands - killing","- killing his","killing his entire","his entire family","entire family ,","family , as",", as well","as well as","well as several","as several students","Struggling with their","with their loss","their loss ,","loss , continuing",", continuing to","continuing to attend","to attend a","attend a now","a now empty","now empty school","empty school ,","school , he",", he keeps","he keeps on","keeps on searching","on searching for","searching for his","for his students","his students with","students with hopes","with hopes of","hopes of finding","of finding someone","finding someone still","someone still alive"],"2grams":["Thomas is","is a","a teacher","teacher in","in a","a 1974-established","1974-established Government-run","Government-run Primary","Primary School","School in","in the","the Andaman","Andaman &","& Nicobar","Nicobar Islands","Islands ,",", and","and lives","lives with","with his","his wife","wife ,",", and","and a","a daughter","He has","has a","a number","number of","of students","students ,",", including","including some","some who","who are","are disabled","disabled ,",", who","who regularly","regularly attend","attend his","his classes","classes by","by boat","boat from","from a","a number","number of","of nearby","nearby islands","Everything changes","changes after","after the","the devastating","devastating December","December 2004","2004 Tsunami","Tsunami strikes","strikes the","the islands","islands -","- killing","killing his","his entire","entire family","family ,",", as","as well","well as","as several","several students","Struggling with","with their","their loss","loss ,",", continuing","continuing to","to attend","attend a","a now","now empty","empty school","school ,",", he","he keeps","keeps on","on searching","searching for","for his","his students","students with","with hopes","hopes of","of finding","finding someone","someone still","still alive"]}

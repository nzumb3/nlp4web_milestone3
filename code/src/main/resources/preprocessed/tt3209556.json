{"title":"Vidiyum Munn","plot":"It's about Four Formidable Men, who, for Three Different Reasons are chasing after Two Women in One Day. Who are these men? How are they connected to each other? What are their reasons to track down the two women? How are these women connected to the men? Will they get caught? If they do, who among the four men will wind up catching them? And, what will happen to them? These are the many questions that will get answered during its course. The plot unfolds as a taut thriller that examines the characters'vulnerability and strengths. The subplot, however, explores a relationship between a woman and a girl; Rekha, the protagonist, is a sex worker who tries to rescue Nandhini, a twelve-year-old girl, from the clutches of prostitution. The journey takes us through the brutality and the hypocrisy that surrounds us, which we deliberately choose to ignore -- broken homes, abuse, unfulfilled dreams, manipulation, blackmail, threat, hopelessness and paranoia. It's a dog-eat-dog world where nothing is as simple as it appears.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["It","'s","about","Four","Formid","Men",",","who",",","for","Three","Differ","Reason","are","chase","after","Two","Women","in","One","Day",".","Who","are","these","men","?","How","are","they","connect","to","each","other","?","What","are","their","reason","to","track","down","the","two","women","?","How","are","these","women","connect","to","the","men","?","Will","they","get","caught","?","If","they","do",",","who","among","the","four","men","will","wind","up","catch","them","?","And",",","what","will","happen","to","them","?","These","are","the","mani","question","that","will","get","answer","dure","it","cours",".","The","plot","unfold","as","a","taut","thriller","that","examin","the","charact","'","vulner","and","strength",".","The","subplot",",","howev",",","explor","a","relationship","between","a","woman","and","a","girl",";","Rekha",",","the","protagonist",",","is","a","sex","worker","who","tri","to","rescu","Nandhini",",","a","twelve-year-old","girl",",","from","the","clutch","of","prostitut",".","The","journey","take","us","through","the","brutal","and","the","hypocrisi","that","surround","us",",","which","we","deliber","choos","to","ignor","--","broken","home",",","abus",",","unfulfil","dream",",","manipul",",","blackmail",",","threat",",","hopeless","and","paranoia",".","It","'s","a","dog-eat-dog","world","where","noth","is","as","simpl","as","it","appear","."],"lemmas":["it","be","about","Four","Formidable","Men",",","who",",","for","Three","Different","reason","be","chase","after","two","woman","in","one","day",".","who","be","these","man","?","how","be","they","connect","to","each","other","?","what","be","they","reason","to","track","down","the","two","woman","?","how","be","these","woman","connect","to","the","man","?","will","they","get","catch","?","if","they","do",",","who","among","the","four","man","will","wind","up","catch","they","?","and",",","what","will","happen","to","they","?","these","be","the","many","question","that","will","get","answer","during","its","course",".","the","plot","unfold","as","a","taut","thriller","that","examine","the","character","'","vulnerability","and","strength",".","the","subplot",",","however",",","explore","a","relationship","between","a","woman","and","a","girl",";","Rekha",",","the","protagonist",",","be","a","sex","worker","who","try","to","rescue","Nandhini",",","a","twelve-year-old","girl",",","from","the","clutch","of","prostitution",".","the","journey","take","we","through","the","brutality","and","the","hypocrisy","that","surround","we",",","which","we","deliberately","choose","to","ignore","--","broken","home",",","abuse",",","unfulfilled","dream",",","manipulation",",","blackmail",",","threat",",","hopelessness","and","paranoia",".","it","be","a","dog-eat-dog","world","where","nothing","be","as","simple","as","it","appear","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["It 's about","'s about Four","about Four Formidable","Four Formidable Men","Formidable Men ,","Men , who",", who ,","who , for",", for Three","for Three Different","Three Different Reasons","Different Reasons are","Reasons are chasing","are chasing after","chasing after Two","after Two Women","Two Women in","Women in One","in One Day","Who are these","are these men","How are they","are they connected","they connected to","connected to each","to each other","What are their","are their reasons","their reasons to","reasons to track","to track down","track down the","down the two","the two women","How are these","are these women","these women connected","women connected to","connected to the","to the men","Will they get","they get caught","If they do","they do ,","do , who",", who among","who among the","among the four","the four men","four men will","men will wind","will wind up","wind up catching","up catching them","And , what",", what will","what will happen","will happen to","happen to them","These are the","are the many","the many questions","many questions that","questions that will","that will get","will get answered","get answered during","answered during its","during its course","The plot unfolds","plot unfolds as","unfolds as a","as a taut","a taut thriller","taut thriller that","thriller that examines","that examines the","examines the characters","the characters '","characters ' vulnerability","' vulnerability and","vulnerability and strengths","The subplot ,","subplot , however",", however ,","however , explores",", explores a","explores a relationship","a relationship between","relationship between a","between a woman","a woman and","woman and a","and a girl","a girl ;","girl ;

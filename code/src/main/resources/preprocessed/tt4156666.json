{"title":"Naija Beta","plot":"A team of Nigerian MIT undergraduates head home one summer to run the first ever robotics camp for high-schoolers in their country. Hoping to instill a love of creative problem solving in their new converts to robotics engineering, the MIT undergrads discover that they themselves have many lessons to learn about their country and about themselves, as they attempt to pull off an autonomous robotics competition in the final days of the program. Ultimately, the robotics camp becomes a portrait of an entrepreneurial generation of young Nigerians and the society they are attempting to change.","genres":["Documentary"," Family","

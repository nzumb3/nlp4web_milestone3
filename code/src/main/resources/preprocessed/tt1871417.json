{"title":"Things I Don't Understand","plot":"The story follows Violet Kubelick, a brilliant young grad student studying near-death experiences and her recent withdrawn, closed-off behavior after a mysterious, failed suicide attempt. She and her two artist-roommates are forced by financial matters to finally confront their fears and step out of the protective bubble they've created for themselves in their Brooklyn loft while Violet herself forms a cathartic relationship with a young, terminally ill girl in a hospice she is interviewing for her thesis. A story of changing, relationships, love, life and what comes after we die","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","stori","follow","Violet","Kubelick",",","a","brilliant","young","grad","student","studi","near-death","experi","and","her","recent","withdrawn",",","closed-off","behavior","after","a","mysteri",",","fail","suicid","attempt",".","She","and","her","two","artist-roomm","are","forc","by","financi","matter","to","final","confront","their","fear","and","step","out","of","the","protect","bubbl","they","ve","creat","for","themselv","in","their","Brooklyn","loft","while","Violet","herself","form","a","cathart","relationship","with","a","young",",","termin","ill","girl","in","a","hospic","she","is","interview","for","her","thesi",".","A","stori","of","chang",",","relationship",",","love",",","life","and","what","come","after","we","die"],"lemmas":["the","story","follow","Violet","Kubelick",",","a","brilliant","young","grad","student","study","near-death","experience","and","she","recent","withdraw",",","closed-off","behavior","after","a","mysterious",",","failed","suicide","attempt",".","she","and","she","two","artist-roommate","be","force","by","financial","matter","to","finally","confront","they","fear","and","step","out","of","the","protective","bubble","they","have","create","for","themselves","in","they","Brooklyn","loft","while","Violet","herself","form","a","cathartic","relationship","with","a","young",",","terminally","ill","girl","in","a","hospice","she","be","interview","for","she","thesis",".","a","story","of","change",",","relationship",",","love",",","life","and","what","come","after","we","die"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The story follows","story follows Violet","follows Violet Kubelick","Violet Kubelick ,","Kubelick , a",", a brilliant","a brilliant young","brilliant young grad","young grad student","grad student studying","student studying near-death","studying near-death experiences","near-death experiences and","experiences and her","and her recent","her recent withdrawn","recent withdrawn ,","withdrawn , closed-off",", closed-off behavior","closed-off behavior after","behavior after a","after a mysterious","a mysterious ,","mysterious , failed",", failed suicide","failed suicide attempt","She and her","and her two","her two artist-roommates","two artist-roommates are","artist-roommates are forced","are forced by","forced by financial","by financial matters","financial matters to","matters to finally","to finally confront","finally confront their","confront their fears","their fears and","fears and step","and step out","step out of","out of the","of the protective","the protective bubble","protective bubble they","bubble they 've","they 've created","'ve created for","created for themselves","for themselves in","themselves in their","in their Brooklyn","their Brooklyn loft","Brooklyn loft while","loft while Violet","while Violet herself","Violet herself forms","herself forms a","forms a cathartic","a cathartic relationship","cathartic relationship with","relationship with a","with a young","a young ,","young , terminally",", terminally ill","terminally ill girl","ill girl in","girl in a","in a hospice","a hospice she","hospice she is","she is interviewing","is interviewing for","interviewing for her","for her thesis","A story of","story of changing","of changing ,","changing , relationships",", relationships ,","relationships , love",", love ,","love , life",", life and","life and what","and what comes","what comes after","comes after we","after we die"],"2grams":["The story","story follows","follows Violet","Violet Kubelick","Kubelick ,",", a","a brilliant","brilliant young","young grad","grad student","student studying","studying near-death","near-death experiences","experiences and","and her","her recent","recent withdrawn","withdrawn ,",", closed-off","closed-off behavior","behavior after","after a","a mysterious","mysterious ,",", failed","failed suicide","suicide attempt","She and","and her","her two","two artist-roommates","artist-roommates are","are forced","forced by","by financial","financial matters","matters to","to finally","finally confront","confront their","their fears","fears and","and step","step out","out of","of the","the protective","protective bubble","bubble they","they 've","'ve created","created for","for themselves","themselves in","in their","their Brooklyn","Brooklyn loft","loft while","while Violet","Violet herself","herself forms","forms a","a cathartic","cathartic relationship","relationship with","with a","a young","young ,",", terminally","terminally ill","ill girl","girl in","in a","a hospice","hospice she","she is","is interviewing","interviewing for","for her","her thesis","A story","story of","of changing","changing ,",", relationships","relationships ,",", love","love ,",", life","life and","and what","what comes","comes after","after we","we die"]}

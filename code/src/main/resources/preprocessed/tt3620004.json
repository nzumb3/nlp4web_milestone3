The love affairs of a father bringing up two daughters become a peculiar experimental verification of film theories as the screenplay was written by the author together with C.G. Jung, Epstein, Kracauer, Balázs, Vertov, Bazin, Metz and Deleuze.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","stori","of","partner","relationship","serv","as","a","start","point","for","survey","of","conscienc","and","it","relat","to","realiti",",","but","is","shot","as","a","suicid","attack","upon","the","faith","in","truth","of","a","documentari","(","lie","is","a","dogma","deform","realiti",")",".","The","love","affair","of","a","father","bring","up","two","daughter","becom","a","peculiar","experiment","verif","of","film","theori","as","the","screenplay","was","written","by","the","author","togeth","with","C.G.","Jung",",","Epstein",",","Kracauer",",","Baláz",",","Vertov",",","Bazin",",","Metz","and","Deleuz","."],"lemmas":["a","story","of","partner","relationship","serve","as","a","start","point","for","survey","of","conscience","and","its","relation","to","reality",",","but","be","shoot","as","a","suicidal","attack","upon","the","faith","in","truthfulness","of","a","documentary","-lrb-","lie","be","a","dogma","deform","reality","-rrb-",".","the","love","affair","of","a","father","bring","up","two","daughter","become","a","peculiar","experimental","verification","of","film","theory","as","the","screenplay","be","write","by","the","author","together","with","C.G.","Jung",",","epstein",",","Kracauer",",","Balázs",",","Vertov",",","Bazin",",","Metz","and","Deleuze","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A story of","story of partner","of partner relationships","partner relationships serves","relationships serves as","serves as a","as a starting","a starting point","starting point for","point for survey","for survey of","survey of conscience","of conscience and","conscience and its","and its relation","its relation to","relation to reality","to reality ,","reality , but",", but is","but is shot","is shot as","shot as a","as a suicidal","a suicidal attack","suicidal attack upon","attack upon the","upon the faith","the faith in","faith in truthfulness","in truthfulness of","truthfulness of a","of a documentary","a documentary (","documentary ( lie","( lie is","lie is a","is a dogma","a dogma deforming","dogma deforming reality","deforming reality )","The love affairs","love affairs of","affairs of a","of a father","a father bringing","father bringing up","bringing up two","up two daughters","two daughters become","daughters become a","become a peculiar","a peculiar experimental","peculiar experimental verification","experimental verification of","verification of film","of film theories","film theories as","theories as the","as the screenplay","the screenplay was","screenplay was written","was written by","written by the","by the author","the author together","author together with","together with C.G.","with C.G.

{"title":"In the Dead of Night","plot":"A group of amateur filmmakers, fresh off completion of their first feature film, decide to shoot a documentary about the homeless in Dallas, Texas. After a few drinks at a bar they roam the early morning streets of downtown, hoping to find homeless Katrina refugees, families who lost their homes due to the mortgage crisis, and Gulf War veterans. Unknown to them, someone else, someone evil, also roams the streets, documenting his own version of what should be done with the homeless.","genres":["Crime"," Horror"," Drama"],"stems":["A","group","of","amateur","filmmak",",","fresh","off","complet","of","their","first","featur","film",",","decid","to","shoot","a","documentari","about","the","homeless","in","Dalla",",","Texa",".","After","a","few","drink","at","a","bar","they","roam","the","earli","morn","street","of","downtown",",","hope","to","find","homeless","Katrina","refuge",",","famili","who","lost","their","home","due","to","the","mortgag","crisi",",","and","Gulf","War","veteran",".","Unknown","to","them",",","someon","els",",","someon","evil",",","also","roam","the","street",",","document","his","own","version","of","what","should","be","done","with","the","homeless","."],"lemmas":["a","group","of","amateur","filmmaker",",","fresh","off","completion","of","they","first","feature","film",",","decide","to","shoot","a","documentary","about","the","homeless","in","Dallas",",","Texas",".","after","a","few","drink","at","a","bar","they","roam","the","early","morning","street","of","downtown",",","hope","to","find","homeless","Katrina","refugee",",","family","who","lose","they","home","due","to","the","mortgage","crisis",",","and","Gulf","War","veteran",".","unknown","to","they",",","someone","else",",","someone","evil",",","also","roam","the","street",",","document","he","own","version","of","what","should","be","do","with","the","homeless","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A group of","group of amateur","of amateur filmmakers","amateur filmmakers ,","filmmakers , fresh",", fresh off","fresh off completion","off completion of","completion of their","of their first","their first feature","first feature film","feature film ,","film , decide",", decide to","decide to shoot","to shoot a","shoot a documentary","a documentary about","documentary about the","about the homeless","the homeless in","homeless in Dallas","in Dallas ,","Dallas , Texas","After a few","a few drinks","few drinks at","drinks at a","at a bar","a bar they","bar they roam","they roam the","roam the early","the early morning","early morning streets","morning streets of","streets of downtown","of downtown ,","downtown , hoping",", hoping to","hoping to find","to find homeless","find homeless Katrina","homeless Katrina refugees","Katrina refugees ,","refugees , families",", families who","families who lost","who lost their","lost their homes","their homes due","homes due to","due to the","to the mortgage","the mortgage crisis","mortgage crisis ,","crisis , and",", and Gulf","and Gulf War","Gulf War veterans","Unknown to them","to them ,","them , someone",", someone else","someone else ,","else , someone",", someone evil","someone evil ,","evil , also",", also roams","also roams the","roams the streets","the streets ,","streets , documenting",", documenting his","documenting his own","his own version","own version of","version of what","of what should","what should be","should be done","be done with","done with the","with the homeless"],"2grams":["A group","group of","of amateur","amateur filmmakers","filmmakers ,",", fresh","fresh off","off completion","completion of","of their","their first","first feature","feature film","film ,",", decide","decide to","to shoot","shoot a","a documentary","documentary about","about the","the homeless","homeless in","in Dallas","Dallas ,",", Texas","After a","a few","few drinks","drinks at","at a","a bar","bar they","they roam","roam the","the early","early morning","morning streets","streets of","of downtown","downtown ,",", hoping","hoping to","to find","find homeless","homeless Katrina","Katrina refugees","refugees ,",", families","families who","who lost","lost their","their homes","homes due","due to","to the","the mortgage","mortgage crisis","crisis ,",", and","and Gulf","Gulf War","War veterans","Unknown to","to them","them ,",", someone","someone else","else ,",", someone","someone evil","evil ,",", also","also roams","roams the","the streets","streets ,",", documenting","documenting his","his own","own version","version of","of what","what should","should be","be done","done with","with the","the homeless"]}

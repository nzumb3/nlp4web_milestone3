{"title":"The Outsider","plot":"The Human Space war against the Outsiders was set to destroy both races and this region of the galaxy along with them... and us. Higher order beings intervene against this. The Gardeners will erase one race to restore the balance, but which one? A solution is found. A champion is elected from each fleet and a contest to death set between them. There is no time limit, food or water. Their champion is a fully armed cyborg. Our champion is a weaponless, pregnant woman.","genres":["Sci-Fi"],"stems":["The","Human","Space","war","against","the","Outsid","was","set","to","destroy","both","race","and","this","region","of","the","galaxi","along","with","them","...","and","us",".","Higher","order","be","interven","against","this",".","The","Garden","will","eras","one","race","to","restor","the","balanc",",","but","which","one","?","A","solut","is","found",".","A","champion","is","elect","from","each","fleet","and","a","contest","to","death","set","between","them",".","There","is","no","time","limit",",","food","or","water",".","Their","champion","is","a","fulli","arm","cyborg",".","Our","champion","is","a","weaponless",",","pregnant","woman","."],"lemmas":["the","Human","Space","war","against","the","Outsiders","be","set","to","destroy","both","race","and","this","region","of","the","galaxy","along","with","they","...","and","we",".","higher","order","being","intervene","against","this",".","the","Gardeners","will","erase","one","race","to","restore","the","balance",",","but","which","one","?","a","solution","be","find",".","a","champion","be","elect","from","each","fleet","and","a","contest","to","death","set","between","they",".","there","be","no","time","limit",",","food","or","water",".","they","champion","be","a","fully","armed","cyborg",".","we","champion","be","a","weaponless",",","pregnant","woman","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The Human Space","Human Space war","Space war against","war against the","against the Outsiders","the Outsiders was","Outsiders was set","was set to","set to destroy","to destroy both","destroy both races","both races and","races and this","and this region","this region of","region of the","of the galaxy","the galaxy along","galaxy along with","along with them","with them ...","them ... and","... and us","Higher order beings","order beings intervene","beings intervene against","intervene against this","The Gardeners will","Gardeners will erase","will erase one","erase one race","one race to","race to restore","to restore the","restore the balance","the balance ,","balance , but",", but which","but which one","A solution is","solution is found","A champion is","champion is elected","is elected from","elected from each","from each fleet","each fleet and","fleet and a","and a contest","a contest to","contest to death","to death set","death set between","set between them","There is no","is no time","no time limit","time limit ,","limit , food",", food or","food or water","Their champion is","champion is a","is a fully","a fully armed","fully armed cyborg","Our champion is","champion is a","is a weaponless","a weaponless ,","weaponless , pregnant",", pregnant woman"],"2grams":["The Human","Human Space","Space war","war against","against the","the Outsiders","Outsiders was","was set","set to","to destroy","destroy both","both races","races and","and this","this region","region of","of the","the galaxy","galaxy along","along with","with them","them ...","... and","and us","Higher order","order beings","beings intervene","intervene against","against this","The Gardeners","Gardeners will","will erase","erase one","one race","race to","to restore","restore the","the balance","balance ,",", but","but which","which one","A solution","solution is","is found","A champion","champion is","is elected","elected from","from each","each fleet","fleet and","and a","a contest","contest to","to death","death set","set between","between them","There is","is no","no time","time limit","limit ,",", food","food or","or water","Their champion","champion is","is a","a fully","fully armed","armed cyborg","Our champion","champion is","is a","a weaponless","weaponless ,",", pregnant","pregnant woman"]}

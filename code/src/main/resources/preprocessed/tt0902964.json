{"title":"Three Fellas","plot":"Back in the day, Jung Kwon and his two buddies Sung Hyun and Kyung Ro were renowned around the riverbank behind school as the \"No Touch Gang\". Kyung's mouth was scarier than his fists and Sung Hyun lacked experience in fighting despite trying really hard, but Jung Kwon had the charisma and superb fighting skills. As the years pass, things change for them all. Work, family, and life get in the way, and even the riverbank is changing. Now it's not just fights between students anymore; organized crime is starting to make a mark in the area. Will the trio be able to go back to their glory days of youth?","genres":["Action"," Crime"],"stems":["Back","in","the","day",",","Jung","Kwon","and","his","two","buddi","Sung","Hyun","and","Kyung","Ro","were","renown","around","the","riverbank","behind","school","as","the","\"","No","Touch","Gang","\"",".","Kyung","'s","mouth","was","scarier","than","his","fist","and","Sung","Hyun","lack","experi","in","fight","despit","tri","realli","hard",",","but","Jung","Kwon","had","the","charisma","and","superb","fight","skill",".","As","the","year","pass",",","thing","chang","for","them","all",".","Work",",","famili",",","and","life","get","in","the","way",",","and","even","the","riverbank","is","chang",".","Now","it","'s","not","just","fight","between","student","anymor",";","organ","crime","is","start","to","make","a","mark","in","the","area",".","Will","the","trio","be","abl","to","go","back","to","their","glori","day","of","youth","?"],"lemmas":["back","in","the","day",",","Jung","Kwon","and","he","two","buddy","Sung","Hyun","and","Kyung","ro","be","renown","around","the","riverbank","behind","school","as","the","``","no","touch","gang","''",".","Kyung","'s","mouth","be","scarier","than","he","fist","and","Sung","Hyun","lack","experience","in","fight","despite","try","really","hard",",","but","Jung","Kwon","have","the","charisma","and","superb","fighting","skill",".","as","the","year","pass",",","thing","change","for","they","all",".","work",",","family",",","and","life","get","in","the","way",",","and","even","the","riverbank","be","change",".","now","it","be","not","just","fight","between","student","anymore",";","organize","crime","be","start","to","make","a","mark","in","the","area",".","will","the","trio","be","able","to","go","back","to","they","glory","day","of","youth","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Back in the","in the day","the day ,","day , Jung",", Jung Kwon","Jung Kwon and","Kwon and his","and his two","his two buddies","two buddies Sung","buddies Sung Hyun","Sung Hyun and","Hyun and Kyung","and Kyung Ro","Kyung Ro were","Ro were renowned","were renowned around","renowned around the","around the riverbank","the riverbank behind","riverbank behind school","behind school as","school as the","as the \"","the \" No","\" No Touch","No Touch Gang","Touch Gang \"","Kyung 's mouth","'s mouth was","mouth was scarier","was scarier than","scarier than his","than his fists","his fists and","fists and Sung","and Sung Hyun","Sung Hyun lacked","Hyun lacked experience","lacked experience in","experience in fighting","in fighting despite","fighting despite trying","despite trying really","trying really hard","really hard ,","hard , but",", but Jung","but Jung Kwon","Jung Kwon had","Kwon had the","had the charisma","the charisma and","charisma and superb","and superb fighting","superb fighting skills","As the years","the years pass","years pass ,","pass , things",", things change","things change for","change for them","for them all","Work , family",", family ,","family , and",", and life","and life get","life get in","get in the","in the way","the way ,","way , and",", and even","and even the","even the riverbank","the riverbank is","riverbank is changing","Now it 's","it 's not","'s not just","not just fights","just fights between","fights between students","between students anymore","students anymore ;","anymore ;

{"title":"In Medias Res","plot":"On the other side of Purgatory, across from the Gate of Heaven - a burning house - the place where Satan takes sinful people to Hell. A man is told he has made many sins and must report to Satan, whereupon the man begs forgiveness for his sins and tries to strike a deal with God. Satan covertly observes the man, deciding to tempt him to take his place in Hell. This exchange would allow Satan to find his own unique audience with God in the form of a written poem Satan calls \"In Medias Res.\"","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["On","the","other","side","of","Purgatori",",","across","from","the","Gate","of","Heaven","-","a","burn","hous","-","the","place","where","Satan","take","sin","peopl","to","Hell",".","A","man","is","told","he","has","made","mani","sin","and","must","report","to","Satan",",","whereupon","the","man","beg","forgiv","for","his","sin","and","tri","to","strike","a","deal","with","God",".","Satan","covert","observ","the","man",",","decid","to","tempt","him","to","take","his","place","in","Hell",".","This","exchang","would","allow","Satan","to","find","his","own","uniqu","audienc","with","God","in","the","form","of","a","written","poem","Satan","call","\"","In","Media","Res",".","\""],"lemmas":["on","the","other","side","of","Purgatory",",","across","from","the","Gate","of","Heaven","-","a","burning","house","-","the","place","where","Satan","take","sinful","people","to","Hell",".","a","man","be","tell","he","have","make","many","sin","and","must","report","to","Satan",",","whereupon","the","man","beg","forgiveness","for","he","sin","and","try","to","strike","a","deal","with","God",".","Satan","covertly","observe","the","man",",","decide","to","tempt","he","to","take","he","place","in","Hell",".","this","exchange","would","allow","Satan","to","find","he","own","unique","audience","with","God","in","the","form","of","a","write","poem","Satan","call","``","In","Medias","Res",".","''"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["On the other","the other side","other side of","side of Purgatory","of Purgatory ,","Purgatory , across",", across from","across from the","from the Gate","the Gate of","Gate of Heaven","of Heaven -","Heaven - a","- a burning","a burning house","burning house -","house - the","- the place","the place where","place where Satan","where Satan takes","Satan takes sinful","takes sinful people","sinful people to","people to Hell","A man is","man is told","is told he","told he has","he has made","has made many","made many sins","many sins and","sins and must","and must report","must report to","report to Satan","to Satan ,","Satan , whereupon",", whereupon the","whereupon the man","the man begs","man begs forgiveness","begs forgiveness for","forgiveness for his","for his sins","his sins and","sins and tries","and tries to","tries to strike","to strike a","strike a deal","a deal with","deal with God","Satan covertly observes","covertly observes the","observes the man","the man ,","man , deciding",", deciding to","deciding to tempt","to tempt him","tempt him to","him to take","to take his","take his place","his place in","place in Hell","This exchange would","exchange would allow","would allow Satan","allow Satan to","Satan to find","to find his","find his own","his own unique","own unique audience","unique audience with","audience with God","with God in","God in the","in the form","the form of","form of a","of a written","a written poem","written poem Satan","poem Satan calls","Satan calls \"","calls \" In","\" In Medias","In Medias Res","Medias Res .","Res . \""],"2grams":["On the","the other","other side","side of","of Purgatory","Purgatory ,",", across","across from","from the","the Gate","Gate of","of Heaven","Heaven -","- a","a burning","burning house","house -","- the","the place","place where","where Satan","Satan takes","takes sinful","sinful people","people to","to Hell","A man","man is","is told","told he","he has","has made","made many","many sins","sins and","and must","must report","report to","to Satan","Satan ,",", whereupon","whereupon the","the man","man begs","begs forgiveness","forgiveness for","for his","his sins","sins and","and tries","tries to","to strike","strike a","a deal","deal with","with God","Satan covertly","covertly observes","observes the","the man","man ,",", deciding","deciding to","to tempt","tempt him","him to","to take","take his","his place","place in","in Hell","This exchange","exchange would","would allow","allow Satan","Satan to","to find","find his","his own","own unique","unique audience","audience with","with God","God in","in the","the form","form of","of a","a written","written poem","poem Satan","Satan calls","calls \"","\" In","In Medias","Medias Res","Res .",". \""]}

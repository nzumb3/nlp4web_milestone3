{"title":"The Take","plot":"In suburban Buenos Aires, thirty unemployed auto-parts workers walk into their idle factory, roll out sleeping mats and refuse to leave. All they want is to re-start the silent machines. But this simple act - the take - has the power to turn the globalization debate on its head. Armed only with slingshots and an abiding faith in shop-floor democracy, the workers face off against the bosses, bankers and a whole system that sees their beloved factories as nothing more than scrap metal for sale. With The Take, director Avi Lewis, one of Canada's most outspoken journalists, and writer Naomi Klein, author of the international bestseller No Logo, champion a radical economic manifesto for the 21st century","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","suburban","Bueno","Aire",",","thirti","unemploy","auto-part","worker","walk","into","their","idl","factori",",","roll","out","sleep","mat","and","refus","to","leav",".","All","they","want","is","to","re-start","the","silent","machin",".","But","this","simpl","act","-","the","take","-","has","the","power","to","turn","the","global","debat","on","it","head",".","Armed","onli","with","slingshot","and","an","abid","faith","in","shop-floor","democraci",",","the","worker","face","off","against","the","boss",",","banker","and","a","whole","system","that","see","their","belov","factori","as","noth","more","than","scrap","metal","for","sale",".","With","The","Take",",","director","Avi","Lewi",",","one","of","Canada","'s","most","outspoken","journalist",",","and","writer","Naomi","Klein",",","author","of","the","intern","bestsel","No","Logo",",","champion","a","radic","econom","manifesto","for","the","21st","centuri"],"lemmas":["in","suburban","Buenos","Aires",",","thirty","unemployed","auto-part","worker","walk","into","they","idle","factory",",","roll","out","sleep","mat","and","refuse","to","leave",".","all","they","want","be","to","re-start","the","silent","machine",".","but","this","simple","act","-","the","take","-","have","the","power","to","turn","the","globalization","debate","on","its","head",".","arm","only","with","slingshot","and","a","abiding","faith","in","shop-floor","democracy",",","the","worker","face","off","against","the","boss",",","banker","and","a","whole","system","that","see","they","beloved","factory","as","nothing","more","than","scrap","metal","for","sale",".","with","the","take",",","director","Avi","Lewis",",","one","of","Canada","'s","most","outspoken","journalist",",","and","writer","Naomi","Klein",",","author","of","the","international","bestseller","No","Logo",",","champion","a","radical","economic","manifesto","for","the","21st","century"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In suburban Buenos","suburban Buenos Aires","Buenos Aires ,","Aires , thirty",", thirty unemployed","thirty unemployed auto-parts","unemployed auto-parts workers","auto-parts workers walk","workers walk into","walk into their","into their idle","their idle factory","idle factory ,","factory , roll",", roll out","roll out sleeping","out sleeping mats","sleeping mats and","mats and refuse","and refuse to","refuse to leave","All they want","they want is","want is to","is to re-start","to re-start the","re-start the silent","the silent machines","But this simple","this simple act","simple act -","act -

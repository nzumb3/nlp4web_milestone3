{"title":"Chavez Cage of Glory","plot":"Barely being able to make ends meet and doing everything he can possibly do to cover his ill son's growing medical bills, Hector Chavez turns to his fighting roots in the underbelly of LA. His amateur Mixed Martial Arts videos go viral grabbing the attention of the world's top MMA federation. Hector is then given a dream come true opportunity to go up against the MMA World Champion; a vicious fighter whose last opponent is in critical condition in the same hospital as his son. Hector is faced with a real do-or-die situation and must risk it all so his son can have the surgery he needs to survive.","genres":["Drama"," Sport"],"stems":["Bare","be","abl","to","make","end","meet","and","do","everyth","he","can","possibl","do","to","cover","his","ill","son","'s","grow","medic","bill",",","Hector","Chavez","turn","to","his","fight","root","in","the","underbelli","of","LA",".","His","amateur","Mix","Martial","Arts","video","go","viral","grab","the","attent","of","the","world","'s","top","MMA","feder",".","Hector","is","then","given","a","dream","come","true","opportun","to","go","up","against","the","MMA","World","Champion",";","a","vicious","fighter","whose","last","oppon","is","in","critic","condit","in","the","same","hospit","as","his","son",".","Hector","is","face","with","a","real","do-or-di","situat","and","must","risk","it","all","so","his","son","can","have","the","surgeri","he","need","to","surviv","."],"lemmas":["barely","be","able","to","make","end","meet","and","do","everything","he","can","possibly","do","to","cover","he","ill","son","'s","grow","medical","bill",",","Hector","Chavez","turn","to","he","fight","root","in","the","underbelly","of","LA",".","he","amateur","Mixed","Martial","Arts","video","go","viral","grab","the","attention","of","the","world","'s","top","MMA","federation",".","Hector","be","then","give","a","dream","come","true","opportunity","to","go","up","against","the","MMA","World","Champion",";","a","vicious","fighter","whose","last","opponent","be","in","critical","condition","in","the","same","hospital","as","he","son",".","Hector","be","face","with","a","real","do-or-die","situation","and","must","risk","it","all","so","he","son","can","have","the","surgery","he","need","to","survive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Barely being able","being able to","able to make","to make ends","make ends meet","ends meet and","meet and doing","and doing everything","doing everything he","everything he can","he can possibly","can possibly do","possibly do to","do to cover","to cover his","cover his ill","his ill son","ill son 's","son 's growing","'s growing medical","growing medical bills","medical bills ,","bills , Hector",", Hector Chavez","Hector Chavez turns","Chavez turns to","turns to his","to his fighting","his fighting roots","fighting roots in","roots in the","in the underbelly","the underbelly of","underbelly of LA","His amateur Mixed","amateur Mixed Martial","Mixed Martial Arts","Martial Arts videos","Arts videos go","videos go viral","go viral grabbing","viral grabbing the","grabbing the attention","the attention of","attention of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's top","'s top MMA","top MMA federation","Hector is then","is then given","then given a","given a dream","a dream come","dream come true","come true opportunity","true opportunity to","opportunity to go","to go up","go up against","up against the","against the MMA","the MMA World","MMA World Champion","World Champion ;","Champion ;

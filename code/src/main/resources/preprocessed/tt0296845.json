{"title":"Little Secrets","plot":"Emily Lindstrom, 14, is an aspiring concert violinist; she's spending the summer practicing for a big audition while her girlfriends are at camp. She's also got a thriving neighborhood business: for 50 cents, she'll keep your secret. Her mother is very pregnant, and her parents seem more concerned about the new baby than anything Emily cares about. A new family moves in next door; their son, Philip, 12, becomes Emily's friend. Eventually, the weight of Emily's secrets - her own, the ones she's keeping professionally, and a secret Philip tells her, send her life temporarily crashing down.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Emili","Lindstrom",",","14",",","is","an","aspir","concert","violinist",";","she","'s","spend","the","summer","practic","for","a","big","audit","while","her","girlfriend","are","at","camp",".","She","'s","also","got","a","thrive","neighborhood","busi",":","for","50","cent",",","she","ll","keep","your","secret",".","Her","mother","is","veri","pregnant",",","and","her","parent","seem","more","concern","about","the","new","babi","than","anyth","Emili","care","about",".","A","new","famili","move","in","next","door",";","their","son",",","Philip",",","12",",","becom","Emili","'s","friend",".","Eventual",",","the","weight","of","Emili","'s","secret","-","her","own",",","the","one","she","'s","keep","profession",",","and","a","secret","Philip","tell","her",",","send","her","life","temporarili","crash","down","."],"lemmas":["Emily","Lindstrom",",","14",",","be","a","aspiring","concert","violinist",";","she","be","spend","the","summer","practicing","for","a","big","audition","while","she","girlfriend","be","at","camp",".","she","be","also","get","a","thriving","neighborhood","business",":","for","50","cent",",","she","will","keep","you","secret",".","she","mother","be","very","pregnant",",","and","she","parent","seem","more","concerned","about","the","new","baby","than","anything","Emily","care","about",".","a","new","family","move","in","next","door",";","they","son",",","Philip",",","12",",","become","Emily","'s","friend",".","eventually",",","the","weight","of","Emily","'s","secret","-","she","own",",","the","one","she","be","keep","professionally",",","and","a","secret","Philip","tell","she",",","send","she","life","temporarily","crash","down","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Emily Lindstrom ,","Lindstrom , 14",", 14 ,","14 , is",", is an","is an aspiring","an aspiring concert","aspiring concert violinist","concert violinist ;","violinist ;

{"title":"Tortoise in Love","plot":"Tom, gardener at the big house, is not a fast mover with women. In fact he's glacially slow. When beautiful Polish au pair Anya arrives for the summer, Tom falls for her catastrophically like the felling of one of the giant trees he cares for in the manicured grounds. Tom's adviser in matters of the heart is young Harry, abandoned by the rich owners of the house to run wild in the gardens. Harry's secret wish is for the Red Arrows to appear at the village fair: Tom's is to win the heart of Anya. Both seem impossible dreams until the whole village decides to lend a hand.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Tom",",","garden","at","the","big","hous",",","is","not","a","fast","mover","with","women",".","In","fact","he","'s","glacial","slow",".","When","beauti","Polish","au","pair","Anya","arriv","for","the","summer",",","Tom","fall","for","her","catastroph","like","the","fell","of","one","of","the","giant","tree","he","care","for","in","the","manicur","ground",".","Tom","'s","advis","in","matter","of","the","heart","is","young","Harri",",","abandon","by","the","rich","owner","of","the","hous","to","run","wild","in","the","garden",".","Harri","'s","secret","wish","is","for","the","Red","Arrow","to","appear","at","the","villag","fair",":","Tom","'s","is","to","win","the","heart","of","Anya",".","Both","seem","imposs","dream","until","the","whole","villag","decid","to","lend","a","hand","."],"lemmas":["Tom",",","gardener","at","the","big","house",",","be","not","a","fast","mover","with","woman",".","in","fact","he","be","glacially","slow",".","when","beautiful","polish","au","pair","Anya","arrive","for","the","summer",",","Tom","fall","for","she","catastrophically","like","the","felling","of","one","of","the","giant","tree","he","care","for","in","the","manicured","grounds",".","Tom","'s","adviser","in","matter","of","the","heart","be","young","Harry",",","abandon","by","the","rich","owner","of","the","house","to","run","wild","in","the","garden",".","Harry","'s","secret","wish","be","for","the","Red","Arrows","to","appear","at","the","village","fair",":","Tom","'s","be","to","win","the","heart","of","Anya",".","both","seem","impossible","dream","until","the","whole","village","decide","to","lend","a","hand","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tom , gardener",", gardener at","gardener at the","at the big","the big house","big house ,","house , is",", is not","is not a","not a fast","a fast mover","fast mover with","mover with women","In fact he","fact he 's","he 's glacially","'s glacially slow","When beautiful Polish","beautiful Polish au","Polish au pair","au pair Anya","pair Anya arrives","Anya arrives for","arrives for the","for the summer","the summer ,","summer , Tom",", Tom falls","Tom falls for","falls for her","for her catastrophically","her catastrophically like","catastrophically like the","like the felling","the felling of","felling of one","of one of","one of the","of the giant","the giant trees","giant trees he","trees he cares","he cares for","cares for in","for in the","in the manicured","the manicured grounds","Tom 's adviser","'s adviser in","adviser in matters","in matters of","matters of the","of the heart","the heart is","heart is young","is young Harry","young Harry ,","Harry , abandoned",", abandoned by","abandoned by the","by the rich","the rich owners","rich owners of","owners of the","of the house","the house to","house to run","to run wild","run wild in","wild in the","in the gardens","Harry 's secret","'s secret wish","secret wish is","wish is for","is for the","for the Red","the Red Arrows","Red Arrows to","Arrows to appear","to appear at","appear at the","at the village","the village fair","village fair :","fair : Tom",": Tom 's","Tom 's is","'s is to","is to win","to win the","win the heart","the heart of","heart of Anya","Both seem impossible","seem impossible dreams","impossible dreams until","dreams until the","until the whole","the whole village","whole village decides","village decides to","decides to lend","to lend a","lend a hand"],"2grams":["Tom ,",", gardener","gardener at","at the","the big","big house","house ,",", is","is not","not a","a fast","fast mover","mover with","with women","In fact","fact he","he 's","'s glacially","glacially slow","When beautiful","beautiful Polish","Polish au","au pair","pair Anya","Anya arrives","arrives for","for the","the summer","summer ,",", Tom","Tom falls","falls for","for her","her catastrophically","catastrophically like","like the","the felling","felling of","of one","one of","of the","the giant","giant trees","trees he","he cares","cares for","for in","in the","the manicured","manicured grounds","Tom 's","'s adviser","adviser in","in matters","matters of","of the","the heart","heart is","is young","young Harry","Harry ,",", abandoned","abandoned by","by the","the rich","rich owners","owners of","of the","the house","house to","to run","run wild","wild in","in the","the gardens","Harry 's","'s secret","secret wish","wish is","is for","for the","the Red","Red Arrows","Arrows to","to appear","appear at","at the","the village","village fair","fair :",": Tom","Tom 's","'s is","is to","to win","win the","the heart","heart of","of Anya","Both seem","seem impossible","impossible dreams","dreams until","until the","the whole","whole village","village decides","decides to","to lend","lend a","a hand"]}

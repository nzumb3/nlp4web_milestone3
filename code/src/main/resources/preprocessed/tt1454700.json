{"title":"Truth","plot":"Lucy's boyfriend is not what he seems to be. On a drive home after a New Years Eve party, Lucy and her roommate Stephanie, suddenly find themselves being kidnapped by Hazeem who is secretly a member of a terrorist cell. Leaping from the moving car, they narrowly escape and find help from a stranger, Thomas. He tries to decoy and fight off Hazeem and the armed co-conspirators, but is overpowered and also taken hostage. It's all over the news that this Al-Quida cell has taken three hostages and threatens to execute them if the United States does not completely leave their Arabic homelands. But Thomas refuses to be a pawn in their game. He challenges, sabotages and resists the terrorists at every turn. This ultimately leads to torture and their attempt to break his will. The cold-hearted leader tolerates neither resistance nor rebellion on moral grounds and will fulfill the cause at any cost. Then truths begin to be revealed. The cell leader is not what he seems to be and the hostages discover the kidnapping was planned months ago and Stephanie was their target because she hides a powerful secret that could shake the foundation of an unconscious nation. Having arranged to bring in an ambitious reporter for a live interview via Internet; they intends to expose Stephanie's soul-wrenching secret and a nation's greatest fear before time runs out.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller","

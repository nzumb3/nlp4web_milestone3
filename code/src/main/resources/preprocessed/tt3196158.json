{"title":"Collapse","plot":"After 15 years away, Thorson (played by Russell Murphy, former San Francisco Ballet principal dancer) returns to the ballet company where audiences once flocked to see him. He has choreographed a ballet for troubled times but it's not going to be easy to finance new work with funds for the arts drying up. As his original scheme collapses and he loses heart, a new experience, both transcendent and terrifying, seizes him.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["After","15","year","away",",","Thorson","(","play","by","Russel","Murphi",",","former","San","Francisco","Ballet","princip","dancer",")","return","to","the","ballet","compani","where","audienc","onc","flock","to","see","him",".","He","has","choreograph","a","ballet","for","troubl","time","but","it","'s","not","go","to","be","easi","to","financ","new","work","with","fund","for","the","art","dri","up",".","As","his","origin","scheme","collaps","and","he","lose","heart",",","a","new","experi",",","both","transcend","and","terrifi",",","seiz","him","."],"lemmas":["after","15","year","away",",","Thorson","-lrb-","play","by","Russell","Murphy",",","former","San","Francisco","Ballet","principal","dancer","-rrb-","return","to","the","ballet","company","where","audience","once","flock","to","see","he",".","he","have","choreograph","a","ballet","for","troubled","time","but","it","be","not","go","to","be","easy","to","finance","new","work","with","fund","for","the","art","dry","up",".","as","he","original","scheme","collapse","and","he","lose","heart",",","a","new","experience",",","both","transcendent","and","terrifying",",","seize","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["After 15 years","15 years away","years away ,","away , Thorson",", Thorson (","Thorson ( played","( played by","played by Russell","by Russell Murphy","Russell Murphy ,","Murphy , former",", former San","former San Francisco","San Francisco Ballet","Francisco Ballet principal","Ballet principal dancer","principal dancer )","dancer ) returns",") returns to","returns to the","to the ballet","the ballet company","ballet company where","company where audiences","where audiences once","audiences once flocked","once flocked to","flocked to see","to see him","He has choreographed","has choreographed a","choreographed a ballet","a ballet for","ballet for troubled","for troubled times","troubled times but","times but it","but it 's","it 's not","'s not going","not going to","going to be","to be easy","be easy to","easy to finance","to finance new","finance new work","new work with","work with funds","with funds for","funds for the","for the arts","the arts drying","arts drying up","As his original","his original scheme","original scheme collapses","scheme collapses and","collapses and he","and he loses","he loses heart","loses heart ,","heart , a",", a new","a new experience","new experience ,","experience , both",", both transcendent","both transcendent and","transcendent and terrifying","and terrifying ,","terrifying , seizes",", seizes him"],"2grams":["After 15","15 years","years away","away ,",", Thorson","Thorson (","( played","played by","by Russell","Russell Murphy","Murphy ,",", former","former San","San Francisco","Francisco Ballet","Ballet principal","principal dancer","dancer )",") returns","returns to","to the","the ballet","ballet company","company where","where audiences","audiences once","once flocked","flocked to","to see","see him","He has","has choreographed","choreographed a","a ballet","ballet for","for troubled","troubled times","times but","but it","it 's","'s not","not going","going to","to be","be easy","easy to","to finance","finance new","new work","work with","with funds","funds for","for the","the arts","arts drying","drying up","As his","his original","original scheme","scheme collapses","collapses and","and he","he loses","loses heart","heart ,",", a","a new","new experience","experience ,",", both","both transcendent","transcendent and","and terrifying","terrifying ,",", seizes","seizes him"]}

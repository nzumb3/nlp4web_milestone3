{"title":"A Still Small Voice","plot":"A young missionary, plagued by dreams of an abused alternate life, searches for meaning in a dying world, and discovers that he has an unusual effect on all those he meets. But when tragedy strikes unexpectedly, he realizes that before he can save others, he must first find a way to save himself. A desperate prostitute may hold the answer, but the end is closer than he knows. Produced for less than $1000, this hour-long drama constructs a non-linear puzzle for the viewer that is not complete until the final, shocking moment.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","young","missionari",",","plagu","by","dream","of","an","abus","altern","life",",","search","for","mean","in","a","die","world",",","and","discov","that","he","has","an","unusu","effect","on","all","those","he","meet",".","But","when","tragedi","strike","unexpect",",","he","realiz","that","befor","he","can","save","other",",","he","must","first","find","a","way","to","save","himself",".","A","desper","prostitut","may","hold","the","answer",",","but","the","end","is","closer","than","he","know",".","Produc","for","less","than","$","1000",",","this","hour-long","drama","construct","a","non-linear","puzzl","for","the","viewer","that","is","not","complet","until","the","final",",","shock","moment","."],"lemmas":["a","young","missionary",",","plague","by","dream","of","a","abused","alternate","life",",","search","for","meaning","in","a","die","world",",","and","discover","that","he","have","a","unusual","effect","on","all","those","he","meet",".","but","when","tragedy","strike","unexpectedly",",","he","realize","that","before","he","can","save","other",",","he","must","first","find","a","way","to","save","himself",".","a","desperate","prostitute","may","hold","the","answer",",","but","the","end","be","closer","than","he","know",".","produce","for","less","than","$","1000",",","this","hour-long","drama","construct","a","non-linear","puzzle","for","the","viewer","that","be","not","complete","until","the","final",",","shocking","moment","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A young missionary","young missionary ,","missionary , plagued",", plagued by","plagued by dreams","by dreams of","dreams of an","of an abused","an abused alternate","abused alternate life","alternate life ,","life , searches",", searches for","searches for meaning","for meaning in","meaning in a","in a dying","a dying world","dying world ,","world , and",", and discovers","and discovers that","discovers that he","that he has","he has an","has an unusual","an unusual effect","unusual effect on","effect on all","on all those","all those he","those he meets","But when tragedy","when tragedy strikes","tragedy strikes unexpectedly","strikes unexpectedly ,","unexpectedly , he",", he realizes","he realizes that","realizes that before","that before he","before he can","he can save","can save others","save others ,","others , he",", he must","he must first","must first find","first find a","find a way","a way to","way to save","to save himself","A desperate prostitute","desperate prostitute may","prostitute may hold","may hold the","hold the answer","the answer ,","answer , but",", but the","but the end","the end is","end is closer","is closer than","closer than he","than he knows","Produced for less","for less than","less than $","than $ 1000","$ 1000 ,","1000 , this",", this hour-long","this hour-long drama","hour-long drama constructs","drama constructs a","constructs a non-linear","a non-linear puzzle","non-linear puzzle for","puzzle for the","for the viewer","the viewer that","viewer that is","that is not","is not complete","not complete until","complete until the","until the final","the final ,","final , shocking",", shocking moment"],"2grams":["A young","young missionary","missionary ,",", plagued","plagued by","by dreams","dreams of","of an","an abused","abused alternate","alternate life","life ,",", searches","searches for","for meaning","meaning in","in a","a dying","dying world","world ,",", and","and discovers","discovers that","that he","he has","has an","an unusual","unusual effect","effect on","on all","all those","those he","he meets","But when","when tragedy","tragedy strikes","strikes unexpectedly","unexpectedly ,",", he","he realizes","realizes that","that before","before he","he can","can save","save others","others ,",", he","he must","must first","first find","find a","a way","way to","to save","save himself","A desperate","desperate prostitute","prostitute may","may hold","hold the","the answer","answer ,",", but","but the","the end","end is","is closer","closer than","than he","he knows","Produced for","for less","less than","than $","$ 1000","1000 ,",", this","this hour-long","hour-long drama","drama constructs","constructs a","a non-linear","non-linear puzzle","puzzle for","for the","the viewer","viewer that","that is","is not","not complete","complete until","until the","the final","final ,",", shocking","shocking moment"]}

{"title":"Marius","plot":"\"Marius\" takes place in Marseilles' Old Port, at the La Marine Bar, owned by César and his son Marius. Marius' biggest dream is to embark on one of the boats passing by his dad's bar and to set off to a faraway land. Fanny, a young and pretty seafood peddler, has secretly been in love with Marius since her childhood; Marius, never admitting it, has always loved Fanny. One day, a sailor drops by La Marine and offers him a job on an exploratory ship. Trying to hold him off and to make him jealous, Fanny confesses his love to him and provokes a fight between Marius and one of César's old friends, Panisse, a boat merchant, who despite his old age, has been courting Fanny for a while. Torn between the call of the sea and his love for her, Marius abandons his dream to be with Fanny who gives herself to him. As César and Honorine, Fanny's mother, are getting ready for the wedding, Marius changes his mind, drawn back to the call of the sea. Sacrificing her love, Fanny convinces Marius to embark on his journey, leaving her behind. Devastated but holding back her tears, she hides Marius' decision to his father.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["\"","Marius","\"","take","place","in","Marseill","'","Old","Port",",","at","the","La","Marin","Bar",",","own","by","César","and","his","son","Marius",".","Marius","'","biggest","dream","is","to","embark","on","one","of","the","boat","pass","by","his","dad","'s","bar","and","to","set","off","to","a","faraway","land",".","Fanni",",","a","young","and","pretti","seafood","peddler",",","has","secret","been","in","love","with","Marius","sinc","her","childhood",";","Marius",",","never","admit","it",",","has","alway","love","Fanni",".","One","day",",","a","sailor","drop","by","La","Marin","and","offer","him","a","job","on","an","exploratori","ship",".","Tri","to","hold","him","off","and","to","make","him","jealous",",","Fanni","confess","his","love","to","him","and","provok","a","fight","between","Marius","and","one","of","César","'s","old","friend",",","Paniss",",","a","boat","merchant",",","who","despit","his","old","age",",","has","been","court","Fanni","for","a","while",".","Torn","between","the","call","of","the","sea","and","his","love","for","her",",","Marius","abandon","his","dream","to","be","with","Fanni","who","give","herself","to","him",".","As","César","and","Honorin",",","Fanni","'s","mother",",","are","get","readi","for","the","wed",",","Marius","chang","his","mind",",","drawn","back","to","the","call","of","the","sea",".","Sacrif","her","love",",","Fanni","convinc","Marius","to","embark","on","his","journey",",","leav","her","behind",".","Devast","but","hold","back","her","tear",",","she","hide","Marius","'","decis","to","his","father","."],"lemmas":["``","Marius","''","take","place","in","Marseilles","'","Old","Port",",","at","the","La","Marine","Bar",",","own","by","César","and","he","son","Marius",".","Marius","'","biggest","dream","be","to","embark","on","one","of","the","boat","pass","by","he","dad","'s","bar","and","to","set","off","to","a","faraway","land",".","fanny",",","a","young","and","pretty","seafood","peddler",",","have","secretly","be","in","love","with","Marius","since","she","childhood",";","Marius",",","never","admit","it",",","have","always","love","Fanny",".","one","day",",","a","sailor","drop","by","La","Marine","and","offer","he","a","job","on","a","exploratory","ship",".","try","to","hold","he","off","and","to","make","he","jealous",",","Fanny","confess","he","love","to","he","and","provoke","a","fight","between","Marius","and","one","of","César","'s","old","friend",",","Panisse",",","a","boat","merchant",",","who","despite","he","old","age",",","have","be","court","Fanny","for","a","while",".","tear","between","the","call","of","the","sea","and","he","love","for","she",",","Marius","abandon","he","dream","to","be","with","Fanny","who","give","herself","to","he",".","as","César","and","Honorine",",","Fanny","'s","mother",",","be","get","ready","for","the","wedding",",","Marius","change","he","mind",",","draw","back","to","the","call","of","the","sea",".","sacrifice","she","love",",","Fanny","convince","Marius","to","embark","on","he","journey",",","leave","she","behind",".","devastate","but","hold","back","she","tear",",","she","hide","Marius","'","decision","to","he","father","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Marius \"","Marius \" takes","\" takes place","takes place in","place in Marseilles","in Marseilles '","Marseilles ' Old","' Old Port","Old Port ,","Port , at",", at the","at the La","the La Marine","La Marine Bar","Marine Bar ,","Bar , owned",", owned by","owned by César","by César and","César and his","and his son","his son Marius","Marius ' biggest","' biggest dream","biggest dream is","dream is to","is to embark","to embark on","embark on one","on one of","one of the","of the boats","the boats passing","boats passing by","passing by his","by his dad","his dad 's","dad 's bar","'s bar and","bar and to","and to set","to set off","set off to","off to a","to a faraway","a faraway land","Fanny , a",", a young","a young and","young and pretty","and pretty seafood","pretty seafood peddler","seafood peddler ,","peddler , has",", has secretly","has secretly been","secretly been in","been in love","in love with","love with Marius","with Marius since","Marius since her","since her childhood","her childhood ;","childhood ;

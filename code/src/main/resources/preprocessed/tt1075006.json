{"title":"El percance perfecto","plot":"Ernesto Palacio, the foremost Latino writer, decides after 2 recent flops to open his latest play in a small theater in Hollywood rather than Broadway or the West End. With a desire to cross language and cultural boundaries with his Spanish language play, and in an attempt to reach the masses, he pushes the envelope even further by casting two non-actors in lead roles...one, a hugely popular, female pop singer and the other a world renowned, Colombian, bullfighter. Fireworks and jealousy amongst the cast lead to mayhem during the opening night performance and despite believing that everything happens for a reason, Ernesto's faith is pushed to the absolute limit by this latest disaster.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Ernesto","Palacio",",","the","foremost","Latino","writer",",","decid","after","2","recent","flop","to","open","his","latest","play","in","a","small","theater","in","Hollywood","rather","than","Broadway","or","the","West","End",".","With","a","desir","to","cross","languag","and","cultur","boundari","with","his","Spanish","languag","play",",","and","in","an","attempt","to","reach","the","mass",",","he","push","the","envelop","even","further","by","cast","two","non-actor","in","lead","role","...","one",",","a","huge","popular",",","femal","pop","singer","and","the","other","a","world","renown",",","Colombian",",","bullfight",".","Firework","and","jealousi","amongst","the","cast","lead","to","mayhem","dure","the","open","night","perform","and","despit","believ","that","everyth","happen","for","a","reason",",","Ernesto","'s","faith","is","push","to","the","absolut","limit","by","this","latest","disast","."],"lemmas":["Ernesto","Palacio",",","the","foremost","Latino","writer",",","decide","after","2","recent","flop","to","open","he","latest","play","in","a","small","theater","in","Hollywood","rather","than","Broadway","or","the","West","End",".","with","a","desire","to","cross","language","and","cultural","boundary","with","he","spanish","language","play",",","and","in","a","attempt","to","reach","the","mass",",","he","push","the","envelope","even","further","by","cast","two","non-actor","in","lead","role","...","one",",","a","hugely","popular",",","female","pop","singer","and","the","other","a","world","renowned",",","colombian",",","bullfighter",".","firework","and","jealousy","amongst","the","cast","lead","to","mayhem","during","the","open","night","performance","and","despite","believe","that","everything","happen","for","a","reason",",","Ernesto","'s","faith","be","push","to","the","absolute","limit","by","this","latest","disaster","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Ernesto

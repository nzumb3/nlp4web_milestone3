{"title":"Peddling Influence","plot":"Does our country have a Free Press? In a nation where deceit has become the norm, should we not expect the truth from our mainstream media? The population knows our news is spun better than a fine piece of thread, yet do they understand why? Peddling Influence is a 90-minute eye-opener that exposes shocking information pertaining to who uses our media, for what purposes, and its lack of coverage or total misrepresentation of facts surrounding things that affect us and the information we need to make educated decisions about a variety of topics. There's also a bonus thirty-five minute topic, Rumors of War, discussing use of the media to gain support for war. It's all about control, so find out who's controlling you!","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Doe","our","countri","have","a","Free","Press","?","In","a","nation","where","deceit","has","becom","the","norm",",","should","we","not","expect","the","truth","from","our","mainstream","media","?","The","popul","know","our","news","is","spun","better","than","a","fine","piec","of","thread",",","yet","do","they","understand","whi","?","Peddl","Influenc","is","a","90-minut","eye-open","that","expos","shock","inform","pertain","to","who","use","our","media",",","for","what","purpos",",","and","it","lack","of","coverag","or","total","misrepresent","of","fact","surround","thing","that","affect","us","and","the","inform","we","need","to","make","educ","decis","about","a","varieti","of","topic",".","There","'s","also","a","bonus","thirty-f","minut","topic",",","Rumor","of","War",",","discuss","use","of","the","media","to","gain","support","for","war",".","It","'s","all","about","control",",","so","find","out","who","'s","control","you","!"],"lemmas":["do","we","country","have","a","Free","Press","?","in","a","nation","where","deceit","have","become","the","norm",",","should","we","not","expect","the","truth","from","we","mainstream","media","?","the","population","know","we","news","be","spin","better","than","a","fine","piece","of","thread",",","yet","do","they","understand","why","?","peddle","influence","be","a","90-minute","eye-opener","that","expose","shocking","information","pertain","to","who","use","we","media",",","for","what","purpose",",","and","its","lack","of","coverage","or","total","misrepresentation","of","fact","surround","thing","that","affect","we","and","the","information","we","need","to","make","educate","decision","about","a","variety","of","topic",".","there","be","also","a","bonus","thirty-five","minute","topic",",","Rumors","of","War",",","discuss","use","of","the","media","to","gain","support","for","war",".","it","be","all","about","control",",","so","find","out","who","be","control","you","!"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Does

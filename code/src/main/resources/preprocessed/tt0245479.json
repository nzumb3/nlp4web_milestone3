{"title":"Just a Kiss","plot":"Manhattan. Halley loves Dag, a philanderer who claims he's reformed. Peter, Dag's best friend, loves Rebecca, a suicidal dancer who sleeps around without Peter's knowing. When Halley and Peter learn that Dag and Rebecca have slept together (it started with just a kiss), Halley leaves Dag, and Peter is wounded. In their suffering, Halley meets Andre, a cellist; Peter meets Colleen, Andre's wife; and, a remorseful Dag meets Paula, an edgy waitress with a crush on Peter. Couplings follow; then, several characters end up in hospital. Paula becomes an avenging angel, and Peter may be her next victim. Is there any way these relationships can be set right? Can we go back to that kiss?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Manhattan",".","Halley","love","Dag",",","a","philander","who","claim","he","'s","reform",".","Peter",",","Dag","'s","best","friend",",","love","Rebecca",",","a","suicid","dancer","who","sleep","around","without","Peter","'s","know",".","When","Halley","and","Peter","learn","that","Dag","and","Rebecca","have","slept","togeth","(","it","start","with","just","a","kiss",")",",","Halley","leav","Dag",",","and","Peter","is","wound",".","In","their","suffer",",","Halley","meet","Andre",",","a","cellist",";","Peter","meet","Colleen",",","Andre","'s","wife",";","and",",","a","remors","Dag","meet","Paula",",","an","edgi","waitress","with","a","crush","on","Peter",".","Coupl","follow",";","then",",","sever","charact","end","up","in","hospit",".","Paula","becom","an","aveng","angel",",","and","Peter","may","be","her","next","victim",".","Is","there","ani","way","these","relationship","can","be","set","right","?","Can","we","go","back","to","that","kiss","?"],"lemmas":["Manhattan",".","Halley","love","Dag",",","a","philanderer","who","claim","he","be","reform",".","Peter",",","Dag","'s","best","friend",",","love","Rebecca",",","a","suicidal","dancer","who","sleep","around","without","Peter","'s","know",".","when","Halley","and","Peter","learn","that","Dag","and","Rebecca","have","sleep","together","-lrb-","it","start","with","just","a","kiss","-rrb-",",","Halley","leave","Dag",",","and","Peter","be","wound",".","in","they","suffering",",","Halley","meet","Andre",",","a","cellist",";","Peter","meet","Colleen",",","Andre","'s","wife",";","and",",","a","remorseful","dag","meet","Paula",",","a","edgy","waitress","with","a","crush","on","Peter",".","coupling","follow",";","then",",","several","character","end","up","in","hospital",".","Paula","become","a","avenge","angel",",","and","Peter","may","be","she","next","victim",".","be","there","any","way","these","relationship","can","be","set","right","?","can","we","go","back","to","that","kiss","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Halley loves Dag","loves Dag ,","Dag , a",", a philanderer","a philanderer who","philanderer who claims","who claims he","claims he 's","he 's reformed","Peter , Dag",", Dag 's","Dag 's best","'s best friend","best friend ,","friend , loves",", loves Rebecca","loves Rebecca ,","Rebecca , a",", a suicidal","a suicidal dancer","suicidal dancer who","dancer who sleeps","who sleeps around","sleeps around without","around without Peter","without Peter 's","Peter 's knowing","When Halley and","Halley and Peter","and Peter learn","Peter learn that","learn that Dag","that Dag and","Dag and Rebecca","and Rebecca have","Rebecca have slept","have slept together","slept together (","together ( it","( it started","it started with","started with just","with just a","just a kiss","a kiss )","kiss ) ,",") , Halley",", Halley leaves","Halley leaves Dag","leaves Dag ,","Dag , and",", and Peter","and Peter is","Peter is wounded","In their suffering","their suffering ,","suffering , Halley",", Halley meets","Halley meets Andre","meets Andre ,","Andre , a",", a cellist","a cellist ;","cellist ;

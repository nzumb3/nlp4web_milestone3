{"title":"Kaminnyy gost","plot":"SHE is a district attorney, SHE is trapped in a never-ending sequence of days. It's been five years since SHE lost her beloved husband. Soon, however, SHE notices someone's presence in her apartment: things get broken or rearranged while SHE's away...Is SHE losing her mind? Or is it her dead husband trying to get in touch with her? That's what her friend keeps telling... And then SHE gets in contact with her husband's spirit and, oh miracle, he answers. SHE sees proof everywhere...and SHE's happy again, SHE's with the love of her life even though he's just a ghost. And then HE appears. Or rather falls down a chimney shaft. HE's a fugitive, framed for the murder HE didn't commit. HE's been in contact with her this whole time. So SHE helps: SHE defends him and wins the case. Somewhere along this emotional roller-coaster SHE lets go of the past pain, her dead husband and finds peace. HE, her chimney guest, will still be there when SHE starts over with a clean slate...","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["SHE","is","a","district","attorney",",","SHE","is","trap","in","a","never-end","sequenc","of","day",".","It","'s","been","five","year","sinc","SHE","lost","her","belov","husband",".","Soon",",","howev",",","SHE","notic","someon","'s","presenc","in","her","apart",":","thing","get","broken","or","rearrang","while","SHE","'s","away","...","Is","SHE","lose","her","mind","?","Or","is","it","her","dead","husband","tri","to","get","in","touch","with","her","?","That","'s","what","her","friend","keep","tell","...","And","then","SHE","get","in","contact","with","her","husband","'s","spirit","and",",","oh","miracl",",","he","answer",".","SHE","see","proof","everywher","...","and","SHE","'s","happi","again",",","SHE","'s","with","the","love","of","her","life","even","though","he","'s","just","a","ghost",".","And","then","HE","appear",".","Or","rather","fall","down","a","chimney","shaft",".","HE","'s","a","fugit",",","frame","for","the","murder","HE","did","n't","commit",".","HE","'s","been","in","contact","with","her","this","whole","time",".","So","SHE","help",":","SHE","defend","him","and","win","the","case",".","Somewher","along","this","emot","roller-coast","SHE","let","go","of","the","past","pain",",","her","dead","husband","and","find","peac",".","HE",",","her","chimney","guest",",","will","still","be","there","when","SHE","start","over","with","a","clean","slate","..."],"lemmas":["SHE","be","a","district","attorney",",","she","be","trap","in","a","never-ending","sequence","of","day",".","it","be","be","five","year","since","SHE","lose","she","beloved","husband",".","soon",",","however",",","she","notice","someone","'s","presence","in","she","apartment",":","thing","get","break","or","rearrange","while","SHE","'s","away","...","be","she","lose","she","mind","?","or","be","it","she","dead","husband","try","to","get","in","touch","with","she","?","that","be","what","she","friend","keep","tell","...","and","then","SHE","get","in","contact","with","she","husband","'s","spirit","and",",","oh","miracle",",","he","answer",".","SHE","see","proof","everywhere","...","and","SHE","'s","happy","again",",","SHE","'s","with","the","love","of","she","life","even","though","he","be","just","a","ghost",".","and","then","he","appear",".","or","rather","fall","down","a","chimney","shaft",".","he","be","a","fugitive",",","frame","for","the","murder","he","do","not","commit",".","he","be","be","in","contact","with","she","this","whole","time",".","so","SHE","help",":","she","defend","he","and","win","the","case",".","somewhere","along","this","emotional","roller-coaster","she","let","go","of","the","past","pain",",","she","dead","husband","and","find","peace",".","he",",","she","chimney","guest",",","will","still","be","there","when","SHE","start","over","with","a","clean","slate","..."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["SHE is a","is a district","a district attorney","district attorney ,","attorney , SHE",", SHE is","SHE is trapped","is trapped in","trapped in a","in a never-ending","a never-ending sequence","never-ending sequence of","sequence of days","It 's been","'s been five","been five years","five years since","years since SHE","since SHE lost","SHE lost her","lost her beloved","her beloved husband","Soon , however",", however ,","however , SHE",", SHE notices","SHE notices someone","notices someone 's","someone 's presence","'s presence in","presence in her","in her apartment","her apartment :","apartment : things",": things get","things get broken","get broken or","broken or rearranged","or rearranged while","rearranged while SHE","while SHE 's","SHE 's away","'s away ...","away ...

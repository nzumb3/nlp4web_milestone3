{"title":"Sarkilarla Gectim Aranizdan","plot":"Kazim Koyuncu was one of the most important musicians in Turkey, having introduced a universal sound to the Karadeniz Lazuri music. He died during treatment for lung cancer in 2005. It is generally assumed that the Chernobyl disaster was the cause of Koyuncu's cancer, as believed by many citizens of the country. Now, Kazim's documentary is out. More importantly, now it cannot be destroyed. Even after generations, people will know how Kazim was as a person, how he lived the \"other way\", how he opposed the system and the life itself.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Kazim","Koyuncu","was","one","of","the","most","import","musician","in","Turkey",",","have","introduc","a","univers","sound","to","the","Karadeniz","Lazuri","music",".","He","die","dure","treatment","for","lung","cancer","in","2005",".","It","is","general","assum","that","the","Chernobyl","disast","was","the","caus","of","Koyuncu","'s","cancer",",","as","believ","by","mani","citizen","of","the","countri",".","Now",",","Kazim","'s","documentari","is","out",".","More","import",",","now","it","can","not","be","destroy",".","Even","after","generat",",","peopl","will","know","how","Kazim","was","as","a","person",",","how","he","live","the","\"","other","way","\"",",","how","he","oppos","the","system","and","the","life","itself","."],"lemmas":["Kazim","Koyuncu","be","one","of","the","most","important","musician","in","Turkey",",","have","introduce","a","universal","sound","to","the","Karadeniz","Lazuri","music",".","he","die","during","treatment","for","lung","cancer","in","2005",".","it","be","generally","assume","that","the","Chernobyl","disaster","be","the","cause","of","Koyuncu","'s","cancer",",","as","believe","by","many","citizen","of","the","country",".","now",",","Kazim","'s","documentary","be","out",".","more","importantly",",","now","it","can","not","be","destroy",".","even","after","generation",",","people","will","know","how","Kazim","be","as","a","person",",","how","he","live","the","``","other","way","''",",","how","he","oppose","the","system","and","the","life","itself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kazim Koyuncu was","Koyuncu was one","was one of","one of the","of the most","the most important","most important musicians","important musicians in","musicians in Turkey","in Turkey ,","Turkey , having",", having introduced","having introduced a","introduced a universal","a universal sound","universal sound to","sound to the","to the Karadeniz","the Karadeniz Lazuri","Karadeniz Lazuri music","He died during","died during treatment","during treatment for","treatment for lung","for lung cancer","lung cancer in","cancer in 2005","It is generally","is generally assumed","generally assumed that","assumed that the","that the Chernobyl","the Chernobyl disaster","Chernobyl disaster was","disaster was the","was the cause","the cause of","cause of Koyuncu","of Koyuncu 's","Koyuncu 's cancer","'s cancer ,","cancer , as",", as believed","as believed by","believed by many","by many citizens","many citizens of","citizens of the","of the country","Now , Kazim",", Kazim 's","Kazim 's documentary","'s documentary is","documentary is out","More importantly ,","importantly , now",", now it","now it can","it can not","can not be","not be destroyed","Even after generations","after generations ,","generations , people",", people will","people will know","will know how","know how Kazim","how Kazim was","Kazim was as","was as a","as a person","a person ,","person , how",", how he","how he lived","he lived the","lived the \"","the \" other","\" other way","other way \"","way \" ,","\" , how",", how he","how he opposed","he opposed the","opposed the system","the system and","system and the","and the life","the life itself"],"2grams":["Kazim Koyuncu","Koyuncu was","was one","one of","of the","the most","most important","important musicians","musicians in","in Turkey","Turkey ,",", having","having introduced","introduced a","a universal","universal sound","sound to","to the","the Karadeniz","Karadeniz Lazuri","Lazuri music","He died","died during","during treatment","treatment for","for lung","lung cancer","cancer in","in 2005","It is","is generally","generally assumed","assumed that","that the","the Chernobyl","Chernobyl disaster","disaster was","was the","the cause","cause of","of Koyuncu","Koyuncu 's","'s cancer","cancer ,",", as","as believed","believed by","by many","many citizens","citizens of","of the","the country","Now ,",", Kazim","Kazim 's","'s documentary","documentary is","is out","More importantly","importantly ,",", now","now it","it can","can not","not be","be destroyed","Even after","after generations","generations ,",", people","people will","will know","know how","how Kazim","Kazim was","was as","as a","a person","person ,",", how","how he","he lived","lived the","the \"","\" other","other way","way \"","\" ,",", how","how he","he opposed","opposed the","the system","system and","and the","the life","life itself"]}

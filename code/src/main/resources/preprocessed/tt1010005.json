{"title":"Election Day","plot":"Forget the pie charts, color-coded maps and hyperventilating pundits. What's the street-level experience of voters in today's America? In a triumph of documentary storytelling, ELECTION DAY combines eleven stories--all shot simultaneously on November 2, 2004, from dawn until long past midnight--into one. Factory workers, ex-felons, harried moms, Native American activists and diligent poll watchers, from South Dakota to Florida, take the process of democracy into their own hands. The result: an entertaining, inspiring and sometimes unsettling tapestry of citizens determined on one fateful day to make their votes count.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Forget","the","pie","chart",",","color-cod","map","and","hyperventil","pundit",".","What","'s","the","street-level","experi","of","voter","in","today","'s","America","?","In","a","triumph","of","documentari","storytel",",","ELECTION","DAi","combin","eleven","stori","--","all","shot","simultan","on","Novemb","2",",","2004",",","from","dawn","until","long","past","midnight","--","into","one",".","Factori","worker",",","ex-felon",",","harri","mom",",","Nativ","American","activist","and","dilig","poll","watcher",",","from","South","Dakota","to","Florida",",","take","the","process","of","democraci","into","their","own","hand",".","The","result",":","an","entertain",",","inspir","and","sometim","unsettl","tapestri","of","citizen","determin","on","one","fate","day","to","make","their","vote","count","."],"lemmas":["forget","the","pie","chart",",","color-code","map","and","hyperventilating","pundit",".","what","be","the","street-level","experience","of","voter","in","today","'s","America","?","in","a","triumph","of","documentary","storytelling",",","election","day","combine","eleven","story","--","all","shot","simultaneously","on","November","2",",","2004",",","from","dawn","until","long","past","midnight","--","into","one",".","factory","worker",",","ex-felon",",","harry","mom",",","native","american","activist","and","diligent","poll","watcher",",","from","South","Dakota","to","Florida",",","take","the","process","of","democracy","into","they","own","hand",".","the","result",":","a","entertaining",",","inspiring","and","sometimes","unsettling","tapestry","of","citizen","determine","on","one","fateful","day","to","make","they","vote","count","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Forget

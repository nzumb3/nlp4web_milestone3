{"title":"David & Goliath","plot":"See this fun and moving Bible story (1 Samuel 16-18) as you've never seen it before -- through the eyes of Amelia (Lauren Faber), a shy, modern-day girl who has her own personal Goliath to face -- a performance in her school's choir concert. To help build Amelia's confidence, her choir teacher (Angela Winston) tells her the story of another young person called upon to do something big - a boy by the name of David. David and Goliath is the fun and moving story of the well-known Biblical figure, King David as he takes on the mighty Philistine, Goliath. David and Goliath is enjoyable for the whole family. Thurl Bailey, recording artist, popular public speaker, sports broadcaster, and former NBA star, takes on the role of Goliath in this exciting family adventure. David and Goliath also introduces Spencer Forsey as David, and features all new original music. David and Goliath is sure to be a favorite addition to your family's DVD library!","genres":["Drama"," Musical"," Family"],"stems":["See","this","fun","and","move","Bibl","stori","(","1","Samuel","16-18",")","as","you","ve","never","seen","it","befor","--","through","the","eye","of","Amelia","(","Lauren","Faber",")",",","a","shi",",","modern-day","girl","who","has","her","own","person","Goliath","to","face","--","a","perform","in","her","school","'s","choir","concert",".","To","help","build","Amelia","'s","confid",",","her","choir","teacher","(","Angela","Winston",")","tell","her","the","stori","of","anoth","young","person","call","upon","to","do","someth","big","-","a","boy","by","the","name","of","David",".","David","and","Goliath","is","the","fun","and","move","stori","of","the","well-known","Biblic","figur",",","King","David","as","he","take","on","the","mighti","Philistin",",","Goliath",".","David","and","Goliath","is","enjoy","for","the","whole","famili",".","Thurl","Bailey",",","record","artist",",","popular","public","speaker",",","sport","broadcast",",","and","former","NBA","star",",","take","on","the","role","of","Goliath","in","this","excit","famili","adventur",".","David","and","Goliath","also","introduc","Spencer","Forsey","as","David",",","and","featur","all","new","origin","music",".","David","and","Goliath","is","sure","to","be","a","favorit","addit","to","your","famili","'s","DVD","librari","!"],"lemmas":["see","this","fun","and","move","Bible","story","-lrb-","1","Samuel","16-18","-rrb-","as","you","have","never","see","it","before","--","through","the","eye","of","Amelia","-lrb-","Lauren","Faber","-rrb-",",","a","shy",",","modern-day","girl","who","have","she","own","personal","Goliath","to","face","--","a","performance","in","she","school","'s","choir","concert",".","to","help","build","Amelia","'s","confidence",",","she","choir","teacher","-lrb-","Angela","Winston","-rrb-","tell","she","the","story","of","another","young","person","call","upon","to","do","something","big","-","a","boy","by","the","name","of","David",".","David","and","Goliath","be","the","fun","and","move","story","of","the","well-known","biblical","figure",",","King","David","as","he","take","on","the","mighty","Philistine",",","Goliath",".","David","and","Goliath","be","enjoyable","for","the","whole","family",".","Thurl","Bailey",",","record","artist",",","popular","public","speaker",",","sport","broadcaster",",","and","former","NBA","star",",","take","on","the","role","of","Goliath","in","this","exciting","family","adventure",".","David","and","Goliath","also","introduce","Spencer","Forsey","as","David",",","and","feature","all","new","original","music",".","David","and","Goliath","be","sure","to","be","a","favorite","addition","to","you","family","'s","dvd","library","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["See this fun","this fun and","fun and moving","and moving Bible","moving Bible story","Bible story (","story ( 1","( 1 Samuel","1 Samuel 16-18","Samuel 16-18 )","16-18 ) as",") as you","as you 've","you 've never","'ve never seen","never seen it","seen it before","it before --","before -- through","-- through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of Amelia","of Amelia (","Amelia ( Lauren","( Lauren Faber","Lauren Faber )","Faber ) ,",") , a",", a shy","a shy ,","shy , modern-day",", modern-day girl","modern-day girl who","girl who has","who has her","has her own","her own personal","own personal Goliath","personal Goliath to","Goliath to face","to face --","face -- a","-- a performance","a performance in","performance in her","in her school","her school 's","school 's choir","'s choir concert","To help build","help build Amelia","build Amelia 's","Amelia 's confidence","'s confidence ,","confidence , her",", her choir","her choir teacher","choir teacher (","teacher ( Angela","( Angela Winston","Angela Winston )","Winston ) tells",") tells her","tells her the","her the story","the story of","story of another","of another young","another young person","young person called","person called upon","called upon to","upon to do","to do something","do something big","something big -","big -

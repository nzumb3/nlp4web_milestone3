{"title":"Seventh-Gay Adventists","plot":"David loves Jesus and wants to go to heaven, but he also wants Colin. Marcos was fired for being gay, but wants to be a pastor again. And Sherri wants her kids to grow up to be good Seventh-day Adventists even though the church teaches that her same-sex marriage is sinful. All three are caught in the middle between the church they know and love and their desire to be fully accepted for who they are. 'Seventh-Gay Adventists' offers a revealing look at the inner spiritual world of three LGBT church members struggling to reconcile their faith and sexuality and explores what it means to belong when you find yourself on the margins.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["David","love","Jesus","and","want","to","go","to","heaven",",","but","he","also","want","Colin",".","Marco","was","fire","for","be","gay",",","but","want","to","be","a","pastor","again",".","And","Sherri","want","her","kid","to","grow","up","to","be","good","Seventh-day","Adventist","even","though","the","church","teach","that","her","same-sex","marriag","is","sin",".","All","three","are","caught","in","the","middl","between","the","church","they","know","and","love","and","their","desir","to","be","fulli","accept","for","who","they","are",".","'","Seventh-Gay","Adventist","'","offer","a","reveal","look","at","the","inner","spiritu","world","of","three","LGBT","church","member","struggl","to","reconcil","their","faith","and","sexual","and","explor","what","it","mean","to","belong","when","you","find","yourself","on","the","margin","."],"lemmas":["David","love","Jesus","and","want","to","go","to","heaven",",","but","he","also","want","Colin",".","Marcos","be","fire","for","be","gay",",","but","want","to","be","a","pastor","again",".","and","Sherri","want","she","kid","to","grow","up","to","be","good","seventh-day","Adventists","even","though","the","church","teach","that","she","same-sex","marriage","be","sinful",".","all","three","be","catch","in","the","middle","between","the","church","they","know","and","love","and","they","desire","to","be","fully","accept","for","who","they","be",".","'","Seventh-Gay","Adventists","'","offer","a","revealing","look","at","the","inner","spiritual","world","of","three","lgbt","church","member","struggle","to","reconcile","they","faith","and","sexuality","and","explore","what","it","mean","to","belong","when","you","find","yourself","on","the","margin","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["David loves Jesus","loves Jesus and","Jesus and wants","and wants to","wants to go","to go to","go to heaven","to heaven ,","heaven , but",", but he","but he also","he also wants","also wants Colin","Marcos was fired","was fired for","fired for being","for being gay","being gay ,","gay , but",", but wants","but wants to","wants to be","to be a","be a pastor","a pastor again","And Sherri wants","Sherri wants her","wants her kids","her kids to","kids to grow","to grow up","grow up to","up to be","to be good","be good Seventh-day","good Seventh-day Adventists","Seventh-day Adventists even","Adventists even though","even though the","though the church","the church teaches","church teaches that","teaches that her","that her same-sex","her same-sex marriage","same-sex marriage is","marriage is sinful","All three are","three are caught","are caught in","caught in the","in the middle","the middle between","middle between the","between the church","the church they","church they know","they know and","know and love","and love and","love and their","and their desire","their desire to","desire to be","to be fully","be fully accepted","fully accepted for","accepted for who","for who they","who they are","they are .","are .

{"title":"CowJews and Indians","plot":"My Jewish family lost its home to the Nazis. I decide to return the reparations to the occupiers of our home in Germany, and I go to Germany to get our home back. In Germany, I suddenly realize I'm a hypocrite: here I am, complaining about the property taken from my ancestors, when in America I'm living on and profiting from the land taken from the Native Americans. And then I have an idea: If Germany owes me for sixty five years of back rent, and I owe the Native Americans for sixty five years of back rent, why not let the Native Americans collect directly from Germany and cut out the middleman? Four Native Americans go to Germany to execute the 'assigned claim.'","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["My","Jewish","famili","lost","it","home","to","the","Nazi",".","I","decid","to","return","the","repar","to","the","occupi","of","our","home","in","Germani",",","and","I","go","to","Germani","to","get","our","home","back",".","In","Germani",",","I","sudden","realiz","I","'m","a","hypocrit",":","here","I","am",",","complain","about","the","properti","taken","from","my","ancestor",",","when","in","America","I","'m","live","on","and","profit","from","the","land","taken","from","the","Nativ","American",".","And","then","I","have","an","idea",":","If","Germani","owe","me","for","sixti","five","year","of","back","rent",",","and","I","owe","the","Nativ","American","for","sixti","five","year","of","back","rent",",","whi","not","let","the","Nativ","American","collect","direct","from","Germani","and","cut","out","the","middleman","?","Four","Nativ","American","go","to","Germani","to","execut","the","'","assign","claim",".","'"],"lemmas":["my","jewish","family","lose","its","home","to","the","Nazis",".","I","decide","to","return","the","reparation","to","the","occupier","of","we","home","in","Germany",",","and","I","go","to","Germany","to","get","we","home","back",".","in","Germany",",","I","suddenly","realize","I","be","a","hypocrite",":","here","I","be",",","complain","about","the","property","take","from","my","ancestor",",","when","in","America","I","be","live","on","and","profit","from","the","land","take","from","the","native","Americans",".","and","then","I","have","a","idea",":","if","Germany","owe","I","for","sixty","five","year","of","back","rent",",","and","I","owe","the","native","Americans","for","sixty","five","year","of","back","rent",",","why","not","let","the","native","Americans","collect","directly","from","Germany","and","cut","out","the","middleman","?","four","native","Americans","go","to","Germany","to","execute","the","'","assigned","claim",".","'"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["My Jewish family","Jewish family lost","family lost its","lost its home","its home to","home to the","to the Nazis","I decide to","decide to return","to return the","return the reparations","the reparations to","reparations to the","to the occupiers","the occupiers of","occupiers of our","of our home","our home in","home in Germany","in Germany ,","Germany , and",", and I","and I go","I go to","go to Germany","to Germany to","Germany to get","to get our","get our home","our home back","In Germany ,","Germany , I",", I suddenly","I suddenly realize","suddenly realize I","realize I 'm","I 'm a","'m a hypocrite","a hypocrite :","hypocrite : here",": here I","here I am","I am ,","am , complaining",", complaining about","complaining about the","about the property","the property taken","property taken from","taken from my","from my ancestors","my ancestors ,","ancestors , when",", when in","when in America","in America I","America I 'm","I 'm living","'m living on","living on and","on and profiting","and profiting from","profiting from the","from the land","the land taken","land taken from","taken from the","from the Native","the Native Americans","And then I","then I have","I have an","have an idea","an idea :","idea : If",": If Germany","If Germany owes","Germany owes me","owes me for","me for sixty","for sixty five","sixty five years","five years of","years of back","of back rent","back rent ,","rent , and",", and I","and I owe","I owe the","owe the Native","the Native Americans","Native Americans for","Americans for sixty","for sixty five","sixty five years","five years of","years of back","of back rent","back rent ,","rent , why",", why not","why not let","not let the","let the Native","the Native Americans","Native Americans collect","Americans collect directly","collect directly from","directly from Germany","from Germany and","Germany and cut","and cut out","cut out the","out the middleman","Four Native Americans","Native Americans go","Americans go to","go to Germany","to Germany to","Germany to execute","to execute the","execute the '","the ' assigned","' assigned claim","assigned claim .","claim .

{"title":"Act of War","plot":"Jack Gracy, a former security guard at the American Embassy in Russia, has shown up uninvited to a party at the embassy in the former Soviet Republic of Bazrhikistan, where his estranged girlfriend is working. As the two are talking upstairs, a group of terrorists disguised as caterers burst in and take all the guests downstairs hostage. The terrorists are threatening to launch nuclear missles at America if their demands are not met, but they haven't planned on Jack being their to spoil the party.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Jack","Graci",",","a","former","secur","guard","at","the","American","Embassi","in","Russia",",","has","shown","up","uninvit","to","a","parti","at","the","embassi","in","the","former","Soviet","Republ","of","Bazrhikistan",",","where","his","estrang","girlfriend","is","work",".","As","the","two","are","talk","upstair",",","a","group","of","terrorist","disguis","as","cater","burst","in","and","take","all","the","guest","downstair","hostag",".","The","terrorist","are","threaten","to","launch","nuclear","missl","at","America","if","their","demand","are","not","met",",","but","they","have","n't","plan","on","Jack","be","their","to","spoil","the","parti","."],"lemmas":["Jack","Gracy",",","a","former","security","guard","at","the","American","Embassy","in","Russia",",","have","show","up","uninvited","to","a","party","at","the","embassy","in","the","former","Soviet","Republic","of","Bazrhikistan",",","where","he","estrange","girlfriend","be","work",".","as","the","two","be","talk","upstairs",",","a","group","of","terrorist","disguise","as","caterer","burst","in","and","take","all","the","guest","downstair","hostage",".","the","terrorist","be","threaten","to","launch","nuclear","missle","at","America","if","they","demand","be","not","meet",",","but","they","have","not","plan","on","Jack","be","they","to","spoil","the","party","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jack Gracy ,","Gracy , a",", a former","a former security","former security guard","security guard at","guard at the","at the American","the American Embassy","American Embassy in","Embassy in Russia","in Russia ,","Russia , has",", has shown","has shown up","shown up uninvited","up uninvited to","uninvited to a","to a party","a party at","party at the","at the embassy","the embassy in","embassy in the","in the former","the former Soviet","former Soviet Republic","Soviet Republic of","Republic of Bazrhikistan","of Bazrhikistan ,","Bazrhikistan , where",", where his","where his estranged","his estranged girlfriend","estranged girlfriend is","girlfriend is working","As the two","the two are","two are talking","are talking upstairs","talking upstairs ,","upstairs , a",", a group","a group of","group of terrorists","of terrorists disguised","terrorists disguised as","disguised as caterers","as caterers burst","caterers burst in","burst in and","in and take","and take all","take all the","all the guests","the guests downstairs","guests downstairs hostage","The terrorists are","terrorists are threatening","are threatening to","threatening to launch","to launch nuclear","launch nuclear missles","nuclear missles at","missles at America","at America if","America if their","if their demands","their demands are","demands are not","are not met","not met ,","met , but",", but they","but they have","they have n't","have n't planned","n't planned on","planned on Jack","on Jack being","Jack being their","being their to","their to spoil","to spoil the","spoil the party"],"2grams":["Jack Gracy","Gracy ,",", a","a former","former security","security guard","guard at","at the","the American","American Embassy","Embassy in","in Russia","Russia ,",", has","has shown","shown up","up uninvited","uninvited to","to a","a party","party at","at the","the embassy","embassy in","in the","the former","former Soviet","Soviet Republic","Republic of","of Bazrhikistan","Bazrhikistan ,",", where","where his","his estranged","estranged girlfriend","girlfriend is","is working","As the","the two","two are","are talking","talking upstairs","upstairs ,",", a","a group","group of","of terrorists","terrorists disguised","disguised as","as caterers","caterers burst","burst in","in and","and take","take all","all the","the guests","guests downstairs","downstairs hostage","The terrorists","terrorists are","are threatening","threatening to","to launch","launch nuclear","nuclear missles","missles at","at America","America if","if their","their demands","demands are","are not","not met","met ,",", but","but they","they have","have n't","n't planned","planned on","on Jack","Jack being","being their","their to","to spoil","spoil the","the party"]}

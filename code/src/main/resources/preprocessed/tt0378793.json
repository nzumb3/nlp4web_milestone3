{"title":"Speak","plot":"The young adolescent Melinda Sordino arrives at high school feeling confused, depressed and alone. Her school peers call her \"squealer\", because she alerted the police during a summer party after she was sexually assaulted by Andy Evans. She refuses to tell anyone the events that took place. Her depression and distance from people is made worse by the increasingly large gap between her and her parents. She finds great support with her art teacher Mr. Freeman and her school friend David Petrakis. Her feelings threaten to engulf her but Melinda learns to grow from her experiences instead of repressing the past emotions that have scarred her for the rest of her life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","young","adolesc","Melinda","Sordino","arriv","at","high","school","feel","confus",",","depress","and","alon",".","Her","school","peer","call","her","\"","squealer","\"",",","becaus","she","alert","the","polic","dure","a","summer","parti","after","she","was","sexual","assault","by","Andi","Evan",".","She","refus","to","tell","anyon","the","event","that","took","place",".","Her","depress","and","distanc","from","peopl","is","made","wors","by","the","increas","larg","gap","between","her","and","her","parent",".","She","find","great","support","with","her","art","teacher","Mr.","Freeman","and","her","school","friend","David","Petraki",".","Her","feel","threaten","to","engulf","her","but","Melinda","learn","to","grow","from","her","experi","instead","of","repress","the","past","emot","that","have","scar","her","for","the","rest","of","her","life","."],"lemmas":["the","young","adolescent","Melinda","Sordino","arrive","at","high","school","feeling","confused",",","depressed","and","alone",".","she","school","peer","call","she","``","squealer","''",",","because","she","alert","the","police","during","a","summer","party","after","she","be","sexually","assault","by","Andy","Evans",".","she","refuse","to","tell","anyone","the","event","that","take","place",".","she","depression","and","distance","from","people","be","make","worse","by","the","increasingly","large","gap","between","she","and","she","parent",".","she","find","great","support","with","she","art","teacher","Mr.","Freeman","and","she","school","friend","David","Petrakis",".","she","feeling","threaten","to","engulf","she","but","Melinda","learn","to","grow","from","she","experience","instead","of","repress","the","past","emotion","that","have","scar","she","for","the","rest","of","she","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

{"title":"Lost & Found: The Legacy of USS Lagarto","plot":"In 1944, the submarine USS Lagarto left a small shipyard in Manitowoc, Wisconsin and traveled 8,000 miles to serve in the war in the Pacific. While on patrol, the sub vanished after engaging a Japanese convoy in a ferocious sea battle. For 60 years nothing further was known; families were simply told 'Lagarto overdue from patrol, presumed lost.' In 2005 a British diver stumbled upon the remains of Lagarto and her crew of 86 at the bottom of the Gulf of Thailand. Wreck divers John Chatterton & Richie Kohler, profiled in the best-seller Shadow Divers, led numerous dives to solve the mystery of the disappearance and to determine why no one escaped. Lagarto is the first sunken American WWII submarine found since the war ended.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","1944",",","the","submarin","USS","Lagarto","left","a","small","shipyard","in","Manitowoc",",","Wisconsin","and","travel","8,000","mile","to","serv","in","the","war","in","the","Pacif",".","While","on","patrol",",","the","sub","vanish","after","engag","a","Japanes","convoy","in","a","feroci","sea","battl",".","For","60","year","noth","further","was","known",";","famili","were","simpli","told","'","Lagarto","overdu","from","patrol",",","presum","lost",".","'","In","2005","a","British","diver","stumbl","upon","the","remain","of","Lagarto","and","her","crew","of","86","at","the","bottom","of","the","Gulf","of","Thailand",".","Wreck","diver","John","Chatterton","&","Richi","Kohler",",","profil","in","the","best-sel","Shadow","Diver",",","led","numer","dive","to","solv","the","mysteri","of","the","disappear","and","to","determin","whi","no","one","escap",".","Lagarto","is","the","first","sunken","American","WWII","submarin","found","sinc","the","war","end","."],"lemmas":["in","1944",",","the","submarine","USS","Lagarto","leave","a","small","shipyard","in","Manitowoc",",","Wisconsin","and","travel","8,000","mile","to","serve","in","the","war","in","the","Pacific",".","while","on","patrol",",","the","sub","vanish","after","engage","a","japanese","convoy","in","a","ferocious","sea","battle",".","for","60","year","nothing","further","be","know",";","family","be","simply","tell","'","Lagarto","overdue","from","patrol",",","presume","lose",".","'","in","2005","a","british","diver","stumble","upon","the","remains","of","Lagarto","and","she","crew","of","86","at","the","bottom","of","the","Gulf","of","Thailand",".","wreck","diver","John","Chatterton","&","Richie","Kohler",",","profile","in","the","best-seller","Shadow","Divers",",","lead","numerous","dive","to","solve","the","mystery","of","the","disappearance","and","to","determine","why","no","one","escape",".","Lagarto","be","the","first","sunken","American","WWII","submarine","find","since","the","war","end","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1944 ,","1944 , the",", the submarine","the submarine USS","submarine USS Lagarto","USS Lagarto left","Lagarto left a","left a small","a small shipyard","small shipyard in","shipyard in Manitowoc","in Manitowoc ,","Manitowoc , Wisconsin",", Wisconsin and","Wisconsin and traveled","and traveled 8,000","traveled 8,000 miles","8,000 miles to","miles to serve","to serve in","serve in the","in the war","the war in","war in the","in the Pacific","While on patrol","on patrol ,","patrol , the",", the sub","the sub vanished","sub vanished after","vanished after engaging","after engaging a","engaging a Japanese","a Japanese convoy","Japanese convoy in","convoy in a","in a ferocious","a ferocious sea","ferocious sea battle","For 60 years","60 years nothing","years nothing further","nothing further was","further was known","was known ;","known ; families","; families were","families were simply","were simply told","simply told '","told ' Lagarto","' Lagarto overdue","Lagarto overdue from","overdue from patrol","from patrol ,","patrol , presumed",", presumed lost","presumed lost .","lost .

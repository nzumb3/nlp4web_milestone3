{"title":"Three Days to a Kill","plot":"At a Chicago-area naval base, an ambassador is kidnapped. Later, a Navy officer calls his friend Cal for help. A Colombian drug lord is holding the ambassador, and the officer wants Cal to rescue the man. Cal convinces the officer to get a pardon for imprisoned explosives expert Rick, and together Cal and Rick form an uneasy partnership. They travel to meet Yolanda, a stripper who supposedly knows the location of this drug lord, named Perez (who looks like a creation out of Madame Tussaud's). Our threesome then sets about to rescue the ambassador. Cal, Rick, and Yolanda meet resistance at every turn; apparently Perez's men have the drop on them. After multiple shootouts, Cal convinces Yolanda to use her son as a pawn to draw Perez away from his home, and then all hell breaks loose.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["At","a","Chicago-area","naval","base",",","an","ambassador","is","kidnap",".","Later",",","a","Navi","offic","call","his","friend","Cal","for","help",".","A","Colombian","drug","lord","is","hold","the","ambassador",",","and","the","offic","want","Cal","to","rescu","the","man",".","Cal","convinc","the","offic","to","get","a","pardon","for","imprison","explos","expert","Rick",",","and","togeth","Cal","and","Rick","form","an","uneasi","partnership",".","They","travel","to","meet","Yolanda",",","a","stripper","who","suppos","know","the","locat","of","this","drug","lord",",","name","Perez","(","who","look","like","a","creation","out","of","Madam","Tussaud","'s",")",".","Our","threesom","then","set","about","to","rescu","the","ambassador",".","Cal",",","Rick",",","and","Yolanda","meet","resist","at","everi","turn",";","appar","Perez","'s","men","have","the","drop","on","them",".","After","multipl","shootout",",","Cal","convinc","Yolanda","to","use","her","son","as","a","pawn","to","draw","Perez","away","from","his","home",",","and","then","all","hell","break","loos","."],"lemmas":["at","a","chicago-area","naval","base",",","a","ambassador","be","kidnap",".","later",",","a","Navy","officer","call","he","friend","cal","for","help",".","a","colombian","drug","lord","be","hold","the","ambassador",",","and","the","officer","want","Cal","to","rescue","the","man",".","cal","convince","the","officer","to","get","a","pardon","for","imprison","explosive","expert","Rick",",","and","together","Cal","and","Rick","form","a","uneasy","partnership",".","they","travel","to","meet","Yolanda",",","a","stripper","who","supposedly","know","the","location","of","this","drug","lord",",","name","Perez","-lrb-","who","look","like","a","creation","out","of","Madame","Tussaud","'s","-rrb-",".","we","threesome","then","set","about","to","rescue","the","ambassador",".","Cal",",","Rick",",","and","Yolanda","meet","resistance","at","every","turn",";","apparently","Perez","'s","man","have","the","drop","on","they",".","after","multiple","shootout",",","Cal","convince","Yolanda","to","use","she","son","as","a","pawn","to","draw","Perez","away","from","he","home",",","and","then","all","hell","break","loose","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["At a Chicago-area","a Chicago-area naval","Chicago-area naval base","naval base ,","base , an",", an ambassador","an ambassador is","ambassador is kidnapped","Later , a",", a Navy","a Navy officer","Navy officer calls","officer calls his","calls his friend","his friend Cal","friend Cal for","Cal for help","A Colombian drug","Colombian drug lord","drug lord is","lord is holding","is holding the","holding the ambassador","the ambassador ,","ambassador , and",", and the","and the officer","the officer wants","officer wants Cal","wants Cal to","Cal to rescue","to rescue the","rescue the man","Cal convinces the","convinces the officer","the officer to","officer to get","to get a","get a pardon","a pardon for","pardon for imprisoned","for imprisoned explosives","imprisoned explosives expert","explosives expert Rick","expert Rick ,","Rick , and",", and together","and together Cal","together Cal and","Cal and Rick","and Rick form","Rick form an","form an uneasy","an uneasy partnership","They travel to","travel to meet","to meet Yolanda","meet Yolanda ,","Yolanda , a",", a stripper","a stripper who","stripper who supposedly","who supposedly knows","supposedly knows the","knows the location","the location of","location of this","of this drug","this drug lord","drug lord ,","lord , named",", named Perez","named Perez (","Perez ( who","( who looks","who looks like","looks like a","like a creation","a creation out","creation out of","out of Madame","of Madame Tussaud","Madame Tussaud 's","Tussaud 's )","Our threesome then","threesome then sets","then sets about","sets about to","about to rescue","to rescue the","rescue the ambassador","Cal , Rick",", Rick ,","Rick , and",", and Yolanda","and Yolanda meet","Yolanda meet resistance","meet resistance at","resistance at every","at every turn","every turn ;","turn ;

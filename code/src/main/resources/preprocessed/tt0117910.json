{"title":"Tieta of Agreste","plot":"Just when her family starts believing that she is dead, and that they can expect a rich heritage, Tieta returns from São Paulo to her native village in Bahia, which she had been forced to leave long ago because of some involvement with a goat herd. Believed to be fabulously rich - and nobody knows how - she brings to the great disappointment of her family a young step-daughter and heir. With the arrival of Tieta turmoil enters into the life of her family and their fellow villagers. Most particularly into the life of her nephew - promised to the Church - and the young aspiring mayor.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Just","when","her","famili","start","believ","that","she","is","dead",",","and","that","they","can","expect","a","rich","heritag",",","Tieta","return","from","São","Paulo","to","her","nativ","villag","in","Bahia",",","which","she","had","been","forc","to","leav","long","ago","becaus","of","some","involv","with","a","goat","herd",".","Believ","to","be","fabul","rich","-","and","nobodi","know","how","-","she","bring","to","the","great","disappoint","of","her","famili","a","young","step-daught","and","heir",".","With","the","arriv","of","Tieta","turmoil","enter","into","the","life","of","her","famili","and","their","fellow","villag",".","Most","particular","into","the","life","of","her","nephew","-","promis","to","the","Church","-","and","the","young","aspir","mayor","."],"lemmas":["just","when","she","family","start","believe","that","she","be","dead",",","and","that","they","can","expect","a","rich","heritage",",","tieta","return","from","São","Paulo","to","she","native","village","in","Bahia",",","which","she","have","be","force","to","leave","long","ago","because","of","some","involvement","with","a","goat","herd",".","believe","to","be","fabulously","rich","-","and","nobody","know","how","-","she","bring","to","the","great","disappointment","of","she","family","a","young","step-daughter","and","heir",".","with","the","arrival","of","Tieta","turmoil","enter","into","the","life","of","she","family","and","they","fellow","villager",".","most","particularly","into","the","life","of","she","nephew","-","promise","to","the","Church","-","and","the","young","aspiring","mayor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Just when her","when her family","her family starts","family starts believing","starts believing that","believing that she","that she is","she is dead","is dead ,","dead , and",", and that","and that they","that they can","they can expect","can expect a","expect a rich","a rich heritage","rich heritage ,","heritage , Tieta",", Tieta returns","Tieta returns from","returns from São","from São Paulo","São Paulo to","Paulo to her","to her native","her native village","native village in","village in Bahia","in Bahia ,","Bahia , which",", which she","which she had","she had been","had been forced","been forced to","forced to leave","to leave long","leave long ago","long ago because","ago because of","because of some","of some involvement","some involvement with","involvement with a","with a goat","a goat herd","Believed to be","to be fabulously","be fabulously rich","fabulously rich -","rich -

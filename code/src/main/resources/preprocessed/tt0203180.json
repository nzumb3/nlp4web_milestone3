{"title":"Varga Girl","plot":"In 1916, Alberto Vargas (1886-1982) arrived in New York City. He was Peruvian, trained in photography. He's soon in love with American showgirls and drawing for Florenz Ziegfeld Jr., who helps Vargas develop an eye for talent and personality. Fox brings Vargas to Hollywood; at night, married and living on Greenfield Avenue, he draws women. The film traces his career, developing the \"Varga Girl\" for Esquire Magazine, the popularity of his art during World War II, his contract dispute with Esquire, a protracted court case, and his work apart from Esquire. The film measures the toll the court case took on him. Vargas's biographer talks, so does photographer Bunny Yeager.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","1916",",","Alberto","Varga","(","1886-1982",")","arriv","in","New","York","Citi",".","He","was","Peruvian",",","train","in","photographi",".","He","'s","soon","in","love","with","American","showgirl","and","draw","for","Florenz","Ziegfeld","Jr.",",","who","help","Varga","develop","an","eye","for","talent","and","person",".","Fox","bring","Varga","to","Hollywood",";","at","night",",","marri","and","live","on","Greenfield","Avenu",",","he","draw","women",".","The","film","trace","his","career",",","develop","the","\"","Varga","Girl","\"","for","Esquir","Magazin",",","the","popular","of","his","art","dure","World","War","II",",","his","contract","disput","with","Esquir",",","a","protract","court","case",",","and","his","work","apart","from","Esquir",".","The","film","measur","the","toll","the","court","case","took","on","him",".","Varga","'s","biograph","talk",",","so","doe","photograph","Bunni","Yeager","."],"lemmas":["in","1916",",","Alberto","Vargas","-lrb-","1886-1982","-rrb-","arrive","in","New","York","City",".","he","be","peruvian",",","train","in","photography",".","he","be","soon","in","love","with","american","showgirl","and","drawing","for","Florenz","Ziegfeld","Jr.",",","who","help","Vargas","develop","a","eye","for","talent","and","personality",".","Fox","bring","Vargas","to","Hollywood",";","at","night",",","marry","and","live","on","Greenfield","Avenue",",","he","draw","woman",".","the","film","trace","he","career",",","develop","the","``","Varga","Girl","''","for","Esquire","Magazine",",","the","popularity","of","he","art","during","World","War","II",",","he","contract","dispute","with","Esquire",",","a","protracted","court","case",",","and","he","work","apart","from","Esquire",".","the","film","measure","the","toll","the","court","case","take","on","he",".","Vargas","'s","biographer","talk",",","so","do","photographer","Bunny","Yeager","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1916 ,","1916 , Alberto",", Alberto Vargas","Alberto Vargas (","Vargas ( 1886-1982","( 1886-1982 )","1886-1982 ) arrived",") arrived in","arrived in New","in New York","New York City","He was Peruvian","was Peruvian ,","Peruvian , trained",", trained in","trained in photography","He 's soon","'s soon in","soon in love","in love with","love with American","with American showgirls","American showgirls and","showgirls and drawing","and drawing for","drawing for Florenz","for Florenz Ziegfeld","Florenz Ziegfeld Jr.","Ziegfeld Jr. ,","Jr. , who",", who helps","who helps Vargas","helps Vargas develop","Vargas develop an","develop an eye","an eye for","eye for talent","for talent and","talent and personality","Fox brings Vargas","brings Vargas to","Vargas to Hollywood","to Hollywood ;","Hollywood ;

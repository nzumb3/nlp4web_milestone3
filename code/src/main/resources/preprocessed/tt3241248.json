{"title":"Here's Looking at You, Kid","plot":"In 2012, the jazz man Thomas De Pourquery was selected to be the head of the Jazz Sous Les Pommiers Festival. As a fan of jazz music, Fred Poulet (film director) decided to follow him during his three years residency for an intriguing documentary. The concept is that on one hand you can never see the artist speaking about himself and on the other hand Fred Poulet is interviewing original characters of Coutances, the city where the festival takes place. Also, the film is made in Super 8.","genres":["Music"],"stems":["In","2012",",","the","jazz","man","Thoma","De","Pourqueri","was","select","to","be","the","head","of","the","Jazz","Sous","Les","Pommier","Festiv",".","As","a","fan","of","jazz","music",",","Fred","Poulet","(","film","director",")","decid","to","follow","him","dure","his","three","year","resid","for","an","intrigu","documentari",".","The","concept","is","that","on","one","hand","you","can","never","see","the","artist","speak","about","himself","and","on","the","other","hand","Fred","Poulet","is","interview","origin","charact","of","Coutanc",",","the","citi","where","the","festiv","take","place",".","Also",",","the","film","is","made","in","Super","8","."],"lemmas":["in","2012",",","the","jazz","man","Thomas","De","Pourquery","be","select","to","be","the","head","of","the","jazz","Sous","Les","Pommiers","Festival",".","as","a","fan","of","jazz","music",",","Fred","Poulet","-lrb-","film","director","-rrb-","decide","to","follow","he","during","he","three","year","residency","for","a","intriguing","documentary",".","the","concept","be","that","on","one","hand","you","can","never","see","the","artist","speak","about","himself","and","on","the","other","hand","Fred","Poulet","be","interview","original","character","of","Coutances",",","the","city","where","the","festival","take","place",".","also",",","the","film","be","make","in","Super","8","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 2012 ,","2012 , the",", the jazz","the jazz man","jazz man Thomas","man Thomas De","Thomas De Pourquery","De Pourquery was","Pourquery was selected","was selected to","selected to be","to be the","be the head","the head of","head of the","of the Jazz","the Jazz Sous","Jazz Sous Les","Sous Les Pommiers","Les Pommiers Festival","As a fan","a fan of","fan of jazz","of jazz music","jazz music ,","music , Fred",", Fred Poulet","Fred Poulet (","Poulet ( film","( film director","film director )","director ) decided",") decided to","decided to follow","to follow him","follow him during","him during his","during his three","his three years","three years residency","years residency for","residency for an","for an intriguing","an intriguing documentary","The concept is","concept is that","is that on","that on one","on one hand","one hand you","hand you can","you can never","can never see","never see the","see the artist","the artist speaking","artist speaking about","speaking about himself","about himself and","himself and on","and on the","on the other","the other hand","other hand Fred","hand Fred Poulet","Fred Poulet is","Poulet is interviewing","is interviewing original","interviewing original characters","original characters of","characters of Coutances","of Coutances ,","Coutances , the",", the city","the city where","city where the","where the festival","the festival takes","festival takes place","Also , the",", the film","the film is","film is made","is made in","made in Super","in Super 8"],"2grams":["In 2012","2012 ,",", the","the jazz","jazz man","man Thomas","Thomas De","De Pourquery","Pourquery was","was selected","selected to","to be","be the","the head","head of","of the","the Jazz","Jazz Sous","Sous Les","Les Pommiers","Pommiers Festival","As a","a fan","fan of","of jazz","jazz music","music ,",", Fred","Fred Poulet","Poulet (","( film","film director","director )",") decided","decided to","to follow","follow him","him during","during his","his three","three years","years residency","residency for","for an","an intriguing","intriguing documentary","The concept","concept is","is that","that on","on one","one hand","hand you","you can","can never","never see","see the","the artist","artist speaking","speaking about","about himself","himself and","and on","on the","the other","other hand","hand Fred","Fred Poulet","Poulet is","is interviewing","interviewing original","original characters","characters of","of Coutances","Coutances ,",", the","the city","city where","where the","the festival","festival takes","takes place","Also ,",", the","the film","film is","is made","made in","in Super","Super 8"]}

{"title":"Close to the Fire","plot":"Where does change come from? And how do you reshape the world when you're worried about food, shelter, and the water around your ankles? Close to the fire takes us to South Africa, Bangladesh, and the Pinoleville Pomo Nation in California, where three activists are working to ignite change. Farmers plant saline-tolerant seeds on land threatened by the rising sea, women run a cooperative bakery in Ivory Park, Pomos build a straw-bale insulated, sustainable home on their reservation. These three interwoven stories raise a question: are people at the margins as marginal as we think?","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["Where","doe","chang","come","from","?","And","how","do","you","reshap","the","world","when","you","re","worri","about","food",",","shelter",",","and","the","water","around","your","ankl","?","Close","to","the","fire","take","us","to","South","Africa",",","Bangladesh",",","and","the","Pinolevill","Pomo","Nation","in","California",",","where","three","activist","are","work","to","ignit","chang",".","Farmer","plant","saline-toler","seed","on","land","threaten","by","the","rise","sea",",","women","run","a","cooper","bakeri","in","Ivori","Park",",","Pomo","build","a","straw-bal","insul",",","sustain","home","on","their","reserv",".","These","three","interwoven","stori","rais","a","question",":","are","peopl","at","the","margin","as","margin","as","we","think","?"],"lemmas":["where","do","change","come","from","?","and","how","do","you","reshape","the","world","when","you","be","worried","about","food",",","shelter",",","and","the","water","around","you","ankle","?","close","to","the","fire","take","we","to","South","Africa",",","Bangladesh",",","and","the","Pinoleville","Pomo","Nation","in","California",",","where","three","activist","be","work","to","ignite","change",".","farmer","plant","saline-tolerant","seed","on","land","threaten","by","the","rise","sea",",","woman","run","a","cooperative","bakery","in","Ivory","Park",",","Pomos","build","a","straw-bale","insulate",",","sustainable","home","on","they","reservation",".","these","three","interwoven","story","raise","a","question",":","be","people","at","the","margin","as","marginal","as","we","think","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Where does change","does change come","change come from","And how do","how do you","do you reshape","you reshape the","reshape the world","the world when","world when you","when you 're","you 're worried","'re worried about","worried about food","about food ,","food , shelter",", shelter ,","shelter , and",", and the","and the water","the water around","water around your","around your ankles","Close to the","to the fire","the fire takes","fire takes us","takes us to","us to South","to South Africa","South Africa ,","Africa , Bangladesh",", Bangladesh ,","Bangladesh , and",", and the","and the Pinoleville","the Pinoleville Pomo","Pinoleville Pomo Nation","Pomo Nation in","Nation in California","in California ,","California , where",", where three","where three activists","three activists are","activists are working","are working to","working to ignite","to ignite change","Farmers plant saline-tolerant","plant saline-tolerant seeds","saline-tolerant seeds on","seeds on land","on land threatened","land threatened by","threatened by the","by the rising","the rising sea","rising sea ,","sea , women",", women run","women run a","run a cooperative","a cooperative bakery","cooperative bakery in","bakery in Ivory","in Ivory Park","Ivory Park ,","Park , Pomos",", Pomos build","Pomos build a","build a straw-bale","a straw-bale insulated","straw-bale insulated ,","insulated , sustainable",", sustainable home","sustainable home on","home on their","on their reservation","These three interwoven","three interwoven stories","interwoven stories raise","stories raise a","raise a question","a question :","question : are",": are people","are people at","people at the","at the margins","the margins as","margins as marginal","as marginal as","marginal as we","as we think"],"2grams":["Where does","does change","change come","come from","And how","how do","do you","you reshape","reshape the","the world","world when","when you","you 're","'re worried","worried about","about food","food ,",", shelter","shelter ,",", and","and the","the water","water around","around your","your ankles","Close to","to the","the fire","fire takes","takes us","us to","to South","South Africa","Africa ,",", Bangladesh","Bangladesh ,",", and","and the","the Pinoleville","Pinoleville Pomo","Pomo Nation","Nation in","in California","California ,",", where","where three","three activists","activists are","are working","working to","to ignite","ignite change","Farmers plant","plant saline-tolerant","saline-tolerant seeds","seeds on","on land","land threatened","threatened by","by the","the rising","rising sea","sea ,",", women","women run","run a","a cooperative","cooperative bakery","bakery in","in Ivory","Ivory Park","Park ,",", Pomos","Pomos build","build a","a straw-bale","straw-bale insulated","insulated ,",", sustainable","sustainable home","home on","on their","their reservation","These three","three interwoven","interwoven stories","stories raise","raise a","a question","question :",": are","are people","people at","at the","the margins","margins as","as marginal","marginal as","as we","we think"]}

{"title":"The Nice Guy","plot":"We follow the main character, Chris, down his destructive path to isolation. We will see him sabotage his relationships with all the people who care about him. This includes his closest of friends, his co-workers, his boss, his family, and his incredible girlfriend, Alyssa. It's a sad tale written to be relatable from both sides of the coin. Whether you were a victim of abuse, or the cause of it, or you know somebody who fits the description of these characters, you will find a connection in this film. It is based on connection. It's a dramatic film that will leave you emotionally distraught, emotionally confused, proud, and maybe for some of you out there awaken by relatable instances in your own life. As much as Chris is the the main character of the story, it really is an ensemble based film. The strongest of points will be from the supporting cast, who we have secured incredible actors for that will help deliver an electrifying film in the end.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["We","follow","the","main","charact",",","Chris",",","down","his","destruct","path","to","isol",".","We","will","see","him","sabotag","his","relationship","with","all","the","peopl","who","care","about","him",".","This","includ","his","closest","of","friend",",","his","co-work",",","his","boss",",","his","famili",",","and","his","incred","girlfriend",",","Alyssa",".","It","'s","a","sad","tale","written","to","be","relat","from","both","side","of","the","coin",".","Whether","you","were","a","victim","of","abus",",","or","the","caus","of","it",",","or","you","know","somebodi","who","fit","the","descript","of","these","charact",",","you","will","find","a","connect","in","this","film",".","It","is","base","on","connect",".","It","'s","a","dramat","film","that","will","leav","you","emot","distraught",",","emot","confus",",","proud",",","and","mayb","for","some","of","you","out","there","awaken","by","relat","instanc","in","your","own","life",".","As","much","as","Chris","is","the","the","main","charact","of","the","stori",",","it","realli","is","an","ensembl","base","film",".","The","strongest","of","point","will","be","from","the","support","cast",",","who","we","have","secur","incred","actor","for","that","will","help","deliv","an","electrifi","film","in","the","end","."],"lemmas":["we","follow","the","main","character",",","Chris",",","down","he","destructive","path","to","isolation",".","we","will","see","he","sabotage","he","relationship","with","all","the","people","who","care","about","he",".","this","include","he","closest","of","friend",",","he","co-worker",",","he","boss",",","he","family",",","and","he","incredible","girlfriend",",","Alyssa",".","it","be","a","sad","tale","write","to","be","relatable","from","both","side","of","the","coin",".","whether","you","be","a","victim","of","abuse",",","or","the","cause","of","it",",","or","you","know","somebody","who","fit","the","description","of","these","character",",","you","will","find","a","connection","in","this","film",".","it","be","base","on","connection",".","it","be","a","dramatic","film","that","will","leave","you","emotionally","distraught",",","emotionally","confuse",",","proud",",","and","maybe","for","some","of","you","out","there","awaken","by","relatable","instance","in","you","own","life",".","as","much","as","Chris","be","the","the","main","character","of","the","story",",","it","really","be","a","ensemble","based","film",".","the","strongest","of","point","will","be","from","the","supporting","cast",",","who","we","have","secure","incredible","actor","for","that","will","help","deliver","a","electrifying","film","in","the","end","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["We

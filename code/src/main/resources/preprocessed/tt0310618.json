{"title":"All Visitors Must Be Announced: The Lives and Loves of Doormen in New York City","plot":"In New York thousands of doormen have played the role of father, brother, friend or even the occasional lover for the residents of their apartment buildings for centuries. One chooses to have a doorman mainly for practical reasons (who else will sign for delivery of packages and red roses when you are out jogging?!) and safety. The friendly smile every time you arrive at or leave your building is a pleasant extra that makes the sometimes lonely life in this big city somewhat more bearable. The presence of the doorman appears to be hardly noticed. In most cases however he knows more about his residents than they would like to believe.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","New","York","thousand","of","doormen","have","play","the","role","of","father",",","brother",",","friend","or","even","the","occasion","lover","for","the","resid","of","their","apart","build","for","centuri",".","One","choos","to","have","a","doorman","main","for","practic","reason","(","who","els","will","sign","for","deliveri","of","packag","and","red","rose","when","you","are","out","jog","?!",")","and","safeti",".","The","friend","smile","everi","time","you","arriv","at","or","leav","your","build","is","a","pleasant","extra","that","make","the","sometim","lone","life","in","this","big","citi","somewhat","more","bearabl",".","The","presenc","of","the","doorman","appear","to","be","hard","notic",".","In","most","case","howev","he","know","more","about","his","resid","than","they","would","like","to","believ","."],"lemmas":["in","New","York","thousand","of","doorman","have","play","the","role","of","father",",","brother",",","friend","or","even","the","occasional","lover","for","the","resident","of","they","apartment","building","for","century",".","one","choose","to","have","a","doorman","mainly","for","practical","reason","-lrb-","who","else","will","sign","for","delivery","of","package","and","red","rose","when","you","be","out","jogging","?!","-rrb-","and","safety",".","the","friendly","smile","every","time","you","arrive","at","or","leave","you","building","be","a","pleasant","extra","that","make","the","sometimes","lonely","life","in","this","big","city","somewhat","more","bearable",".","the","presence","of","the","doorman","appear","to","be","hardly","notice",".","in","most","case","however","he","know","more","about","he","resident","than","they","would","like","to","believe","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In New York","New York thousands","York thousands of","thousands of doormen","of doormen have","doormen have played","have played the","played the role","the role of","role of father","of father ,","father , brother",", brother ,","brother , friend",", friend or","friend or even","or even the","even the occasional","the occasional lover","occasional lover for","lover for the","for the residents","the residents of","residents of their","of their apartment","their apartment buildings","apartment buildings for","buildings for centuries","One chooses to","chooses to have","to have a","have a doorman","a doorman mainly","doorman mainly for","mainly for practical","for practical reasons","practical reasons (","reasons ( who","( who else","who else will","else will sign","will sign for","sign for delivery","for delivery of","delivery of packages","of packages and","packages and red","and red roses","red roses when","roses when you","when you are","you are out","are out jogging","out jogging ?!","jogging ?!

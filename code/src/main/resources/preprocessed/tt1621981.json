{"title":"Symphonia Colonialis","plot":"The film is about the Classical Brazilian music of the Minas Gerais province during the 18th and 19th centuries. It narrates the story of a slave boy at the end of the 18th century who gains his freedom by means of his extraordinary musical talent and goes on to become a famous composer, Antonio Francisco da Cunha. At the same time, the film tells us about the music today in São João del Rei, a little town in Minas Gerais, focusing on the Orquestra Ribeiro Bastos, the only surviving mulatto orchestra whose origins date back 250 years.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","film","is","about","the","Classic","Brazilian","music","of","the","Mina","Gerai","provinc","dure","the","18th","and","19th","centuri",".","It","narrat","the","stori","of","a","slave","boy","at","the","end","of","the","18th","centuri","who","gain","his","freedom","by","mean","of","his","extraordinari","music","talent","and","goe","on","to","becom","a","famous","compos",",","Antonio","Francisco","da","Cunha",".","At","the","same","time",",","the","film","tell","us","about","the","music","today","in","São","João","del","Rei",",","a","littl","town","in","Mina","Gerai",",","focus","on","the","Orquestra","Ribeiro","Basto",",","the","onli","surviv","mulatto","orchestra","whose","origin","date","back","250","year","."],"lemmas":["the","film","be","about","the","classical","brazilian","music","of","the","Minas","Gerais","province","during","the","18th","and","19th","century",".","it","narrate","the","story","of","a","slave","boy","at","the","end","of","the","18th","century","who","gain","he","freedom","by","means","of","he","extraordinary","musical","talent","and","go","on","to","become","a","famous","composer",",","Antonio","Francisco","da","Cunha",".","at","the","same","time",",","the","film","tell","we","about","the","music","today","in","São","João","del","Rei",",","a","little","town","in","Minas","Gerais",",","focus","on","the","Orquestra","Ribeiro","Bastos",",","the","only","survive","mulatto","orchestra","whose","origin","date","back","250","year","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The film is","film is about","is about the","about the Classical","the Classical Brazilian","Classical Brazilian music","Brazilian music of","music of the","of the Minas","the Minas Gerais","Minas Gerais province","Gerais province during","province during the","during the 18th","the 18th and","18th and 19th","and 19th centuries","It narrates the","narrates the story","the story of","story of a","of a slave","a slave boy","slave boy at","boy at the","at the end","the end of","end of the","of the 18th","the 18th century","18th century who","century who gains","who gains his","gains his freedom","his freedom by","freedom by means","by means of","means of his","of his extraordinary","his extraordinary musical","extraordinary musical talent","musical talent and","talent and goes","and goes on","goes on to","on to become","to become a","become a famous","a famous composer","famous composer ,","composer , Antonio",", Antonio Francisco","Antonio Francisco da","Francisco da Cunha","At the same","the same time","same time ,","time , the",", the film","the film tells","film tells us","tells us about","us about the","about the music","the music today","music today in","today in São","in São João","São João del","João del Rei","del Rei ,","Rei , a",", a little","a little town","little town in","town in Minas","in Minas Gerais","Minas Gerais ,","Gerais , focusing",", focusing on","focusing on the","on the Orquestra","the Orquestra Ribeiro","Orquestra Ribeiro Bastos","Ribeiro Bastos ,","Bastos , the",", the only","the only surviving","only surviving mulatto","surviving mulatto orchestra","mulatto orchestra whose","orchestra whose origins","whose origins date","origins date back","date back 250","back 250 years"],"2grams":["The film","film is","is about","about the","the Classical","Classical Brazilian","Brazilian music","music of","of the","the Minas","Minas Gerais","Gerais province","province during","during the","the 18th","18th and","and 19th","19th centuries","It narrates","narrates the","the story","story of","of a","a slave","slave boy","boy at","at the","the end","end of","of the","the 18th","18th century","century who","who gains","gains his","his freedom","freedom by","by means","means of","of his","his extraordinary","extraordinary musical","musical talent","talent and","and goes","goes on","on to","to become","become a","a famous","famous composer","composer ,",", Antonio","Antonio Francisco","Francisco da","da Cunha","At the","the same","same time","time ,",", the","the film","film tells","tells us","us about","about the","the music","music today","today in","in São","São João","João del","del Rei","Rei ,",", a","a little","little town","town in","in Minas","Minas Gerais","Gerais ,",", focusing","focusing on","on the","the Orquestra","Orquestra Ribeiro","Ribeiro Bastos","Bastos ,",", the","the only","only surviving","surviving mulatto","mulatto orchestra","orchestra whose","whose origins","origins date","date back","back 250","250 years"]}

{"title":"The 3 Little Wolfs","plot":"Why is this night different from all other nights? It's Passover at the Wolf house... and it may be their last! Join the three Wolf brothers as they navigate a breezy spring New York City day, culminating in an obligatory visit home to Long Island where their mother Sarah (Tovah Feldshuh), a natural incendiary with the tenacity of a cold sore, awaits them. Also awaiting them, a Seder for the ages, more eventful than the Last Supper. Well maybe not quite that eventful.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Whi","is","this","night","differ","from","all","other","night","?","It","'s","Passov","at","the","Wolf","hous","...","and","it","may","be","their","last","!","Join","the","three","Wolf","brother","as","they","navig","a","breezi","spring","New","York","Citi","day",",","culmin","in","an","obligatori","visit","home","to","Long","Island","where","their","mother","Sarah","(","Tovah","Feldshuh",")",",","a","natur","incendiari","with","the","tenac","of","a","cold","sore",",","await","them",".","Also","await","them",",","a","Seder","for","the","age",",","more","event","than","the","Last","Supper",".","Well","mayb","not","quit","that","event","."],"lemmas":["why","be","this","night","different","from","all","other","night","?","it","be","Passover","at","the","Wolf","house","...","and","it","may","be","they","last","!","join","the","three","Wolf","brother","as","they","navigate","a","breezy","spring","New","York","City","day",",","culminate","in","a","obligatory","visit","home","to","Long","Island","where","they","mother","Sarah","-lrb-","Tovah","Feldshuh","-rrb-",",","a","natural","incendiary","with","the","tenacity","of","a","cold","sore",",","await","they",".","also","await","they",",","a","Seder","for","the","age",",","more","eventful","than","the","last","supper",".","well","maybe","not","quite","that","eventful","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Why is this","is this night","this night different","night different from","different from all","from all other","all other nights","It 's Passover","'s Passover at","Passover at the","at the Wolf","the Wolf house","Wolf house ...","house ... and","... and it","and it may","it may be","may be their","be their last","Join the three","the three Wolf","three Wolf brothers","Wolf brothers as","brothers as they","as they navigate","they navigate a","navigate a breezy","a breezy spring","breezy spring New","spring New York","New York City","York City day","City day ,","day , culminating",", culminating in","culminating in an","in an obligatory","an obligatory visit","obligatory visit home","visit home to","home to Long","to Long Island","Long Island where","Island where their","where their mother","their mother Sarah","mother Sarah (","Sarah ( Tovah","( Tovah Feldshuh","Tovah Feldshuh )","Feldshuh ) ,",") , a",", a natural","a natural incendiary","natural incendiary with","incendiary with the","with the tenacity","the tenacity of","tenacity of a","of a cold","a cold sore","cold sore ,","sore , awaits",", awaits them","Also awaiting them","awaiting them ,","them , a",", a Seder","a Seder for","Seder for the","for the ages","the ages ,","ages , more",", more eventful","more eventful than","eventful than the","than the Last","the Last Supper","Well maybe not","maybe not quite","not quite that","quite that eventful"],"2grams":["Why is","is this","this night","night different","different from","from all","all other","other nights","It 's","'s Passover","Passover at","at the","the Wolf","Wolf house","house ...","... and","and it","it may","may be","be their","their last","Join the","the three","three Wolf","Wolf brothers","brothers as","as they","they navigate","navigate a","a breezy","breezy spring","spring New","New York","York City","City day","day ,",", culminating","culminating in","in an","an obligatory","obligatory visit","visit home","home to","to Long","Long Island","Island where","where their","their mother","mother Sarah","Sarah (","( Tovah","Tovah Feldshuh","Feldshuh )",") ,",", a","a natural","natural incendiary","incendiary with","with the","the tenacity","tenacity of","of a","a cold","cold sore","sore ,",", awaits","awaits them","Also awaiting","awaiting them","them ,",", a","a Seder","Seder for","for the","the ages","ages ,",", more","more eventful","eventful than","than the","the Last","Last Supper","Well maybe","maybe not","not quite","quite that","that eventful"]}

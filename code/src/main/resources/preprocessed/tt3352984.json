{"title":"Finding Family","plot":"This documentary tells the true-life story of Oggi Tomic, born in Sarajevo but now living in Cambridge. He co-rote and co-directed the film. He was born in 1985 with water on the brain and given only months to live, abandoned by his mother and brought up in a series of Bosnian orphanages during the bitter Yugoslav civil wars. Finally as a teenager he made his way to the UK and a new life. In 2012 he returned to meet his long-lost biological family - and had to grapple with the fact that they are Serbs, and that some of them were among the enemy army that shelled and sniped at during the 1,300 days of the siege of Sarajevo which began 20 years ago..","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["This","documentari","tell","the","true-lif","stori","of","Oggi","Tomic",",","born","in","Sarajevo","but","now","live","in","Cambridg",".","He","co-rot","and","co-direct","the","film",".","He","was","born","in","1985","with","water","on","the","brain","and","given","onli","month","to","live",",","abandon","by","his","mother","and","brought","up","in","a","seri","of","Bosnian","orphanag","dure","the","bitter","Yugoslav","civil","war",".","Final","as","a","teenag","he","made","his","way","to","the","UK","and","a","new","life",".","In","2012","he","return","to","meet","his","long-lost","biolog","famili","-","and","had","to","grappl","with","the","fact","that","they","are","Serb",",","and","that","some","of","them","were","among","the","enemi","armi","that","shell","and","snipe","at","dure","the","1,300","day","of","the","sieg","of","Sarajevo","which","began","20","year","ago",".","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","tell","the","true-life","story","of","Oggi","Tomic",",","bear","in","Sarajevo","but","now","live","in","Cambridge",".","he","co-rote","and","co-directed","the","film",".","he","be","bear","in","1985","with","water","on","the","brain","and","give","only","month","to","live",",","abandon","by","he","mother","and","bring","up","in","a","series","of","bosnian","orphanage","during","the","bitter","yugoslav","civil","war",".","finally","as","a","teenager","he","make","he","way","to","the","UK","and","a","new","life",".","in","2012","he","return","to","meet","he","long-lost","biological","family","-","and","have","to","grapple","with","the","fact","that","they","be","Serbs",",","and","that","some","of","they","be","among","the","enemy","army","that","shell","and","snipe","at","during","the","1,300","day","of","the","siege","of","Sarajevo","which","begin","20","year","ago",".","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary tells","documentary tells the","tells the true-life","the true-life story","true-life story of","story of Oggi","of Oggi Tomic","Oggi Tomic ,","Tomic , born",", born in","born in Sarajevo","in Sarajevo but","Sarajevo but now","but now living","now living in","living in Cambridge","He co-rote and","co-rote and co-directed","and co-directed the","co-directed the film","He was born","was born in","born in 1985","in 1985 with","1985 with water","with water on","water on the","on the brain","the brain and","brain and given","and given only","given only months","only months to","months to live","to live ,","live , abandoned",", abandoned by","abandoned by his","by his mother","his mother and","mother and brought","and brought up","brought up in","up in a","in a series","a series of","series of Bosnian","of Bosnian orphanages","Bosnian orphanages during","orphanages during the","during the bitter","the bitter Yugoslav","bitter Yugoslav civil","Yugoslav civil wars","Finally as a","as a teenager","a teenager he","teenager he made","he made his","made his way","his way to","way to the","to the UK","the UK and","UK and a","and a new","a new life","In 2012 he","2012 he returned","he returned to","returned to meet","to meet his","meet his long-lost","his long-lost biological","long-lost biological family","biological family -","family -

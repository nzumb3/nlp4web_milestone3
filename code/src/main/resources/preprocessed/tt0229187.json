{"title":"24 Hours in the Life of a Woman","plot":"Set in 1913, 1936 and 2001. When he returns to the casino and sea-side resort of his early adolescence, Louis, a seventy-eight-year-old man encounters Olivia, a nineteen-year-old girl madly in love with a violent cad. Louis tells the story of his own mother having a passionate, driven fling with his Italian tennis instructor in 1936, and of Marie Collins Brown, the slightly older widowed woman who helped him through his confusion and pain by recounting the story of her passionate twenty-four-hour fling with a hopeless young Polish gambler in 1913.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Set","in","1913",",","1936","and","2001",".","When","he","return","to","the","casino","and","sea-sid","resort","of","his","earli","adolesc",",","Loui",",","a","seventy-eight-year-old","man","encount","Olivia",",","a","nineteen-year-old","girl","mad","in","love","with","a","violent","cad",".","Loui","tell","the","stori","of","his","own","mother","have","a","passion",",","driven","fling","with","his","Italian","tenni","instructor","in","1936",",","and","of","Mari","Collin","Brown",",","the","slight","older","widow","woman","who","help","him","through","his","confus","and","pain","by","recount","the","stori","of","her","passion","twenty-four-hour","fling","with","a","hopeless","young","Polish","gambler","in","1913","."],"lemmas":["set","in","1913",",","1936","and","2001",".","when","he","return","to","the","casino","and","sea-side","resort","of","he","early","adolescence",",","Louis",",","a","seventy-eight-year-old","man","encounter","Olivia",",","a","nineteen-year-old","girl","madly","in","love","with","a","violent","cad",".","Louis","tell","the","story","of","he","own","mother","have","a","passionate",",","driven","fling","with","he","italian","tennis","instructor","in","1936",",","and","of","Marie","Collins","Brown",",","the","slightly","older","widow","woman","who","help","he","through","he","confusion","and","pain","by","recount","the","story","of","she","passionate","twenty-four-hour","fling","with","a","hopeless","young","polish","gambler","in","1913","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Set in 1913","in 1913 ,","1913 , 1936",", 1936 and","1936 and 2001","When he returns","he returns to","returns to the","to the casino","the casino and","casino and sea-side","and sea-side resort","sea-side resort of","resort of his","of his early","his early adolescence","early adolescence ,","adolescence , Louis",", Louis ,","Louis , a",", a seventy-eight-year-old","a seventy-eight-year-old man","seventy-eight-year-old man encounters","man encounters Olivia","encounters Olivia ,","Olivia , a",", a nineteen-year-old","a nineteen-year-old girl","nineteen-year-old girl madly","girl madly in","madly in love","in love with","love with a","with a violent","a violent cad","Louis tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of his","of his own","his own mother","own mother having","mother having a","having a passionate","a passionate ,","passionate , driven",", driven fling","driven fling with","fling with his","with his Italian","his Italian tennis","Italian tennis instructor","tennis instructor in","instructor in 1936","in 1936 ,","1936 , and",", and of","and of Marie","of Marie Collins","Marie Collins Brown","Collins Brown ,","Brown , the",", the slightly","the slightly older","slightly older widowed","older widowed woman","widowed woman who","woman who helped","who helped him","helped him through","him through his","through his confusion","his confusion and","confusion and pain","and pain by","pain by recounting","by recounting the","recounting the story","the story of","story of her","of her passionate","her passionate twenty-four-hour","passionate twenty-four-hour fling","twenty-four-hour fling with","fling with a","with a hopeless","a hopeless young","hopeless young Polish","young Polish gambler","Polish gambler in","gambler in 1913"],"2grams":["Set in","in 1913","1913 ,",", 1936","1936 and","and 2001","When he","he returns","returns to","to the","the casino","casino and","and sea-side","sea-side resort","resort of","of his","his early","early adolescence","adolescence ,",", Louis","Louis ,",", a","a seventy-eight-year-old","seventy-eight-year-old man","man encounters","encounters Olivia","Olivia ,",", a","a nineteen-year-old","nineteen-year-old girl","girl madly","madly in","in love","love with","with a","a violent","violent cad","Louis tells","tells the","the story","story of","of his","his own","own mother","mother having","having a","a passionate","passionate ,",", driven","driven fling","fling with","with his","his Italian","Italian tennis","tennis instructor","instructor in","in 1936","1936 ,",", and","and of","of Marie","Marie Collins","Collins Brown","Brown ,",", the","the slightly","slightly older","older widowed","widowed woman","woman who","who helped","helped him","him through","through his","his confusion","confusion and","and pain","pain by","by recounting","recounting the","the story","story of","of her","her passionate","passionate twenty-four-hour","twenty-four-hour fling","fling with","with a","a hopeless","hopeless young","young Polish","Polish gambler","gambler in","in 1913"]}

{"title":"Avec la gauche","plot":"He acts as if it's in the bag. Well, he hasn't crossed paths with me yet!\" That, in a nutshell, was the reaction of singer-song- writer Vincent Lemay-Thivierge upon learning that Jacques Duchesneau, former head of the anti-collusion unit, was running for the CAQ in the Saint-Jérôme riding during the September 2012 Québec general election. A proud representative of Québec solidaire, backed by volunteers and former FLQ member Paul Rose, the musician went into politics to bring the discussion back to often-overshadowed issue of poverty, and to oppose his opponent's less-than-local platform.

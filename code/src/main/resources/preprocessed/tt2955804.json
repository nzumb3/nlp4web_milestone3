{"title":"Purgatorio: A Journey Into the Heart of the Border","plot":"Reyes' provocative essay film re-imagines the Mexico/U.S. border as a mythical place comparable to Dante's purgatory. Leaving politics aside, he takes a fresh look at the brutal beauty of the border and the people caught in its spell. By capturing a stunning mosaic of compelling characters and broken landscapes that live on the US/Mexico border, the filmmaker reflects on the flaws of human nature and the powerful absurdities of the modern world. An unusual border film, in the auteur tradition of camera-stylo, Purgatorio ultimately becomes a fable of humanity, an epic and visceral experience with powerful and lingering images.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Rey","'","provoc","essay","film","re-imagin","the","Mexico/U",".","S.","border","as","a","mythic","place","compar","to","Dant","'s","purgatori",".","Leav","polit","asid",",","he","take","a","fresh","look","at","the","brutal","beauti","of","the","border","and","the","peopl","caught","in","it","spell",".","By","captur","a","stun","mosaic","of","compel","charact","and","broken","landscap","that","live","on","the","US/Mexico","border",",","the","filmmak","reflect","on","the","flaw","of","human","natur","and","the","power","absurd","of","the","modern","world",".","An","unusu","border","film",",","in","the","auteur","tradit","of","camera-stylo",",","Purgatorio","ultim","becom","a","fabl","of","human",",","an","epic","and","viscer","experi","with","power","and","linger","imag","."],"lemmas":["Reyes","'","provocative","essay","film","re-imagine","the","mexico/u",".","S.","border","as","a","mythical","place","comparable","to","Dante","'s","purgatory",".","leave","politics","aside",",","he","take","a","fresh","look","at","the","brutal","beauty","of","the","border","and","the","people","catch","in","its","spell",".","by","capture","a","stunning","mosaic","of","compelling","character","and","broken","landscape","that","live","on","the","us/mexico","border",",","the","filmmaker","reflect","on","the","flaw","of","human","nature","and","the","powerful","absurdity","of","the","modern","world",".","a","unusual","border","film",",","in","the","auteur","tradition","of","camera-stylo",",","Purgatorio","ultimately","become","a","fable","of","humanity",",","a","epic","and","visceral","experience","with","powerful","and","linger","image","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Reyes

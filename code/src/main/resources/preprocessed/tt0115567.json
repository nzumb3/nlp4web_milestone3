But the mobsters blow his cover because they need him for a different scam. The lost heiress to a Vegas casino fortune has been found; she's a truckstop waitress in France. The mobsters' proposition: romance the broad, and get hitched. Or else. Then the crooks can bump her off and keep the casino for themselves...","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Crime"],"stems":["An","actor","owe","big","buck","to","the","Vega","mob",".","He","'s","all","set","to","pay","them","off",";","he","'s","con","a","rich","widow","into","marri","him",".","But","the","mobster","blow","his","cover","becaus","they","need","him","for","a","differ","scam",".","The","lost","heiress","to","a","Vega","casino","fortun","has","been","found",";","she","'s","a","truckstop","waitress","in","Franc",".","The","mobster","'","proposit",":","romanc","the","broad",",","and","get","hitch",".","Or","els",".","Then","the","crook","can","bump","her","off","and","keep","the","casino","for","themselv","..."],"lemmas":["a","actor","owe","big","buck","to","the","Vegas","mob",".","he","be","all","set","to","pay","they","off",";","he","be","con","a","rich","widow","into","marry","he",".","but","the","mobster","blow","he","cover","because","they","need","he","for","a","different","scam",".","the","lose","heiress","to","a","Vegas","casino","fortune","have","be","find",";","she","be","a","truckstop","waitress","in","France",".","the","mobster","'","proposition",":","romance","the","broad",",","and","get","hitch",".","or","else",".","then","the","crook","can","bump","she","off","and","keep","the","casino","for","themselves","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["An actor owes","actor owes big","owes big bucks","big bucks to","bucks to the","to the Vegas","the Vegas mob","He 's all","'s all set","all set to","set to pay","to pay them","pay them off","them off ;","off ; he","; he 's","he 's conned","'s conned a","conned a rich","a rich widow","rich widow into","widow into marrying","into marrying him","But the mobsters","the mobsters blow","mobsters blow his","blow his cover","his cover because","cover because they","because they need","they need him","need him for","him for a","for a different","a different scam","The lost heiress","lost heiress to","heiress to a","to a Vegas","a Vegas casino","Vegas casino fortune","casino fortune has","fortune has been","has been found","been found ;","found ; she","; she 's","she 's a","'s a truckstop","a truckstop waitress","truckstop waitress in","waitress in France","The mobsters '","mobsters ' proposition","' proposition :","proposition : romance",": romance the","romance the broad","the broad ,","broad , and",", and get","and get hitched","Then the crooks","the crooks can","crooks can bump","can bump her","bump her off","her off and","off and keep","and keep the","keep the casino","the casino for","casino for themselves","for themselves ..."],"2grams":["An actor","actor owes","owes big","big bucks","bucks to","to the","the Vegas","Vegas mob","He 's","'s all","all set","set to","to pay","pay them","them off","off ;","; he","he 's","'s conned","conned a","a rich","rich widow","widow into","into marrying","marrying him","But the","the mobsters","mobsters blow","blow his","his cover","cover because","because they","they need","need him","him for","for a","a different","different scam","The lost","lost heiress","heiress to","to a","a Vegas","Vegas casino","casino fortune","fortune has","has been","been found","found ;","; she","she 's","'s a","a truckstop","truckstop waitress","waitress in","in France","The mobsters","mobsters '","' proposition","proposition :",": romance","romance the","the broad","broad ,",", and","and get","get hitched","Or else","Then the","the crooks","crooks can","can bump","bump her","her off","off and","and keep","keep the","the casino","casino for","for themselves","themselves ..."]}

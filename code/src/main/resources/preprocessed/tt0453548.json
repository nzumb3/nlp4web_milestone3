{"title":"Snow Angels","plot":"On a cold afternoon, with snow on the ground, the high school band is practicing for the last football game. They hear shots. Flashback a few weeks before. Arthur is a high school student, bussing at a restaurant. Annie and Barb are waitresses there - Annie was Arthur's babysitter when he was little. She's now separated from her husband Glenn, who's on the wagon, starting a new job, praying to Jesus, and trying to prove he has his balance back so he can see more of their small daughter, Tara. Annie's seeing someone else, Arthur's parents have just separated, and Arthur is attracted to Lila, a new student at the high school. It's a small town, people's lives cross.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["On","a","cold","afternoon",",","with","snow","on","the","ground",",","the","high","school","band","is","practic","for","the","last","footbal","game",".","They","hear","shot",".","Flashback","a","few","week","befor",".","Arthur","is","a","high","school","student",",","buss","at","a","restaur",".","Annie","and","Barb","are","waitress","there","-","Annie","was","Arthur","'s","babysitt","when","he","was","littl",".","She","'s","now","separ","from","her","husband","Glenn",",","who","'s","on","the","wagon",",","start","a","new","job",",","pray","to","Jesus",",","and","tri","to","prove","he","has","his","balanc","back","so","he","can","see","more","of","their","small","daughter",",","Tara",".","Annie","'s","see","someon","els",",","Arthur","'s","parent","have","just","separ",",","and","Arthur","is","attract","to","Lila",",","a","new","student","at","the","high","school",".","It","'s","a","small","town",",","peopl","'s","live","cross","."],"lemmas":["on","a","cold","afternoon",",","with","snow","on","the","ground",",","the","high","school","band","be","practice","for","the","last","football","game",".","they","hear","shot",".","flashback","a","few","week","before",".","Arthur","be","a","high","school","student",",","bus","at","a","restaurant",".","Annie","and","Barb","be","waitress","there","-","annie","be","Arthur","'s","babysitter","when","he","be","little",".","she","be","now","separate","from","she","husband","Glenn",",","who","be","on","the","wagon",",","start","a","new","job",",","pray","to","Jesus",",","and","try","to","prove","he","have","he","balance","back","so","he","can","see","more","of","they","small","daughter",",","Tara",".","Annie","'s","see","someone","else",",","Arthur","'s","parent","have","just","separate",",","and","Arthur","be","attract","to","Lila",",","a","new","student","at","the","high","school",".","it","be","a","small","town",",","people","'s","life","cross","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On a cold","a cold afternoon","cold afternoon ,","afternoon , with",", with snow","with snow on","snow on the","on the ground","the ground ,","ground , the",", the high","the high school","high school band","school band is","band is practicing","is practicing for","practicing for the","for the last","the last football","last football game","They hear shots","Flashback a few","a few weeks","few weeks before","Arthur is a","is a high","a high school","high school student","school student ,","student , bussing",", bussing at","bussing at a","at a restaurant","Annie and Barb","and Barb are","Barb are waitresses","are waitresses there","waitresses there -","there -

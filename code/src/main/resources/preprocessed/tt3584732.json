{"title":"Alik Sukh - A tale of fleeting happiness","plot":"The story is of Doctor Kingshuk Guha a gynaecologist who is out negotiating the purchase of a luxury apartment for himself and his wife Rammani and is unable to attend to an emergency because of a traffic jam. When his women patient Kavita dies after developing complications following a caesarean delivery, her more militant family members hold the doctor responsible and smash up the nursing home. Even Kingshuk's wife believes he is guilty of negligence. Rammani's struggle with her conscience is depicted through her conversations with the dead woman whom she has seen lying abandoned on an operating table. The doctor hires a defence lawyer but is persuaded by pragmatic but amoral medical colleagues to settle out of court. Will Kingshuk ever be able to regain happiness in his life or is happiness just a distant fleeting emotion...?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","stori","is","of","Doctor","Kingshuk","Guha","a","gynaecologist","who","is","out","negoti","the","purchas","of","a","luxuri","apart","for","himself","and","his","wife","Rammani","and","is","unabl","to","attend","to","an","emerg","becaus","of","a","traffic","jam",".","When","his","women","patient","Kavita","die","after","develop","complic","follow","a","caesarean","deliveri",",","her","more","milit","famili","member","hold","the","doctor","respons","and","smash","up","the","nurs","home",".","Even","Kingshuk","'s","wife","believ","he","is","guilti","of","neglig",".","Rammani","'s","struggl","with","her","conscienc","is","depict","through","her","convers","with","the","dead","woman","whom","she","has","seen","lie","abandon","on","an","oper","tabl",".","The","doctor","hire","a","defenc","lawyer","but","is","persuad","by","pragmat","but","amor","medic","colleagu","to","settl","out","of","court",".","Will","Kingshuk","ever","be","abl","to","regain","happi","in","his","life","or","is","happi","just","a","distant","fleet","emot","...","?"],"lemmas":["the","story","be","of","Doctor","Kingshuk","Guha","a","gynaecologist","who","be","out","negotiate","the","purchase","of","a","luxury","apartment","for","himself","and","he","wife","Rammani","and","be","unable","to","attend","to","a","emergency","because","of","a","traffic","jam",".","when","he","woman","patient","Kavita","die","after","develop","complication","follow","a","caesarean","delivery",",","she","more","militant","family","member","hold","the","doctor","responsible","and","smash","up","the","nursing","home",".","even","Kingshuk","'s","wife","believe","he","be","guilty","of","negligence",".","Rammani","'s","struggle","with","she","conscience","be","depict","through","she","conversation","with","the","dead","woman","whom","she","have","see","lie","abandon","on","a","operating","table",".","the","doctor","hire","a","defence","lawyer","but","be","persuade","by","pragmatic","but","amoral","medical","colleague","to","settle","out","of","court",".","Will","Kingshuk","ever","be","able","to","regain","happiness","in","he","life","or","be","happiness","just","a","distant","fleeting","emotion","...","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

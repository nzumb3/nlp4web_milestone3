{"title":"Objectivo Europa","plot":"The old dream of joining Europe led Portugal to trail into a path of democracy and individual liberties, dropping its African colonies and embracing capitalism. The southern Europe country became a member of the European Union in 1986. And, 25 years later, its capital gave name to the Treaty that provided the EU with much needed new muscle. This is a new perspective of building and embracing a new political identity on top of a classic problem of a nation in crisis.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","old","dream","of","join","Europ","led","Portug","to","trail","into","a","path","of","democraci","and","individu","liberti",",","drop","it","African","coloni","and","embrac","capit",".","The","southern","Europ","countri","becam","a","member","of","the","European","Union","in","1986",".","And",",","25","year","later",",","it","capit","gave","name","to","the","Treati","that","provid","the","EU","with","much","need","new","muscl",".","This","is","a","new","perspect","of","build","and","embrac","a","new","polit","ident","on","top","of","a","classic","problem","of","a","nation","in","crisi","."],"lemmas":["the","old","dream","of","join","Europe","lead","Portugal","to","trail","into","a","path","of","democracy","and","individual","liberty",",","drop","its","African","colony","and","embrace","capitalism",".","the","southern","Europe","country","become","a","member","of","the","European","Union","in","1986",".","and",",","25","year","later",",","its","capital","give","name","to","the","Treaty","that","provide","the","EU","with","much","need","new","muscle",".","this","be","a","new","perspective","of","build","and","embrace","a","new","political","identity","on","top","of","a","classic","problem","of","a","nation","in","crisis","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The old dream","old dream of","dream of joining","of joining Europe","joining Europe led","Europe led Portugal","led Portugal to","Portugal to trail","to trail into","trail into a","into a path","a path of","path of democracy","of democracy and","democracy and individual","and individual liberties","individual liberties ,","liberties , dropping",", dropping its","dropping its African","its African colonies","African colonies and","colonies and embracing","and embracing capitalism","The southern Europe","southern Europe country","Europe country became","country became a","became a member","a member of","member of the","of the European","the European Union","European Union in","Union in 1986","And , 25",", 25 years","25 years later","years later ,","later , its",", its capital","its capital gave","capital gave name","gave name to","name to the","to the Treaty","the Treaty that","Treaty that provided","that provided the","provided the EU","the EU with","EU with much","with much needed","much needed new","needed new muscle","This is a","is a new","a new perspective","new perspective of","perspective of building","of building and","building and embracing","and embracing a","embracing a new","a new political","new political identity","political identity on","identity on top","on top of","top of a","of a classic","a classic problem","classic problem of","problem of a","of a nation","a nation in","nation in crisis"],"2grams":["The old","old dream","dream of","of joining","joining Europe","Europe led","led Portugal","Portugal to","to trail","trail into","into a","a path","path of","of democracy","democracy and","and individual","individual liberties","liberties ,",", dropping","dropping its","its African","African colonies","colonies and","and embracing","embracing capitalism","The southern","southern Europe","Europe country","country became","became a","a member","member of","of the","the European","European Union","Union in","in 1986","And ,",", 25","25 years","years later","later ,",", its","its capital","capital gave","gave name","name to","to the","the Treaty","Treaty that","that provided","provided the","the EU","EU with","with much","much needed","needed new","new muscle","This is","is a","a new","new perspective","perspective of","of building","building and","and embracing","embracing a","a new","new political","political identity","identity on","on top","top of","of a","a classic","classic problem","problem of","of a","a nation","nation in","in crisis"]}

{"title":"Francis of Brooklyn","plot":"Pvt. Francis returns from serving in Iraq as a broken alcoholic who has lost all passion for life. An encounter with a fellow veteran, now destitute, initiates a spiritual crisis that leads the young man to renounce his family's wealth and to seek out a more meaningful life among the homeless and rejected on the streets of Brooklyn. Soon a growing fraternity of assorted and eccentric oddballs form around Francis as these modern day friars seek to muddle their way towards enlightenment. A series of funny and often irreverent vignettes, adapted from the true story of St. Francis of Assisi, all illustrating the simplest joys of a life based on humility, faith and compassion.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Pvt.","Franci","return","from","serv","in","Iraq","as","a","broken","alcohol","who","has","lost","all","passion","for","life",".","An","encount","with","a","fellow","veteran",",","now","destitut",",","initi","a","spiritu","crisi","that","lead","the","young","man","to","renounc","his","famili","'s","wealth","and","to","seek","out","a","more","meaning","life","among","the","homeless","and","reject","on","the","street","of","Brooklyn",".","Soon","a","grow","fratern","of","assort","and","eccentr","oddbal","form","around","Franci","as","these","modern","day","friar","seek","to","muddl","their","way","toward","enlighten",".","A","seri","of","funni","and","often","irrever","vignett",",","adapt","from","the","true","stori","of","St.","Franci","of","Assisi",",","all","illustr","the","simplest","joy","of","a","life","base","on","humil",",","faith","and","compass","."],"lemmas":["Pvt.","Francis","return","from","serve","in","Iraq","as","a","broken","alcoholic","who","have","lose","all","passion","for","life",".","a","encounter","with","a","fellow","veteran",",","now","destitute",",","initiate","a","spiritual","crisis","that","lead","the","young","man","to","renounce","he","family","'s","wealth","and","to","seek","out","a","more","meaningful","life","among","the","homeless","and","reject","on","the","street","of","Brooklyn",".","soon","a","grow","fraternity","of","assorted","and","eccentric","oddball","form","around","Francis","as","these","modern","day","friar","seek","to","muddle","they","way","towards","enlightenment",".","a","series","of","funny","and","often","irreverent","vignette",",","adapt","from","the","true","story","of","St.","Francis","of","Assisi",",","all","illustrate","the","simplest","joy","of","a","life","base","on","humility",",","faith","and","compassion","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Pvt.

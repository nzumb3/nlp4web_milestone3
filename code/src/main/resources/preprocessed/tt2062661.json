{"title":"Area 407","plot":"The film opens with two teenagers flying from New York to Los Angeles on New Years Eve. Their nightmare begins when their plane hits extreme turbulence mid-flight. The relentless weather attack causes panic and terror amongst the passengers until the plane ultimately crashes in a remote government-testing area. The handful of survivors from the crash, bloody and disoriented, are then insistently pursued in the darkness by unknown predators that, unbeknownst to them, are part of the government's top-secret Mesa Experiment.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["The","film","open","with","two","teenag","fli","from","New","York","to","Los","Angele","on","New","Year","Eve",".","Their","nightmar","begin","when","their","plane","hit","extrem","turbul","mid-flight",".","The","relentless","weather","attack","caus","panic","and","terror","amongst","the","passeng","until","the","plane","ultim","crash","in","a","remot","government-test","area",".","The","hand","of","survivor","from","the","crash",",","bloodi","and","disori",",","are","then","insist","pursu","in","the","dark","by","unknown","predat","that",",","unbeknownst","to","them",",","are","part","of","the","govern","'s","top-secret","Mesa","Experiment","."],"lemmas":["the","film","open","with","two","teenager","fly","from","New","York","to","Los","Angeles","on","New","year","Eve",".","they","nightmare","begin","when","they","plane","hit","extreme","turbulence","mid-flight",".","the","relentless","weather","attack","cause","panic","and","terror","amongst","the","passenger","until","the","plane","ultimately","crash","in","a","remote","government-testing","area",".","the","handful","of","survivor","from","the","crash",",","bloody","and","disoriented",",","be","then","insistently","pursue","in","the","darkness","by","unknown","predator","that",",","unbeknownst","to","they",",","be","part","of","the","government","'s","top-secret","Mesa","Experiment","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film opens","film opens with","opens with two","with two teenagers","two teenagers flying","teenagers flying from","flying from New","from New York","New York to","York to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles on","Angeles on New","on New Years","New Years Eve","Their nightmare begins","nightmare begins when","begins when their","when their plane","their plane hits","plane hits extreme","hits extreme turbulence","extreme turbulence mid-flight","The relentless weather","relentless weather attack","weather attack causes","attack causes panic","causes panic and","panic and terror","and terror amongst","terror amongst the","amongst the passengers","the passengers until","passengers until the","until the plane","the plane ultimately","plane ultimately crashes","ultimately crashes in","crashes in a","in a remote","a remote government-testing","remote government-testing area","The handful of","handful of survivors","of survivors from","survivors from the","from the crash","the crash ,","crash , bloody",", bloody and","bloody and disoriented","and disoriented ,","disoriented , are",", are then","are then insistently","then insistently pursued","insistently pursued in","pursued in the","in the darkness","the darkness by","darkness by unknown","by unknown predators","unknown predators that","predators that ,","that , unbeknownst",", unbeknownst to","unbeknownst to them","to them ,","them , are",", are part","are part of","part of the","of the government","the government 's","government 's top-secret","'s top-secret Mesa","top-secret Mesa Experiment"],"2grams":["The film","film opens","opens with","with two","two teenagers","teenagers flying","flying from","from New","New York","York to","to Los","Los Angeles","Angeles on","on New","New Years","Years Eve","Their nightmare","nightmare begins","begins when","when their","their plane","plane hits","hits extreme","extreme turbulence","turbulence mid-flight","The relentless","relentless weather","weather attack","attack causes","causes panic","panic and","and terror","terror amongst","amongst the","the passengers","passengers until","until the","the plane","plane ultimately","ultimately crashes","crashes in","in a","a remote","remote government-testing","government-testing area","The handful","handful of","of survivors","survivors from","from the","the crash","crash ,",", bloody","bloody and","and disoriented","disoriented ,",", are","are then","then insistently","insistently pursued","pursued in","in the","the darkness","darkness by","by unknown","unknown predators","predators that","that ,",", unbeknownst","unbeknownst to","to them","them ,",", are","are part","part of","of the","the government","government 's","'s top-secret","top-secret Mesa","Mesa Experiment"]}

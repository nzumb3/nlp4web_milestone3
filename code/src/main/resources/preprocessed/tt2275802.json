{"title":"Satyagraha","plot":"Satyagraha is the story of a son who yearns for a father. Of a father, who grieves for his lost son. Of a young woman who fights so hard with life that she has forgotten to love. Of an ambitious rabble-rouser, for whom action is the knee-jerk mantra. It is the story of how these four discover one another, and come together to raise hell, shaking the powers that be to their very roots! But, Satyagraha is also the story of an influential power-hungry despot who will stop at nothing to destroy them. Satyagraha: The revolution has begun!","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Satyagraha","is","the","stori","of","a","son","who","yearn","for","a","father",".","Of","a","father",",","who","griev","for","his","lost","son",".","Of","a","young","woman","who","fight","so","hard","with","life","that","she","has","forgotten","to","love",".","Of","an","ambiti","rabble-rous",",","for","whom","action","is","the","knee-jerk","mantra",".","It","is","the","stori","of","how","these","four","discov","one","anoth",",","and","come","togeth","to","rais","hell",",","shake","the","power","that","be","to","their","veri","root","!","But",",","Satyagraha","is","also","the","stori","of","an","influenti","power-hungri","despot","who","will","stop","at","noth","to","destroy","them",".","Satyagraha",":","The","revolut","has","begun","!"],"lemmas":["Satyagraha","be","the","story","of","a","son","who","yearn","for","a","father",".","of","a","father",",","who","grieve","for","he","lost","son",".","of","a","young","woman","who","fight","so","hard","with","life","that","she","have","forget","to","love",".","of","a","ambitious","rabble-rouser",",","for","whom","action","be","the","knee-jerk","mantra",".","it","be","the","story","of","how","these","four","discover","one","another",",","and","come","together","to","raise","hell",",","shake","the","power","that","be","to","they","very","root","!","but",",","Satyagraha","be","also","the","story","of","a","influential","power-hungry","despot","who","will","stop","at","nothing","to","destroy","they",".","Satyagraha",":","the","revolution","have","begin","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Satyagraha is the","is the story","the story of","story of a","of a son","a son who","son who yearns","who yearns for","yearns for a","for a father","Of a father","a father ,","father , who",", who grieves","who grieves for","grieves for his","for his lost","his lost son","Of a young","a young woman","young woman who","woman who fights","who fights so","fights so hard","so hard with","hard with life","with life that","life that she","that she has","she has forgotten","has forgotten to","forgotten to love","Of an ambitious","an ambitious rabble-rouser","ambitious rabble-rouser ,","rabble-rouser , for",", for whom","for whom action","whom action is","action is the","is the knee-jerk","the knee-jerk mantra","It is the","is the story","the story of","story of how","of how these","how these four","these four discover","four discover one","discover one another","one another ,","another , and",", and come","and come together","come together to","together to raise","to raise hell","raise hell ,","hell , shaking",", shaking the","shaking the powers","the powers that","powers that be","that be to","be to their","to their very","their very roots","But , Satyagraha",", Satyagraha is","Satyagraha is also","is also the","also the story","the story of","story of an","of an influential","an influential power-hungry","influential power-hungry despot","power-hungry despot who","despot who will","who will stop","will stop at","stop at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to destroy","to destroy them","Satyagraha : The",": The revolution","The revolution has","revolution has begun"],"2grams":["Satyagraha is","is the","the story","story of","of a","a son","son who","who yearns","yearns for","for a","a father","Of a","a father","father ,",", who","who grieves","grieves for","for his","his lost","lost son","Of a","a young","young woman","woman who","who fights","fights so","so hard","hard with","with life","life that","that she","she has","has forgotten","forgotten to","to love","Of an","an ambitious","ambitious rabble-rouser","rabble-rouser ,",", for","for whom","whom action","action is","is the","the knee-jerk","knee-jerk mantra","It is","is the","the story","story of","of how","how these","these four","four discover","discover one","one another","another ,",", and","and come","come together","together to","to raise","raise hell","hell ,",", shaking","shaking the","the powers","powers that","that be","be to","to their","their very","very roots","But ,",", Satyagraha","Satyagraha is","is also","also the","the story","story of","of an","an influential","influential power-hungry","power-hungry despot","despot who","who will","will stop","stop at","at nothing","nothing to","to destroy","destroy them","Satyagraha :",": The","The revolution","revolution has","has begun"]}

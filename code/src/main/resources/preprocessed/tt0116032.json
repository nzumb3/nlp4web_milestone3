{"title":"Darkdrive","plot":"In the near future, a new law has criminals sent to a virtual reality world as their prison, built by a shadowy corporation called Zircon based in Seattle. The designer of the system, Steven Falcon, realizes the danger of it being overloaded and of hackers who try to break in and steal files only to have the prisoners try to break out via that method. When Falcon threatens to quit the operation, he becomes marked for murder by his employers who force him to enter the Matrix virtual reality/afterlife to find the source of the danger of the system crashing.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["In","the","near","futur",",","a","new","law","has","crimin","sent","to","a","virtual","realiti","world","as","their","prison",",","built","by","a","shadowi","corpor","call","Zircon","base","in","Seattl",".","The","design","of","the","system",",","Steven","Falcon",",","realiz","the","danger","of","it","be","overload","and","of","hacker","who","tri","to","break","in","and","steal","file","onli","to","have","the","prison","tri","to","break","out","via","that","method",".","When","Falcon","threaten","to","quit","the","oper",",","he","becom","mark","for","murder","by","his","employ","who","forc","him","to","enter","the","Matrix","virtual","reality/afterlif","to","find","the","sourc","of","the","danger","of","the","system","crash","."],"lemmas":["in","the","near","future",",","a","new","law","have","criminal","send","to","a","virtual","reality","world","as","they","prison",",","build","by","a","shadowy","corporation","call","Zircon","base","in","Seattle",".","the","designer","of","the","system",",","Steven","Falcon",",","realize","the","danger","of","it","be","overload","and","of","hacker","who","try","to","break","in","and","steal","file","only","to","have","the","prisoner","try","to","break","out","via","that","method",".","when","Falcon","threaten","to","quit","the","operation",",","he","become","marked","for","murder","by","he","employer","who","force","he","to","enter","the","Matrix","virtual","reality/afterlife","to","find","the","source","of","the","danger","of","the","system","crash","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In the near","the near future","near future ,","future , a",", a new","a new law","new law has","law has criminals","has criminals sent","criminals sent to","sent to a","to a virtual","a virtual reality","virtual reality world","reality world as","world as their","as their prison","their prison ,","prison , built",", built by","built by a","by a shadowy","a shadowy corporation","shadowy corporation called","corporation called Zircon","called Zircon based","Zircon based in","based in Seattle","The designer of","designer of the","of the system","the system ,","system , Steven",", Steven Falcon","Steven Falcon ,","Falcon , realizes",", realizes the","realizes the danger","the danger of","danger of it","of it being","it being overloaded","being overloaded and","overloaded and of","and of hackers","of hackers who","hackers who try","who try to","try to break","to break in","break in and","in and steal","and steal files","steal files only","files only to","only to have","to have the","have the prisoners","the prisoners try","prisoners try to","try to break","to break out","break out via","out via that","via that method","When Falcon threatens","Falcon threatens to","threatens to quit","to quit the","quit the operation","the operation ,","operation , he",", he becomes","he becomes marked","becomes marked for","marked for murder","for murder by","murder by his","by his employers","his employers who","employers who force","who force him","force him to","him to enter","to enter the","enter the Matrix","the Matrix virtual","Matrix virtual reality/afterlife","virtual reality/afterlife to","reality/afterlife to find","to find the","find the source","the source of","source of the","of the danger","the danger of","danger of the","of the system","the system crashing"],"2grams":["In the","the near","near future","future ,",", a","a new","new law","law has","has criminals","criminals sent","sent to","to a","a virtual","virtual reality","reality world","world as","as their","their prison","prison ,",", built","built by","by a","a shadowy","shadowy corporation","corporation called","called Zircon","Zircon based","based in","in Seattle","The designer","designer of","of the","the system","system ,",", Steven","Steven Falcon","Falcon ,",", realizes","realizes the","the danger","danger of","of it","it being","being overloaded","overloaded and","and of","of hackers","hackers who","who try","try to","to break","break in","in and","and steal","steal files","files only","only to","to have","have the","the prisoners","prisoners try","try to","to break","break out","out via","via that","that method","When Falcon","Falcon threatens","threatens to","to quit","quit the","the operation","operation ,",", he","he becomes","becomes marked","marked for","for murder","murder by","by his","his employers","employers who","who force","force him","him to","to enter","enter the","the Matrix","Matrix virtual","virtual reality/afterlife","reality/afterlife to","to find","find the","the source","source of","of the","the danger","danger of","of the","the system","system crashing"]}

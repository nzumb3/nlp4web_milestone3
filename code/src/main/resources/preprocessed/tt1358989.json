{"title":"The Little Wizard: Guardian of the Magic Crystals","plot":"Once upon a time a guardian was chosen to watch over all living things. She was called The Magistical. Hoping to preserve all precious life, The Magistical created a spell. This spell granted the last of every type of creature, immortality. However, to one very evil Draken, the spell would carry a very different meaning than intended. By killing all other Drakens, she would become the last. Without fear of death, such a beast could rule the world. Now only one baby cub stands between her and her evil ambitions. And between them stands a small, but determined obstacle, named Foible.","genres":["Animation"," Family"],"stems":["Once","upon","a","time","a","guardian","was","chosen","to","watch","over","all","live","thing",".","She","was","call","The","Magist",".","Hope","to","preserv","all","precious","life",",","The","Magist","creat","a","spell",".","This","spell","grant","the","last","of","everi","type","of","creatur",",","immort",".","Howev",",","to","one","veri","evil","Draken",",","the","spell","would","carri","a","veri","differ","mean","than","intend",".","By","kill","all","other","Draken",",","she","would","becom","the","last",".","Without","fear","of","death",",","such","a","beast","could","rule","the","world",".","Now","onli","one","babi","cub","stand","between","her","and","her","evil","ambit",".","And","between","them","stand","a","small",",","but","determin","obstacl",",","name","Foibl","."],"lemmas":["once","upon","a","time","a","guardian","be","choose","to","watch","over","all","live","thing",".","she","be","call","The","Magistical",".","hope","to","preserve","all","precious","life",",","the","Magistical","create","a","spell",".","this","spell","grant","the","last","of","every","type","of","creature",",","immortality",".","however",",","to","one","very","evil","Draken",",","the","spell","would","carry","a","very","different","meaning","than","intend",".","by","kill","all","other","draken",",","she","would","become","the","last",".","without","fear","of","death",",","such","a","beast","could","rule","the","world",".","now","only","one","baby","cub","stand","between","she","and","she","evil","ambition",".","and","between","they","stand","a","small",",","but","determine","obstacle",",","name","Foible","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Once upon a","upon a time","a time a","time a guardian","a guardian was","guardian was chosen","was chosen to","chosen to watch","to watch over","watch over all","over all living","all living things","She was called","was called The","called The Magistical","Hoping to preserve","to preserve all","preserve all precious","all precious life","precious life ,","life , The",", The Magistical","The Magistical created","Magistical created a","created a spell","This spell granted","spell granted the","granted the last","the last of","last of every","of every type","every type of","type of creature","of creature ,","creature , immortality","However , to",", to one","to one very","one very evil","very evil Draken","evil Draken ,","Draken , the",", the spell","the spell would","spell would carry","would carry a","carry a very","a very different","very different meaning","different meaning than","meaning than intended","By killing all","killing all other","all other Drakens","other Drakens ,","Drakens , she",", she would","she would become","would become the","become the last","Without fear of","fear of death","of death ,","death , such",", such a","such a beast","a beast could","beast could rule","could rule the","rule the world","Now only one","only one baby","one baby cub","baby cub stands","cub stands between","stands between her","between her and","her and her","and her evil","her evil ambitions","And between them","between them stands","them stands a","stands a small","a small ,","small , but",", but determined","but determined obstacle","determined obstacle ,","obstacle , named",", named Foible"],"2grams":["Once upon","upon a","a time","time a","a guardian","guardian was","was chosen","chosen to","to watch","watch over","over all","all living","living things","She was","was called","called The","The Magistical","Hoping to","to preserve","preserve all","all precious","precious life","life ,",", The","The Magistical","Magistical created","created a","a spell","This spell","spell granted","granted the","the last","last of","of every","every type","type of","of creature","creature ,",", immortality","However ,",", to","to one","one very","very evil","evil Draken","Draken ,",", the","the spell","spell would","would carry","carry a","a very","very different","different meaning","meaning than","than intended","By killing","killing all","all other","other Drakens","Drakens ,",", she","she would","would become","become the","the last","Without fear","fear of","of death","death ,",", such","such a","a beast","beast could","could rule","rule the","the world","Now only","only one","one baby","baby cub","cub stands","stands between","between her","her and","and her","her evil","evil ambitions","And between","between them","them stands","stands a","a small","small ,",", but","but determined","determined obstacle","obstacle ,",", named","named Foible"]}

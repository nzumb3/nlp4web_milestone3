{"title":"Morgan","plot":"Morgan comes home after a tragic accident in a bikers race leaves him paraplegic, binding him to wheelchair use for the rest of his life. He tries to stay positive, not letting the accident end his life, but deep-rooted feelings of uselessness make him rather wish he were dead. Rolling out for beer, he meets Dean, and the two strike up a friendship that quickly develops into a romantic connection. Morgan wants to participate in the biking race in the handicap category, more so because of his competitive nature than to prove his ability. Everyone is against it, even Dean, leading to differences between the two. Finally, he realizes that he's at fault and makes peace with himself.","genres":["Drama","

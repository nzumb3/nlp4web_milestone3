{"title":"Echoes of the Holocaust","plot":"To the survivors who frequent it, this is holy ground . . . a Jewish cemetery for the countless souls who perished during the Holocaust, and for whom no grave stone, burial marker, or final resting place exists. The true power of the Holocaust Memorial of Miami Beach can be witnessed when survivors - serving as docents or guides - begin gathering to tell their stories of survival to school children, tourists and visitor groups from across the globe. In 2006, the Memorial's leaders embarked on a mission to preserve some of the survivors' tours on film, so that the echoes of their words live on. With each passing year, there are fewer survivors left. Echoes of the Holocaust captures four of the Memorial's remaining survivors.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["To","the","survivor","who","frequent","it",",","this","is","holi","ground",". . .","a","Jewish","cemeteri","for","the","countless","soul","who","perish","dure","the","Holocaust",",","and","for","whom","no","grave","stone",",","burial","marker",",","or","final","rest","place","exist",".","The","true","power","of","the","Holocaust","Memori","of","Miami","Beach","can","be","wit","when","survivor","-","serv","as","docent","or","guid","-","begin","gather","to","tell","their","stori","of","surviv","to","school","children",",","tourist","and","visitor","group","from","across","the","globe",".","In","2006",",","the","Memori","'s","leader","embark","on","a","mission","to","preserv","some","of","the","survivor","'","tour","on","film",",","so","that","the","echo","of","their","word","live","on",".","With","each","pass","year",",","there","are","fewer","survivor","left",".","Echoe","of","the","Holocaust","captur","four","of","the","Memori","'s","remain","survivor","."],"lemmas":["to","the","survivor","who","frequent","it",",","this","be","holy","ground",". . .","a","jewish","cemetery","for","the","countless","soul","who","perish","during","the","Holocaust",",","and","for","whom","no","grave","stone",",","burial","marker",",","or","final","rest","place","exist",".","the","true","power","of","the","Holocaust","Memorial","of","Miami","Beach","can","be","witness","when","survivor","-","serve","as","docent","or","guide","-","begin","gather","to","tell","they","story","of","survival","to","school","child",",","tourist","and","visitor","group","from","across","the","globe",".","in","2006",",","the","Memorial","'s","leader","embark","on","a","mission","to","preserve","some","of","the","survivor","'","tour","on","film",",","so","that","the","echo","of","they","word","live","on",".","with","each","pass","year",",","there","be","fewer","survivor","leave",".","echo","of","the","Holocaust","capture","four","of","the","Memorial","'s","remain","survivor","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["To the survivors","the survivors who","survivors who frequent","who frequent it","frequent it ,","it , this",", this is","this is holy","is holy ground",". . .","a Jewish cemetery","Jewish cemetery for","cemetery for the","for the countless","the countless souls","countless souls who","souls who perished","who perished during","perished during the","during the Holocaust","the Holocaust ,","Holocaust , and",", and for","and for whom","for whom no","whom no grave","no grave stone","grave stone ,","stone , burial",", burial marker","burial marker ,","marker , or",", or final","or final resting","final resting place","resting place exists","The true power","true power of","power of the","of the Holocaust","the Holocaust Memorial","Holocaust Memorial of","Memorial of Miami","of Miami Beach","Miami Beach can","Beach can be","can be witnessed","be witnessed when","witnessed when survivors","when survivors -","survivors -

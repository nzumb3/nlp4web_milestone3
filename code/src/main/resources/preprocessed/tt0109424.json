{"title":"Chungking Express","plot":"Wong Kar-Wai's movie about two love-struck cops is filmed in impressionistic splashes of motion and color. The first half deals with Cop 223, who has broken up with his girlfriend of five years. He purchases a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of May 1 each day for a month. By the end of that time, he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it too will have expired forever. The second half shows Cop 663 dealing with his breakup with his flight attendant girlfriend. He talks to his apartment furnishings until he meets a new girl at a local lunch counter.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Wong","Kar-Wai","'s","movi","about","two","love-struck","cop","is","film","in","impressionist","splash","of","motion","and","color",".","The","first","half","deal","with","Cop","223",",","who","has","broken","up","with","his","girlfriend","of","five","year",".","He","purchas","a","tin","of","pineappl","with","an","expir","date","of","May","1","each","day","for","a","month",".","By","the","end","of","that","time",",","he","feel","that","he","will","either","be","rejoin","with","his","love","or","that","it","too","will","have","expir","forev",".","The","second","half","show","Cop","663","deal","with","his","breakup","with","his","flight","attend","girlfriend",".","He","talk","to","his","apart","furnish","until","he","meet","a","new","girl","at","a","local","lunch","counter","."],"lemmas":["Wong","Kar-Wai","'s","movie","about","two","love-struck","cop","be","film","in","impressionistic","splash","of","motion","and","color",".","the","first","half","deal","with","cop","223",",","who","have","break","up","with","he","girlfriend","of","five","year",".","he","purchase","a","tin","of","pineapple","with","a","expiration","date","of","May","1","each","day","for","a","month",".","by","the","end","of","that","time",",","he","feel","that","he","will","either","be","rejoin","with","he","love","or","that","it","too","will","have","expire","forever",".","the","second","half","show","cop","663","deal","with","he","breakup","with","he","flight","attendant","girlfriend",".","he","talk","to","he","apartment","furnishings","until","he","meet","a","new","girl","at","a","local","lunch","counter","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Wong Kar-Wai 's","Kar-Wai 's movie","'s movie about","movie about two","about two love-struck","two love-struck cops","love-struck cops is","cops is filmed","is filmed in","filmed in impressionistic","in impressionistic splashes","impressionistic splashes of","splashes of motion","of motion and","motion and color","The first half","first half deals","half deals with","deals with Cop","with Cop 223","Cop 223 ,","223 , who",", who has","who has broken","has broken up","broken up with","up with his","with his girlfriend","his girlfriend of","girlfriend of five","of five years","He purchases a","purchases a tin","a tin of","tin of pineapples","of pineapples with","pineapples with an","with an expiration","an expiration date","expiration date of","date of May","of May 1","May 1 each","1 each day","each day for","day for a","for a month","By the end","the end of","end of that","of that time","that time ,","time , he",", he feels","he feels that","feels that he","that he will","he will either","will either be","either be rejoined","be rejoined with","rejoined with his","with his love","his love or","love or that","or that it","that it too","it too will","too will have","will have expired","have expired forever","The second half","second half shows","half shows Cop","shows Cop 663","Cop 663 dealing","663 dealing with","dealing with his","with his breakup","his breakup with","breakup with his","with his flight","his flight attendant","flight attendant girlfriend","He talks to","talks to his","to his apartment","his apartment furnishings","apartment furnishings until","furnishings until he","until he meets","he meets a","meets a new","a new girl","new girl at","girl at a","at a local","a local lunch","local lunch counter"],"2grams":["Wong Kar-Wai","Kar-Wai 's","'s movie","movie about","about two","two love-struck","love-struck cops","cops is","is filmed","filmed in","in impressionistic","impressionistic splashes","splashes of","of motion","motion and","and color","The first","first half","half deals","deals with","with Cop","Cop 223","223 ,",", who","who has","has broken","broken up","up with","with his","his girlfriend","girlfriend of","of five","five years","He purchases","purchases a","a tin","tin of","of pineapples","pineapples with","with an","an expiration","expiration date","date of","of May","May 1","1 each","each day","day for","for a","a month","By the","the end","end of","of that","that time","time ,",", he","he feels","feels that","that he","he will","will either","either be","be rejoined","rejoined with","with his","his love","love or","or that","that it","it too","too will","will have","have expired","expired forever","The second","second half","half shows","shows Cop","Cop 663","663 dealing","dealing with","with his","his breakup","breakup with","with his","his flight","flight attendant","attendant girlfriend","He talks","talks to","to his","his apartment","apartment furnishings","furnishings until","until he","he meets","meets a","a new","new girl","girl at","at a","a local","local lunch","lunch counter"]}

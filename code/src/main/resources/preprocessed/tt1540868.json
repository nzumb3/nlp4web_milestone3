{"title":"El Medico: The Cubaton Story","plot":"Two men struggle in Cuba. El Medico, a young Cuban doctor and musician, is trying to get a better life for his family. Michel, a European music producer, wants fame and fortune. It is a fight between two minds; One sees the music as an authentic expression of Cuban culture and history, the other sees it as a commercial product to be sold by any means necessary. Caught in this clash of views is also Coquita, the young dancer whose dreams are ruined because Michel thinks she is not sexy enough, and El Medico's Mother who thinks her son is betraying the revolutionary ideals that she suffered for. El Medico realizes that being Michel's product is not his dream, but he has to decide between doing his duty to the State, as a doctor fulfilling his mothers dream, or being an artist.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","men","struggl","in","Cuba",".","El","Medico",",","a","young","Cuban","doctor","and","musician",",","is","tri","to","get","a","better","life","for","his","famili",".","Michel",",","a","European","music","produc",",","want","fame","and","fortun",".","It","is","a","fight","between","two","mind",";","One","see","the","music","as","an","authent","express","of","Cuban","cultur","and","histori",",","the","other","see","it","as","a","commerci","product","to","be","sold","by","ani","mean","necessari",".","Caught","in","this","clash","of","view","is","also","Coquita",",","the","young","dancer","whose","dream","are","ruin","becaus","Michel","think","she","is","not","sexi","enough",",","and","El","Medico","'s","Mother","who","think","her","son","is","betray","the","revolutionari","ideal","that","she","suffer","for",".","El","Medico","realiz","that","be","Michel","'s","product","is","not","his","dream",",","but","he","has","to","decid","between","do","his","duti","to","the","State",",","as","a","doctor","fulfil","his","mother","dream",",","or","be","an","artist","."],"lemmas":["two","man","struggle","in","Cuba",".","El","Medico",",","a","young","Cuban","doctor","and","musician",",","be","try","to","get","a","better","life","for","he","family",".","Michel",",","a","european","music","producer",",","want","fame","and","fortune",".","it","be","a","fight","between","two","mind",";","one","see","the","music","as","a","authentic","expression","of","cuban","culture","and","history",",","the","other","see","it","as","a","commercial","product","to","be","sell","by","any","means","necessary",".","catch","in","this","clash","of","view","be","also","Coquita",",","the","young","dancer","whose","dream","be","ruin","because","Michel","think","she","be","not","sexy","enough",",","and","El","Medico","'s","Mother","who","think","she","son","be","betray","the","revolutionary","ideal","that","she","suffer","for",".","El","Medico","realize","that","be","Michel","'s","product","be","not","he","dream",",","but","he","have","to","decide","between","do","he","duty","to","the","State",",","as","a","doctor","fulfil","he","mother","dream",",","or","be","a","artist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two men struggle","men struggle in","struggle in Cuba","El Medico ,","Medico , a",", a young","a young Cuban","young Cuban doctor","Cuban doctor and","doctor and musician","and musician ,","musician , is",", is trying","is trying to","trying to get","to get a","get a better","a better life","better life for","life for his","for his family","Michel , a",", a European","a European music","European music producer","music producer ,","producer , wants",", wants fame","wants fame and","fame and fortune","It is a","is a fight","a fight between","fight between two","between two minds","two minds ;","minds ;

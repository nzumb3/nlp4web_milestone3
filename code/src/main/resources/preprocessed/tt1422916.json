{"title":"One Hit from Home","plot":"Baseball superstar Jimmy Easton returns home after a devastating knee injury cuts short his promising career. In search of a new purpose for his life, Jimmy faces dark memories from his past as he tries to make peace with a world he once left behind. His life takes a transforming turn when he is involuntarily thrust back into the world of baseball - not as a player, but as the coach of an underachieving college team struggling to rise above mediocrity. Coach Jimmy's rocky relationship with Brandon Elliott, the team's only star, forces both of them to deal with their similarly checkered pasts. One Hit From Home is a unique sports drama that explores the unpredictability of life and reminds us that we can find hope in the midst of broken dreams.","genres":["Drama"," Sport"," Family"],"stems":["Basebal","superstar","Jimmi","Easton","return","home","after","a","devast","knee","injuri","cut","short","his","promis","career",".","In","search","of","a","new","purpos","for","his","life",",","Jimmi","face","dark","memori","from","his","past","as","he","tri","to","make","peac","with","a","world","he","onc","left","behind",".","His","life","take","a","transform","turn","when","he","is","involuntarili","thrust","back","into","the","world","of","basebal","-","not","as","a","player",",","but","as","the","coach","of","an","underachiev","colleg","team","struggl","to","rise","abov","mediocr",".","Coach","Jimmi","'s","rocki","relationship","with","Brandon","Elliott",",","the","team","'s","onli","star",",","forc","both","of","them","to","deal","with","their","similar","checker","past",".","One","Hit","From","Home","is","a","uniqu","sport","drama","that","explor","the","unpredict","of","life","and","remind","us","that","we","can","find","hope","in","the","midst","of","broken","dream","."],"lemmas":["baseball","superstar","Jimmy","Easton","return","home","after","a","devastating","knee","injury","cut","short","he","promising","career",".","in","search","of","a","new","purpose","for","he","life",",","Jimmy","face","dark","memory","from","he","past","as","he","try","to","make","peace","with","a","world","he","once","leave","behind",".","he","life","take","a","transform","turn","when","he","be","involuntarily","thrust","back","into","the","world","of","baseball","-","not","as","a","player",",","but","as","the","coach","of","a","underachieving","college","team","struggle","to","rise","above","mediocrity",".","coach","Jimmy","'s","rocky","relationship","with","Brandon","Elliott",",","the","team","'s","only","star",",","force","both","of","they","to","deal","with","they","similarly","checkered","past",".","one","hit","from","Home","be","a","unique","sport","drama","that","explore","the","unpredictability","of","life","and","remind","we","that","we","can","find","hope","in","the","midst","of","broken","dream","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Baseball superstar Jimmy","superstar Jimmy Easton","Jimmy Easton returns","Easton returns home","returns home after","home after a","after a devastating","a devastating knee","devastating knee injury","knee injury cuts","injury cuts short","cuts short his","short his promising","his promising career","In search of","search of a","of a new","a new purpose","new purpose for","purpose for his","for his life","his life ,","life , Jimmy",", Jimmy faces","Jimmy faces dark","faces dark memories","dark memories from","memories from his","from his past","his past as","past as he","as he tries","he tries to","tries to make","to make peace","make peace with","peace with a","with a world","a world he","world he once","he once left","once left behind","His life takes","life takes a","takes a transforming","a transforming turn","transforming turn when","turn when he","when he is","he is involuntarily","is involuntarily thrust","involuntarily thrust back","thrust back into","back into the","into the world","the world of","world of baseball","of baseball -","baseball -

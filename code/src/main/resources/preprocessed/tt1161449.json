{"title":"The Sanctuary","plot":"In 1897, the \"Poisoned Knife\" clan broke into the royal palace of Thailand to steal the Royal Antiques, but the thieves didn't escape with their lives. Before their deaths, they hid the antiques somewhere close to the palace.Today, Wisa (Winston Omega), the mafia boss whose ancestors masterminded the theft of the antiques wants to find them. He hires Patrick (Russell Wong - Romeo Must Die, Mummy 3: Tomb Of The Dragon Emperor), the former Director of the U.S. military National Subterranean Exploration Unit, to search for the lost antiques. Patrick and Selina (Patharawarin Timkul - Bangkok Dangerous) the beautiful and sexy assassin, retrieve the antiques from beneath the Thai temple where Krit (Mike B - Brave, Ong Bak), a gifted martial artist, resides as a temple boy. When they steal the antiques from the temple, it's down to Krit with the help of Praifa (Intira Charoenpura - Nang Nak, Brokedown Palace, King Naresuan Trilogy), an Archaeology student, to retrieve them. Together they fight against the powerful and greedy group of thugs. Will they be able to rescue Thailand's national treasure and protect the world from evil?","genres":["Action"],"stems":["In","1897",",","the","\"","Poison","Knife","\"","clan","broke","into","the","royal","palac","of","Thailand","to","steal","the","Royal","Antiqu",",","but","the","thiev","did","n't","escap","with","their","live",".","Befor","their","death",",","they","hid","the","antiqu","somewher","close","to","the","palace.Today",",","Wisa","(","Winston","Omega",")",",","the","mafia","boss","whose","ancestor","mastermind","the","theft","of","the","antiqu","want","to","find","them",".","He","hire","Patrick","(","Russel","Wong","-","Romeo","Must","Die",",","Mummi","3",":","Tomb","Of","The","Dragon","Emperor",")",",","the","former","Director","of","the","U.S.","militari","Nation","Subterranean","Explorat","Unit",",","to","search","for","the","lost","antiqu",".","Patrick","and","Selina","(","Patharawarin","Timkul","-","Bangkok","Danger",")","the","beauti","and","sexi","assassin",",","retriev","the","antiqu","from","beneath","the","Thai","templ","where","Krit","(","Mike","B","-","Brave",",","Ong","Bak",")",",","a","gift","martial","artist",",","resid","as","a","templ","boy",".","When","they","steal","the","antiqu","from","the","templ",",","it","'s","down","to","Krit","with","the","help","of","Praifa","(","Intira","Charoenpura","-","Nang","Nak",",","Brokedown","Palac",",","King","Naresuan","Trilog",")",",","an","Archaeolog","student",",","to","retriev","them",".","Togeth","they","fight","against","the","power","and","greedi","group","of","thug",".","Will","they","be","abl","to","rescu","Thailand","'s","nation","treasur","and","protect","the","world","from","evil","?"],"lemmas":["in","1897",",","the","``","Poisoned","Knife","''","clan","break","into","the","royal","palace","of","Thailand","to","steal","the","Royal","Antiques",",","but","the","thief","do","not","escape","with","they","life",".","before","they","death",",","they","hide","the","antique","somewhere","close","to","the","palace.today",",","Wisa","-lrb-","Winston","Omega","-rrb-",",","the","mafia","boss","whose","ancestor","mastermind","the","theft","of","the","antique","want","to","find","they",".","he","hire","Patrick","-lrb-","Russell","Wong","-","Romeo","must","die",",","Mummy","3",":","tomb","of","the","Dragon","Emperor","-rrb-",",","the","former","Director","of","the","U.S.","military","National","Subterranean","Exploration","Unit",",","to","search","for","the","lost","antique",".","Patrick","and","Selina","-lrb-","Patharawarin","Timkul","-","Bangkok","Dangerous","-rrb-","the","beautiful","and","sexy","assassin",",","retrieve","the","antique","from","beneath","the","Thai","temple","where","Krit","-lrb-","Mike","B","-","Brave",",","Ong","bak","-rrb-",",","a","gifted","martial","artist",",","reside","as","a","temple","boy",".","when","they","steal","the","antique","from","the","temple",",","it","be","down","to","Krit","with","the","help","of","Praifa","-lrb-","Intira","Charoenpura","-","Nang","Nak",",","Brokedown","Palace",",","King","Naresuan","Trilogy","-rrb-",",","a","Archaeology","student",",","to","retrieve","they",".","together","they","fight","against","the","powerful","and","greedy","group","of","thug",".","will","they","be","able","to","rescue","Thailand","'s","national","treasure","and","protect","the","world","from","evil","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1897 ,","1897 , the",", the \"","the \" Poisoned","\" Poisoned Knife","Poisoned Knife \"","Knife \" clan","\" clan broke","clan broke into","broke into the","into the royal","the royal palace","royal palace of","palace of Thailand","of Thailand to","Thailand to steal","to steal the","steal the Royal","the Royal Antiques","Royal Antiques ,","Antiques , but",", but the","but the thieves","the thieves did","thieves did n't","did n't escape","n't escape with","escape with their","with their lives","Before their deaths","their deaths ,","deaths , they",", they hid","they hid the","hid the antiques","the antiques somewhere","antiques somewhere close","somewhere close to","close to the","to the palace.Today","the palace.Today ,","palace.Today , Wisa",", Wisa (","Wisa ( Winston","( Winston Omega","Winston Omega )","Omega ) ,",") , the",", the mafia","the mafia boss","mafia boss whose","boss whose ancestors","whose ancestors masterminded","ancestors masterminded the","masterminded the theft","the theft of","theft of the","of the antiques","the antiques wants","antiques wants to","wants to find","to find them","He hires Patrick","hires Patrick (","Patrick ( Russell","( Russell Wong","Russell Wong -","Wong -

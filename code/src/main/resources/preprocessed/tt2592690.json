Mary's life was plagued by alcoholism, abusive husbands, failed suicide attempts, and deteriorating health - but somehow through it all, she managed to keep her sense of humor and took life in stride. This documentary was filmed ten years ago by her grandson, Brennan Howard, and was just recently completed.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Mari","'","chronicl","the","final","month","in","the","life","of","Mari","Evan",",","a","former","1950s","American","débutant","and","downtown","Los","Angele","barfli",".","Mari","'s","life","was","plagu","by","alcohol",",","abus","husband",",","fail","suicid","attempt",",","and","deterior","health","-","but","somehow","through","it","all",",","she","manag","to","keep","her","sens","of","humor","and","took","life","in","stride",".","This","documentari","was","film","ten","year","ago","by","her","grandson",",","Brennan","Howard",",","and","was","just","recent","complet","."],"lemmas":["'","Mary","'","chronicle","the","final","month","in","the","life","of","Mary","Evans",",","a","former","1950s","american","débutante","and","downtown","Los","Angeles","barfly",".","Mary","'s","life","be","plague","by","alcoholism",",","abusive","husband",",","fail","suicide","attempt",",","and","deteriorate","health","-","but","somehow","through","it","all",",","she","manage","to","keep","she","sense","of","humor","and","take","life","in","stride",".","this","documentary","be","film","ten","year","ago","by","she","grandson",",","Brennan","Howard",",","and","be","just","recently","complete","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["' Mary '","Mary ' chronicles","' chronicles the","chronicles the final","the final months","final months in","months in the","in the life","the life of","life of Mary","of Mary Evans","Mary Evans ,","Evans , a",", a former","a former 1950s","former 1950s American","1950s American débutante","American débutante and","débutante and downtown","and downtown Los","downtown Los Angeles","Los Angeles barfly","Mary 's life","'s life was","life was plagued","was plagued by","plagued by alcoholism","by alcoholism ,","alcoholism , abusive",", abusive husbands","abusive husbands ,","husbands , failed",", failed suicide","failed suicide attempts","suicide attempts ,","attempts , and",", and deteriorating","and deteriorating health","deteriorating health -","health - but","- but somehow","but somehow through","somehow through it","through it all","it all ,","all , she",", she managed","she managed to","managed to keep","to keep her","keep her sense","her sense of","sense of humor","of humor and","humor and took","and took life","took life in","life in stride","This documentary was","documentary was filmed","was filmed ten","filmed ten years","ten years ago","years ago by","ago by her","by her grandson","her grandson ,","grandson , Brennan",", Brennan Howard","Brennan Howard ,","Howard , and",", and was","and was just","was just recently","just recently completed"],"2grams":["' Mary","Mary '","' chronicles","chronicles the","the final","final months","months in","in the","the life","life of","of Mary","Mary Evans","Evans ,",", a","a former","former 1950s","1950s American","American débutante","débutante and","and downtown","downtown Los","Los Angeles","Angeles barfly","Mary 's","'s life","life was","was plagued","plagued by","by alcoholism","alcoholism ,",", abusive","abusive husbands","husbands ,",", failed","failed suicide","suicide attempts","attempts ,",", and","and deteriorating","deteriorating health","health -","- but","but somehow","somehow through","through it","it all","all ,",", she","she managed","managed to","to keep","keep her","her sense","sense of","of humor","humor and","and took","took life","life in","in stride","This documentary","documentary was","was filmed","filmed ten","ten years","years ago","ago by","by her","her grandson","grandson ,",", Brennan","Brennan Howard","Howard ,",", and","and was","was just","just recently","recently completed"]}

{"title":"The Mystic Tales of Nikolas Winter","plot":"Nikolas Winter, the greatest of all magicians, has gone into hiding. His magic is too powerful for anyone, not even he himself dares to use it. Elizabeth Ward, a non-too-talented psychic, has started receiving visions of a beautiful but demonic young woman, and is desperate for help. Count Cagliostro, the most feared of all alchemists, has returned after being banished for performing dark magic - and will do anything to be reunited with his lost love, the mysterious Lady of Darkness, even if it means human sacrifice. Arthur Phillips, a young man bored with his mundane life, escapes night after night into his imagination, writing down elaborate tales of fantasy and intrigue. Each of these unique individuals will cross paths with each other, and either battle to the death, or live to tell another tale, in this colorful and unique fantasy directed by Ansel Faraj, and starring Linden Chiles, Audrey Stanzler, and Mihran Konanyan.","genres":["Adventure"," Thriller"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Nikola","Winter",",","the","greatest","of","all","magician",",","has","gone","into","hide",".","His","magic","is","too","power","for","anyon",",","not","even","he","himself","dare","to","use","it",".","Elizabeth","Ward",",","a","non-too-tal","psychic",",","has","start","receiv","vision","of","a","beauti","but","demon","young","woman",",","and","is","desper","for","help",".","Count","Cagliostro",",","the","most","fear","of","all","alchemist",",","has","return","after","be","banish","for","perform","dark","magic","-","and","will","do","anyth","to","be","reunit","with","his","lost","love",",","the","mysteri","Ladi","of","Dark",",","even","if","it","mean","human","sacrific",".","Arthur","Phillip",",","a","young","man","bore","with","his","mundan","life",",","escap","night","after","night","into","his","imagin",",","write","down","elabor","tale","of","fantasi","and","intrigu",".","Each","of","these","uniqu","individu","will","cross","path","with","each","other",",","and","either","battl","to","the","death",",","or","live","to","tell","anoth","tale",",","in","this","color","and","uniqu","fantasi","direct","by","Ansel","Faraj",",","and","star","Linden","Chile",",","Audrey","Stanzler",",","and","Mihran","Konanyan","."],"lemmas":["Nikolas","Winter",",","the","greatest","of","all","magician",",","have","go","into","hiding",".","he","magic","be","too","powerful","for","anyone",",","not","even","he","himself","dare","to","use","it",".","Elizabeth","Ward",",","a","non-too-talented","psychic",",","have","start","receive","vision","of","a","beautiful","but","demonic","young","woman",",","and","be","desperate","for","help",".","Count","Cagliostro",",","the","most","fear","of","all","alchemist",",","have","return","after","be","banish","for","perform","dark","magic","-","and","will","do","anything","to","be","reunite","with","he","lost","love",",","the","mysterious","lady","of","darkness",",","even","if","it","mean","human","sacrifice",".","Arthur","Phillips",",","a","young","man","bore","with","he","mundane","life",",","escape","night","after","night","into","he","imagination",",","write","down","elaborate","tale","of","fantasy","and","intrigue",".","each","of","these","unique","individual","will","cross","path","with","each","other",",","and","either","battle","to","the","death",",","or","live","to","tell","another","tale",",","in","this","colorful","and","unique","fantasy","direct","by","Ansel","Faraj",",","and","star","Linden","Chiles",",","Audrey","Stanzler",",","and","Mihran","Konanyan","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nikolas Winter ,","Winter , the",", the greatest","the greatest of","greatest of all","of all magicians","all magicians ,","magicians , has",", has gone","has gone into","gone into hiding","His magic is","magic is too","is too powerful","too powerful for","powerful for anyone","for anyone ,","anyone , not",", not even","not even he","even he himself","he himself dares","himself dares to","dares to use","to use it","Elizabeth Ward ,","Ward , a",", a non-too-talented","a non-too-talented psychic","non-too-talented psychic ,","psychic , has",", has started","has started receiving","started receiving visions","receiving visions of","visions of a","of a beautiful","a beautiful but","beautiful but demonic","but demonic young","demonic young woman","young woman ,","woman , and",", and is","and is desperate","is desperate for","desperate for help","Count Cagliostro ,","Cagliostro , the",", the most","the most feared","most feared of","feared of all","of all alchemists","all alchemists ,","alchemists , has",", has returned","has returned after","returned after being","after being banished","being banished for","banished for performing","for performing dark","performing dark magic","dark magic -","magic -

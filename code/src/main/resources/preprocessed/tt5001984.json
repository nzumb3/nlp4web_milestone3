{"title":"City East","plot":"Split into four separate yet interconnected stories, City East follows the Grim Reaper as she seeks to fulfill a dying woman's last wish, a trio of guardian spirits fighting against the darkness, an inhuman psychopath hired to hunt down a thief on the run, and a world-weary street musician struggling with immortality. As this imaginative quartet unfolds--each one affecting the others both directly and indirectly--their individual tales weave together to form a dark, poignant fable about life, death, good, and evil.","genres":["Fantasy"],"stems":["Split","into","four","separ","yet","interconnect","stori",",","Citi","East","follow","the","Grim","Reaper","as","she","seek","to","fulfil","a","die","woman","'s","last","wish",",","a","trio","of","guardian","spirit","fight","against","the","dark",",","an","inhuman","psychopath","hire","to","hunt","down","a","thief","on","the","run",",","and","a","world-weari","street","musician","struggl","with","immort",".","As","this","imagin","quartet","unfold","--","each","one","affect","the","other","both","direct","and","indirect","--","their","individu","tale","weav","togeth","to","form","a","dark",",","poignant","fabl","about","life",",","death",",","good",",","and","evil","."],"lemmas":["split","into","four","separate","yet","interconnect","story",",","City","East","follow","the","Grim","Reaper","as","she","seek","to","fulfill","a","die","woman","'s","last","wish",",","a","trio","of","guardian","spirit","fight","against","the","darkness",",","a","inhuman","psychopath","hire","to","hunt","down","a","thief","on","the","run",",","and","a","world-weary","street","musician","struggle","with","immortality",".","as","this","imaginative","quartet","unfold","--","each","one","affect","the","other","both","directly","and","indirectly","--","they","individual","tale","weave","together","to","form","a","dark",",","poignant","fable","about","life",",","death",",","good",",","and","evil","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Split into four","into four separate","four separate yet","separate yet interconnected","yet interconnected stories","interconnected stories ,","stories , City",", City East","City East follows","East follows the","follows the Grim","the Grim Reaper","Grim Reaper as","Reaper as she","as she seeks","she seeks to","seeks to fulfill","to fulfill a","fulfill a dying","a dying woman","dying woman 's","woman 's last","'s last wish","last wish ,","wish , a",", a trio","a trio of","trio of guardian","of guardian spirits","guardian spirits fighting","spirits fighting against","fighting against the","against the darkness","the darkness ,","darkness , an",", an inhuman","an inhuman psychopath","inhuman psychopath hired","psychopath hired to","hired to hunt","to hunt down","hunt down a","down a thief","a thief on","thief on the","on the run","the run ,","run , and",", and a","and a world-weary","a world-weary street","world-weary street musician","street musician struggling","musician struggling with","struggling with immortality","As this imaginative","this imaginative quartet","imaginative quartet unfolds","quartet unfolds --","unfolds -- each","-- each one","each one affecting","one affecting the","affecting the others","the others both","others both directly","both directly and","directly and indirectly","and indirectly --","indirectly -- their","-- their individual","their individual tales","individual tales weave","tales weave together","weave together to","together to form","to form a","form a dark","a dark ,","dark , poignant",", poignant fable","poignant fable about","fable about life","about life ,","life , death",", death ,","death , good",", good ,","good , and",", and evil"],"2grams":["Split into","into four","four separate","separate yet","yet interconnected","interconnected stories","stories ,",", City","City East","East follows","follows the","the Grim","Grim Reaper","Reaper as","as she","she seeks","seeks to","to fulfill","fulfill a","a dying","dying woman","woman 's","'s last","last wish","wish ,",", a","a trio","trio of","of guardian","guardian spirits","spirits fighting","fighting against","against the","the darkness","darkness ,",", an","an inhuman","inhuman psychopath","psychopath hired","hired to","to hunt","hunt down","down a","a thief","thief on","on the","the run","run ,",", and","and a","a world-weary","world-weary street","street musician","musician struggling","struggling with","with immortality","As this","this imaginative","imaginative quartet","quartet unfolds","unfolds --","-- each","each one","one affecting","affecting the","the others","others both","both directly","directly and","and indirectly","indirectly --","-- their","their individual","individual tales","tales weave","weave together","together to","to form","form a","a dark","dark ,",", poignant","poignant fable","fable about","about life","life ,",", death","death ,",", good","good ,",", and","and evil"]}

{"title":"Capitalismo Selvagem","plot":"This is a comedy; a double satire of Brazilian soap operas and at the same time, about \"savage capitalism\" in 1990's Brazil where the Amazon jungle is exploited, while killing Indians and appropriating the land of its few surviving owners. The plot is headed mostly by Hugo Assis (Jose Mayer), apparently at first a major industrialist, and Elisa Medeiros (Fernanda Torres), a reporter investigating the suspect activities of Mr. Assis' company. Through Elisa, the powerful industrialist discovers his true origins. During a passionate love affair with her, Mr. Assis starts to become another person. As his company begins a massive gold extraction operation on indigenous lands, Elisa becomes engaged in an environmental struggle against this project and the exploitation of Indian homelands.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","is","a","comedi",";","a","doubl","satir","of","Brazilian","soap","opera","and","at","the","same","time",",","about","\"","savag","capit","\"","in","1990","'s","Brazil","where","the","Amazon","jungl","is","exploit",",","while","kill","Indian","and","appropri","the","land","of","it","few","surviv","owner",".","The","plot","is","head","most","by","Hugo","Assis","(","Jose","Mayer",")",",","appar","at","first","a","major","industrialist",",","and","Elisa","Medeiro","(","Fernanda","Torr",")",",","a","report","investig","the","suspect","activ","of","Mr.","Assis","'","compani",".","Through","Elisa",",","the","power","industrialist","discov","his","true","origin",".","Dure","a","passion","love","affair","with","her",",","Mr.","Assis","start","to","becom","anoth","person",".","As","his","compani","begin","a","massiv","gold","extract","oper","on","indigen","land",",","Elisa","becom","engag","in","an","environment","struggl","against","this","project","and","the","exploit","of","Indian","homeland","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","comedy",";","a","double","satire","of","brazilian","soap","opera","and","at","the","same","time",",","about","``","savage","capitalism","''","in","1990","'s","Brazil","where","the","Amazon","jungle","be","exploit",",","while","kill","Indians","and","appropriate","the","land","of","its","few","survive","owner",".","the","plot","be","head","mostly","by","Hugo","Assis","-lrb-","Jose","Mayer","-rrb-",",","apparently","at","first","a","major","industrialist",",","and","Elisa","Medeiros","-lrb-","Fernanda","Torres","-rrb-",",","a","reporter","investigate","the","suspect","activity","of","Mr.","Assis","'","company",".","through","Elisa",",","the","powerful","industrialist","discover","he","true","origin",".","during","a","passionate","love","affair","with","she",",","Mr.","Assis","start","to","become","another","person",".","as","he","company","begin","a","massive","gold","extraction","operation","on","indigenous","land",",","Elisa","become","engage","in","a","environmental","struggle","against","this","project","and","the","exploitation","of","indian","homeland","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is a","is a comedy","a comedy ;","comedy ;

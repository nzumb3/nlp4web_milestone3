Years later Arjun will attempt to gain fame along with two associates, Zoheb and Wasim, and his sweetheart, Priya. He returns to Bhatinda and asks his childhood slacker and trouble-maker friend, Manjeet Khosla, to also join his band - a decision that will not only cost him his popularity, his career and dreams, but also his love.","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["Bhatinda-bas","school-go","Arjun","want","to","follow","in","his","much-malign","grand-fath","'s","footstep","and","attain","fame","at","the","Wembley","Stadium","much","to","the","chagrin","of","his","father",".","After","the","latter","'s","pass",",","he","re-loc","to","live","in","Britain","with","his","patern","uncl",",","and","when","admonish","about","his","career",",","run","away",".","Year","later","Arjun","will","attempt","to","gain","fame","along","with","two","associ",",","Zoheb","and","Wasim",",","and","his","sweetheart",",","Priya",".","He","return","to","Bhatinda","and","ask","his","childhood","slacker","and","trouble-mak","friend",",","Manjeet","Khosla",",","to","also","join","his","band","-","a","decis","that","will","not","onli","cost","him","his","popular",",","his","career","and","dream",",","but","also","his","love","."],"lemmas":["bhatinda-based","school-going","Arjun","want","to","follow","in","he","much-maligned","grand-father","'s","footstep","and","attain","fame","at","the","Wembley","Stadium","much","to","the","chagrin","of","he","father",".","after","the","latter","'s","passing",",","he","re-locate","to","live","in","Britain","with","he","paternal","uncle",",","and","when","admonish","about","he","career",",","run","away",".","year","later","Arjun","will","attempt","to","gain","fame","along","with","two","associate",",","Zoheb","and","Wasim",",","and","he","sweetheart",",","Priya",".","he","return","to","Bhatinda","and","ask","he","childhood","slacker","and","trouble-maker","friend",",","Manjeet","Khosla",",","to","also","join","he","band","-","a","decision","that","will","not","only","cost","he","he","popularity",",","he","career","and","dream",",","but","also","he","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bhatinda-based school-going Arjun","school-going Arjun wants","Arjun wants to","wants to follow","to follow in","follow in his","in his much-maligned","his much-maligned grand-father","much-maligned grand-father 's","grand-father 's footsteps","'s footsteps and","footsteps and attain","and attain fame","attain fame at","fame at the","at the Wembley","the Wembley Stadium","Wembley Stadium much","Stadium much to","much to the","to the chagrin","the chagrin of","chagrin of his","of his father","After the latter","the latter 's","latter 's passing","'s passing ,","passing , he",", he re-locates","he re-locates to","re-locates to live","to live in","live in Britain","in Britain with","Britain with his","with his paternal","his paternal uncle","paternal uncle ,","uncle , and",", and when","and when admonished","when admonished about","admonished about his","about his career","his career ,","career , runs",", runs away","Years later Arjun","later Arjun will","Arjun will attempt","will attempt to","attempt to gain","to gain fame","gain fame along","fame along with","along with two","with two associates","two associates ,","associates , Zoheb",", Zoheb and","Zoheb and Wasim","and Wasim ,","Wasim , and",", and his","and his sweetheart","his sweetheart ,","sweetheart , Priya","He returns to","returns to Bhatinda","to Bhatinda and","Bhatinda and asks","and asks his","asks his childhood","his childhood slacker","childhood slacker and","slacker and trouble-maker","and trouble-maker friend","trouble-maker friend ,","friend , Manjeet",", Manjeet Khosla","Manjeet Khosla ,","Khosla , to",", to also","to also join","also join his","join his band","his band -","band -

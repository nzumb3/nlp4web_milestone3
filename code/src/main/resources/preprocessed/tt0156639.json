{"title":"The Big Tease","plot":"Flamboyant Glasgow hairdresser, Crawford Mackinzie, gets a letter from the World Hairdresser International Federation inviting him to its prestigious annual contest in L.A. Filmmaker Martin Samuels is making a fly-on-the-wall documentary about Crawford; he and the crew go too. After maxing out his credit card at the Century Plaza Hotel, Crawford discovers he's been invited to participate in the audience, not the contest; he tries every angle imaginable to get in the competition: he phones fellow Scot Sean Connery, he gets a union card, he asks the reigning champion for help, and he connects with Connery's publicist, who's having a bad hair day. Will he succeed, for the little people?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Flamboy","Glasgow","hairdress",",","Crawford","Mackinzi",",","get","a","letter","from","the","World","Hairdress","Internat","Feder","invit","him","to","it","prestigi","annual","contest","in","L.A.","Filmmak","Martin","Samuel","is","make","a","fly-on-the-wal","documentari","about","Crawford",";","he","and","the","crew","go","too",".","After","max","out","his","credit","card","at","the","Centuri","Plaza","Hotel",",","Crawford","discov","he","'s","been","invit","to","particip","in","the","audienc",",","not","the","contest",";","he","tri","everi","angl","imagin","to","get","in","the","competit",":","he","phone","fellow","Scot","Sean","Conneri",",","he","get","a","union","card",",","he","ask","the","reign","champion","for","help",",","and","he","connect","with","Conneri","'s","publicist",",","who","'s","have","a","bad","hair","day",".","Will","he","succeed",",","for","the","littl","peopl","?"],"lemmas":["flamboyant","Glasgow","hairdresser",",","Crawford","Mackinzie",",","get","a","letter","from","the","World","Hairdresser","International","Federation","invite","he","to","its","prestigious","annual","contest","in","L.A.","Filmmaker","Martin","Samuels","be","make","a","fly-on-the-wall","documentary","about","Crawford",";","he","and","the","crew","go","too",".","after","max","out","he","credit","card","at","the","Century","Plaza","Hotel",",","Crawford","discover","he","be","be","invite","to","participate","in","the","audience",",","not","the","contest",";","he","try","every","angle","imaginable","to","get","in","the","competition",":","he","phone","fellow","Scot","Sean","Connery",",","he","get","a","union","card",",","he","ask","the","reign","champion","for","help",",","and","he","connect","with","Connery","'s","publicist",",","who","be","have","a","bad","hair","day",".","will","he","succeed",",","for","the","little","people","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Flamboyant Glasgow hairdresser","Glasgow hairdresser ,","hairdresser , Crawford",", Crawford Mackinzie","Crawford Mackinzie ,","Mackinzie , gets",", gets a","gets a letter","a letter from","letter from the","from the World","the World Hairdresser","World Hairdresser International","Hairdresser International Federation","International Federation inviting","Federation inviting him","inviting him to","him to its","to its prestigious","its prestigious annual","prestigious annual contest","annual contest in","contest in L.A.","in L.A.

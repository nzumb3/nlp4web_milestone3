{"title":"Ocean of Storms","plot":"'Ocean of Storms' is a feature film of five chapters created by filmmaker Glynn Beard over a period of ten years to speak to his son through his film work as an artist. Each chapter addresses an aspect of our cultural values in a story segment which is meant to evoke strong emotional personal ties between the audience and the characters in the stories facing everyday difficult life choices typically resulting in a great personal cost to the individual characters. The stories are diverse, sad, funny, surreal but always connecting back to the raw human emotion of the characters as they face coping with life in the current changing cultural values of our society.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["'","Ocean","of","Storm","'","is","a","featur","film","of","five","chapter","creat","by","filmmak","Glynn","Beard","over","a","period","of","ten","year","to","speak","to","his","son","through","his","film","work","as","an","artist",".","Each","chapter","address","an","aspect","of","our","cultur","valu","in","a","stori","segment","which","is","meant","to","evok","strong","emot","person","tie","between","the","audienc","and","the","charact","in","the","stori","face","everyday","difficult","life","choic","typic","result","in","a","great","person","cost","to","the","individu","charact",".","The","stori","are","divers",",","sad",",","funni",",","surreal","but","alway","connect","back","to","the","raw","human","emot","of","the","charact","as","they","face","cope","with","life","in","the","current","chang","cultur","valu","of","our","societi","."],"lemmas":["'","ocean","of","storm","'","be","a","feature","film","of","five","chapter","create","by","filmmaker","Glynn","Beard","over","a","period","of","ten","year","to","speak","to","he","son","through","he","film","work","as","a","artist",".","each","chapter","address","a","aspect","of","we","cultural","value","in","a","story","segment","which","be","mean","to","evoke","strong","emotional","personal","tie","between","the","audience","and","the","character","in","the","story","face","everyday","difficult","life","choice","typically","result","in","a","great","personal","cost","to","the","individual","character",".","the","story","be","diverse",",","sad",",","funny",",","surreal","but","always","connect","back","to","the","raw","human","emotion","of","the","character","as","they","face","cope","with","life","in","the","current","change","cultural","value","of","we","society","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["'

{"title":"Bindlestiffs","plot":"Three high school virgins, suspended from school on a bogus graffiti charge, flee to the inner city in an attempt to live out the plot of The Catcher in the Rye - a book they neither have read nor understand. BINDLESTIFFS documents their struggles along the way as they surrender their virginities to vagrants, prostitutes, and crack fiends. Hot on their tail is Charlie, the deranged school security guard. Under the impression that the boys are planning a school shooting, he takes the law into his own hands to stop them and save America.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Three","high","school","virgin",",","suspend","from","school","on","a","bogus","graffiti","charg",",","flee","to","the","inner","citi","in","an","attempt","to","live","out","the","plot","of","The","Catcher","in","the","Rye","-","a","book","they","neither","have","read","nor","understand",".","BINDLESTIFFS","document","their","struggl","along","the","way","as","they","surrend","their","virgin","to","vagrant",",","prostitut",",","and","crack","fiend",".","Hot","on","their","tail","is","Charli",",","the","derang","school","secur","guard",".","Under","the","impress","that","the","boy","are","plan","a","school","shoot",",","he","take","the","law","into","his","own","hand","to","stop","them","and","save","America","."],"lemmas":["three","high","school","virgin",",","suspend","from","school","on","a","bogus","graffiti","charge",",","flee","to","the","inner","city","in","a","attempt","to","live","out","the","plot","of","the","catcher","in","the","Rye","-","a","book","they","neither","have","read","nor","understand",".","BINDLESTIFFS","document","they","struggle","along","the","way","as","they","surrender","they","virginity","to","vagrant",",","prostitute",",","and","crack","fiend",".","hot","on","they","tail","be","Charlie",",","the","deranged","school","security","guard",".","under","the","impression","that","the","boy","be","plan","a","school","shooting",",","he","take","the","law","into","he","own","hand","to","stop","they","and","save","America","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Three high school","high school virgins","school virgins ,","virgins , suspended",", suspended from","suspended from school","from school on","school on a","on a bogus","a bogus graffiti","bogus graffiti charge","graffiti charge ,","charge , flee",", flee to","flee to the","to the inner","the inner city","inner city in","city in an","in an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to live","to live out","live out the","out the plot","the plot of","plot of The","of The Catcher","The Catcher in","Catcher in the","in the Rye","the Rye -","Rye - a","- a book","a book they","book they neither","they neither have","neither have read","have read nor","read nor understand","BINDLESTIFFS documents their","documents their struggles","their struggles along","struggles along the","along the way","the way as","way as they","as they surrender","they surrender their","surrender their virginities","their virginities to","virginities to vagrants","to vagrants ,","vagrants , prostitutes",", prostitutes ,","prostitutes , and",", and crack","and crack fiends","Hot on their","on their tail","their tail is","tail is Charlie","is Charlie ,","Charlie , the",", the deranged","the deranged school","deranged school security","school security guard","Under the impression","the impression that","impression that the","that the boys","the boys are","boys are planning","are planning a","planning a school","a school shooting","school shooting ,","shooting , he",", he takes","he takes the","takes the law","the law into","law into his","into his own","his own hands","own hands to","hands to stop","to stop them","stop them and","them and save","and save America"],"2grams":["Three high","high school","school virgins","virgins ,",", suspended","suspended from","from school","school on","on a","a bogus","bogus graffiti","graffiti charge","charge ,",", flee","flee to","to the","the inner","inner city","city in","in an","an attempt","attempt to","to live","live out","out the","the plot","plot of","of The","The Catcher","Catcher in","in the","the Rye","Rye -","- a","a book","book they","they neither","neither have","have read","read nor","nor understand","BINDLESTIFFS documents","documents their","their struggles","struggles along","along the","the way","way as","as they","they surrender","surrender their","their virginities","virginities to","to vagrants","vagrants ,",", prostitutes","prostitutes ,",", and","and crack","crack fiends","Hot on","on their","their tail","tail is","is Charlie","Charlie ,",", the","the deranged","deranged school","school security","security guard","Under the","the impression","impression that","that the","the boys","boys are","are planning","planning a","a school","school shooting","shooting ,",", he","he takes","takes the","the law","law into","into his","his own","own hands","hands to","to stop","stop them","them and","and save","save America"]}

{"title":"Rebels with a Cause","plot":"REBELS WITH A CAUSE provides the David and Goliath origin for one of America's most visited, and arguably it's most beautiful, urban national parks - Point Reyes National Seashore and Golden Gate National Recreation Area. When California was the nation's fastest-growing state, a handful of politically savvy activists awakened their neighbors, local farmers, and officials to the threat of sprawl and over-development. Passionately, tirelessly, endlessly, they raised support for conservation, successfully battling the most powerful opponents of their day in big industry and government. Their efforts set new precedents for protecting open space and shaped the environmental movement as we know it today.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["REBELS","WITH","A","CAUSE","provid","the","David","and","Goliath","origin","for","one","of","America","'s","most","visit",",","and","arguabl","it","'s","most","beauti",",","urban","nation","park","-","Point","Rey","Nation","Seashor","and","Golden","Gate","Nation","Recreat","Area",".","When","California","was","the","nation","'s","fastest-grow","state",",","a","hand","of","polit","savvi","activist","awaken","their","neighbor",",","local","farmer",",","and","offici","to","the","threat","of","sprawl","and","over-develop",".","Passion",",","tireless",",","endless",",","they","rais","support","for","conserv",",","success","battl","the","most","power","oppon","of","their","day","in","big","industri","and","govern",".","Their","effort","set","new","preced","for","protect","open","space","and","shape","the","environment","movement","as","we","know","it","today","."],"lemmas":["rebel","with","a","cause","provide","the","David","and","Goliath","origin","for","one","of","America","'s","most","visit",",","and","arguably","it","be","most","beautiful",",","urban","national","park","-","Point","Reyes","National","Seashore","and","Golden","Gate","National","Recreation","Area",".","when","California","be","the","nation","'s","fastest-growing","state",",","a","handful","of","politically","savvy","activist","awaken","they","neighbor",",","local","farmer",",","and","official","to","the","threat","of","sprawl","and","over-development",".","passionately",",","tirelessly",",","endlessly",",","they","raise","support","for","conservation",",","successfully","battle","the","most","powerful","opponent","of","they","day","in","big","industry","and","government",".","they","effort","set","new","precedent","for","protect","open","space","and","shape","the","environmental","movement","as","we","know","it","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["REBELS WITH A","WITH A CAUSE","A CAUSE provides","CAUSE provides the","provides the David","the David and","David and Goliath","and Goliath origin","Goliath origin for","origin for one","for one of","one of America","of America 's","America 's most","'s most visited","most visited ,","visited , and",", and arguably","and arguably it","arguably it 's","it 's most","'s most beautiful","most beautiful ,","beautiful , urban",", urban national","urban national parks","national parks -","parks -

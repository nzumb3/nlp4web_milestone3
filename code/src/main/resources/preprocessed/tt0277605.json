{"title":"Bio-Zombie","plot":"Hong Kong's answer to George Romero's Dawn Of The Dead. A soft drink tainted with \"Iraqi bio-chemicals\" has the power to turn people into flesh-eating zombies. Gangsters smuggle it into HK, only to become instant zombie prey. One of the gang escapes with the bottle, but is run over by two young VCD sellers and wannabe petty criminals (Woody Invincible and Crazy Bee) returning to their mall shop in their bosses' car. Trying to revive him, they give him a drink of what they think is Lucosade. With him seemingly dead and unsure of what to do, they bring the corpse back to the mall with them in the boot of their car. They make the mistake of leaving the boot open. And, pretty soon, the mall is crawling with zombies. The odd couple and a bunch of other mall employees have to bond together to try and fight their way out.","genres":["Comedy"," Sci-Fi","

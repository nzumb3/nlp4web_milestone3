{"title":"Sol LeWitt: 4 Decades","plot":"Sol LeWitt, one of our most influential contemporary artists, has never liked the idea of being filmed or photographed. He always felt he was best represented only by his work. After twenty years of urging him to make an exception, he finally consented, on the occasion of a major retrospective exhibition in 2000. He died in 2007. LeWitt visits the exhibition with its curator Gary Garrels, discussing the work on view. Garrels spent three years on the creation of this exhibition, in close cooperation with the artist. He leads LeWitt through his breakthroughs of 4 decades, from the 1960s to 2000. The large number of spectacular wall drawings, for which LeWitt is especially recognized, are the highlight of the exhibition. This video is a unique document, an opportunity to accompany one of the great artists of our time on a tour of his work, from his formative years to the present.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sol","LeWitt",",","one","of","our","most","influenti","contemporari","artist",",","has","never","like","the","idea","of","be","film","or","photograph",".","He","alway","felt","he","was","best","repres","onli","by","his","work",".","After","twenti","year","of","urg","him","to","make","an","except",",","he","final","consent",",","on","the","occas","of","a","major","retrospect","exhibit","in","2000",".","He","die","in","2007",".","LeWitt","visit","the","exhibit","with","it","curat","Gari","Garrel",",","discuss","the","work","on","view",".","Garrel","spent","three","year","on","the","creation","of","this","exhibit",",","in","close","cooper","with","the","artist",".","He","lead","LeWitt","through","his","breakthrough","of","4","decad",",","from","the","1960s","to","2000",".","The","larg","number","of","spectacular","wall","draw",",","for","which","LeWitt","is","especi","recogn",",","are","the","highlight","of","the","exhibit",".","This","video","is","a","uniqu","document",",","an","opportun","to","accompani","one","of","the","great","artist","of","our","time","on","a","tour","of","his","work",",","from","his","format","year","to","the","present","."],"lemmas":["Sol","LeWitt",",","one","of","we","most","influential","contemporary","artist",",","have","never","like","the","idea","of","be","film","or","photograph",".","he","always","feel","he","be","best","represent","only","by","he","work",".","after","twenty","year","of","urge","he","to","make","a","exception",",","he","finally","consent",",","on","the","occasion","of","a","major","retrospective","exhibition","in","2000",".","he","die","in","2007",".","LeWitt","visit","the","exhibition","with","its","curator","Gary","Garrels",",","discuss","the","work","on","view",".","Garrels","spend","three","year","on","the","creation","of","this","exhibition",",","in","close","cooperation","with","the","artist",".","he","lead","LeWitt","through","he","breakthrough","of","4","decade",",","from","the","1960s","to","2000",".","the","large","number","of","spectacular","wall","drawing",",","for","which","LeWitt","be","especially","recognize",",","be","the","highlight","of","the","exhibition",".","this","video","be","a","unique","document",",","a","opportunity","to","accompany","one","of","the","great","artist","of","we","time","on","a","tour","of","he","work",",","from","he","formative","year","to","the","present","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sol

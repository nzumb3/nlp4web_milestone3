{"title":"Jozi","plot":"James is a successful comedy writer. There is only one small problem, he lives in Johannesburg and has completely and utterly lost his sense of humour. Crime, politics, pessimism and feather duster salesmen have invaded every cell of his body causing him to lose the very spark of humour which enables him to earn his living. He has other problems too - his girlfriend has left him for the most boring man in the world; his entire family has emigrated; he has thrown his producer's computer out the window and developed a serious drug problem. In the maddest of madcap journey James must travel through the highways and byways of South Africa from Daspoort Rehab back to Johannesburg to try and find his elusive sense of humour as well as his ability to love and laugh again.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Jame","is","a","success","comedi","writer",".","There","is","onli","one","small","problem",",","he","live","in","Johannesburg","and","has","complet","and","utter","lost","his","sens","of","humour",".","Crime",",","polit",",","pessim","and","feather","duster","salesmen","have","invad","everi","cell","of","his","bodi","caus","him","to","lose","the","veri","spark","of","humour","which","enabl","him","to","earn","his","live",".","He","has","other","problem","too","-","his","girlfriend","has","left","him","for","the","most","bore","man","in","the","world",";","his","entir","famili","has","emigr",";","he","has","thrown","his","produc","'s","comput","out","the","window","and","develop","a","serious","drug","problem",".","In","the","maddest","of","madcap","journey","Jame","must","travel","through","the","highway","and","byway","of","South","Africa","from","Daspoort","Rehab","back","to","Johannesburg","to","tri","and","find","his","elus","sens","of","humour","as","well","as","his","abil","to","love","and","laugh","again","."],"lemmas":["James","be","a","successful","comedy","writer",".","there","be","only","one","small","problem",",","he","live","in","Johannesburg","and","have","completely","and","utterly","lose","he","sense","of","humour",".","Crime",",","politics",",","pessimism","and","feather","duster","salesman","have","invade","every","cell","of","he","body","cause","he","to","lose","the","very","spark","of","humour","which","enable","he","to","earn","he","living",".","he","have","other","problem","too","-","he","girlfriend","have","leave","he","for","the","most","boring","man","in","the","world",";","he","entire","family","have","emigrate",";","he","have","throw","he","producer","'s","computer","out","the","window","and","develop","a","serious","drug","problem",".","in","the","maddest","of","madcap","journey","James","must","travel","through","the","highway","and","byway","of","South","Africa","from","Daspoort","Rehab","back","to","Johannesburg","to","try","and","find","he","elusive","sense","of","humour","as","well","as","he","ability","to","love","and","laugh","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["James is a","is a successful","a successful comedy","successful comedy writer","There is only","is only one","only one small","one small problem","small problem ,","problem , he",", he lives","he lives in","lives in Johannesburg","in Johannesburg and","Johannesburg and has","and has completely","has completely and","completely and utterly","and utterly lost","utterly lost his","lost his sense","his sense of","sense of humour","Crime , politics",", politics ,","politics , pessimism",", pessimism and","pessimism and feather","and feather duster","feather duster salesmen","duster salesmen have","salesmen have invaded","have invaded every","invaded every cell","every cell of","cell of his","of his body","his body causing","body causing him","causing him to","him to lose","to lose the","lose the very","the very spark","very spark of","spark of humour","of humour which","humour which enables","which enables him","enables him to","him to earn","to earn his","earn his living","He has other","has other problems","other problems too","problems too -","too - his","- his girlfriend","his girlfriend has","girlfriend has left","has left him","left him for","him for the","for the most","the most boring","most boring man","boring man in","man in the","in the world","the world ;","world ;

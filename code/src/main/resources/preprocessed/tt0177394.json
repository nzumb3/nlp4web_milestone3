{"title":"The Wolves of Kromer","plot":"Once upon a time in the village of Kromer lived two beautiful young wolves. Cocksure Gabriel takes newcomer Seth under his paw and helps reconcile him to the vilification associated with being a wolf. They fall head-over-heels in puppy love, playing together around picturesque waterfalls, secluded woodlands, and moonlit lakes. One day a wicked old crone and her goofy sidekick kill their mistress, frame the wolves, and incite a torch-bearing mob of religious zealots to seek vengeance on the hapless pair. But who will live happily ever after?","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Once","upon","a","time","in","the","villag","of","Kromer","live","two","beauti","young","wolv",".","Cocksur","Gabriel","take","newcom","Seth","under","his","paw","and","help","reconcil","him","to","the","vilif","associ","with","be","a","wolf",".","They","fall","head-over-heel","in","puppi","love",",","play","togeth","around","picturesqu","waterfal",",","seclud","woodland",",","and","moonlit","lake",".","One","day","a","wick","old","crone","and","her","goofi","sidekick","kill","their","mistress",",","frame","the","wolv",",","and","incit","a","torch-bear","mob","of","religi","zealot","to","seek","vengeanc","on","the","hapless","pair",".","But","who","will","live","happili","ever","after","?"],"lemmas":["once","upon","a","time","in","the","village","of","Kromer","live","two","beautiful","young","wolf",".","Cocksure","Gabriel","take","newcomer","Seth","under","he","paw","and","help","reconcile","he","to","the","vilification","associate","with","be","a","wolf",".","they","fall","head-over-heel","in","puppy","love",",","play","together","around","picturesque","waterfall",",","secluded","woodland",",","and","moonlit","lake",".","one","day","a","wicked","old","crone","and","she","goofy","sidekick","kill","they","mistress",",","frame","the","wolf",",","and","incite","a","torch-bearing","mob","of","religious","zealot","to","seek","vengeance","on","the","hapless","pair",".","but","who","will","live","happily","ever","after","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Once upon a","upon a time","a time in","time in the","in the village","the village of","village of Kromer","of Kromer lived","Kromer lived two","lived two beautiful","two beautiful young","beautiful young wolves","Cocksure Gabriel takes","Gabriel takes newcomer","takes newcomer Seth","newcomer Seth under","Seth under his","under his paw","his paw and","paw and helps","and helps reconcile","helps reconcile him","reconcile him to","him to the","to the vilification","the vilification associated","vilification associated with","associated with being","with being a","being a wolf","They fall head-over-heels","fall head-over-heels in","head-over-heels in puppy","in puppy love","puppy love ,","love , playing",", playing together","playing together around","together around picturesque","around picturesque waterfalls","picturesque waterfalls ,","waterfalls , secluded",", secluded woodlands","secluded woodlands ,","woodlands , and",", and moonlit","and moonlit lakes","One day a","day a wicked","a wicked old","wicked old crone","old crone and","crone and her","and her goofy","her goofy sidekick","goofy sidekick kill","sidekick kill their","kill their mistress","their mistress ,","mistress , frame",", frame the","frame the wolves","the wolves ,","wolves , and",", and incite","and incite a","incite a torch-bearing","a torch-bearing mob","torch-bearing mob of","mob of religious","of religious zealots","religious zealots to","zealots to seek","to seek vengeance","seek vengeance on","vengeance on the","on the hapless","the hapless pair","But who will","who will live","will live happily","live happily ever","happily ever after"],"2grams":["Once upon","upon a","a time","time in","in the","the village","village of","of Kromer","Kromer lived","lived two","two beautiful","beautiful young","young wolves","Cocksure Gabriel","Gabriel takes","takes newcomer","newcomer Seth","Seth under","under his","his paw","paw and","and helps","helps reconcile","reconcile him","him to","to the","the vilification","vilification associated","associated with","with being","being a","a wolf","They fall","fall head-over-heels","head-over-heels in","in puppy","puppy love","love ,",", playing","playing together","together around","around picturesque","picturesque waterfalls","waterfalls ,",", secluded","secluded woodlands","woodlands ,",", and","and moonlit","moonlit lakes","One day","day a","a wicked","wicked old","old crone","crone and","and her","her goofy","goofy sidekick","sidekick kill","kill their","their mistress","mistress ,",", frame","frame the","the wolves","wolves ,",", and","and incite","incite a","a torch-bearing","torch-bearing mob","mob of","of religious","religious zealots","zealots to","to seek","seek vengeance","vengeance on","on the","the hapless","hapless pair","But who","who will","will live","live happily","happily ever","ever after"]}

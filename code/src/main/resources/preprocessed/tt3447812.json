{"title":"The Territory","plot":"Tucked away off a cobblestone street in Montparnasse lies a rabbit hole which opens up once or twice a year to foreign students and young artists in search of a room for rent. What they find is The Territory, something between an auberge de jeunesse and a dystopian experimental art project, run under the many, watchful eyes of a Russian landlord. The filmmaker, 6 months into his tenancy, begins an attempt at a portrait of the underground community. The result is an intricately woven fabric of spaces, characters, and stories that range from the comically absurd to the thrillingly dark.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller","

{"title":"The Devil's Ground","plot":"While traveling from California to Bangor through a lonely road, Carrie Mitchel is advised by the gas station attendant Jimmy to rest in a hotel; however, she decides to continue driving through the night. Later she almost hits the teenager Amy Singer that is wandering on the road wounded with blood on her face. She gives a lift to Amy that tells that her friends from the Boston University Mike, Greg, Tammy and Lisa and she had traveled in a RV to Arrowhead to research the area as part of a discipline in their course. When they stopped in a gas station, the attendant Billy advised them to avoid the place in Bradford City called \"Devil's Playground\" by the locals. While digging in an area where a mine collapsed on 19 December 1967 killing 239 coal miners, they find preserved bones that they believe belonged to the Indians. However, when they find teeth with golf fillings and a watch on the wrist of an arm, they realize that the deaths have recently occurred and they are in a dangerous location.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["While","travel","from","California","to","Bangor","through","a","lone","road",",","Carri","Mitchel","is","advis","by","the","gas","station","attend","Jimmi","to","rest","in","a","hotel",";","howev",",","she","decid","to","continu","drive","through","the","night",".","Later","she","almost","hit","the","teenag","Ami","Singer","that","is","wander","on","the","road","wound","with","blood","on","her","face",".","She","give","a","lift","to","Ami","that","tell","that","her","friend","from","the","Boston","Univers","Mike",",","Greg",",","Tammi","and","Lisa","and","she","had","travel","in","a","RV","to","Arrowhead","to","research","the","area","as","part","of","a","disciplin","in","their","cours",".","When","they","stop","in","a","gas","station",",","the","attend","Billi","advis","them","to","avoid","the","place","in","Bradford","Citi","call","\"","Devil","'s","Playground","\"","by","the","local",".","While","dig","in","an","area","where","a","mine","collaps","on","19","Decemb","1967","kill","239","coal","miner",",","they","find","preserv","bone","that","they","believ","belong","to","the","Indian",".","Howev",",","when","they","find","teeth","with","golf","fill","and","a","watch","on","the","wrist","of","an","arm",",","they","realiz","that","the","death","have","recent","occur","and","they","are","in","a","danger","locat","."],"lemmas":["while","travel","from","California","to","Bangor","through","a","lonely","road",",","Carrie","Mitchel","be","advise","by","the","gas","station","attendant","Jimmy","to","rest","in","a","hotel",";","however",",","she","decide","to","continue","drive","through","the","night",".","later","she","almost","hit","the","teenager","Amy","Singer","that","be","wander","on","the","road","wound","with","blood","on","she","face",".","she","give","a","lift","to","Amy","that","tell","that","she","friend","from","the","Boston","University","Mike",",","Greg",",","Tammy","and","Lisa","and","she","have","travel","in","a","rv","to","Arrowhead","to","research","the","area","as","part","of","a","discipline","in","they","course",".","when","they","stop","in","a","gas","station",",","the","attendant","Billy","advise","they","to","avoid","the","place","in","Bradford","City","call","``","Devil","'s","playground","''","by","the","local",".","while","digging","in","a","area","where","a","mine","collapse","on","19","December","1967","kill","239","coal","miner",",","they","find","preserved","bone","that","they","believe","belong","to","the","Indians",".","however",",","when","they","find","tooth","with","golf","filling","and","a","watch","on","the","wrist","of","a","arm",",","they","realize","that","the","death","have","recently","occur","and","they","be","in","a","dangerous","location","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["While traveling from","traveling from California","from California to","California to Bangor","to Bangor through","Bangor through a","through a lonely","a lonely road","lonely road ,","road , Carrie",", Carrie Mitchel","Carrie Mitchel is","Mitchel is advised","is advised by","advised by the","by the gas","the gas station","gas station attendant","station attendant Jimmy","attendant Jimmy to","Jimmy to rest","to rest in","rest in a","in a hotel","a hotel ;","hotel ;

{"title":"We Are Poets","plot":"In the age of Facebook and digital communication, a remarkable group of British teenagers have chosen to define themselves through one of the most ancient, and potent, forms of culture out there - the spoken poem. 'We Are Poets' intimately follows the lives and words of the UK's multi-ethnic noughties generation as the Leeds Young Authors poetry team prepare for a transformational journey of a lifetime, from the red bricked back streets of inner city North England, to a stage in front of the White House at Brave New Voices - the world's most prestigious poetry slam competition. Anyone tempted to dismiss today's youth as politically apathetic better pay heed - here is electrifying evidence to the contrary.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","age","of","Facebook","and","digit","communic",",","a","remark","group","of","British","teenag","have","chosen","to","defin","themselv","through","one","of","the","most","ancient",",","and","potent",",","form","of","cultur","out","there","-","the","spoken","poem",".","'","We","Are","Poet","'","intim","follow","the","live","and","word","of","the","UK","'s","multi-ethn","noughti","generat","as","the","Leed","Young","Author","poetri","team","prepar","for","a","transform","journey","of","a","lifetim",",","from","the","red","brick","back","street","of","inner","citi","North","England",",","to","a","stage","in","front","of","the","White","Hous","at","Brave","New","Voic","-","the","world","'s","most","prestigi","poetri","slam","competit",".","Anyon","tempt","to","dismiss","today","'s","youth","as","polit","apathet","better","pay","heed","-","here","is","electrifi","evid","to","the","contrari","."],"lemmas":["in","the","age","of","Facebook","and","digital","communication",",","a","remarkable","group","of","british","teenager","have","choose","to","define","themselves","through","one","of","the","most","ancient",",","and","potent",",","form","of","culture","out","there","-","the","speak","poem",".","'","we","be","poet","'","intimately","follow","the","life","and","word","of","the","UK","'s","multi-ethnic","noughty","generation","as","the","Leeds","Young","Authors","poetry","team","prepare","for","a","transformational","journey","of","a","lifetime",",","from","the","red","brick","back","street","of","inner","city","North","England",",","to","a","stage","in","front","of","the","White","House","at","Brave","New","voice","-","the","world","be","most","prestigious","poetry","slam","competition",".","anyone","tempt","to","dismiss","today","'s","youth","as","politically","apathetic","better","pay","heed","-","here","be","electrify","evidence","to","the","contrary","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In the age","the age of","age of Facebook","of Facebook and","Facebook and digital","and digital communication","digital communication ,","communication , a",", a remarkable","a remarkable group","remarkable group of","group of British","of British teenagers","British teenagers have","teenagers have chosen","have chosen to","chosen to define","to define themselves","define themselves through","themselves through one","through one of","one of the","of the most","the most ancient","most ancient ,","ancient , and",", and potent","and potent ,","potent , forms",", forms of","forms of culture","of culture out","culture out there","out there -","there - the","- the spoken","the spoken poem","spoken poem .","poem .

{"title":"Skeptic","plot":"A street tale of redemption through the power of a spiritual awakening. Dave finds such an escape in a negative way by following the evils of the streets and yet confronted with the positive love of God. Dave must face the pressure of the streets and turning his life around and making a decision on whether to except Christ as he attempts to turn his life around. We often hurt those we love the most. Sometimes it is doing the right thing that takes so much courage.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["A","street","tale","of","redempt","through","the","power","of","a","spiritu","awaken",".","Dave","find","such","an","escap","in","a","negat","way","by","follow","the","evil","of","the","street","and","yet","confront","with","the","posit","love","of","God",".","Dave","must","face","the","pressur","of","the","street","and","turn","his","life","around","and","make","a","decis","on","whether","to","except","Christ","as","he","attempt","to","turn","his","life","around",".","We","often","hurt","those","we","love","the","most",".","Sometim","it","is","do","the","right","thing","that","take","so","much","courag","."],"lemmas":["a","street","tale","of","redemption","through","the","power","of","a","spiritual","awakening",".","Dave","find","such","a","escape","in","a","negative","way","by","follow","the","evil","of","the","street","and","yet","confront","with","the","positive","love","of","God",".","Dave","must","face","the","pressure","of","the","street","and","turn","he","life","around","and","make","a","decision","on","whether","to","except","Christ","as","he","attempt","to","turn","he","life","around",".","we","often","hurt","those","we","love","the","most",".","sometimes","it","be","do","the","right","thing","that","take","so","much","courage","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A street tale","street tale of","tale of redemption","of redemption through","redemption through the","through the power","the power of","power of a","of a spiritual","a spiritual awakening","Dave finds such","finds such an","such an escape","an escape in","escape in a","in a negative","a negative way","negative way by","way by following","by following the","following the evils","the evils of","evils of the","of the streets","the streets and","streets and yet","and yet confronted","yet confronted with","confronted with the","with the positive","the positive love","positive love of","love of God","Dave must face","must face the","face the pressure","the pressure of","pressure of the","of the streets","the streets and","streets and turning","and turning his","turning his life","his life around","life around and","around and making","and making a","making a decision","a decision on","decision on whether","on whether to","whether to except","to except Christ","except Christ as","Christ as he","as he attempts","he attempts to","attempts to turn","to turn his","turn his life","his life around","We often hurt","often hurt those","hurt those we","those we love","we love the","love the most","Sometimes it is","it is doing","is doing the","doing the right","the right thing","right thing that","thing that takes","that takes so","takes so much","so much courage"],"2grams":["A street","street tale","tale of","of redemption","redemption through","through the","the power","power of","of a","a spiritual","spiritual awakening","Dave finds","finds such","such an","an escape","escape in","in a","a negative","negative way","way by","by following","following the","the evils","evils of","of the","the streets","streets and","and yet","yet confronted","confronted with","with the","the positive","positive love","love of","of God","Dave must","must face","face the","the pressure","pressure of","of the","the streets","streets and","and turning","turning his","his life","life around","around and","and making","making a","a decision","decision on","on whether","whether to","to except","except Christ","Christ as","as he","he attempts","attempts to","to turn","turn his","his life","life around","We often","often hurt","hurt those","those we","we love","love the","the most","Sometimes it","it is","is doing","doing the","the right","right thing","thing that","that takes","takes so","so much","much courage"]}

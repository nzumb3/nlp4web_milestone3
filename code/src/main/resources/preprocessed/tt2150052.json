{"title":"For Tom and All Eternity","plot":"Clarita Harbinger - played by Peggy Matheson (Together Forever, Films for Families Series) is an over-anxious undercover policewoman interested in Tom Hansen - played by Drew Martin (Currently off-Broadway), an architect who has what might be the ultimate crappy love life. As he gets close to what seems to be the perfect woman, he starts \"seeing signs\" that tell him to dump her and go off on a quest to find the girl he first kissed in 6th grade, a move that disappoints everyone and even calls the ghost of his favorite school teacher back from the dead to offer advice to fix his love life. Tom spins out of control risking his friendships, job and life as he collides into a twist and unexpected result. A fabulous Rockabilly, Swing, and Country Western music soundtrack really set this cleverly written indie film apart. Based on true events (not including the ghost of the school teacher part). Music by The Honey Bees, Two Timin' Three, Mark Hansen, Jerry HotRod DeMink and Dangerous Dan & The Danger Rangers.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["Clarita","Harbing","-","play","by","Peggi","Matheson","(","Togeth","Forev",",","Film","for","Famili","Seri",")","is","an","over-anxi","undercov","policewoman","interest","in","Tom","Hansen","-","play","by","Drew","Martin","(","Current","off-Broadway",")",",","an","architect","who","has","what","might","be","the","ultim","crappi","love","life",".","As","he","get","close","to","what","seem","to","be","the","perfect","woman",",","he","start","\"","see","sign","\"","that","tell","him","to","dump","her","and","go","off","on","a","quest","to","find","the","girl","he","first","kiss","in","6th","grade",",","a","move","that","disappoint","everyon","and","even","call","the","ghost","of","his","favorit","school","teacher","back","from","the","dead","to","offer","advic","to","fix","his","love","life",".","Tom","spin","out","of","control","risk","his","friendship",",","job","and","life","as","he","collid","into","a","twist","and","unexpect","result",".","A","fabul","Rockabilli",",","Swing",",","and","Countri","Western","music","soundtrack","realli","set","this","clever","written","indi","film","apart",".","Base","on","true","event","(","not","includ","the","ghost","of","the","school","teacher","part",")",".","Music","by","The","Honey","Bee",",","Two","Timin","'","Three",",","Mark","Hansen",",","Jerri","HotRod","DeMink","and","Danger","Dan","&","The","Danger","Ranger","."],"lemmas":["Clarita","Harbinger","-","play","by","Peggy","Matheson","-lrb-","together","forever",",","film","for","family","series","-rrb-","be","a","over-anxious","undercover","policewoman","interested","in","Tom","Hansen","-","play","by","Drew","Martin","-lrb-","Currently","off-broadway","-rrb-",",","a","architect","who","have","what","might","be","the","ultimate","crappy","love","life",".","as","he","get","close","to","what","seem","to","be","the","perfect","woman",",","he","start","``","see","sign","''","that","tell","he","to","dump","she","and","go","off","on","a","quest","to","find","the","girl","he","first","kiss","in","6th","grade",",","a","move","that","disappoint","everyone","and","even","call","the","ghost","of","he","favorite","school","teacher","back","from","the","dead","to","offer","advice","to","fix","he","love","life",".","Tom","spin","out","of","control","risk","he","friendship",",","job","and","life","as","he","collide","into","a","twist","and","unexpected","result",".","a","fabulous","Rockabilly",",","Swing",",","and","Country","Western","music","soundtrack","really","set","this","cleverly","write","indie","film","apart",".","base","on","true","event","-lrb-","not","include","the","ghost","of","the","school","teacher","part","-rrb-",".","music","by","the","Honey","Bees",",","two","timin","'","Three",",","Mark","Hansen",",","Jerry","HotRod","DeMink","and","Dangerous","Dan","&","The","Danger","Rangers","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Clarita

{"title":"Alvaro Siza: Transforming Reality","plot":"In \"Álvaro Siza Transforming Reality\", Portugal's renowned architect discusses his work and tours15 projects with architectural historian Kenneth Frampton, who has referred to Siza as \"one of the most important architects working today\". In 1974 the end of the dictatorship in Portugal opened up this previously isolated part of the world to current ideas about design, architecture and urban planning. 'Critical regionalism', or the melding of indigenous architectural forms with international ideas defined the architectural revolution in and around Oporto, Portugal. This movement became know as 'the Oporto School' of which Siza is the leading figure. Siza's approach to architecture is centered around the idea that the setting of a building is integral to its design, moreover that a structure's design should reinforce its surroundings by both enhancing and highlighting its potential. Frampton discusses with Siza his most significant architectural innovations at the actual sites in Portugal, including his large-scale housing project in Evora, the architecture school of the University in Porto, the Teachers' College in Setúbal and the recent Serralves Museum in Porto .","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","\"","Álvaro","Siza","Transform","Realiti","\"",",","Portug","'s","renown","architect","discuss","his","work","and","tours15","project","with","architectur","historian","Kenneth","Frampton",",","who","has","refer","to","Siza","as","\"","one","of","the","most","import","architect","work","today","\"",".","In","1974","the","end","of","the","dictatorship","in","Portug","open","up","this","previous","isol","part","of","the","world","to","current","idea","about","design",",","architectur","and","urban","plan",".","'","Critic","region","'",",","or","the","meld","of","indigen","architectur","form","with","intern","idea","defin","the","architectur","revolut","in","and","around","Oporto",",","Portug",".","This","movement","becam","know","as","'","the","Oporto","School","'","of","which","Siza","is","the","lead","figur",".","Siza","'s","approach","to","architectur","is","center","around","the","idea","that","the","set","of","a","build","is","integr","to","it","design",",","moreov","that","a","structur","'s","design","should","reinforc","it","surround","by","both","enhanc","and","highlight","it","potenti",".","Frampton","discuss","with","Siza","his","most","signific","architectur","innov","at","the","actual","site","in","Portug",",","includ","his","large-scal","hous","project","in","Evora",",","the","architectur","school","of","the","Univers","in","Porto",",","the","Teacher","'","Colleg","in","Setúbal","and","the","recent","Serralv","Museum","in","Porto","."],"lemmas":["in","``","Álvaro","Siza","transform","reality","''",",","Portugal","'s","renowned","architect","discuss","he","work","and","tours15","project","with","architectural","historian","Kenneth","Frampton",",","who","have","refer","to","Siza","as","``","one","of","the","most","important","architect","work","today","''",".","in","1974","the","end","of","the","dictatorship","in","Portugal","open","up","this","previously","isolate","part","of","the","world","to","current","idea","about","design",",","architecture","and","urban","planning",".","'","critical","regionalism","'",",","or","the","melding","of","indigenous","architectural","form","with","international","idea","define","the","architectural","revolution","in","and","around","Oporto",",","Portugal",".","this","movement","become","know","as","'","the","Oporto","School","'","of","which","Siza","be","the","lead","figure",".","Siza","'s","approach","to","architecture","be","center","around","the","idea","that","the","setting","of","a","building","be","integral","to","its","design",",","moreover","that","a","structure","'s","design","should","reinforce","its","surroundings","by","both","enhance","and","highlight","its","potential",".","Frampton","discuss","with","Siza","he","most","significant","architectural","innovation","at","the","actual","site","in","Portugal",",","include","he","large-scale","housing","project","in","Evora",",","the","architecture","school","of","the","University","in","Porto",",","the","Teachers","'","College","in","Setúbal","and","the","recent","Serralves","Museum","in","Porto","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In \" Álvaro","\" Álvaro Siza","Álvaro Siza Transforming","Siza Transforming Reality","Transforming Reality \"","Reality \" ,","\" , Portugal",", Portugal 's","Portugal 's renowned","'s renowned architect","renowned architect discusses","architect discusses his","discusses his work","his work and","work and tours15","and tours15 projects","tours15 projects with","projects with architectural","with architectural historian","architectural historian Kenneth","historian Kenneth Frampton","Kenneth Frampton ,","Frampton , who",", who has","who has referred","has referred to","referred to Siza","to Siza as","Siza as \"","as \" one","\" one of","one of the","of the most","the most important","most important architects","important architects working","architects working today","working today \"","In 1974 the","1974 the end","the end of","end of the","of the dictatorship","the dictatorship in","dictatorship in Portugal","in Portugal opened","Portugal opened up","opened up this","up this previously","this previously isolated","previously isolated part","isolated part of","part of the","of the world","the world to","world to current","to current ideas","current ideas about","ideas about design","about design ,","design , architecture",", architecture and","architecture and urban","and urban planning","urban planning .","planning .

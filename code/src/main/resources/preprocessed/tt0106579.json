{"title":"Clean, Shaven","plot":"Peter Winter is a young schizophrenic who is desperately trying to get his daughter back from her adoptive family. He attempts to function in a world that, for him, is filled with strange voices, electrical noise, disconcerting images, and jarringly sudden emotional shifts. He clings to his humanity like a raft, barely afloat in a sea of terror. In a brief moment of congruence, he shatters his image reflected in a window, perhaps to more properly align it with his fragmented psyche. During his quest, he runs afoul of the law and an ongoing murder investigation.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Peter","Winter","is","a","young","schizophren","who","is","desper","tri","to","get","his","daughter","back","from","her","adopt","famili",".","He","attempt","to","function","in","a","world","that",",","for","him",",","is","fill","with","strang","voic",",","electr","nois",",","disconcert","imag",",","and","jar","sudden","emot","shift",".","He","cling","to","his","human","like","a","raft",",","bare","afloat","in","a","sea","of","terror",".","In","a","brief","moment","of","congruenc",",","he","shatter","his","imag","reflect","in","a","window",",","perhap","to","more","proper","align","it","with","his","fragment","psych",".","Dure","his","quest",",","he","run","afoul","of","the","law","and","an","ongo","murder","investig","."],"lemmas":["Peter","Winter","be","a","young","schizophrenic","who","be","desperately","try","to","get","he","daughter","back","from","she","adoptive","family",".","he","attempt","to","function","in","a","world","that",",","for","he",",","be","fill","with","strange","voice",",","electrical","noise",",","disconcert","image",",","and","jarringly","sudden","emotional","shift",".","he","cling","to","he","humanity","like","a","raft",",","barely","afloat","in","a","sea","of","terror",".","in","a","brief","moment","of","congruence",",","he","shatter","he","image","reflect","in","a","window",",","perhaps","to","more","properly","align","it","with","he","fragmented","psyche",".","during","he","quest",",","he","run","afoul","of","the","law","and","a","ongoing","murder","investigation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Peter Winter is","Winter is a","is a young","a young schizophrenic","young schizophrenic who","schizophrenic who is","who is desperately","is desperately trying","desperately trying to","trying to get","to get his","get his daughter","his daughter back","daughter back from","back from her","from her adoptive","her adoptive family","He attempts to","attempts to function","to function in","function in a","in a world","a world that","world that ,","that , for",", for him","for him ,","him , is",", is filled","is filled with","filled with strange","with strange voices","strange voices ,","voices , electrical",", electrical noise","electrical noise ,","noise , disconcerting",", disconcerting images","disconcerting images ,","images , and",", and jarringly","and jarringly sudden","jarringly sudden emotional","sudden emotional shifts","He clings to","clings to his","to his humanity","his humanity like","humanity like a","like a raft","a raft ,","raft , barely",", barely afloat","barely afloat in","afloat in a","in a sea","a sea of","sea of terror","In a brief","a brief moment","brief moment of","moment of congruence","of congruence ,","congruence , he",", he shatters","he shatters his","shatters his image","his image reflected","image reflected in","reflected in a","in a window","a window ,","window , perhaps",", perhaps to","perhaps to more","to more properly","more properly align","properly align it","align it with","it with his","with his fragmented","his fragmented psyche","During his quest","his quest ,","quest , he",", he runs","he runs afoul","runs afoul of","afoul of the","of the law","the law and","law and an","and an ongoing","an ongoing murder","ongoing murder investigation"],"2grams":["Peter Winter","Winter is","is a","a young","young schizophrenic","schizophrenic who","who is","is desperately","desperately trying","trying to","to get","get his","his daughter","daughter back","back from","from her","her adoptive","adoptive family","He attempts","attempts to","to function","function in","in a","a world","world that","that ,",", for","for him","him ,",", is","is filled","filled with","with strange","strange voices","voices ,",", electrical","electrical noise","noise ,",", disconcerting","disconcerting images","images ,",", and","and jarringly","jarringly sudden","sudden emotional","emotional shifts","He clings","clings to","to his","his humanity","humanity like","like a","a raft","raft ,",", barely","barely afloat","afloat in","in a","a sea","sea of","of terror","In a","a brief","brief moment","moment of","of congruence","congruence ,",", he","he shatters","shatters his","his image","image reflected","reflected in","in a","a window","window ,",", perhaps","perhaps to","to more","more properly","properly align","align it","it with","with his","his fragmented","fragmented psyche","During his","his quest","quest ,",", he","he runs","runs afoul","afoul of","of the","the law","law and","and an","an ongoing","ongoing murder","murder investigation"]}

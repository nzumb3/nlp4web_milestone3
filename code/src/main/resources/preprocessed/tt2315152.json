{"title":"A Werewolf Boy","plot":"An offer to buy her property brings elderly Kim Sun-yi back to the country cottage she briefly lived in during eventful times in her youth. With her granddaughter by her side, Sun-yi recalls meeting Cheol-su, not only a feral orphan from Korean war days but a mute boy genetically spliced with wolf DNA by a rogue scientist, now deceased. She effectively tames the unsocialized lad through dog obedience training, and he soon becomes more than a loyal companion, protecting her from the rude advances of her late father's business partner's ne'er-do-well, spoiled, self-centered son, Ji-tae, who fully expects Sun-yi to marry him someday. He would claim her as his own sooner than that if not for Cheol-su, who transforms into an unbeatable werewolf anytime someone threatens a member of his pack, leading Ji-tae to work towards a permanent solution to this problem.","genres":["Fantasy"," Romance"],"stems":["An","offer","to","buy","her","properti","bring","elder","Kim","Sun-yi","back","to","the","countri","cottag","she","briefli","live","in","dure","event","time","in","her","youth",".","With","her","granddaught","by","her","side",",","Sun-yi","recal","meet","Cheol-su",",","not","onli","a","feral","orphan","from","Korean","war","day","but","a","mute","boy","genet","splice","with","wolf","DNA","by","a","rogu","scientist",",","now","deceas",".","She","effect","tame","the","unsoci","lad","through","dog","obedi","train",",","and","he","soon","becom","more","than","a","loyal","companion",",","protect","her","from","the","rude","advanc","of","her","late","father","'s","busi","partner","'s","ne'er","-","do-wel",",","spoil",",","self-cent","son",",","Ji-ta",",","who","fulli","expect","Sun-yi","to","marri","him","someday",".","He","would","claim","her","as","his","own","sooner","than","that","if","not","for","Cheol-su",",","who","transform","into","an","unbeat","werewolf","anytim","someon","threaten","a","member","of","his","pack",",","lead","Ji-ta","to","work","toward","a","perman","solut","to","this","problem","."],"lemmas":["a","offer","to","buy","she","property","bring","elderly","Kim","Sun-yi","back","to","the","country","cottage","she","briefly","live","in","during","eventful","time","in","she","youth",".","with","she","granddaughter","by","she","side",",","sun-yi","recall","meet","cheol-su",",","not","only","a","feral","orphan","from","korean","war","day","but","a","mute","boy","genetically","splice","with","wolf","dna","by","a","rogue","scientist",",","now","decease",".","she","effectively","tame","the","unsocialized","lad","through","dog","obedience","training",",","and","he","soon","become","more","than","a","loyal","companion",",","protect","she","from","the","rude","advance","of","she","late","father","'s","business","partner","'s","ne'er","-","do-well",",","spoil",",","self-centered","son",",","ji-tae",",","who","fully","expect","sun-yi","to","marry","he","someday",".","he","would","claim","she","as","he","own","sooner","than","that","if","not","for","cheol-su",",","who","transform","into","a","unbeatable","werewolf","anytime","someone","threaten","a","member","of","he","pack",",","lead","ji-tae","to","work","towards","a","permanent","solution","to","this","problem","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["An offer to","offer to buy","to buy her","buy her property","her property brings","property brings elderly","brings elderly Kim","elderly Kim Sun-yi","Kim Sun-yi back","Sun-yi back to","back to the","to the country","the country cottage","country cottage she","cottage she briefly","she briefly lived","briefly lived in","lived in during","in during eventful","during eventful times","eventful times in","times in her","in her youth","With her granddaughter","her granddaughter by","granddaughter by her","by her side","her side ,","side , Sun-yi",", Sun-yi recalls","Sun-yi recalls meeting","recalls meeting Cheol-su","meeting Cheol-su ,","Cheol-su , not",", not only","not only a","only a feral","a feral orphan","feral orphan from","orphan from Korean","from Korean war","Korean war days","war days but","days but a","but a mute","a mute boy","mute boy genetically","boy genetically spliced","genetically spliced with","spliced with wolf","with wolf DNA","wolf DNA by","DNA by a","by a rogue","a rogue scientist","rogue scientist ,","scientist , now",", now deceased","She effectively tames","effectively tames the","tames the unsocialized","the unsocialized lad","unsocialized lad through","lad through dog","through dog obedience","dog obedience training","obedience training ,","training , and",", and he","and he soon","he soon becomes","soon becomes more","becomes more than","more than a","than a loyal","a loyal companion","loyal companion ,","companion , protecting",", protecting her","protecting her from","her from the","from the rude","the rude advances","rude advances of","advances of her","of her late","her late father","late father 's","father 's business","'s business partner","business partner 's","partner 's ne'er","'s ne'er -","ne'er -

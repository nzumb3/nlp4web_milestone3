{"title":"The King of New Orleans","plot":"Take a little trip through the streets of New Orleans.... Larry Shirt (David Jensen) is a taxi driver whose passengers are the city's hustlers, tourists, socialites, musicians, housekeepers, weirdos and reporters. Bobby Cohn (Richard Brien), Harvard student home from school and in the middle of a personal crisis, is one of those passengers. The circumstances that bring them together lead to a bond that is ultimately turned upside down by Hurricane Katrina, but instilled by the love of the city that they both call home.","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["Take","a","littl","trip","through","the","street","of","New","Orlean","...",".","Larri","Shirt","(","David","Jensen",")","is","a","taxi","driver","whose","passeng","are","the","citi","'s","hustler",",","tourist",",","socialit",",","musician",",","housekeep",",","weirdo","and","report",".","Bobbi","Cohn","(","Richard","Brien",")",",","Harvard","student","home","from","school","and","in","the","middl","of","a","person","crisi",",","is","one","of","those","passeng",".","The","circumst","that","bring","them","togeth","lead","to","a","bond","that","is","ultim","turn","upsid","down","by","Hurrican","Katrina",",","but","instil","by","the","love","of","the","citi","that","they","both","call","home","."],"lemmas":["take","a","little","trip","through","the","street","of","New","Orleans","...",".","Larry","Shirt","-lrb-","David","Jensen","-rrb-","be","a","taxi","driver","whose","passenger","be","the","city","'s","hustler",",","tourist",",","socialite",",","musician",",","housekeeper",",","weirdo","and","reporter",".","Bobby","Cohn","-lrb-","Richard","Brien","-rrb-",",","Harvard","student","home","from","school","and","in","the","middle","of","a","personal","crisis",",","be","one","of","those","passenger",".","the","circumstance","that","bring","they","together","lead","to","a","bond","that","be","ultimately","turn","upside","down","by","Hurricane","Katrina",",","but","instil","by","the","love","of","the","city","that","they","both","call","home","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Take a little","a little trip","little trip through","trip through the","through the streets","the streets of","streets of New","of New Orleans","New Orleans ...","Larry Shirt (","Shirt ( David","( David Jensen","David Jensen )","Jensen ) is",") is a","is a taxi","a taxi driver","taxi driver whose","driver whose passengers","whose passengers are","passengers are the","are the city","the city 's","city 's hustlers","'s hustlers ,","hustlers , tourists",", tourists ,","tourists , socialites",", socialites ,","socialites , musicians",", musicians ,","musicians , housekeepers",", housekeepers ,","housekeepers , weirdos",", weirdos and","weirdos and reporters","Bobby Cohn (","Cohn ( Richard","( Richard Brien","Richard Brien )","Brien ) ,",") , Harvard",", Harvard student","Harvard student home","student home from","home from school","from school and","school and in","and in the","in the middle","the middle of","middle of a","of a personal","a personal crisis","personal crisis ,","crisis , is",", is one","is one of","one of those","of those passengers","The circumstances that","circumstances that bring","that bring them","bring them together","them together lead","together lead to","lead to a","to a bond","a bond that","bond that is","that is ultimately","is ultimately turned","ultimately turned upside","turned upside down","upside down by","down by Hurricane","by Hurricane Katrina","Hurricane Katrina ,","Katrina , but",", but instilled","but instilled by","instilled by the","by the love","the love of","love of the","of the city","the city that","city that they","that they both","they both call","both call home"],"2grams":["Take a","a little","little trip","trip through","through the","the streets","streets of","of New","New Orleans","Orleans ...","Larry Shirt","Shirt (","( David","David Jensen","Jensen )",") is","is a","a taxi","taxi driver","driver whose","whose passengers","passengers are","are the","the city","city 's","'s hustlers","hustlers ,",", tourists","tourists ,",", socialites","socialites ,",", musicians","musicians ,",", housekeepers","housekeepers ,",", weirdos","weirdos and","and reporters","Bobby Cohn","Cohn (","( Richard","Richard Brien","Brien )",") ,",", Harvard","Harvard student","student home","home from","from school","school and","and in","in the","the middle","middle of","of a","a personal","personal crisis","crisis ,",", is","is one","one of","of those","those passengers","The circumstances","circumstances that","that bring","bring them","them together","together lead","lead to","to a","a bond","bond that","that is","is ultimately","ultimately turned","turned upside","upside down","down by","by Hurricane","Hurricane Katrina","Katrina ,",", but","but instilled","instilled by","by the","the love","love of","of the","the city","city that","that they","they both","both call","call home"]}

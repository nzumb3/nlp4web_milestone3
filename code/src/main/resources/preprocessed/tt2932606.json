{"title":"Siddharth","plot":"After sending away his 12 year-old son Siddharth for work, Mahendra (a chain-wallah who specializes in fixing broken zippers on the streets) is relieved as his financial burdens will be alleviated. But when Siddharth fails to return home, Mahendra learns he may have been taken by child-traffickers. With little resources and no connections, he travels across India in pursuit, with the hope that whatever force arbitrarily took his child away will return him unharmed.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["After","send","away","his","12","year-old","son","Siddharth","for","work",",","Mahendra","(","a","chain-wallah","who","special","in","fix","broken","zipper","on","the","street",")","is","reliev","as","his","financi","burden","will","be","allevi",".","But","when","Siddharth","fail","to","return","home",",","Mahendra","learn","he","may","have","been","taken","by","child-traffick",".","With","littl","resourc","and","no","connect",",","he","travel","across","India","in","pursuit",",","with","the","hope","that","whatev","forc","arbitrarili","took","his","child","away","will","return","him","unharm","."],"lemmas":["after","send","away","he","12","year-old","son","siddharth","for","work",",","Mahendra","-lrb-","a","chain-wallah","who","specialize","in","fix","broken","zipper","on","the","street","-rrb-","be","relieve","as","he","financial","burden","will","be","alleviate",".","but","when","Siddharth","fail","to","return","home",",","Mahendra","learn","he","may","have","be","take","by","child-trafficker",".","with","little","resource","and","no","connection",",","he","travel","across","India","in","pursuit",",","with","the","hope","that","whatever","force","arbitrarily","take","he","child","away","will","return","he","unharmed","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["After sending away","sending away his","away his 12","his 12 year-old","12 year-old son","year-old son Siddharth","son Siddharth for","Siddharth for work","for work ,","work , Mahendra",", Mahendra (","Mahendra ( a","( a chain-wallah","a chain-wallah who","chain-wallah who specializes","who specializes in","specializes in fixing","in fixing broken","fixing broken zippers","broken zippers on","zippers on the","on the streets","the streets )","streets ) is",") is relieved","is relieved as","relieved as his","as his financial","his financial burdens","financial burdens will","burdens will be","will be alleviated","But when Siddharth","when Siddharth fails","Siddharth fails to","fails to return","to return home","return home ,","home , Mahendra",", Mahendra learns","Mahendra learns he","learns he may","he may have","may have been","have been taken","been taken by","taken by child-traffickers","With little resources","little resources and","resources and no","and no connections","no connections ,","connections , he",", he travels","he travels across","travels across India","across India in","India in pursuit","in pursuit ,","pursuit , with",", with the","with the hope","the hope that","hope that whatever","that whatever force","whatever force arbitrarily","force arbitrarily took","arbitrarily took his","took his child","his child away","child away will","away will return","will return him","return him unharmed"],"2grams":["After sending","sending away","away his","his 12","12 year-old","year-old son","son Siddharth","Siddharth for","for work","work ,",", Mahendra","Mahendra (","( a","a chain-wallah","chain-wallah who","who specializes","specializes in","in fixing","fixing broken","broken zippers","zippers on","on the","the streets","streets )",") is","is relieved","relieved as","as his","his financial","financial burdens","burdens will","will be","be alleviated","But when","when Siddharth","Siddharth fails","fails to","to return","return home","home ,",", Mahendra","Mahendra learns","learns he","he may","may have","have been","been taken","taken by","by child-traffickers","With little","little resources","resources and","and no","no connections","connections ,",", he","he travels","travels across","across India","India in","in pursuit","pursuit ,",", with","with the","the hope","hope that","that whatever","whatever force","force arbitrarily","arbitrarily took","took his","his child","child away","away will","will return","return him","him unharmed"]}

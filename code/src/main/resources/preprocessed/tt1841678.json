{"title":"Just Around the Corner","plot":"The dictionary defines the word 'extraordinary' as going beyond what is usual. This word perfectly describes Bob Benjamin's life. Being diagnosed with Parkinson's disease at the young age of 38 was a quite blow to Bob. Instead of letting the disease dictate his future he chose to take the fight to Parkinson's. He recruited his friends, many of whom were musicians he had worked with in the past, to help fight the disease. To date, that fight has raised 1.5 million dollars to fund research that will one day just around the corner, produce a cure.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","dictionari","defin","the","word","'","extraordinari","'","as","go","beyond","what","is","usual",".","This","word","perfect","describ","Bob","Benjamin","'s","life",".","Be","diagnos","with","Parkinson","'s","diseas","at","the","young","age","of","38","was","a","quit","blow","to","Bob",".","Instead","of","let","the","diseas","dictat","his","futur","he","chose","to","take","the","fight","to","Parkinson","'s",".","He","recruit","his","friend",",","mani","of","whom","were","musician","he","had","work","with","in","the","past",",","to","help","fight","the","diseas",".","To","date",",","that","fight","has","rais","1.5","million","dollar","to","fund","research","that","will","one","day","just","around","the","corner",",","produc","a","cure","."],"lemmas":["the","dictionary","define","the","word","'","extraordinary","'","as","go","beyond","what","be","usual",".","this","word","perfectly","describe","Bob","Benjamin","'s","life",".","be","diagnose","with","Parkinson","'s","disease","at","the","young","age","of","38","be","a","quite","blow","to","Bob",".","instead","of","let","the","disease","dictate","he","future","he","choose","to","take","the","fight","to","Parkinson","'s",".","he","recruit","he","friend",",","many","of","whom","be","musician","he","have","work","with","in","the","past",",","to","help","fight","the","disease",".","to","date",",","that","fight","have","raise","1.5","million","dollar","to","fund","research","that","will","one","day","just","around","the","corner",",","produce","a","cure","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The dictionary defines","dictionary defines the","defines the word","the word '","word ' extraordinary","' extraordinary '","extraordinary ' as","' as going","as going beyond","going beyond what","beyond what is","what is usual","This word perfectly","word perfectly describes","perfectly describes Bob","describes Bob Benjamin","Bob Benjamin 's","Benjamin 's life","Being diagnosed with","diagnosed with Parkinson","with Parkinson 's","Parkinson 's disease","'s disease at","disease at the","at the young","the young age","young age of","age of 38","of 38 was","38 was a","was a quite","a quite blow","quite blow to","blow to Bob","Instead of letting","of letting the","letting the disease","the disease dictate","disease dictate his","dictate his future","his future he","future he chose","he chose to","chose to take","to take the","take the fight","the fight to","fight to Parkinson","to Parkinson 's","He recruited his","recruited his friends","his friends ,","friends , many",", many of","many of whom","of whom were","whom were musicians","were musicians he","musicians he had","he had worked","had worked with","worked with in","with in the","in the past","the past ,","past , to",", to help","to help fight","help fight the","fight the disease","To date ,","date , that",", that fight","that fight has","fight has raised","has raised 1.5","raised 1.5 million","1.5 million dollars","million dollars to","dollars to fund","to fund research","fund research that","research that will","that will one","will one day","one day just","day just around","just around the","around the corner","the corner ,","corner , produce",", produce a","produce a cure"],"2grams":["The dictionary","dictionary defines","defines the","the word","word '","' extraordinary","extraordinary '","' as","as going","going beyond","beyond what","what is","is usual","This word","word perfectly","perfectly describes","describes Bob","Bob Benjamin","Benjamin 's","'s life","Being diagnosed","diagnosed with","with Parkinson","Parkinson 's","'s disease","disease at","at the","the young","young age","age of","of 38","38 was","was a","a quite","quite blow","blow to","to Bob","Instead of","of letting","letting the","the disease","disease dictate","dictate his","his future","future he","he chose","chose to","to take","take the","the fight","fight to","to Parkinson","Parkinson 's","He recruited","recruited his","his friends","friends ,",", many","many of","of whom","whom were","were musicians","musicians he","he had","had worked","worked with","with in","in the","the past","past ,",", to","to help","help fight","fight the","the disease","To date","date ,",", that","that fight","fight has","has raised","raised 1.5","1.5 million","million dollars","dollars to","to fund","fund research","research that","that will","will one","one day","day just","just around","around the","the corner","corner ,",", produce","produce a","a cure"]}

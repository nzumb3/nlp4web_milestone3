{"title":"Bidder 70","plot":"The story of Tim DeChristopher, a young man who disrupted a controversial BLM Oil and Gas leasing auction in 2008. He posed as a bidder (#70) and bid $1.7 million to win 22,000 acres of land he had no intention of paying for (or drilling on). Tim was federally indicted, convicted and sentenced to two years in prison for his courageous act of civil disobedience. Bidder 70 is a personal story surrounded by a wider context of citizen action, our history of peaceful civil disobedience, and grass roots movements demanding government and industry accountability.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Crime"],"stems":["The","stori","of","Tim","DeChristoph",",","a","young","man","who","disrupt","a","controversi","BLM","Oil","and","Gas","leas","auction","in","2008",".","He","pose","as","a","bidder","(","#","70",")","and","bid","$","1.7","million","to","win","22,000","acr","of","land","he","had","no","intent","of","pay","for","(","or","drill","on",")",".","Tim","was","feder","indict",",","convict","and","sentenc","to","two","year","in","prison","for","his","courag","act","of","civil","disobedi",".","Bidder","70","is","a","person","stori","surround","by","a","wider","context","of","citizen","action",",","our","histori","of","peac","civil","disobedi",",","and","grass","root","movement","demand","govern","and","industri","account","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","Tim","DeChristopher",",","a","young","man","who","disrupt","a","controversial","BLM","Oil","and","Gas","leasing","auction","in","2008",".","he","pose","as","a","bidder","-lrb-","#","70","-rrb-","and","bid","$","1.7","million","to","win","22,000","acre","of","land","he","have","no","intention","of","pay","for","-lrb-","or","drilling","on","-rrb-",".","Tim","be","federally","indict",",","convict","and","sentence","to","two","year","in","prison","for","he","courageous","act","of","civil","disobedience",".","bidder","70","be","a","personal","story","surround","by","a","wider","context","of","citizen","action",",","we","history","of","peaceful","civil","disobedience",",","and","grass","root","movement","demand","government","and","industry","accountability","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The story of","story of Tim","of Tim DeChristopher","Tim DeChristopher ,","DeChristopher , a",", a young","a young man","young man who","man who disrupted","who disrupted a","disrupted a controversial","a controversial BLM","controversial BLM Oil","BLM Oil and","Oil and Gas","and Gas leasing","Gas leasing auction","leasing auction in","auction in 2008","He posed as","posed as a","as a bidder","a bidder (","bidder ( #","( # 70","# 70 )","70 ) and",") and bid","and bid $","bid $ 1.7","$ 1.7 million","1.7 million to","million to win","to win 22,000","win 22,000 acres","22,000 acres of","acres of land","of land he","land he had","he had no","had no intention","no intention of","intention of paying","of paying for","paying for (","for ( or","( or drilling","or drilling on","drilling on )","Tim was federally","was federally indicted","federally indicted ,","indicted , convicted",", convicted and","convicted and sentenced","and sentenced to","sentenced to two","to two years","two years in","years in prison","in prison for","prison for his","for his courageous","his courageous act","courageous act of","act of civil","of civil disobedience","Bidder 70 is","70 is a","is a personal","a personal story","personal story surrounded","story surrounded by","surrounded by a","by a wider","a wider context","wider context of","context of citizen","of citizen action","citizen action ,","action , our",", our history","our history of","history of peaceful","of peaceful civil","peaceful civil disobedience","civil disobedience ,","disobedience , and",", and grass","and grass roots","grass roots movements","roots movements demanding","movements demanding government","demanding government and","government and industry","and industry accountability"],"2grams":["The story","story of","of Tim","Tim DeChristopher","DeChristopher ,",", a","a young","young man","man who","who disrupted","disrupted a","a controversial","controversial BLM","BLM Oil","Oil and","and Gas","Gas leasing","leasing auction","auction in","in 2008","He posed","posed as","as a","a bidder","bidder (","( #","# 70","70 )",") and","and bid","bid $","$ 1.7","1.7 million","million to","to win","win 22,000","22,000 acres","acres of","of land","land he","he had","had no","no intention","intention of","of paying","paying for","for (","( or","or drilling","drilling on","on )","Tim was","was federally","federally indicted","indicted ,",", convicted","convicted and","and sentenced","sentenced to","to two","two years","years in","in prison","prison for","for his","his courageous","courageous act","act of","of civil","civil disobedience","Bidder 70","70 is","is a","a personal","personal story","story surrounded","surrounded by","by a","a wider","wider context","context of","of citizen","citizen action","action ,",", our","our history","history of","of peaceful","peaceful civil","civil disobedience","disobedience ,",", and","and grass","grass roots","roots movements","movements demanding","demanding government","government and","and industry","industry accountability"]}

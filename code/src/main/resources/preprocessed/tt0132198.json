{"title":"Grüningers Fall","plot":"The Grüninger case from Switzerland. This is a documentary about a police officer who showed civil courage back in the forties when he led many refugees fleeing German Nazi terror immigrate to Switzerland, although he was advised not to do so. Grüninger later was sued by the state of Switzerland, lost his job and died in the early seventies. The film constructs a just lawsuit with eye-witnesses and thus fully legitimates what Grüninger did.","genres":["Biography"," War"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Grüninger","case","from","Switzerland",".","This","is","a","documentari","about","a","polic","offic","who","show","civil","courag","back","in","the","forti","when","he","led","mani","refuge","flee","German","Nazi","terror","immigr","to","Switzerland",",","although","he","was","advis","not","to","do","so",".","Grüninger","later","was","su","by","the","state","of","Switzerland",",","lost","his","job","and","die","in","the","earli","seventi",".","The","film","construct","a","just","lawsuit","with","eye-wit","and","thus","fulli","legitim","what","Grüninger","did","."],"lemmas":["the","Grüninger","case","from","Switzerland",".","this","be","a","documentary","about","a","police","officer","who","show","civil","courage","back","in","the","forty","when","he","lead","many","refugee","flee","German","Nazi","terror","immigrate","to","Switzerland",",","although","he","be","advise","not","to","do","so",".","Grüninger","later","be","sue","by","the","state","of","Switzerland",",","lose","he","job","and","die","in","the","early","seventy",".","the","film","construct","a","just","lawsuit","with","eye-witness","and","thus","fully","legitimate","what","Grüninger","do","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Grüninger case","Grüninger case from","case from Switzerland","This is a","is a documentary","a documentary about","documentary about a","about a police","a police officer","police officer who","officer who showed","who showed civil","showed civil courage","civil courage back","courage back in","back in the","in the forties","the forties when","forties when he","when he led","he led many","led many refugees","many refugees fleeing","refugees fleeing German","fleeing German Nazi","German Nazi terror","Nazi terror immigrate","terror immigrate to","immigrate to Switzerland","to Switzerland ,","Switzerland , although",", although he","although he was","he was advised","was advised not","advised not to","not to do","to do so","Grüninger later was","later was sued","was sued by","sued by the","by the state","the state of","state of Switzerland","of Switzerland ,","Switzerland , lost",", lost his","lost his job","his job and","job and died","and died in","died in the","in the early","the early seventies","The film constructs","film constructs a","constructs a just","a just lawsuit","just lawsuit with","lawsuit with eye-witnesses","with eye-witnesses and","eye-witnesses and thus","and thus fully","thus fully legitimates","fully legitimates what","legitimates what Grüninger","what Grüninger did"],"2grams":["The Grüninger","Grüninger case","case from","from Switzerland","This is","is a","a documentary","documentary about","about a","a police","police officer","officer who","who showed","showed civil","civil courage","courage back","back in","in the","the forties","forties when","when he","he led","led many","many refugees","refugees fleeing","fleeing German","German Nazi","Nazi terror","terror immigrate","immigrate to","to Switzerland","Switzerland ,",", although","although he","he was","was advised","advised not","not to","to do","do so","Grüninger later","later was","was sued","sued by","by the","the state","state of","of Switzerland","Switzerland ,",", lost","lost his","his job","job and","and died","died in","in the","the early","early seventies","The film","film constructs","constructs a","a just","just lawsuit","lawsuit with","with eye-witnesses","eye-witnesses and","and thus","thus fully","fully legitimates","legitimates what","what Grüninger","Grüninger did"]}

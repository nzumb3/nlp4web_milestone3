{"title":"Losing God","plot":"Josh Preville was a born-again Pentecostal Christian for many years. Today, he is an atheist. In this riveting and often shocking documentary, Josh engages in discussions with various members of the Christian faith, separating these discussions with segments from a letter he wrote to family explaining his decision to leave the faith and shocking statistics about popular issues that plague the nation today. Scenes from this movie include believers discussing their willingness to kill their children for God, belief in demonic warfare and evil spirits, personal stories of exorcisms by a retired psychologist, sensitive family debates between a Christian father and his atheist son, discussions of evolution and science, the separation of church and state, the definition of atheism and agnosticism, the power of prayer and Bible reading to cure mental illness, gay marriage, and

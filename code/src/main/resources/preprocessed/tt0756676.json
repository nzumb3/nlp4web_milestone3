{"title":"Lenz","plot":"The filmmaker Lenz has left his native Berlin for the Vosges to research the story behind Georg Büchner's novel fragment Lenz. But he soon trades the Alsatian landscape for higher altitudes and more emotional territory: a reunion with his estranged wife Natalie and their son Noah in the Swiss Alps. Like his literary counterpart, the modern-day Lenz follows the Romantic motto: Genius writes its own rules. Against a background of kitsch global tourism - provided by the authentic Zermatt locations - Thomas Imbach's Lenz portrays an unconventional family and a man struggling between euphoria and desperation.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","filmmak","Lenz","has","left","his","nativ","Berlin","for","the","Vosg","to","research","the","stori","behind","Georg","Büchner","'s","novel","fragment","Lenz",".","But","he","soon","trade","the","Alsatian","landscap","for","higher","altitud","and","more","emot","territori",":","a","reunion","with","his","estrang","wife","Natali","and","their","son","Noah","in","the","Swiss","Alps",".","Like","his","literari","counterpart",",","the","modern-day","Lenz","follow","the","Romant","motto",":","Genius","write","it","own","rule",".","Against","a","background","of","kitsch","global","tourism","-","provid","by","the","authent","Zermatt","locat","-","Thoma","Imbach","'s","Lenz","portray","an","unconvent","famili","and","a","man","struggl","between","euphoria","and","desper","."],"lemmas":["the","filmmaker","Lenz","have","leave","he","native","Berlin","for","the","Vosges","to","research","the","story","behind","Georg","Büchner","'s","novel","fragment","Lenz",".","but","he","soon","trade","the","alsatian","landscape","for","higher","altitude","and","more","emotional","territory",":","a","reunion","with","he","estrange","wife","natalie","and","they","son","Noah","in","the","Swiss","Alps",".","like","he","literary","counterpart",",","the","modern-day","Lenz","follow","the","romantic","motto",":","genius","write","its","own","rule",".","against","a","background","of","kitsch","global","tourism","-","provide","by","the","authentic","Zermatt","location","-","Thomas","Imbach","'s","Lenz","portray","a","unconventional","family","and","a","man","struggle","between","euphoria","and","desperation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The filmmaker Lenz","filmmaker Lenz has","Lenz has left","has left his","left his native","his native Berlin","native Berlin for","Berlin for the","for the Vosges","the Vosges to","Vosges to research","to research the","research the story","the story behind","story behind Georg","behind Georg Büchner","Georg Büchner 's","Büchner 's novel","'s novel fragment","novel fragment Lenz","But he soon","he soon trades","soon trades the","trades the Alsatian","the Alsatian landscape","Alsatian landscape for","landscape for higher","for higher altitudes","higher altitudes and","altitudes and more","and more emotional","more emotional territory","emotional territory :","territory : a",": a reunion","a reunion with","reunion with his","with his estranged","his estranged wife","estranged wife Natalie","wife Natalie and","Natalie and their","and their son","their son Noah","son Noah in","Noah in the","in the Swiss","the Swiss Alps","Like his literary","his literary counterpart","literary counterpart ,","counterpart , the",", the modern-day","the modern-day Lenz","modern-day Lenz follows","Lenz follows the","follows the Romantic","the Romantic motto","Romantic motto :","motto : Genius",": Genius writes","Genius writes its","writes its own","its own rules","Against a background","a background of","background of kitsch","of kitsch global","kitsch global tourism","global tourism -","tourism -

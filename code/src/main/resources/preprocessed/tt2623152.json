{"title":"Metamorphosen","plot":"Settled somewhere in nowhere in the south Ural region in Russia, the film tells the story of people living in one of the most radioactive contaminated spots on earth. Unknown to a wide public, this region was repeatedly irradiated by different accident of the nuclear facility Mayak, which was the first plant for the production of fissile material for nuclear weapons in the Soviet Union and which is still in operation. Rather than an investigative flick, the filmmakers attempt is to find a cinematic translation for a danger that is not perceptible nor visual and to capture the strenght of people and nature who has to cope with it.","genres":["Documentary","

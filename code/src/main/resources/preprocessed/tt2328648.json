{"title":"Room Enough For Two: The Life of Dorothy Parker","plot":"Helen Reddy, writer of 'I am Woman!', writes ... 'Terrie Frankel is one of the most underrated songwriters in the US and I have loved her work for many years. Together with her late twin, Jennie, they wrote many wonderful songs as well as books and music for several productions.' Room Enough For Two - The Life of Dorothy Parker, written, produced and starring Terrie Frankel, is a 'tour de force' one woman musical tribute to the most celebrated, yet forgotten female humorist of the early 20th Century. In these challenging economic times, the story of Dorothy Parker, founder of the Algonquin Round Table, highest paid female screenwriter during the Depression, Black Listed in Hollywood, is relative and meaningful and an inspiration to women everywhere.","genres":["Biography"," Musical"," Music"],"stems":["Helen","Reddi",",","writer","of","'","I","am","Woman","!","'",",","write","...","'","Terri","Frankel","is","one","of","the","most","underr","songwrit","in","the","US","and","I","have","love","her","work","for","mani","year",".","Togeth","with","her","late","twin",",","Jenni",",","they","wrote","mani","wonder","song","as","well","as","book","and","music","for","sever","product",".","'","Room","Enough","For","Two","-","The","Life","of","Dorothi","Parker",",","written",",","produc","and","star","Terri","Frankel",",","is","a","'","tour","de","forc","'","one","woman","music","tribut","to","the","most","celebr",",","yet","forgotten","femal","humorist","of","the","earli","20th","Centuri",".","In","these","challeng","econom","time",",","the","stori","of","Dorothi","Parker",",","founder","of","the","Algonquin","Round","Tabl",",","highest","paid","femal","screenwrit","dure","the","Depress",",","Black","List","in","Hollywood",",","is","relat","and","meaning","and","an","inspir","to","women","everywher","."],"lemmas":["Helen","Reddy",",","writer","of","'","I","be","Woman","!","'",",","write","...","'","Terrie","Frankel","be","one","of","the","most","underrated","songwriter","in","the","US","and","I","have","love","she","work","for","many","year",".","together","with","she","late","twin",",","Jennie",",","they","write","many","wonderful","song","as","well","as","book","and","music","for","several","production",".","'","Room","Enough","for","two","-","the","Life","of","Dorothy","Parker",",","write",",","produce","and","star","Terrie","Frankel",",","be","a","'","tour","de","force","'","one","woman","musical","tribute","to","the","most","celebrated",",","yet","forget","female","humorist","of","the","early","20th","Century",".","in","these","challenging","economic","time",",","the","story","of","Dorothy","Parker",",","founder","of","the","Algonquin","Round","Table",",","highest","pay","female","screenwriter","during","the","Depression",",","Black","Listed","in","Hollywood",",","be","relative","and","meaningful","and","a","inspiration","to","woman","everywhere","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Helen Reddy ,","Reddy , writer",", writer of","writer of '","of ' I","' I am","I am Woman","am Woman !","Woman !

{"title":"Bachke Rehna Re Baba","plot":"Rukmini is well into her early 40s and is still unmarried. She decides to let her orphaned niece, Padmini, live with her, and together they device a scheme to entrap wealthy men, relieve them of their money, abandon them, and move on to better targets. They do succeed for quite a while, assuming various disguises, and names, amassing a vast fortune, until Padmini falls in love with one of her targets, a young man named Raghu, and decides to call it quits. An unstable Rukmini, who owes money to Monty, decides she cannot go it alone and concocts a scheme that will force Padmini to give up on Raghu and re-join forces with her to go on philandering unsuspecting wealthy men. Rukmini's first move is to seduce an equally unsuspecting Raghu and ensure that Padmini is a witness to this. The question remains, will a street-smart Padmini allow herself to be taken in by her aunt?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Rukmini","is","well","into","her","earli","40s","and","is","still","unmarri",".","She","decid","to","let","her","orphan","niec",",","Padmini",",","live","with","her",",","and","togeth","they","devic","a","scheme","to","entrap","wealthi","men",",","reliev","them","of","their","money",",","abandon","them",",","and","move","on","to","better","target",".","They","do","succeed","for","quit","a","while",",","assum","various","disguis",",","and","name",",","amass","a","vast","fortun",",","until","Padmini","fall","in","love","with","one","of","her","target",",","a","young","man","name","Raghu",",","and","decid","to","call","it","quit",".","An","unstabl","Rukmini",",","who","owe","money","to","Monti",",","decid","she","can","not","go","it","alon","and","concoct","a","scheme","that","will","forc","Padmini","to","give","up","on","Raghu","and","re-join","forc","with","her","to","go","on","philand","unsuspect","wealthi","men",".","Rukmini","'s","first","move","is","to","seduc","an","equal","unsuspect","Raghu","and","ensur","that","Padmini","is","a","wit","to","this",".","The","question","remain",",","will","a","street-smart","Padmini","allow","herself","to","be","taken","in","by","her","aunt","?"],"lemmas":["Rukmini","be","well","into","she","early","40","and","be","still","unmarried",".","she","decide","to","let","she","orphan","niece",",","Padmini",",","live","with","she",",","and","together","they","device","a","scheme","to","entrap","wealthy","man",",","relieve","they","of","they","money",",","abandon","they",",","and","move","on","to","better","target",".","they","do","succeed","for","quite","a","while",",","assume","various","disguise",",","and","name",",","amass","a","vast","fortune",",","until","Padmini","fall","in","love","with","one","of","she","target",",","a","young","man","name","Raghu",",","and","decide","to","call","it","quit",".","a","unstable","Rukmini",",","who","owe","money","to","Monty",",","decide","she","can","not","go","it","alone","and","concoct","a","scheme","that","will","force","Padmini","to","give","up","on","Raghu","and","re-join","force","with","she","to","go","on","philander","unsuspecting","wealthy","man",".","Rukmini","'s","first","move","be","to","seduce","a","equally","unsuspecting","Raghu","and","ensure","that","Padmini","be","a","witness","to","this",".","the","question","remain",",","will","a","street-smart","Padmini","allow","herself","to","be","take","in","by","she","aunt","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Rukmini

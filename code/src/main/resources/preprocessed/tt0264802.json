{"title":"Live Nude Girls Unite!","plot":"Documentary look at the 1996-97 effort of the dancers and support staff at a San Francisco peep show, The Lusty Lady, to unionize. Angered by arbitrary and race-based wage policies, customers' surreptitious video cameras, and no paid sick days or holidays, the dancers get help from the Service Employees International local and enter protracted bargaining with the union-busting law firm that management hires. We see the women work, sort out their demands, and go through the difficulties of bargaining. The narrator is Julia Query, a dancer and stand-up comedian who is reluctant to tell her mother, a physician who works with prostitutes, that she strips.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Documentari","look","at","the","1996-97","effort","of","the","dancer","and","support","staff","at","a","San","Francisco","peep","show",",","The","Lusti","Ladi",",","to","union",".","Angere","by","arbitrari","and","race-bas","wage","polici",",","custom","'","surreptiti","video","camera",",","and","no","paid","sick","day","or","holiday",",","the","dancer","get","help","from","the","Servic","Employe","Internat","local","and","enter","protract","bargain","with","the","union-bust","law","firm","that","manag","hire",".","We","see","the","women","work",",","sort","out","their","demand",",","and","go","through","the","difficulti","of","bargain",".","The","narrat","is","Julia","Queri",",","a","dancer","and","stand-up","comedian","who","is","reluct","to","tell","her","mother",",","a","physician","who","work","with","prostitut",",","that","she","strip","."],"lemmas":["documentary","look","at","the","1996-97","effort","of","the","dancer","and","support","staff","at","a","San","Francisco","peep","show",",","the","lusty","lady",",","to","unionize",".","anger","by","arbitrary","and","race-based","wage","policy",",","customer","'","surreptitious","video","camera",",","and","no","pay","sick","day","or","holiday",",","the","dancer","get","help","from","the","Service","Employees","International","local","and","enter","protracted","bargaining","with","the","union-busting","law","firm","that","management","hire",".","we","see","the","woman","work",",","sort","out","they","demand",",","and","go","through","the","difficulty","of","bargaining",".","the","narrator","be","Julia","Query",",","a","dancer","and","stand-up","comedian","who","be","reluctant","to","tell","she","mother",",","a","physician","who","work","with","prostitute",",","that","she","strip","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Documentary

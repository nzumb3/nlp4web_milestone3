The film \"Following the Trail of a Lost Collection\" tells the story of this collection, a story of robbery, political intrigues and greed, full of dramatic events.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","confus","of","the","end","of","the","second","world","war","and","the","follow","year",",","precious","paint",",","sculptur",",","book","and","other","object","disappear","as","war-booti","to","Russia",".","Until","recent",",","among","these","miss","art","object","was","a","uniqu","collect","of","draw","by","ancient","European","master","such","as","Rembrandt",",","Dürer",",","Holbein",",","Grünewald",",","Titiaan","and","Tintoretto",",","which","onc","belong","to","the","Dutch","banker","and","art","collector","Franz","Koenig",".","The","film","\"","Follow","the","Trail","of","a","Lost","Collect","\"","tell","the","stori","of","this","collect",",","a","stori","of","robberi",",","polit","intrigu","and","greed",",","full","of","dramat","event","."],"lemmas":["in","the","confusion","of","the","end","of","the","second","world","war","and","the","following","year",",","precious","painting",",","sculpture",",","book","and","other","object","disappear","as","war-booty","to","Russia",".","until","recently",",","among","these","miss","art","object","be","a","unique","collection","of","drawing","by","ancient","european","master","such","as","Rembrandt",",","Dürer",",","Holbein",",","Grünewald",",","Titiaan","and","Tintoretto",",","which","once","belong","to","the","dutch","banker","and","art","collector","Franz","Koenigs",".","the","film","``","follow","the","trail","of","a","Lost","Collection","''","tell","the","story","of","this","collection",",","a","story","of","robbery",",","political","intrigue","and","greed",",","full","of","dramatic","event","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

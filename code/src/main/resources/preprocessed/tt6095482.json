{"title":"The Lambirds","plot":"In January 2015 sixty-eight young students from both Nepal and India borrowed money from banks and loan sharks and bid their families farewell in hopes of finding a better future in North America. 'Lambirds Academy' offered them 8 months of education as well a secured job and a visa in exchange for $10,000. Upon the completion of their degree in St. Lucia, an island in the Caribbean, they were promised a job on board a cruise ship, as well as the opportunity to further their education in a 'sister school' in California. When the students arrived on February 2015 to St. Lucia, a paradise for honeymooners, they found what 'Lambirds Academy' was. Nothing but an empty room above a grocery store; no teachers, no classes. With no money, no job, no home and their passports confiscated, the students were left stranded on the island. For a year, they have tried to face the ones who scammed them in court to attempt to recuperate what was taken from them. This is a journey in every sense of the word. A quest to get back what was taken from them.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Januari","2015","sixty-eight","young","student","from","both","Nepal","and","India","borrow","money","from","bank","and","loan","shark","and","bid","their","famili","farewel","in","hope","of","find","a","better","futur","in","North","America",".","'","Lambird","Academi","'","offer","them","8","month","of","educ","as","well","a","secur","job","and","a","visa","in","exchang","for","$","10,000",".","Upon","the","complet","of","their","degre","in","St.","Lucia",",","an","island","in","the","Caribbean",",","they","were","promis","a","job","on","board","a","cruis","ship",",","as","well","as","the","opportun","to","further","their","educ","in","a","'","sister","school","'","in","California",".","When","the","student","arriv","on","Februari","2015","to","St.","Lucia",",","a","paradis","for","honeymoon",",","they","found","what","'","Lambird","Academi","'","was",".","Noth","but","an","empti","room","abov","a","groceri","store",";","no","teacher",",","no","class",".","With","no","money",",","no","job",",","no","home","and","their","passport","confisc",",","the","student","were","left","strand","on","the","island",".","For","a","year",",","they","have","tri","to","face","the","one","who","scam","them","in","court","to","attempt","to","recuper","what","was","taken","from","them",".","This","is","a","journey","in","everi","sens","of","the","word",".","A","quest","to","get","back","what","was","taken","from","them","."],"lemmas":["in","January","2015","sixty-eight","young","student","from","both","Nepal","and","India","borrow","money","from","bank","and","loan","shark","and","bid","they","family","farewell","in","hope","of","find","a","better","future","in","North","America",".","'","Lambirds","Academy","'","offer","they","8","month","of","education","as","well","a","secured","job","and","a","visa","in","exchange","for","$","10,000",".","upon","the","completion","of","they","degree","in","St.","Lucia",",","a","island","in","the","Caribbean",",","they","be","promise","a","job","on","board","a","cruise","ship",",","as","well","as","the","opportunity","to","further","they","education","in","a","'","sister","school","'","in","California",".","when","the","student","arrive","on","February","2015","to","St.","Lucia",",","a","paradise","for","honeymooner",",","they","find","what","'","Lambirds","Academy","'","be",".","nothing","but","a","empty","room","above","a","grocery","store",";","no","teacher",",","no","class",".","with","no","money",",","no","job",",","no","home","and","they","passport","confiscate",",","the","student","be","left","strand","on","the","island",".","for","a","year",",","they","have","try","to","face","the","one","who","scam","they","in","court","to","attempt","to","recuperate","what","be","take","from","they",".","this","be","a","journey","in","every","sense","of","the","word",".","a","quest","to","get","back","what","be","take","from","they","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In January 2015","January 2015 sixty-eight","2015 sixty-eight young","sixty-eight young students","young students from","students from both","from both Nepal","both Nepal and","Nepal and India","and India borrowed","India borrowed money","borrowed money from","money from banks","from banks and","banks and loan","and loan sharks","loan sharks and","sharks and bid","and bid their","bid their families","their families farewell","families farewell in","farewell in hopes","in hopes of","hopes of finding","of finding a","finding a better","a better future","better future in","future in North","in North America","North America .","America .

{"title":"Scarred Lands and Wounded Lives (60)","plot":"In all its stages, from the production of weapons through combat to cleanup and restoration, war entails actions that pollute land, air, and water, destroy biodiversity, and drain natural resources. Yet the environmental damage occasioned by war and preparation for war is routinely underestimated, under reported, even ignored. The environment remains war's 'silent casualty.' This shorter, one hour version, of the feature length film by the same name is a powerful reminder of the true impact of war throughout our history.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," History"],"stems":["In","all","it","stage",",","from","the","product","of","weapon","through","combat","to","cleanup","and","restor",",","war","entail","action","that","pollut","land",",","air",",","and","water",",","destroy","biodivers",",","and","drain","natur","resourc",".","Yet","the","environment","damag","occas","by","war","and","prepar","for","war","is","routin","underestim",",","under","report",",","even","ignor",".","The","environ","remain","war","'s","'","silent","casualti",".","'","This","shorter",",","one","hour","version",",","of","the","featur","length","film","by","the","same","name","is","a","power","remind","of","the","true","impact","of","war","throughout","our","histori","."],"lemmas":["in","all","its","stage",",","from","the","production","of","weapon","through","combat","to","cleanup","and","restoration",",","war","entail","action","that","pollute","land",",","air",",","and","water",",","destroy","biodiversity",",","and","drain","natural","resource",".","yet","the","environmental","damage","occasion","by","war","and","preparation","for","war","be","routinely","underestimate",",","under","report",",","even","ignore",".","the","environment","remain","war","'s","'","silent","casualty",".","'","this","shorter",",","one","hour","version",",","of","the","feature","length","film","by","the","same","name","be","a","powerful","reminder","of","the","true","impact","of","war","throughout","we","history","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["In all its","all its stages","its stages ,","stages , from",", from the","from the production","the production of","production of weapons","of weapons through","weapons through combat","through combat to","combat to cleanup","to cleanup and","cleanup and restoration","and restoration ,","restoration , war",", war entails","war entails actions","entails actions that","actions that pollute","that pollute land","pollute land ,","land , air",", air ,","air , and",", and water","and water ,","water , destroy",", destroy biodiversity","destroy biodiversity ,","biodiversity , and",", and drain","and drain natural","drain natural resources","Yet the environmental","the environmental damage","environmental damage occasioned","damage occasioned by","occasioned by war","by war and","war and preparation","and preparation for","preparation for war","for war is","war is routinely","is routinely underestimated","routinely underestimated ,","underestimated , under",", under reported","under reported ,","reported , even",", even ignored","The environment remains","environment remains war","remains war 's","war 's '","'s ' silent","' silent casualty","silent casualty .","casualty .

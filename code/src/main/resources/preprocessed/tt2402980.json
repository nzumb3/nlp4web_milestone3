{"title":"Birdmen: The Original Dream of Human Flight","plot":"These are the men and women who fly like birds. Matt, Ellen and Mike are wingsuit B.A.S.E. jumpers, taking part in the ultimate extreme sport which allows human beings to fly. Birdmen captures their experiences in stunning aerial camera work to bring us as close as possible to the sensation of human flight. Historically these \"birdmen\" have always eventually plunged to their death: Otto Lilienthal, Clem Sohn and Leo Valentin. But now new developments in wingsuits have made the extraordinary sport a little safer, and it shows signs of becoming increasingly popular. These adrenaline-driven B.A.S.E. jumpers are pushing the limits of what humans can do, risking their lives for the glorious moment of flight.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["These","are","the","men","and","women","who","fli","like","bird",".","Matt",",","Ellen","and","Mike","are","wingsuit","B.A.S.E.","jumper",",","take","part","in","the","ultim","extrem","sport","which","allow","human","be","to","fli",".","Birdmen","captur","their","experi","in","stun","aerial","camera","work","to","bring","us","as","close","as","possibl","to","the","sensat","of","human","flight",".","Histor","these","\"","birdmen","\"","have","alway","eventu","plung","to","their","death",":","Otto","Lilienth",",","Clem","Sohn","and","Leo","Valentin",".","But","now","new","develop","in","wingsuit","have","made","the","extraordinari","sport","a","littl","safer",",","and","it","show","sign","of","becom","increas","popular",".","These","adrenaline-driven","B.A.S.E.","jumper","are","push","the","limit","of","what","human","can","do",",","risk","their","live","for","the","glorious","moment","of","flight","."],"lemmas":["these","be","the","man","and","woman","who","fly","like","bird",".","Matt",",","Ellen","and","Mike","be","wingsuit","b.a.s.e.","jumper",",","take","part","in","the","ultimate","extreme","sport","which","allow","human","being","to","fly",".","Birdmen","capture","they","experience","in","stunning","aerial","camera","work","to","bring","we","as","close","as","possible","to","the","sensation","of","human","flight",".","Historically","these","``","birdman","''","have","always","eventually","plunge","to","they","death",":","Otto","Lilienthal",",","Clem","Sohn","and","Leo","Valentin",".","but","now","new","development","in","wingsuit","have","make","the","extraordinary","sport","a","little","safer",",","and","it","show","sign","of","become","increasingly","popular",".","these","adrenaline-driven","B.A.S.E.","jumper","be","push","the","limit","of","what","human","can","do",",","risk","they","life","for","the","glorious","moment","of","flight","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["These

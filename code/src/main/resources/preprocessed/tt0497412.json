They invite the son of the owner, the silly Nick, only to have access to the facility, and the geek Cari to be his date. They go to a convenience store to buy some packs of beer and they humiliate the gentle attendant. Once in the spot, they separate to different places with the intention of having sex. However, their night party becomes a tragic nightmare.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["In","Landi",",","the","colleg","friend","Shawn",",","Amber",",","Whitney",",","Jess",",","Madison","and","Kyle","organ","a","parti","in","the","Steen","'s","Textil","Mill","that","has","been","bankrupt","and","close","a","coupl","of","month","ago","and","is","abandon",".","They","invit","the","son","of","the","owner",",","the","silli","Nick",",","onli","to","have","access","to","the","facil",",","and","the","geek","Cari","to","be","his","date",".","They","go","to","a","conveni","store","to","buy","some","pack","of","beer","and","they","humili","the","gentl","attend",".","Once","in","the","spot",",","they","separ","to","differ","place","with","the","intent","of","have","sex",".","Howev",",","their","night","parti","becom","a","tragic","nightmar","."],"lemmas":["in","Landis",",","the","college","friend","Shawn",",","Amber",",","Whitney",",","Jesse",",","Madison","and","Kyle","organize","a","party","in","the","Steen","'s","Textile","Mill","that","have","be","bankrupt","and","close","a","couple","of","month","ago","and","be","abandon",".","they","invite","the","son","of","the","owner",",","the","silly","Nick",",","only","to","have","access","to","the","facility",",","and","the","geek","Cari","to","be","he","date",".","they","go","to","a","convenience","store","to","buy","some","pack","of","beer","and","they","humiliate","the","gentle","attendant",".","once","in","the","spot",",","they","separate","to","different","place","with","the","intention","of","have","sex",".","however",",","they","night","party","become","a","tragic","nightmare","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Landis ,","Landis , the",", the college","the college friends","college friends Shawn","friends Shawn ,","Shawn , Amber",", Amber ,","Amber , Whitney",", Whitney ,","Whitney , Jesse",", Jesse ,","Jesse , Madison",", Madison and","Madison and Kyle","and Kyle organize","Kyle organize a","organize a party","a party in","party in the","in the Steen","the Steen 's","Steen 's Textile","'s Textile Mill","Textile Mill that","Mill that has","that has been","has been bankrupted","been bankrupted and","bankrupted and closed","and closed a","closed a couple","a couple of","couple of months","of months ago","months ago and","ago and is","and is abandoned","They invite the","invite the son","the son of","son of the","of the owner","the owner ,","owner , the",", the silly","the silly Nick","silly Nick ,","Nick , only",", only to","only to have","to have access","have access to","access to the","to the facility","the facility ,","facility , and",", and the","and the geek","the geek Cari","geek Cari to","Cari to be","to be his","be his date","They go to","go to a","to a convenience","a convenience store","convenience store to","store to buy","to buy some","buy some packs","some packs of","packs of beer","of beer and","beer and they","and they humiliate","they humiliate the","humiliate the gentle","the gentle attendant","Once in the","in the spot","the spot ,","spot , they",", they separate","they separate to","separate to different","to different places","different places with","places with the","with the intention","the intention of","intention of having","of having sex","However , their",", their night","their night party","night party becomes","party becomes a","becomes a tragic","a tragic nightmare"],"2grams":["In Landis","Landis ,",", the","the college","college friends","friends Shawn","Shawn ,",", Amber","Amber ,",", Whitney","Whitney ,",", Jesse","Jesse ,",", Madison","Madison and","and Kyle","Kyle organize","organize a","a party","party in","in the","the Steen","Steen 's","'s Textile","Textile Mill","Mill that","that has","has been","been bankrupted","bankrupted and","and closed","closed a","a couple","couple of","of months","months ago","ago and","and is","is abandoned","They invite","invite the","the son","son of","of the","the owner","owner ,",", the","the silly","silly Nick","Nick ,",", only","only to","to have","have access","access to","to the","the facility","facility ,",", and","and the","the geek","geek Cari","Cari to","to be","be his","his date","They go","go to","to a","a convenience","convenience store","store to","to buy","buy some","some packs","packs of","of beer","beer and","and they","they humiliate","humiliate the","the gentle","gentle attendant","Once in","in the","the spot","spot ,",", they","they separate","separate to","to different","different places","places with","with the","the intention","intention of","of having","having sex","However ,",", their","their night","night party","party becomes","becomes a","a tragic","tragic nightmare"]}

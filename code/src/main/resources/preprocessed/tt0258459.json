{"title":"Blue End","plot":"Joseph Paul Jernigan was 39 years old when he was executed in Huntsville, Texas, in 1993. Ten minutes after the lethal injection, he was handed over to scientists, transported to Denver, frozen in blue gelatin and, over a period of four months, photographed as he was planed off, millimeter by millimeter. He would be reborn on the Internet as the \"visible man\" -- the first completely digitized human being. This worldwide, digitally distributed Visible Human Project is the result of a unique interaction between science and justice.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Joseph","Paul","Jernigan","was","39","year","old","when","he","was","execut","in","Huntsvill",",","Texa",",","in","1993",".","Ten","minut","after","the","lethal","inject",",","he","was","hand","over","to","scientist",",","transport","to","Denver",",","frozen","in","blue","gelatin","and",",","over","a","period","of","four","month",",","photograph","as","he","was","plane","off",",","millimet","by","millimet",".","He","would","be","reborn","on","the","Internet","as","the","\"","visibl","man","\"","--","the","first","complet","digit","human","be",".","This","worldwid",",","digit","distribut","Visibl","Human","Project","is","the","result","of","a","uniqu","interact","between","scienc","and","justic","."],"lemmas":["Joseph","Paul","Jernigan","be","39","year","old","when","he","be","execute","in","Huntsville",",","Texas",",","in","1993",".","ten","minute","after","the","lethal","injection",",","he","be","hand","over","to","scientist",",","transport","to","Denver",",","freeze","in","blue","gelatin","and",",","over","a","period","of","four","month",",","photograph","as","he","be","plane","off",",","millimeter","by","millimeter",".","he","would","be","reborn","on","the","internet","as","the","``","visible","man","''","--","the","first","completely","digitize","human","being",".","this","worldwide",",","digitally","distribute","Visible","Human","Project","be","the","result","of","a","unique","interaction","between","science","and","justice","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Joseph Paul Jernigan","Paul Jernigan was","Jernigan was 39","was 39 years","39 years old","years old when","old when he","when he was","he was executed","was executed in","executed in Huntsville","in Huntsville ,","Huntsville , Texas",", Texas ,","Texas , in",", in 1993","Ten minutes after","minutes after the","after the lethal","the lethal injection","lethal injection ,","injection , he",", he was","he was handed","was handed over","handed over to","over to scientists","to scientists ,","scientists , transported",", transported to","transported to Denver","to Denver ,","Denver , frozen",", frozen in","frozen in blue","in blue gelatin","blue gelatin and","gelatin and ,","and , over",", over a","over a period","a period of","period of four","of four months","four months ,","months , photographed",", photographed as","photographed as he","as he was","he was planed","was planed off","planed off ,","off , millimeter",", millimeter by","millimeter by millimeter","He would be","would be reborn","be reborn on","reborn on the","on the Internet","the Internet as","Internet as the","as the \"","the \" visible","\" visible man","visible man \"","man \" --","\" -- the","-- the first","the first completely","first completely digitized","completely digitized human","digitized human being","This worldwide ,","worldwide , digitally",", digitally distributed","digitally distributed Visible","distributed Visible Human","Visible Human Project","Human Project is","Project is the","is the result","the result of","result of a","of a unique","a unique interaction","unique interaction between","interaction between science","between science and","science and justice"],"2grams":["Joseph Paul","Paul Jernigan","Jernigan was","was 39","39 years","years old","old when","when he","he was","was executed","executed in","in Huntsville","Huntsville ,",", Texas","Texas ,",", in","in 1993","Ten minutes","minutes after","after the","the lethal","lethal injection","injection ,",", he","he was","was handed","handed over","over to","to scientists","scientists ,",", transported","transported to","to Denver","Denver ,",", frozen","frozen in","in blue","blue gelatin","gelatin and","and ,",", over","over a","a period","period of","of four","four months","months ,",", photographed","photographed as","as he","he was","was planed","planed off","off ,",", millimeter","millimeter by","by millimeter","He would","would be","be reborn","reborn on","on the","the Internet","Internet as","as the","the \"","\" visible","visible man","man \"","\" --","-- the","the first","first completely","completely digitized","digitized human","human being","This worldwide","worldwide ,",", digitally","digitally distributed","distributed Visible","Visible Human","Human Project","Project is","is the","the result","result of","of a","a unique","unique interaction","interaction between","between science","science and","and justice"]}

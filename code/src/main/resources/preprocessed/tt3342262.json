{"title":"Tir","plot":"Branko has been a truck driver for only a few months, a choice that is quite understandable, given that he now earns three times as much as he did as a schoolteacher. But everything has a price, which is not always quantifiable in terms of money. As children we were told: \"work ennobles man\". But here the opposite seems true: it is Branko, with his efficiency, his obstinacy, his good will, who ennobles a job that grows more and more alienating, absurd and enslaving.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Branko","has","been","a","truck","driver","for","onli","a","few","month",",","a","choic","that","is","quit","understand",",","given","that","he","now","earn","three","time","as","much","as","he","did","as","a","schoolteach",".","But","everyth","has","a","price",",","which","is","not","alway","quantifi","in","term","of","money",".","As","children","we","were","told",":","\"","work","ennobl","man","\"",".","But","here","the","opposit","seem","true",":","it","is","Branko",",","with","his","effici",",","his","obstinaci",",","his","good","will",",","who","ennobl","a","job","that","grow","more","and","more","alien",",","absurd","and","enslav","."],"lemmas":["Branko","have","be","a","truck","driver","for","only","a","few","month",",","a","choice","that","be","quite","understandable",",","give","that","he","now","earn","three","time","as","much","as","he","do","as","a","schoolteacher",".","but","everything","have","a","price",",","which","be","not","always","quantifiable","in","term","of","money",".","as","child","we","be","tell",":","``","work","ennoble","man","''",".","but","here","the","opposite","seem","true",":","it","be","Branko",",","with","he","efficiency",",","he","obstinacy",",","he","good","will",",","who","ennoble","a","job","that","grow","more","and","more","alienating",",","absurd","and","enslave","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Branko has been","has been a","been a truck","a truck driver","truck driver for","driver for only","for only a","only a few","a few months","few months ,","months , a",", a choice","a choice that","choice that is","that is quite","is quite understandable","quite understandable ,","understandable , given",", given that","given that he","that he now","he now earns","now earns three","earns three times","three times as","times as much","as much as","much as he","as he did","he did as","did as a","as a schoolteacher","But everything has","everything has a","has a price","a price ,","price , which",", which is","which is not","is not always","not always quantifiable","always quantifiable in","quantifiable in terms","in terms of","terms of money","As children we","children we were","we were told","were told :","told : \"",": \" work","\" work ennobles","work ennobles man","ennobles man \"","But here the","here the opposite","the opposite seems","opposite seems true","seems true :","true : it",": it is","it is Branko","is Branko ,","Branko , with",", with his","with his efficiency","his efficiency ,","efficiency , his",", his obstinacy","his obstinacy ,","obstinacy , his",", his good","his good will","good will ,","will , who",", who ennobles","who ennobles a","ennobles a job","a job that","job that grows","that grows more","grows more and","more and more","and more alienating","more alienating ,","alienating , absurd",", absurd and","absurd and enslaving"],"2grams":["Branko has","has been","been a","a truck","truck driver","driver for","for only","only a","a few","few months","months ,",", a","a choice","choice that","that is","is quite","quite understandable","understandable ,",", given","given that","that he","he now","now earns","earns three","three times","times as","as much","much as","as he","he did","did as","as a","a schoolteacher","But everything","everything has","has a","a price","price ,",", which","which is","is not","not always","always quantifiable","quantifiable in","in terms","terms of","of money","As children","children we","we were","were told","told :",": \"","\" work","work ennobles","ennobles man","man \"","But here","here the","the opposite","opposite seems","seems true","true :",": it","it is","is Branko","Branko ,",", with","with his","his efficiency","efficiency ,",", his","his obstinacy","obstinacy ,",", his","his good","good will","will ,",", who","who ennobles","ennobles a","a job","job that","that grows","grows more","more and","and more","more alienating","alienating ,",", absurd","absurd and","and enslaving"]}

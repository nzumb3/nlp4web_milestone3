{"title":"Magnetis√∏ren's femte vinter","plot":"A mysterious stranger, Meisner, arrives in a northern Swedish town in 1820, calling himself a magnetist - an amalgam of hypnotist and healer - and claiming he can cure diseases un-treatable by doctors. Ignoring the objections of his colleagues, Dr. Selander allows Meisner to cure his blind daughter, Maria, who not only regains her sight, but also falls in love with the charismatic magnetist. Dark secrets and repressed memories start to emerge, amidst the love between father and daughter, man and woman.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["A","mysteri","stranger",",","Meisner",",","arriv","in","a","northern","Swedish","town","in","1820",",","call","himself","a","magnetist","-","an","amalgam","of","hypnotist","and","healer","-","and","claim","he","can","cure","diseas","un-treat","by","doctor",".","Ignore","the","object","of","his","colleagu",",","Dr.","Seland","allow","Meisner","to","cure","his","blind","daughter",",","Maria",",","who","not","onli","regain","her","sight",",","but","also","fall","in","love","with","the","charismat","magnetist",".","Dark","secret","and","repress","memori","start","to","emerg",",","amidst","the","love","between","father","and","daughter",",","man","and","woman","."],"lemmas":["a","mysterious","stranger",",","Meisner",",","arrive","in","a","northern","swedish","town","in","1820",",","call","himself","a","magnetist","-","a","amalgam","of","hypnotist","and","healer","-","and","claim","he","can","cure","disease","un-treatable","by","doctor",".","ignore","the","objection","of","he","colleague",",","Dr.","Selander","allow","Meisner","to","cure","he","blind","daughter",",","Maria",",","who","not","only","regain","she","sight",",","but","also","fall","in","love","with","the","charismatic","magnetist",".","dark","secret","and","repress","memory","start","to","emerge",",","amidst","the","love","between","father","and","daughter",",","man","and","woman","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A mysterious stranger","mysterious stranger ,","stranger , Meisner",", Meisner ,","Meisner , arrives",", arrives in","arrives in a","in a northern","a northern Swedish","northern Swedish town","Swedish town in","town in 1820","in 1820 ,","1820 , calling",", calling himself","calling himself a","himself a magnetist","a magnetist -","magnetist - an","- an amalgam","an amalgam of","amalgam of hypnotist","of hypnotist and","hypnotist and healer","and healer -","healer - and","- and claiming","and claiming he","claiming he can","he can cure","can cure diseases","cure diseases un-treatable","diseases un-treatable by","un-treatable by doctors","Ignoring the objections","the objections of","objections of his","of his colleagues","his colleagues ,","colleagues , Dr.",", Dr. Selander","Dr. Selander allows","Selander allows Meisner","allows Meisner to","Meisner to cure","to cure his","cure his blind","his blind daughter","blind daughter ,","daughter , Maria",", Maria ,","Maria , who",", who not","who not only","not only regains","only regains her","regains her sight","her sight ,","sight , but",", but also","but also falls","also falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with the","with the charismatic","the charismatic magnetist","Dark secrets and","secrets and repressed","and repressed memories","repressed memories start","memories start to","start to emerge","to emerge ,","emerge , amidst",", amidst the","amidst the love","the love between","love between father","between father and","father and daughter","and daughter ,","daughter , man",", man and","man and woman"],"2grams":["A mysterious","mysterious stranger","stranger ,",", Meisner","Meisner ,",", arrives","arrives in","in a","a northern","northern Swedish","Swedish town","town in","in 1820","1820 ,",", calling","calling himself","himself a","a magnetist","magnetist -","- an","an amalgam","amalgam of","of hypnotist","hypnotist and","and healer","healer -","- and","and claiming","claiming he","he can","can cure","cure diseases","diseases un-treatable","un-treatable by","by doctors","Ignoring the","the objections","objections of","of his","his colleagues","colleagues ,",", Dr.","Dr. Selander","Selander allows","allows Meisner","Meisner to","to cure","cure his","his blind","blind daughter","daughter ,",", Maria","Maria ,",", who","who not","not only","only regains","regains her","her sight","sight ,",", but","but also","also falls","falls in","in love","love with","with the","the charismatic","charismatic magnetist","Dark secrets","secrets and","and repressed","repressed memories","memories start","start to","to emerge","emerge ,",", amidst","amidst the","the love","love between","between father","father and","and daughter","daughter ,",", man","man and","and woman"]}

{"title":"False Alarm","plot":"False Alarm tells the story of Syria today. It is the story of a country that has lost its revolutionary spirit and was overpowered by its own multiplicity. It is a Documentary about revolution, exile, death, hope, victory and defeat. Told by young Syrians, filming each other's journeys and holding on to their cameras like they were the only proof of existence, it is a story about a country that has become unrecognizable to its own inhabitants. The Documentary follows them through the laughter and the tears, until it is no longer clear whether they are happy to have found their freedom or sad that the revolution no longer resembles them.","genres":["Documentary"," News","

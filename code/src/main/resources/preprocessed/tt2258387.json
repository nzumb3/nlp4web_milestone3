{"title":"Henryk","plot":"Young police officer Julian Grey has returned to Hoquiam - his nautical, dumpy hometown, to help his childhood friend Don cope with the disappearance of his fiance, Wendy. The investigation was closed some months back, and is now labeled a 'cold case.' Upon arriving into town, Julian immediately sees peculiarities in the investigation - mainly that the local police reports omit the identity of the only man considered a suspect in the case. This man, Trent Reynolds, reveals that although he knew Wendy very little, he noticed a Paganistic scar on her arm shortly before her disappearance. This, among other clues, leads Julian to conduct research into Hoquiam's history. In doing so, he learns of an old urban legend about a Satanic cult that would abduct and sacrifice the townspeople - 'The Golden Order of the Cross.' Julian learns that not only does this cult still practice, but that its ability to control and brainwash its members proves as dangerous and deadly as the ritualistic sacrifices themselves. Risking his life and sanity, it becomes Julian's mission to infiltrate the secret cult in order to rescue Wendy, and compile enough evidence on them to initialize a police-raid.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Young","polic","offic","Julian","Grey","has","return","to","Hoquiam","-","his","nautic",",","dumpi","hometown",",","to","help","his","childhood","friend","Don","cope","with","the","disappear","of","his","fianc",",","Wendi",".","The","investig","was","close","some","month","back",",","and","is","now","label","a","'","cold","case",".","'","Upon","arriv","into","town",",","Julian","immedi","see","peculiar","in","the","investig","-","main","that","the","local","polic","report","omit","the","ident","of","the","onli","man","consid","a","suspect","in","the","case",".","This","man",",","Trent","Reynold",",","reveal","that","although","he","knew","Wendi","veri","littl",",","he","notic","a","Paganist","scar","on","her","arm","short","befor","her","disappear",".","This",",","among","other","clue",",","lead","Julian","to","conduct","research","into","Hoquiam","'s","histori",".","In","do","so",",","he","learn","of","an","old","urban","legend","about","a","Satan","cult","that","would","abduct","and","sacrific","the","townspeopl","-","'","The","Golden","Order","of","the","Cross",".","'","Julian","learn","that","not","onli","doe","this","cult","still","practic",",","but","that","it","abil","to","control","and","brainwash","it","member","prove","as","danger","and","dead","as","the","ritualist","sacrific","themselv",".","Risk","his","life","and","saniti",",","it","becom","Julian","'s","mission","to","infiltr","the","secret","cult","in","order","to","rescu","Wendi",",","and","compil","enough","evid","on","them","to","initi","a","police-raid","."],"lemmas":["young","police","officer","Julian","Grey","have","return","to","Hoquiam","-","he","nautical",",","dumpy","hometown",",","to","help","he","childhood","friend","Don","cope","with","the","disappearance","of","he","fiance",",","Wendy",".","the","investigation","be","close","some","month","back",",","and","be","now","label","a","'","cold","case",".","'","upon","arrive","into","town",",","Julian","immediately","see","peculiarity","in","the","investigation","-","mainly","that","the","local","police","report","omit","the","identity","of","the","only","man","consider","a","suspect","in","the","case",".","this","man",",","Trent","Reynolds",",","reveal","that","although","he","know","Wendy","very","little",",","he","notice","a","paganistic","scar","on","she","arm","shortly","before","she","disappearance",".","this",",","among","other","clue",",","lead","Julian","to","conduct","research","into","Hoquiam","'s","history",".","in","do","so",",","he","learn","of","a","old","urban","legend","about","a","satanic","cult","that","would","abduct","and","sacrifice","the","townspeople","-","'","the","Golden","Order","of","the","Cross",".","'","Julian","learn","that","not","only","do","this","cult","still","practice",",","but","that","its","ability","to","control","and","brainwash","its","member","prove","as","dangerous","and","deadly","as","the","ritualistic","sacrifice","themselves",".","risk","he","life","and","sanity",",","it","become","Julian","'s","mission","to","infiltrate","the","secret","cult","in","order","to","rescue","Wendy",",","and","compile","enough","evidence","on","they","to","initialize","a","police-raid","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Young police officer","police officer Julian","officer Julian Grey","Julian Grey has","Grey has returned","has returned to","returned to Hoquiam","to Hoquiam -","Hoquiam - his","- his nautical","his nautical ,","nautical , dumpy",", dumpy hometown","dumpy hometown ,","hometown , to",", to help","to help his","help his childhood","his childhood friend","childhood friend Don","friend Don cope","Don cope with","cope with the","with the disappearance","the disappearance of","disappearance of his","of his fiance","his fiance ,","fiance , Wendy","The investigation was","investigation was closed","was closed some","closed some months","some months back","months back ,","back , and",", and is","and is now","is now labeled","now labeled a","labeled a '","a ' cold","' cold case","cold case .","case .

{"title":"Riwayat","plot":"About 100 million baby girls are missing from this world (Report in the Lancet 2006, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world)- they are dead, killed because of simply being girls. Their killing is simply due to blind faith in traditions that prefer baby boys to carry the family's name ahead, to be the heir to the family's fortune, to get nirvana after death. RIWAYAT is a hard hitting family drama touching the conscience of the global audience to raise awareness of this social evil. It is a musical love story against the backdrop of this inhuman practice, an emotional journey of three ladies, including Anita, the central protagonist, who face this evil in their life.","genres":["Crime"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["About","100","million","babi","girl","are","miss","from","this","world","(","Report","in","the","Lancet","2006",",","one","of","the","most","prestigi","medic","journal","in","the","world",")","-","they","are","dead",",","kill","becaus","of","simpli","be","girl",".","Their","kill","is","simpli","due","to","blind","faith","in","tradit","that","prefer","babi","boy","to","carri","the","famili","'s","name","ahead",",","to","be","the","heir","to","the","famili","'s","fortun",",","to","get","nirvana","after","death",".","RIWAYAT","is","a","hard","hit","famili","drama","touch","the","conscienc","of","the","global","audienc","to","rais","awar","of","this","social","evil",".","It","is","a","music","love","stori","against","the","backdrop","of","this","inhuman","practic",",","an","emot","journey","of","three","ladi",",","includ","Anita",",","the","central","protagonist",",","who","face","this","evil","in","their","life","."],"lemmas":["about","100","million","baby","girl","be","miss","from","this","world","-lrb-","Report","in","the","Lancet","2006",",","one","of","the","most","prestigious","medical","journal","in","the","world","-rrb-","-","they","be","dead",",","kill","because","of","simply","be","girl",".","they","killing","be","simply","due","to","blind","faith","in","tradition","that","prefer","baby","boy","to","carry","the","family","'s","name","ahead",",","to","be","the","heir","to","the","family","'s","fortune",",","to","get","nirvana","after","death",".","riwayat","be","a","hard","hit","family","drama","touch","the","conscience","of","the","global","audience","to","raise","awareness","of","this","social","evil",".","it","be","a","musical","love","story","against","the","backdrop","of","this","inhuman","practice",",","a","emotional","journey","of","three","lady",",","include","Anita",",","the","central","protagonist",",","who","face","this","evil","in","they","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["About 100 million","100 million baby","million baby girls","baby girls are","girls are missing","are missing from","missing from this","from this world","this world (","world ( Report","( Report in","Report in the","in the Lancet","the Lancet 2006","Lancet 2006 ,","2006 , one",", one of","one of the","of the most","the most prestigious","most prestigious medical","prestigious medical journals","medical journals in","journals in the","in the world","the world )","world ) -",") -

{"title":"Human Nature","plot":"A philosophical burlesque, Human Nature follows the ups and downs of an obsessive scientist, a female naturalist, and the man they discover, born and raised in the wild. As scientist Nathan trains the wild man, Puff, in the ways of the world - starting with table manners - Nathan's lover Lila fights to preserve the man's simian past, which represents a freedom enviable to most. In the power struggle that ensues, an unusual love triangle emerges exposing the perversities of the human heart and the idiosyncrasies of the civilized mind. Human Nature is a comical examination of the trappings of desire in a world where both nature and culture are idealized.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["A","philosoph","burlesqu",",","Human","Natur","follow","the","up","and","down","of","an","obsess","scientist",",","a","femal","naturalist",",","and","the","man","they","discov",",","born","and","rais","in","the","wild",".","As","scientist","Nathan","train","the","wild","man",",","Puff",",","in","the","way","of","the","world","-","start","with","tabl","manner","-","Nathan","'s","lover","Lila","fight","to","preserv","the","man","'s","simian","past",",","which","repres","a","freedom","enviabl","to","most",".","In","the","power","struggl","that","ensu",",","an","unusu","love","triangl","emerg","expos","the","pervers","of","the","human","heart","and","the","idiosyncrasi","of","the","civil","mind",".","Human","Natur","is","a","comic","examin","of","the","trap","of","desir","in","a","world","where","both","natur","and","cultur","are","ideal","."],"lemmas":["a","philosophical","burlesque",",","Human","Nature","follow","the","up","and","downs","of","a","obsessive","scientist",",","a","female","naturalist",",","and","the","man","they","discover",",","bear","and","raise","in","the","wild",".","as","scientist","Nathan","train","the","wild","man",",","puff",",","in","the","way","of","the","world","-","start","with","table","manners","-","Nathan","'s","lover","Lila","fight","to","preserve","the","man","'s","simian","past",",","which","represent","a","freedom","enviable","to","most",".","in","the","power","struggle","that","ensue",",","a","unusual","love","triangle","emerge","expose","the","perversity","of","the","human","heart","and","the","idiosyncrasy","of","the","civilized","mind",".","Human","Nature","be","a","comical","examination","of","the","trappings","of","desire","in","a","world","where","both","nature","and","culture","be","idealized","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A philosophical burlesque","philosophical burlesque ,","burlesque , Human",", Human Nature","Human Nature follows","Nature follows the","follows the ups","the ups and","ups and downs","and downs of","downs of an","of an obsessive","an obsessive scientist","obsessive scientist ,","scientist , a",", a female","a female naturalist","female naturalist ,","naturalist , and",", and the","and the man","the man they","man they discover","they discover ,","discover , born",", born and","born and raised","and raised in","raised in the","in the wild","As scientist Nathan","scientist Nathan trains","Nathan trains the","trains the wild","the wild man","wild man ,","man , Puff",", Puff ,","Puff , in",", in the","in the ways","the ways of","ways of the","of the world","the world -","world -

{"title":"Masti Express","plot":"Mumbai-based Raju (Rajpal Yadav) drives a beat-up auto-rickshaw, lives with his wife, Seema (Divya Dutta), an adopted son, Babu, and invests in lottery tickets much to the chagrin of Seema who repeatedly threatens to kill herself by jumping under a train. When he attempts to secure admission for Babu in Bata Ryan School, he is not only refused but also humiliated by the Principal. Hoping to ensure a decent education for Babu, as well as improve their lifestyle, he decides to enter into an auto-rickshaw race that will get the winner Rs.10 Lakhs - fully aware that his auto-rickshaw may not live up to this challenge. Even after he finds out that the race, organized by a gangster named Veerubhai, who already has him in his bad books, may be 'fixed', he is determined to win. Things will not at all go his way when his rickshaw gets run-over by a lorry and he may end up not only never taking part in the race but also being compelled to take up a new line of work altogether.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Mumbai-bas","Raju","(","Rajpal","Yadav",")","drive","a","beat-up","auto-rickshaw",",","live","with","his","wife",",","Seema","(","Divya","Dutta",")",",","an","adopt","son",",","Babu",",","and","invest","in","lotteri","ticket","much","to","the","chagrin","of","Seema","who","repeat","threaten","to","kill","herself","by","jump","under","a","train",".","When","he","attempt","to","secur","admiss","for","Babu","in","Bata","Ryan","School",",","he","is","not","onli","refus","but","also","humili","by","the","Princip",".","Hope","to","ensur","a","decent","educ","for","Babu",",","as","well","as","improv","their","lifestyl",",","he","decid","to","enter","into","an","auto-rickshaw","race","that","will","get","the","winner","Rs",".10","Lakh","-","fulli","awar","that","his","auto-rickshaw","may","not","live","up","to","this","challeng",".","Even","after","he","find","out","that","the","race",",","organ","by","a","gangster","name","Veerubhai",",","who","alreadi","has","him","in","his","bad","book",",","may","be","'","fix","'",",","he","is","determin","to","win",".","Thing","will","not","at","all","go","his","way","when","his","rickshaw","get","run-ov","by","a","lorri","and","he","may","end","up","not","onli","never","take","part","in","the","race","but","also","be","compel","to","take","up","a","new","line","of","work","altogeth","."],"lemmas":["mumbai-based","Raju","-lrb-","Rajpal","Yadav","-rrb-","drive","a","beat-up","auto-rickshaw",",","live","with","he","wife",",","Seema","-lrb-","Divya","Dutta","-rrb-",",","a","adopted","son",",","Babu",",","and","invest","in","lottery","ticket","much","to","the","chagrin","of","Seema","who","repeatedly","threaten","to","kill","herself","by","jump","under","a","train",".","when","he","attempt","to","secure","admission","for","Babu","in","Bata","Ryan","School",",","he","be","not","only","refuse","but","also","humiliate","by","the","principal",".","hope","to","ensure","a","decent","education","for","Babu",",","as","well","as","improve","they","lifestyle",",","he","decide","to","enter","into","a","auto-rickshaw","race","that","will","get","the","winner","rs",".10","lakhs","-","fully","aware","that","he","auto-rickshaw","may","not","live","up","to","this","challenge",".","even","after","he","find","out","that","the","race",",","organize","by","a","gangster","name","Veerubhai",",","who","already","have","he","in","he","bad","book",",","may","be","'","fix","'",",","he","be","determine","to","win",".","thing","will","not","at","all","go","he","way","when","he","rickshaw","get","run-over","by","a","lorry","and","he","may","end","up","not","only","never","take","part","in","the","race","but","also","be","compel","to","take","up","a","new","line","of","work","altogether","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mumbai-based Raju (","Raju ( Rajpal","( Rajpal Yadav","Rajpal Yadav )","Yadav ) drives",") drives a","drives a beat-up","a beat-up auto-rickshaw","beat-up auto-rickshaw ,","auto-rickshaw , lives",", lives with","lives with his","with his wife","his wife ,","wife , Seema",", Seema (","Seema ( Divya","( Divya Dutta","Divya Dutta )","Dutta ) ,",") , an",", an adopted","an adopted son","adopted son ,","son , Babu",", Babu ,","Babu , and",", and invests","and invests in","invests in lottery","in lottery tickets","lottery tickets much","tickets much to","much to the","to the chagrin","the chagrin of","chagrin of Seema","of Seema who","Seema who repeatedly","who repeatedly threatens","repeatedly threatens to","threatens to kill","to kill herself","kill herself by","herself by jumping","by jumping under","jumping under a","under a train","When he attempts","he attempts to","attempts to secure","to secure admission","secure admission for","admission for Babu","for Babu in","Babu in Bata","in Bata Ryan","Bata Ryan School","Ryan School ,","School , he",", he is","he is not","is not only","not only refused","only refused but","refused but also","but also humiliated","also humiliated by","humiliated by the","by the Principal","Hoping to ensure","to ensure a","ensure a decent","a decent education","decent education for","education for Babu","for Babu ,","Babu , as",", as well","as well as","well as improve","as improve their","improve their lifestyle","their lifestyle ,","lifestyle , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to enter","to enter into","enter into an","into an auto-rickshaw","an auto-rickshaw race","auto-rickshaw race that","race that will","that will get","will get the","get the winner","the winner Rs","winner Rs .10","Rs .10 Lakhs",".10 Lakhs -","Lakhs -

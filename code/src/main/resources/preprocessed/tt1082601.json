{"title":"Fighting","plot":"Shawn MacArthur, the kind-hearted son of an Alabama wrestling coach, makes a grim living selling fake products on the streets in New York. After dealing with thieving punks, he's discovered by bare-knuckle/street-fight manager, Harvey Boarden. He soon proves himself worthy and starts earning a small fortune, part of which he volunteers to spend on single mother Zulay Velez. Shawn doesn't cheat and that seems to be a major problem, notably after the arrival of his Alabama high-school rival.","genres":["Action"," Sport"," Drama"],"stems":["Shawn","MacArthur",",","the","kind-heart","son","of","an","Alabama","wrestl","coach",",","make","a","grim","live","sell","fake","product","on","the","street","in","New","York",".","After","deal","with","thiev","punk",",","he","'s","discov","by","bare-knuckle/street-fight","manag",",","Harvey","Boarden",".","He","soon","prove","himself","worthi","and","start","earn","a","small","fortun",",","part","of","which","he","volunt","to","spend","on","singl","mother","Zulay","Velez",".","Shawn","doe","n't","cheat","and","that","seem","to","be","a","major","problem",",","notabl","after","the","arriv","of","his","Alabama","high-school","rival","."],"lemmas":["Shawn","MacArthur",",","the","kind-hearted","son","of","a","Alabama","wrestling","coach",",","make","a","grim","living","sell","fake","product","on","the","street","in","New","York",".","after","deal","with","thieving","punk",",","he","be","discover","by","bare-knuckle/street-fight","manager",",","Harvey","Boarden",".","he","soon","prove","himself","worthy","and","start","earn","a","small","fortune",",","part","of","which","he","volunteer","to","spend","on","single","mother","Zulay","Velez",".","Shawn","do","not","cheat","and","that","seem","to","be","a","major","problem",",","notably","after","the","arrival","of","he","Alabama","high-school","rival","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Shawn MacArthur ,","MacArthur , the",", the kind-hearted","the kind-hearted son","kind-hearted son of","son of an","of an Alabama","an Alabama wrestling","Alabama wrestling coach","wrestling coach ,","coach , makes",", makes a","makes a grim","a grim living","grim living selling","living selling fake","selling fake products","fake products on","products on the","on the streets","the streets in","streets in New","in New York","After dealing with","dealing with thieving","with thieving punks","thieving punks ,","punks , he",", he 's","he 's discovered","'s discovered by","discovered by bare-knuckle/street-fight","by bare-knuckle/street-fight manager","bare-knuckle/street-fight manager ,","manager , Harvey",", Harvey Boarden","He soon proves","soon proves himself","proves himself worthy","himself worthy and","worthy and starts","and starts earning","starts earning a","earning a small","a small fortune","small fortune ,","fortune , part",", part of","part of which","of which he","which he volunteers","he volunteers to","volunteers to spend","to spend on","spend on single","on single mother","single mother Zulay","mother Zulay Velez","Shawn does n't","does n't cheat","n't cheat and","cheat and that","and that seems","that seems to","seems to be","to be a","be a major","a major problem","major problem ,","problem , notably",", notably after","notably after the","after the arrival","the arrival of","arrival of his","of his Alabama","his Alabama high-school","Alabama high-school rival"],"2grams":["Shawn MacArthur","MacArthur ,",", the","the kind-hearted","kind-hearted son","son of","of an","an Alabama","Alabama wrestling","wrestling coach","coach ,",", makes","makes a","a grim","grim living","living selling","selling fake","fake products","products on","on the","the streets","streets in","in New","New York","After dealing","dealing with","with thieving","thieving punks","punks ,",", he","he 's","'s discovered","discovered by","by bare-knuckle/street-fight","bare-knuckle/street-fight manager","manager ,",", Harvey","Harvey Boarden","He soon","soon proves","proves himself","himself worthy","worthy and","and starts","starts earning","earning a","a small","small fortune","fortune ,",", part","part of","of which","which he","he volunteers","volunteers to","to spend","spend on","on single","single mother","mother Zulay","Zulay Velez","Shawn does","does n't","n't cheat","cheat and","and that","that seems","seems to","to be","be a","a major","major problem","problem ,",", notably","notably after","after the","the arrival","arrival of","of his","his Alabama","Alabama high-school","high-school rival"]}

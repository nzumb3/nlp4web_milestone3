{"title":"Mid-August Lunch","plot":"Gianni is a middle-aged man living in Rome with his imposing and demanding elderly mother. His only outlet from her and the increasing debt into which they are sinking, are the increasingly frequent quiet sessions at the local tavern. As an Oriental saying goes, 'Moments of crisis are moments of opportunities'. These appear during the celebration of the holiday of Ferragosto on 15 August. That's when everybody leaves town to have fun. Opportunity knocks on Gianni's door in the most unexpected way.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Gianni","is","a","middle-ag","man","live","in","Rome","with","his","impos","and","demand","elder","mother",".","His","onli","outlet","from","her","and","the","increas","debt","into","which","they","are","sink",",","are","the","increas","frequent","quiet","session","at","the","local","tavern",".","As","an","Oriental","say","goe",",","'","Moment","of","crisi","are","moment","of","opportun","'",".","These","appear","dure","the","celebr","of","the","holiday","of","Ferragosto","on","15","August",".","That","'s","when","everybodi","leav","town","to","have","fun",".","Opportun","knock","on","Gianni","'s","door","in","the","most","unexpect","way","."],"lemmas":["Gianni","be","a","middle-aged","man","live","in","Rome","with","he","impose","and","demand","elderly","mother",".","he","only","outlet","from","she","and","the","increase","debt","into","which","they","be","sink",",","be","the","increasingly","frequent","quiet","session","at","the","local","tavern",".","as","a","oriental","saying","go",",","'","moment","of","crisis","be","moment","of","opportunity","'",".","these","appear","during","the","celebration","of","the","holiday","of","Ferragosto","on","15","August",".","that","be","when","everybody","leave","town","to","have","fun",".","Opportunity","knock","on","Gianni","'s","door","in","the","most","unexpected","way","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gianni is a","is a middle-aged","a middle-aged man","middle-aged man living","man living in","living in Rome","in Rome with","Rome with his","with his imposing","his imposing and","imposing and demanding","and demanding elderly","demanding elderly mother","His only outlet","only outlet from","outlet from her","from her and","her and the","and the increasing","the increasing debt","increasing debt into","debt into which","into which they","which they are","they are sinking","are sinking ,","sinking , are",", are the","are the increasingly","the increasingly frequent","increasingly frequent quiet","frequent quiet sessions","quiet sessions at","sessions at the","at the local","the local tavern","As an Oriental","an Oriental saying","Oriental saying goes","saying goes ,","goes , '",", ' Moments","' Moments of","Moments of crisis","of crisis are","crisis are moments","are moments of","moments of opportunities","of opportunities '","These appear during","appear during the","during the celebration","the celebration of","celebration of the","of the holiday","the holiday of","holiday of Ferragosto","of Ferragosto on","Ferragosto on 15","on 15 August","That 's when","'s when everybody","when everybody leaves","everybody leaves town","leaves town to","town to have","to have fun","Opportunity knocks on","knocks on Gianni","on Gianni 's","Gianni 's door","'s door in","door in the","in the most","the most unexpected","most unexpected way"],"2grams":["Gianni is","is a","a middle-aged","middle-aged man","man living","living in","in Rome","Rome with","with his","his imposing","imposing and","and demanding","demanding elderly","elderly mother","His only","only outlet","outlet from","from her","her and","and the","the increasing","increasing debt","debt into","into which","which they","they are","are sinking","sinking ,",", are","are the","the increasingly","increasingly frequent","frequent quiet","quiet sessions","sessions at","at the","the local","local tavern","As an","an Oriental","Oriental saying","saying goes","goes ,",", '","' Moments","Moments of","of crisis","crisis are","are moments","moments of","of opportunities","opportunities '","These appear","appear during","during the","the celebration","celebration of","of the","the holiday","holiday of","of Ferragosto","Ferragosto on","on 15","15 August","That 's","'s when","when everybody","everybody leaves","leaves town","town to","to have","have fun","Opportunity knocks","knocks on","on Gianni","Gianni 's","'s door","door in","in the","the most","most unexpected","unexpected way"]}

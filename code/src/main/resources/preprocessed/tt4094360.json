{"title":"Home","plot":"California's San Joaquin County lost nearly 40,000 homes to foreclosure between 2007 and 2012. Thirty-four community members of the small city of Tracy, bedroom to Silicon Valley, narrate an intertwining story of personal and shared experience and provide glimpses into their nuanced versions of the American Dream. The unfolding story of 19-year-old Juan Sanchez, whose parents lost their home in Bakersfield only to lose a rental in Tracy, grounds the film. In addition to Rex, the foreclosure rescue dog, long abandoned homes become characters in this poetic documentary.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["California","'s","San","Joaquin","Counti","lost","near","40,000","home","to","foreclosur","between","2007","and","2012",".","Thirty-four","communiti","member","of","the","small","citi","of","Traci",",","bedroom","to","Silicon","Valley",",","narrat","an","intertwin","stori","of","person","and","share","experi","and","provid","glimps","into","their","nuanc","version","of","the","American","Dream",".","The","unfold","stori","of","19-year-old","Juan","Sanchez",",","whose","parent","lost","their","home","in","Bakersfield","onli","to","lose","a","rental","in","Traci",",","ground","the","film",".","In","addit","to","Rex",",","the","foreclosur","rescu","dog",",","long","abandon","home","becom","charact","in","this","poetic","documentari","."],"lemmas":["California","'s","San","Joaquin","County","lose","nearly","40,000","home","to","foreclosure","between","2007","and","2012",".","thirty-four","community","member","of","the","small","city","of","Tracy",",","bedroom","to","Silicon","Valley",",","narrate","a","intertwine","story","of","personal","and","shared","experience","and","provide","glimpse","into","they","nuanced","version","of","the","american","dream",".","the","unfold","story","of","19-year-old","Juan","Sanchez",",","whose","parent","lose","they","home","in","Bakersfield","only","to","lose","a","rental","in","Tracy",",","grounds","the","film",".","in","addition","to","rex",",","the","foreclosure","rescue","dog",",","long","abandon","home","become","character","in","this","poetic","documentary","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["California 's San","'s San Joaquin","San Joaquin County","Joaquin County lost","County lost nearly","lost nearly 40,000","nearly 40,000 homes","40,000 homes to","homes to foreclosure","to foreclosure between","foreclosure between 2007","between 2007 and","2007 and 2012","Thirty-four community members","community members of","members of the","of the small","the small city","small city of","city of Tracy","of Tracy ,","Tracy , bedroom",", bedroom to","bedroom to Silicon","to Silicon Valley","Silicon Valley ,","Valley , narrate",", narrate an","narrate an intertwining","an intertwining story","intertwining story of","story of personal","of personal and","personal and shared","and shared experience","shared experience and","experience and provide","and provide glimpses","provide glimpses into","glimpses into their","into their nuanced","their nuanced versions","nuanced versions of","versions of the","of the American","the American Dream","The unfolding story","unfolding story of","story of 19-year-old","of 19-year-old Juan","19-year-old Juan Sanchez","Juan Sanchez ,","Sanchez , whose",", whose parents","whose parents lost","parents lost their","lost their home","their home in","home in Bakersfield","in Bakersfield only","Bakersfield only to","only to lose","to lose a","lose a rental","a rental in","rental in Tracy","in Tracy ,","Tracy , grounds",", grounds the","grounds the film","In addition to","addition to Rex","to Rex ,","Rex , the",", the foreclosure","the foreclosure rescue","foreclosure rescue dog","rescue dog ,","dog , long",", long abandoned","long abandoned homes","abandoned homes become","homes become characters","become characters in","characters in this","in this poetic","this poetic documentary"],"2grams":["California 's","'s San","San Joaquin","Joaquin County","County lost","lost nearly","nearly 40,000","40,000 homes","homes to","to foreclosure","foreclosure between","between 2007","2007 and","and 2012","Thirty-four community","community members","members of","of the","the small","small city","city of","of Tracy","Tracy ,",", bedroom","bedroom to","to Silicon","Silicon Valley","Valley ,",", narrate","narrate an","an intertwining","intertwining story","story of","of personal","personal and","and shared","shared experience","experience and","and provide","provide glimpses","glimpses into","into their","their nuanced","nuanced versions","versions of","of the","the American","American Dream","The unfolding","unfolding story","story of","of 19-year-old","19-year-old Juan","Juan Sanchez","Sanchez ,",", whose","whose parents","parents lost","lost their","their home","home in","in Bakersfield","Bakersfield only","only to","to lose","lose a","a rental","rental in","in Tracy","Tracy ,",", grounds","grounds the","the film","In addition","addition to","to Rex","Rex ,",", the","the foreclosure","foreclosure rescue","rescue dog","dog ,",", long","long abandoned","abandoned homes","homes become","become characters","characters in","in this","this poetic","poetic documentary"]}

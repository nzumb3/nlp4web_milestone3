{"title":"Surfer, Dude","plot":"Steve Addington is the world's preeminent surfer - cool, laid back, stoned, shirtless and barefoot, living off endorsements for surfboards and trunks, paid in cash. In Malibu his endorsement contract has been bought by Eddie Zarno, a surfer turned businessman who wants Steve to record his moves for an electronic virtual reality game. Steve just wants to surf. While Zarno tries to change Steve's mind, the Pacific goes calm - there are no waves for days on end. Steve's attracted to Danni, recently fired by Zarno, but the lack of surfing drains him. Plus, he's low on dough. Will he sign with Zarno, get paid, and lose his self-respect?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Steve","Addington","is","the","world","'s","preemin","surfer","-","cool",",","laid","back",",","stone",",","shirtless","and","barefoot",",","live","off","endors","for","surfboard","and","trunk",",","paid","in","cash",".","In","Malibu","his","endors","contract","has","been","bought","by","Eddie","Zarno",",","a","surfer","turn","businessman","who","want","Steve","to","record","his","move","for","an","electron","virtual","realiti","game",".","Steve","just","want","to","surf",".","While","Zarno","tri","to","chang","Steve","'s","mind",",","the","Pacif","goe","calm","-","there","are","no","wave","for","day","on","end",".","Steve","'s","attract","to","Danni",",","recent","fire","by","Zarno",",","but","the","lack","of","surf","drain","him",".","Plus",",","he","'s","low","on","dough",".","Will","he","sign","with","Zarno",",","get","paid",",","and","lose","his","self-respect","?"],"lemmas":["Steve","Addington","be","the","world","'s","preeminent","surfer","-","cool",",","lay","back",",","stoned",",","shirtless","and","barefoot",",","live","off","endorsement","for","surfboard","and","trunk",",","pay","in","cash",".","in","Malibu","he","endorsement","contract","have","be","buy","by","Eddie","Zarno",",","a","surfer","turn","businessman","who","want","Steve","to","record","he","move","for","a","electronic","virtual","reality","game",".","Steve","just","want","to","surf",".","while","Zarno","try","to","change","Steve","'s","mind",",","the","Pacific","go","calm","-","there","be","no","wave","for","day","on","end",".","Steve","'s","attract","to","Danni",",","recently","fire","by","Zarno",",","but","the","lack","of","surfing","drain","he",".","Plus",",","he","be","low","on","dough",".","will","he","sign","with","Zarno",",","get","pay",",","and","lose","he","self-respect","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Steve Addington is","Addington is the","is the world","the world 's","world 's preeminent","'s preeminent surfer","preeminent surfer -","surfer -

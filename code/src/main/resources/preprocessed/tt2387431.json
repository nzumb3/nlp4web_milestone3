{"title":"Dark by Noon","plot":"This time-travel thriller is set in an alternate time, a world where history has unfolded differently. Rez played by Patrick Buchanan (Belfast Story) lost his wife sometime in the past. Now heist a man abandoned by society, but he possesses a gift: the perfect photographic memory, but having perfect recall isn't all it's cracked up to be. A covert government agency headed by Rez's old mentor Haycock - played by Anthony Murphy (Charlie Casanova, Dawn of the Dragonslayer) has stolen a device called 'Titus'; a machine that has the ability to send a person eight hours into the future, but only for a short period. The organisation is making millions by recording advance knowledge of the stock market, heisting the future eight hours at a time. One day Rez leaps forward in time and witnesses a nuclear explosion. As he jumps back to his own time-line, events begin to spiral out of control as he only has eight hours to discover the cause, save his estranged daughter and a city, unaware it's about to be destroyed.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["This","time-travel","thriller","is","set","in","an","altern","time",",","a","world","where","histori","has","unfold","differ",".","Rez","play","by","Patrick","Buchanan","(","Belfast","Stori",")","lost","his","wife","sometim","in","the","past",".","Now","heist","a","man","abandon","by","societi",",","but","he","possess","a","gift",":","the","perfect","photograph","memori",",","but","have","perfect","recal","is","n't","all","it","'s","crack","up","to","be",".","A","covert","govern","agenc","head","by","Rez","'s","old","mentor","Haycock","-","play","by","Anthoni","Murphi","(","Charli","Casanova",",","Dawn","of","the","Dragonslay",")","has","stolen","a","devic","call","'","Titus","'",";","a","machin","that","has","the","abil","to","send","a","person","eight","hour","into","the","futur",",","but","onli","for","a","short","period",".","The","organis","is","make","million","by","record","advanc","knowledg","of","the","stock","market",",","heist","the","futur","eight","hour","at","a","time",".","One","day","Rez","leap","forward","in","time","and","wit","a","nuclear","explos",".","As","he","jump","back","to","his","own","time-lin",",","event","begin","to","spiral","out","of","control","as","he","onli","has","eight","hour","to","discov","the","caus",",","save","his","estrang","daughter","and","a","citi",",","unawar","it","'s","about","to","be","destroy","."],"lemmas":["this","time-travel","thriller","be","set","in","a","alternate","time",",","a","world","where","history","have","unfold","differently",".","rez","play","by","Patrick","Buchanan","-lrb-","Belfast","Story","-rrb-","lose","he","wife","sometime","in","the","past",".","now","heist","a","man","abandon","by","society",",","but","he","possess","a","gift",":","the","perfect","photographic","memory",",","but","have","perfect","recall","be","not","all","it","be","crack","up","to","be",".","a","covert","government","agency","head","by","Rez","'s","old","mentor","Haycock","-","play","by","Anthony","Murphy","-lrb-","Charlie","Casanova",",","Dawn","of","the","Dragonslayer","-rrb-","have","steal","a","device","call","'","Titus","'",";","a","machine","that","have","the","ability","to","send","a","person","eight","hour","into","the","future",",","but","only","for","a","short","period",".","the","organisation","be","make","million","by","record","advance","knowledge","of","the","stock","market",",","heist","the","future","eight","hour","at","a","time",".","one","day","rez","leap","forward","in","time","and","witness","a","nuclear","explosion",".","as","he","jump","back","to","he","own","time-line",",","event","begin","to","spiral","out","of","control","as","he","only","have","eight","hour","to","discover","the","cause",",","save","he","estrange","daughter","and","a","city",",","unaware","it","be","about","to","be","destroy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This time-travel thriller","time-travel thriller is","thriller is set","is set in","set in an","in an alternate","an alternate time","alternate time ,","time , a",", a world","a world where","world where history","where history has","history has unfolded","has unfolded differently","Rez played by","played by Patrick","by Patrick Buchanan","Patrick Buchanan (","Buchanan ( Belfast","( Belfast Story","Belfast Story )","Story ) lost",") lost his","lost his wife","his wife sometime","wife sometime in","sometime in the","in the past","Now heist a","heist a man","a man abandoned","man abandoned by","abandoned by society","by society ,","society , but",", but he","but he possesses","he possesses a","possesses a gift","a gift :","gift : the",": the perfect","the perfect photographic","perfect photographic memory","photographic memory ,","memory , but",", but having","but having perfect","having perfect recall","perfect recall is","recall is n't","is n't all","n't all it","all it 's","it 's cracked","'s cracked up","cracked up to","up to be","A covert government","covert government agency","government agency headed","agency headed by","headed by Rez","by Rez 's","Rez 's old","'s old mentor","old mentor Haycock","mentor Haycock -","Haycock - played","- played by","played by Anthony","by Anthony Murphy","Anthony Murphy (","Murphy ( Charlie","( Charlie Casanova","Charlie Casanova ,","Casanova , Dawn",", Dawn of","Dawn of the","of the Dragonslayer","the Dragonslayer )","Dragonslayer ) has",") has stolen","has stolen a","stolen a device","a device called","device called '","called ' Titus","' Titus '","Titus ' ;","' ;

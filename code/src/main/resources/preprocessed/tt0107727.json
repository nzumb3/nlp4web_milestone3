{"title":"L'oeil de Vichy","plot":"This movie is only made of archive pictures: the official newsreels that were broadcasted on French movie screens during 1940 and 1944 (the Occupation). Those newsreels were controlled by the government of Vichy, which collaborated with the Nazis, so most of them are propaganda. Their purpose is to show what the disinformation was then, and perhaps more generally to evoke the problem of the power of the mass media.","genres":["Documentary"," War"],"stems":["This","movi","is","onli","made","of","archiv","pictur",":","the","offici","newsreel","that","were","broadcast","on","French","movi","screen","dure","1940","and","1944","(","the","Occupat",")",".","Those","newsreel","were","control","by","the","govern","of","Vichi",",","which","collabor","with","the","Nazi",",","so","most","of","them","are","propaganda",".","Their","purpos","is","to","show","what","the","disinform","was","then",",","and","perhap","more","general","to","evok","the","problem","of","the","power","of","the","mass","media","."],"lemmas":["this","movie","be","only","make","of","archive","picture",":","the","official","newsreel","that","be","broadcast","on","french","movie","screen","during","1940","and","1944","-lrb-","the","occupation","-rrb-",".","those","newsreel","be","control","by","the","government","of","Vichy",",","which","collaborate","with","the","Nazis",",","so","most","of","they","be","propaganda",".","they","purpose","be","to","show","what","the","disinformation","be","then",",","and","perhaps","more","generally","to","evoke","the","problem","of","the","power","of","the","mass","media","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This movie is","movie is only","is only made","only made of","made of archive","of archive pictures","archive pictures :","pictures : the",": the official","the official newsreels","official newsreels that","newsreels that were","that were broadcasted","were broadcasted on","broadcasted on French","on French movie","French movie screens","movie screens during","screens during 1940","during 1940 and","1940 and 1944","and 1944 (","1944 ( the","( the Occupation","the Occupation )","Those newsreels were","newsreels were controlled","were controlled by","controlled by the","by the government","the government of","government of Vichy","of Vichy ,","Vichy , which",", which collaborated","which collaborated with","collaborated with the","with the Nazis","the Nazis ,","Nazis , so",", so most","so most of","most of them","of them are","them are propaganda","Their purpose is","purpose is to","is to show","to show what","show what the","what the disinformation","the disinformation was","disinformation was then","was then ,","then , and",", and perhaps","and perhaps more","perhaps more generally","more generally to","generally to evoke","to evoke the","evoke the problem","the problem of","problem of the","of the power","the power of","power of the","of the mass","the mass media"],"2grams":["This movie","movie is","is only","only made","made of","of archive","archive pictures","pictures :",": the","the official","official newsreels","newsreels that","that were","were broadcasted","broadcasted on","on French","French movie","movie screens","screens during","during 1940","1940 and","and 1944","1944 (","( the","the Occupation","Occupation )","Those newsreels","newsreels were","were controlled","controlled by","by the","the government","government of","of Vichy","Vichy ,",", which","which collaborated","collaborated with","with the","the Nazis","Nazis ,",", so","so most","most of","of them","them are","are propaganda","Their purpose","purpose is","is to","to show","show what","what the","the disinformation","disinformation was","was then","then ,",", and","and perhaps","perhaps more","more generally","generally to","to evoke","evoke the","the problem","problem of","of the","the power","power of","of the","the mass","mass media"]}

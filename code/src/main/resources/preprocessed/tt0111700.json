{"title":"White Badge","plot":"South Korea, 1979. Han Kiju is an alcoholic novelist who has never recovered from his year long tour as a volunteer soldier in Vietnam. When he's asked to write a book about the Korean soldiers who fought in Vietnam he's battered by flashbacks that remind him of the brutality and lies that destroyed his innocence. The serialized novel brings him back in contact with a former soldier who served under him, PFC Pyon Chinsu, the one-time company clown driven mad by the violence of the war and who now looks to Han for some sort of emotional rescue.","genres":["War"],"stems":["South","Korea",",","1979",".","Han","Kiju","is","an","alcohol","novelist","who","has","never","recov","from","his","year","long","tour","as","a","volunt","soldier","in","Vietnam",".","When","he","'s","ask","to","write","a","book","about","the","Korean","soldier","who","fought","in","Vietnam","he","'s","batter","by","flashback","that","remind","him","of","the","brutal","and","lie","that","destroy","his","innoc",".","The","serial","novel","bring","him","back","in","contact","with","a","former","soldier","who","serv","under","him",",","PFC","Pyon","Chinsu",",","the","one-tim","compani","clown","driven","mad","by","the","violenc","of","the","war","and","who","now","look","to","Han","for","some","sort","of","emot","rescu","."],"lemmas":["South","Korea",",","1979",".","Han","Kiju","be","a","alcoholic","novelist","who","have","never","recover","from","he","year","long","tour","as","a","volunteer","soldier","in","Vietnam",".","when","he","be","ask","to","write","a","book","about","the","korean","soldier","who","fight","in","Vietnam","he","be","batter","by","flashback","that","remind","he","of","the","brutality","and","lie","that","destroy","he","innocence",".","the","serialize","novel","bring","he","back","in","contact","with","a","former","soldier","who","serve","under","he",",","PFC","Pyon","Chinsu",",","the","one-time","company","clown","drive","mad","by","the","violence","of","the","war","and","who","now","look","to","han","for","some","sort","of","emotional","rescue","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["South Korea ,","Korea , 1979","Han Kiju is","Kiju is an","is an alcoholic","an alcoholic novelist","alcoholic novelist who","novelist who has","who has never","has never recovered","never recovered from","recovered from his","from his year","his year long","year long tour","long tour as","tour as a","as a volunteer","a volunteer soldier","volunteer soldier in","soldier in Vietnam","When he 's","he 's asked","'s asked to","asked to write","to write a","write a book","a book about","book about the","about the Korean","the Korean soldiers","Korean soldiers who","soldiers who fought","who fought in","fought in Vietnam","in Vietnam he","Vietnam he 's","he 's battered","'s battered by","battered by flashbacks","by flashbacks that","flashbacks that remind","that remind him","remind him of","him of the","of the brutality","the brutality and","brutality and lies","and lies that","lies that destroyed","that destroyed his","destroyed his innocence","The serialized novel","serialized novel brings","novel brings him","brings him back","him back in","back in contact","in contact with","contact with a","with a former","a former soldier","former soldier who","soldier who served","who served under","served under him","under him ,","him , PFC",", PFC Pyon","PFC Pyon Chinsu","Pyon Chinsu ,","Chinsu , the",", the one-time","the one-time company","one-time company clown","company clown driven","clown driven mad","driven mad by","mad by the","by the violence","the violence of","violence of the","of the war","the war and","war and who","and who now","who now looks","now looks to","looks to Han","to Han for","Han for some","for some sort","some sort of","sort of emotional","of emotional rescue"],"2grams":["South Korea","Korea ,",", 1979","Han Kiju","Kiju is","is an","an alcoholic","alcoholic novelist","novelist who","who has","has never","never recovered","recovered from","from his","his year","year long","long tour","tour as","as a","a volunteer","volunteer soldier","soldier in","in Vietnam","When he","he 's","'s asked","asked to","to write","write a","a book","book about","about the","the Korean","Korean soldiers","soldiers who","who fought","fought in","in Vietnam","Vietnam he","he 's","'s battered","battered by","by flashbacks","flashbacks that","that remind","remind him","him of","of the","the brutality","brutality and","and lies","lies that","that destroyed","destroyed his","his innocence","The serialized","serialized novel","novel brings","brings him","him back","back in","in contact","contact with","with a","a former","former soldier","soldier who","who served","served under","under him","him ,",", PFC","PFC Pyon","Pyon Chinsu","Chinsu ,",", the","the one-time","one-time company","company clown","clown driven","driven mad","mad by","by the","the violence","violence of","of the","the war","war and","and who","who now","now looks","looks to","to Han","Han for","for some","some sort","sort of","of emotional","emotional rescue"]}

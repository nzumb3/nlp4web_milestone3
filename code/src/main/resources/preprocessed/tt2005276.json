{"title":"Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary","plot":"Unlike any other film, book, or article produced about Mumia Abu-Jamal, \"Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary\" focuses on his career as a prolific author and broadcaster from Pennsylvania's Death Row. In fact, the film does not deal with Abu-Jamal's case, but rather chronicles his life and work as a journalist and revolutionary - both prior and post incarceration. After Abu-Jamal is convicted for the murder of of Philadelphia patrolman Daniel Faulkner, the story then exposes Abu-Jamal's battles with the American court system to continue his work from prison- a battle he continues to wage to this very day.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Unlike","ani","other","film",",","book",",","or","articl","produc","about","Mumia","Abu-Jam",",","\"","Mumia",":","Long","Distanc","Revolutionari","\"","focus","on","his","career","as","a","prolif","author","and","broadcast","from","Pennsylvania","'s","Death","Row",".","In","fact",",","the","film","doe","not","deal","with","Abu-Jam","'s","case",",","but","rather","chronicl","his","life","and","work","as","a","journalist","and","revolutionari","-","both","prior","and","post","incarcer",".","After","Abu-Jam","is","convict","for","the","murder","of","of","Philadelphia","patrolman","Daniel","Faulkner",",","the","stori","then","expos","Abu-Jam","'s","battl","with","the","American","court","system","to","continu","his","work","from","prison","-","a","battl","he","continu","to","wage","to","this","veri","day","."],"lemmas":["unlike","any","other","film",",","book",",","or","article","produce","about","Mumia","Abu-Jamal",",","``","Mumia",":","Long","Distance","Revolutionary","''","focus","on","he","career","as","a","prolific","author","and","broadcaster","from","Pennsylvania","'s","Death","Row",".","in","fact",",","the","film","do","not","deal","with","Abu-Jamal","'s","case",",","but","rather","chronicle","he","life","and","work","as","a","journalist","and","revolutionary","-","both","prior","and","post","incarceration",".","after","Abu-Jamal","be","convict","for","the","murder","of","of","Philadelphia","patrolman","Daniel","Faulkner",",","the","story","then","expose","Abu-Jamal","'s","battle","with","the","american","court","system","to","continue","he","work","from","prison","-","a","battle","he","continue","to","wage","to","this","very","day","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Unlike any other","any other film","other film ,","film , book",", book ,","book , or",", or article","or article produced","article produced about","produced about Mumia","about Mumia Abu-Jamal","Mumia Abu-Jamal ,","Abu-Jamal , \"",", \" Mumia","\" Mumia :","Mumia : Long",": Long Distance","Long Distance Revolutionary","Distance Revolutionary \"","Revolutionary \" focuses","\" focuses on","focuses on his","on his career","his career as","career as a","as a prolific","a prolific author","prolific author and","author and broadcaster","and broadcaster from","broadcaster from Pennsylvania","from Pennsylvania 's","Pennsylvania 's Death","'s Death Row","In fact ,","fact , the",", the film","the film does","film does not","does not deal","not deal with","deal with Abu-Jamal","with Abu-Jamal 's","Abu-Jamal 's case","'s case ,","case , but",", but rather","but rather chronicles","rather chronicles his","chronicles his life","his life and","life and work","and work as","work as a","as a journalist","a journalist and","journalist and revolutionary","and revolutionary -","revolutionary -

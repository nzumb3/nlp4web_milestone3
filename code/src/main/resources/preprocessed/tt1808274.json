{"title":"At the Jersey Shore","plot":"Joe Lombardi -- a twenty-something man-child -- wants nothing more than to break away from his mundane suburban life and job at a local New Jersey newspaper. His editor, Mr. Simon, promises Joe a promotion to a big-time New York City paper if he writes one last, home-run article -- on the Jersey Shore dating scene. But Joe hasn't been down there since he was a kid, with his now-estranged mother; and he has a general disdain for the Jersey Shore culture. He reluctantly takes on the story and is writing about Danny, his best friend who believes that he can meet a wife in the clubs; Marc, a nerdy guy from high school who has now transformed himself into a club going, drug using, fornicator and Ashley, his boss's wild niece, who secretly aspires to a life as a fashion designer. Eventually, writing about these quirky characters opens Joe's eyes, forcing him to truly understand all that the area has to offer and making him re-evaluate his own life... and grow up.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Joe","Lombardi","--","a","twenty-someth","man-child","--","want","noth","more","than","to","break","away","from","his","mundan","suburban","life","and","job","at","a","local","New","Jersey","newspap",".","His","editor",",","Mr.","Simon",",","promis","Joe","a","promot","to","a","big-tim","New","York","Citi","paper","if","he","write","one","last",",","home-run","articl","--","on","the","Jersey","Shore","date","scene",".","But","Joe","has","n't","been","down","there","sinc","he","was","a","kid",",","with","his","now-estrang","mother",";","and","he","has","a","general","disdain","for","the","Jersey","Shore","cultur",".","He","reluct","take","on","the","stori","and","is","write","about","Danni",",","his","best","friend","who","believ","that","he","can","meet","a","wife","in","the","club",";","Marc",",","a","nerdi","guy","from","high","school","who","has","now","transform","himself","into","a","club","go",",","drug","use",",","fornic","and","Ashley",",","his","boss","'s","wild","niec",",","who","secret","aspir","to","a","life","as","a","fashion","design",".","Eventual",",","write","about","these","quirki","charact","open","Joe","'s","eye",",","forc","him","to","truli","understand","all","that","the","area","has","to","offer","and","make","him","re-evalu","his","own","life","...","and","grow","up","."],"lemmas":["Joe","Lombardi","--","a","twenty-something","man-child","--","want","nothing","more","than","to","break","away","from","he","mundane","suburban","life","and","job","at","a","local","New","Jersey","newspaper",".","he","editor",",","Mr.","Simon",",","promise","Joe","a","promotion","to","a","big-time","New","York","City","paper","if","he","write","one","last",",","home-run","article","--","on","the","Jersey","Shore","date","scene",".","but","Joe","have","not","be","down","there","since","he","be","a","kid",",","with","he","now-estranged","mother",";","and","he","have","a","general","disdain","for","the","Jersey","Shore","culture",".","he","reluctantly","take","on","the","story","and","be","write","about","Danny",",","he","best","friend","who","believe","that","he","can","meet","a","wife","in","the","club",";","Marc",",","a","nerdy","guy","from","high","school","who","have","now","transform","himself","into","a","club","go",",","drug","use",",","fornicator","and","ashley",",","he","boss","'s","wild","niece",",","who","secretly","aspire","to","a","life","as","a","fashion","designer",".","eventually",",","write","about","these","quirky","character","open","Joe","'s","eye",",","force","he","to","truly","understand","all","that","the","area","have","to","offer","and","make","he","re-evaluate","he","own","life","...","and","grow","up","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Joe Lombardi --","Lombardi -- a","-- a twenty-something","a twenty-something man-child","twenty-something man-child --","man-child -- wants","-- wants nothing","wants nothing more","nothing more than","more than to","than to break","to break away","break away from","away from his","from his mundane","his mundane suburban","mundane suburban life","suburban life and","life and job","and job at","job at a","at a local","a local New","local New Jersey","New Jersey newspaper","His editor ,","editor , Mr.",", Mr. Simon","Mr. Simon ,","Simon , promises",", promises Joe","promises Joe a","Joe a promotion","a promotion to","promotion to a","to a big-time","a big-time New","big-time New York","New York City","York City paper","City paper if","paper if he","if he writes","he writes one","writes one last","one last ,","last , home-run",", home-run article","home-run article --","article -- on","-- on the","on the Jersey","the Jersey Shore","Jersey Shore dating","Shore dating scene","But Joe has","Joe has n't","has n't been","n't been down","been down there","down there since","there since he","since he was","he was a","was a kid","a kid ,","kid , with",", with his","with his now-estranged","his now-estranged mother","now-estranged mother ;","mother ;

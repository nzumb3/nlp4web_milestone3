{"title":"Love & Dance","plot":"Chen, a young kid, is battling a cultural conflict between his Russian born mother and Israeli father. She is cultured and used to the finer things in life, including theater and fine dining. He is gruff on the outside but sweet on the inside - a Sabra; and looking to make his young son a man rather than the wimp his mother is raising. One day, Chen stumbles upon a ballroom dance class for young people and sees Natalie, a stunning Russian young girl he falls in love with immediately. His interest in Natalie leads him to taking ballroom dancing and to ultimately bridging the cultural divide of his own family - through the Cha Cha and the Tango. The teachers are a pair of former Russian world champions who never quite fulfilled their potential, but find themselves battling their demons through the instructions of the kids.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["Chen",",","a","young","kid",",","is","battl","a","cultur","conflict","between","his","Russian","born","mother","and","Israeli","father",".","She","is","cultur","and","use","to","the","finer","thing","in","life",",","includ","theater","and","fine","dine",".","He","is","gruff","on","the","outsid","but","sweet","on","the","insid","-","a","Sabra",";","and","look","to","make","his","young","son","a","man","rather","than","the","wimp","his","mother","is","rais",".","One","day",",","Chen","stumbl","upon","a","ballroom","danc","class","for","young","peopl","and","see","Natali",",","a","stun","Russian","young","girl","he","fall","in","love","with","immedi",".","His","interest","in","Natali","lead","him","to","take","ballroom","danc","and","to","ultim","bridg","the","cultur","divid","of","his","own","famili","-","through","the","Cha","Cha","and","the","Tango",".","The","teacher","are","a","pair","of","former","Russian","world","champion","who","never","quit","fulfil","their","potenti",",","but","find","themselv","battl","their","demon","through","the","instruct","of","the","kid","."],"lemmas":["Chen",",","a","young","kid",",","be","battle","a","cultural","conflict","between","he","russian","born","mother","and","israeli","father",".","she","be","culture","and","use","to","the","finer","thing","in","life",",","include","theater","and","fine","dining",".","he","be","gruff","on","the","outside","but","sweet","on","the","inside","-","a","Sabra",";","and","look","to","make","he","young","son","a","man","rather","than","the","wimp","he","mother","be","raise",".","one","day",",","Chen","stumble","upon","a","ballroom","dance","class","for","young","people","and","see","Natalie",",","a","stunning","russian","young","girl","he","fall","in","love","with","immediately",".","he","interest","in","Natalie","lead","he","to","take","ballroom","dancing","and","to","ultimately","bridge","the","cultural","divide","of","he","own","family","-","through","the","Cha","Cha","and","the","Tango",".","the","teacher","be","a","pair","of","former","russian","world","champion","who","never","quite","fulfil","they","potential",",","but","find","themselves","battle","they","demon","through","the","instruction","of","the","kid","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Chen , a",", a young","a young kid","young kid ,","kid , is",", is battling","is battling a","battling a cultural","a cultural conflict","cultural conflict between","conflict between his","between his Russian","his Russian born","Russian born mother","born mother and","mother and Israeli","and Israeli father","She is cultured","is cultured and","cultured and used","and used to","used to the","to the finer","the finer things","finer things in","things in life","in life ,","life , including",", including theater","including theater and","theater and fine","and fine dining","He is gruff","is gruff on","gruff on the","on the outside","the outside but","outside but sweet","but sweet on","sweet on the","on the inside","the inside -","inside - a","- a Sabra","a Sabra ;","Sabra ;

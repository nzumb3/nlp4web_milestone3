{"title":"The Language of Kickball","plot":"\"Sometimes I'm only pretending to listen.\" \"Sometimes I'm only pretending to talk!\" The verbal volleys go back and forth in actor/filmmaker Michael Barron's feature debut, a made-in-Cleveland comedy that plays as though Samuel Beckett, Tom Stoppard, Whit Stillman got tossed into the same burning Cuyahoga River together and clung to a Drew Carey-shaped flotation device for safety. Barron plays Fitz, a young man facing the world (i.e. dreary jobs at places like Burger Bazaar) armed with a worthless creative writing degree, a car composed mostly of rust, and arcane philosophies nurtured along by his slacker housemate Austin, ten years a lazy mall janitor and proud of it. Austin is able to pull some strings with upper management and gets Fitz in a position - wearing a urine-stained bunny costume at an Easter display. Just when it looks like things can't get any worse for the hero, a guy calling himself the devil offers to buy his soul, adding that Fitz should sell now, while it's still worth something.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["\"","Sometim","I","'m","onli","pretend","to","listen",".","\"","\"","Sometim","I","'m","onli","pretend","to","talk","!","\"","The","verbal","volley","go","back","and","forth","in","actor/filmmak","Michael","Barron","'s","featur","debut",",","a","made-in-Cleveland","comedi","that","play","as","though","Samuel","Beckett",",","Tom","Stoppard",",","Whit","Stillman","got","toss","into","the","same","burn","Cuyahoga","River","togeth","and","clung","to","a","Drew","Carey-shap","flotat","devic","for","safeti",".","Barron","play","Fitz",",","a","young","man","face","the","world","(","i.e.","dreari","job","at","place","like","Burger","Bazaar",")","arm","with","a","worthless","creativ","write","degre",",","a","car","compos","most","of","rust",",","and","arcan","philosophi","nurtur","along","by","his","slacker","housem","Austin",",","ten","year","a","lazi","mall","janitor","and","proud","of","it",".","Austin","is","abl","to","pull","some","string","with","upper","manag","and","get","Fitz","in","a","posit","-","wear","a","urine-stain","bunni","costum","at","an","Easter","display",".","Just","when","it","look","like","thing","ca","n't","get","ani","wors","for","the","hero",",","a","guy","call","himself","the","devil","offer","to","buy","his","soul",",","ad","that","Fitz","should","sell","now",",","while","it","'s","still","worth","someth","."],"lemmas":["``","sometimes","I","be","only","pretend","to","listen",".","''","``","sometimes","I","be","only","pretend","to","talk","!","''","the","verbal","volley","go","back","and","forth","in","actor/filmmaker","Michael","Barron","'s","feature","debut",",","a","made-in-cleveland","comedy","that","play","as","though","Samuel","Beckett",",","Tom","Stoppard",",","Whit","Stillman","get","toss","into","the","same","burning","Cuyahoga","River","together","and","cling","to","a","Drew","carey-shaped","flotation","device","for","safety",".","Barron","play","Fitz",",","a","young","man","face","the","world","-lrb-","i.e.","dreary","job","at","place","like","Burger","Bazaar","-rrb-","arm","with","a","worthless","creative","writing","degree",",","a","car","compose","mostly","of","rust",",","and","arcane","philosophy","nurture","along","by","he","slacker","housemate","Austin",",","ten","year","a","lazy","mall","janitor","and","proud","of","it",".","Austin","be","able","to","pull","some","string","with","upper","management","and","get","Fitz","in","a","position","-","wear","a","urine-stained","bunny","costume","at","a","Easter","display",".","just","when","it","look","like","thing","can","not","get","any","worse","for","the","hero",",","a","guy","call","himself","the","devil","offer","to","buy","he","soul",",","add","that","Fitz","should","sell","now",",","while","it","be","still","worth","something","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Sometimes I","Sometimes I 'm","I 'm only","'m only pretending","only pretending to","pretending to listen","to listen .","listen . \"","\" Sometimes I","Sometimes I 'm","I 'm only","'m only pretending","only pretending to","pretending to talk","to talk !","talk !

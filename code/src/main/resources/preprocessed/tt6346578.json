{"title":"Jards","plot":"The celebrated composer and musician Jards Macalé is in the recording studio where director Eryk Rocha captures him in a wide variety of poses and states of creating, imaginatively varying style and shooting formats. Fashioning an intimately attuned portrait of an artist, Rocha uses his camera as an instrument to riff with Jards in a poetic exchange between images and music. The repetitive, time-stopping process of rehearsal and the flow of energy between the two art forms create an elegiac vision of the creativity of some of Brazil's most beloved singers and musicians.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","celebr","compos","and","musician","Jard","Macalé","is","in","the","record","studio","where","director","Eryk","Rocha","captur","him","in","a","wide","varieti","of","pose","and","state","of","creat",",","imagin","vari","style","and","shoot","format",".","Fashion","an","intim","attun","portrait","of","an","artist",",","Rocha","use","his","camera","as","an","instrument","to","riff","with","Jard","in","a","poetic","exchang","between","imag","and","music",".","The","repetit",",","time-stop","process","of","rehears","and","the","flow","of","energi","between","the","two","art","form","creat","an","elegiac","vision","of","the","creativ","of","some","of","Brazil","'s","most","belov","singer","and","musician","."],"lemmas":["the","celebrated","composer","and","musician","Jards","Macalé","be","in","the","recording","studio","where","director","Eryk","Rocha","capture","he","in","a","wide","variety","of","pose","and","state","of","create",",","imaginatively","vary","style","and","shooting","format",".","fashion","a","intimately","attuned","portrait","of","a","artist",",","Rocha","use","he","camera","as","a","instrument","to","riff","with","Jards","in","a","poetic","exchange","between","image","and","music",".","the","repetitive",",","time-stopping","process","of","rehearsal","and","the","flow","of","energy","between","the","two","art","form","create","a","elegiac","vision","of","the","creativity","of","some","of","Brazil","'s","most","beloved","singer","and","musician","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The celebrated composer","celebrated composer and","composer and musician","and musician Jards","musician Jards Macalé","Jards Macalé is","Macalé is in","is in the","in the recording","the recording studio","recording studio where","studio where director","where director Eryk","director Eryk Rocha","Eryk Rocha captures","Rocha captures him","captures him in","him in a","in a wide","a wide variety","wide variety of","variety of poses","of poses and","poses and states","and states of","states of creating","of creating ,","creating , imaginatively",", imaginatively varying","imaginatively varying style","varying style and","style and shooting","and shooting formats","Fashioning an intimately","an intimately attuned","intimately attuned portrait","attuned portrait of","portrait of an","of an artist","an artist ,","artist , Rocha",", Rocha uses","Rocha uses his","uses his camera","his camera as","camera as an","as an instrument","an instrument to","instrument to riff","to riff with","riff with Jards","with Jards in","Jards in a","in a poetic","a poetic exchange","poetic exchange between","exchange between images","between images and","images and music","The repetitive ,","repetitive , time-stopping",", time-stopping process","time-stopping process of","process of rehearsal","of rehearsal and","rehearsal and the","and the flow","the flow of","flow of energy","of energy between","energy between the","between the two","the two art","two art forms","art forms create","forms create an","create an elegiac","an elegiac vision","elegiac vision of","vision of the","of the creativity","the creativity of","creativity of some","of some of","some of Brazil","of Brazil 's","Brazil 's most","'s most beloved","most beloved singers","beloved singers and","singers and musicians"],"2grams":["The celebrated","celebrated composer","composer and","and musician","musician Jards","Jards Macalé","Macalé is","is in","in the","the recording","recording studio","studio where","where director","director Eryk","Eryk Rocha","Rocha captures","captures him","him in","in a","a wide","wide variety","variety of","of poses","poses and","and states","states of","of creating","creating ,",", imaginatively","imaginatively varying","varying style","style and","and shooting","shooting formats","Fashioning an","an intimately","intimately attuned","attuned portrait","portrait of","of an","an artist","artist ,",", Rocha","Rocha uses","uses his","his camera","camera as","as an","an instrument","instrument to","to riff","riff with","with Jards","Jards in","in a","a poetic","poetic exchange","exchange between","between images","images and","and music","The repetitive","repetitive ,",", time-stopping","time-stopping process","process of","of rehearsal","rehearsal and","and the","the flow","flow of","of energy","energy between","between the","the two","two art","art forms","forms create","create an","an elegiac","elegiac vision","vision of","of the","the creativity","creativity of","of some","some of","of Brazil","Brazil 's","'s most","most beloved","beloved singers","singers and","and musicians"]}

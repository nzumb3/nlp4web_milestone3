{"title":"Ik ook van jou","plot":"While camping in France, Dutch friends Eric and Eddy fall in with two women. Eric talks to Silke, a Ugandan studying medicine in Holland. She tells him about her life and asks about the book he's writing: it's the story of his love affair with Reza. He tells her the story and we see it in flashbacks: Reza explodes into his boring life, she's unpredictable, their relationship becomes intense. She moves in with him, pushes him to write instead of studying law, then jealousy and fits of bizarre self-destruction become part of her quixotic moods. How does Eric's story end?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["While","camp","in","Franc",",","Dutch","friend","Eric","and","Eddi","fall","in","with","two","women",".","Eric","talk","to","Silk",",","a","Ugandan","studi","medicin","in","Holland",".","She","tell","him","about","her","life","and","ask","about","the","book","he","'s","write",":","it","'s","the","stori","of","his","love","affair","with","Reza",".","He","tell","her","the","stori","and","we","see","it","in","flashback",":","Reza","explod","into","his","bore","life",",","she","'s","unpredict",",","their","relationship","becom","intens",".","She","move","in","with","him",",","push","him","to","write","instead","of","studi","law",",","then","jealousi","and","fit","of","bizarr","self-destruct","becom","part","of","her","quixot","mood",".","How","doe","Eric","'s","stori","end","?"],"lemmas":["while","camping","in","France",",","Dutch","friend","Eric","and","Eddy","fall","in","with","two","woman",".","Eric","talk","to","Silke",",","a","Ugandan","study","medicine","in","Holland",".","she","tell","he","about","she","life","and","ask","about","the","book","he","be","write",":","it","be","the","story","of","he","love","affair","with","Reza",".","he","tell","she","the","story","and","we","see","it","in","flashback",":","reza","explode","into","he","boring","life",",","she","be","unpredictable",",","they","relationship","become","intense",".","she","move","in","with","he",",","push","he","to","write","instead","of","study","law",",","then","jealousy","and","fit","of","bizarre","self-destruction","become","part","of","she","quixotic","mood",".","how","do","Eric","'s","story","end","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["While camping in","camping in France","in France ,","France , Dutch",", Dutch friends","Dutch friends Eric","friends Eric and","Eric and Eddy","and Eddy fall","Eddy fall in","fall in with","in with two","with two women","Eric talks to","talks to Silke","to Silke ,","Silke , a",", a Ugandan","a Ugandan studying","Ugandan studying medicine","studying medicine in","medicine in Holland","She tells him","tells him about","him about her","about her life","her life and","life and asks","and asks about","asks about the","about the book","the book he","book he 's","he 's writing","'s writing :","writing : it",": it 's","it 's the","'s the story","the story of","story of his","of his love","his love affair","love affair with","affair with Reza","He tells her","tells her the","her the story","the story and","story and we","and we see","we see it","see it in","it in flashbacks","in flashbacks :","flashbacks : Reza",": Reza explodes","Reza explodes into","explodes into his","into his boring","his boring life","boring life ,","life , she",", she 's","she 's unpredictable","'s unpredictable ,","unpredictable , their",", their relationship","their relationship becomes","relationship becomes intense","She moves in","moves in with","in with him","with him ,","him , pushes",", pushes him","pushes him to","him to write","to write instead","write instead of","instead of studying","of studying law","studying law ,","law , then",", then jealousy","then jealousy and","jealousy and fits","and fits of","fits of bizarre","of bizarre self-destruction","bizarre self-destruction become","self-destruction become part","become part of","part of her","of her quixotic","her quixotic moods","How does Eric","does Eric 's","Eric 's story","'s story end"],"2grams":["While camping","camping in","in France","France ,",", Dutch","Dutch friends","friends Eric","Eric and","and Eddy","Eddy fall","fall in","in with","with two","two women","Eric talks","talks to","to Silke","Silke ,",", a","a Ugandan","Ugandan studying","studying medicine","medicine in","in Holland","She tells","tells him","him about","about her","her life","life and","and asks","asks about","about the","the book","book he","he 's","'s writing","writing :",": it","it 's","'s the","the story","story of","of his","his love","love affair","affair with","with Reza","He tells","tells her","her the","the story","story and","and we","we see","see it","it in","in flashbacks","flashbacks :",": Reza","Reza explodes","explodes into","into his","his boring","boring life","life ,",", she","she 's","'s unpredictable","unpredictable ,",", their","their relationship","relationship becomes","becomes intense","She moves","moves in","in with","with him","him ,",", pushes","pushes him","him to","to write","write instead","instead of","of studying","studying law","law ,",", then","then jealousy","jealousy and","and fits","fits of","of bizarre","bizarre self-destruction","self-destruction become","become part","part of","of her","her quixotic","quixotic moods","How does","does Eric","Eric 's","'s story","story end"]}

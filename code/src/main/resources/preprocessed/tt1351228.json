{"title":"River Right of Passage","plot":"River Right of Passage chronicles an 18-day Grand Canyon expedition of two generations of river-runners, providing a window into unique familial and community relationships that center around whitewater rafting. The documentary follows Marty, Rick, and Steve who all started boating in the early 1980's. Whitewater rafting is such a fundamental part of their lives that these men raised their children on the water. 16-year-old Shon is a daredevil kayaker, 17-year-old Kelsey is an avid boater, and twenty-year-old Noah is a competent guide. Only 14-year-old Eliza has fears about whitewater and is ill at ease. While the wilderness hazards of rainstorms, sandstorms, sunburn, dehydration, extreme winds, poisonous reptiles, and turbulent waters are challenging; interpersonal dynamics and the emotional stresses of expedition prove to be admirable adversaries.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["River","Right","of","Passag","chronicl","an","18-day","Grand","Canyon","expedit","of","two","generat","of","river-runn",",","provid","a","window","into","uniqu","famili","and","communiti","relationship","that","center","around","whitewat","raft",".","The","documentari","follow","Marti",",","Rick",",","and","Steve","who","all","start","boat","in","the","earli","1980","'s",".","Whitewat","raft","is","such","a","fundament","part","of","their","live","that","these","men","rais","their","children","on","the","water",".","16-year-old","Shon","is","a","daredevil","kayak",",","17-year-old","Kelsey","is","an","avid","boater",",","and","twenty-year-old","Noah","is","a","compet","guid",".","Onli","14-year-old","Eliza","has","fear","about","whitewat","and","is","ill","at","eas",".","While","the","wilder","hazard","of","rainstorm",",","sandstorm",",","sunburn",",","dehydr",",","extrem","wind",",","poison","reptil",",","and","turbul","water","are","challeng",";","interperson","dynam","and","the","emot","stress","of","expedit","prove","to","be","admir","adversari","."],"lemmas":["River","Right","of","passage","chronicle","a","18-day","Grand","Canyon","expedition","of","two","generation","of","river-runner",",","provide","a","window","into","unique","familial","and","community","relationship","that","center","around","whitewater","rafting",".","the","documentary","follow","Marty",",","Rick",",","and","Steve","who","all","start","boat","in","the","early","1980","'s",".","whitewater","rafting","be","such","a","fundamental","part","of","they","life","that","these","man","raise","they","child","on","the","water",".","16-year-old","Shon","be","a","daredevil","kayaker",",","17-year-old","Kelsey","be","a","avid","boater",",","and","twenty-year-old","Noah","be","a","competent","guide",".","only","14-year-old","Eliza","have","fear","about","whitewater","and","be","ill","at","ease",".","while","the","wilderness","hazard","of","rainstorm",",","sandstorm",",","sunburn",",","dehydration",",","extreme","wind",",","poisonous","reptile",",","and","turbulent","water","be","challenging",";","interpersonal","dynamics","and","the","emotional","stress","of","expedition","prove","to","be","admirable","adversary","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["River Right of","Right of Passage","of Passage chronicles","Passage chronicles an","chronicles an 18-day","an 18-day Grand","18-day Grand Canyon","Grand Canyon expedition","Canyon expedition of","expedition of two","of two generations","two generations of","generations of river-runners","of river-runners ,","river-runners , providing",", providing a","providing a window","a window into","window into unique","into unique familial","unique familial and","familial and community","and community relationships","community relationships that","relationships that center","that center around","center around whitewater","around whitewater rafting","The documentary follows","documentary follows Marty","follows Marty ,","Marty , Rick",", Rick ,","Rick , and",", and Steve","and Steve who","Steve who all","who all started","all started boating","started boating in","boating in the","in the early","the early 1980","early 1980 's","Whitewater rafting is","rafting is such","is such a","such a fundamental","a fundamental part","fundamental part of","part of their","of their lives","their lives that","lives that these","that these men","these men raised","men raised their","raised their children","their children on","children on the","on the water","16-year-old Shon is","Shon is a","is a daredevil","a daredevil kayaker","daredevil kayaker ,","kayaker , 17-year-old",", 17-year-old Kelsey","17-year-old Kelsey is","Kelsey is an","is an avid","an avid boater","avid boater ,","boater , and",", and twenty-year-old","and twenty-year-old Noah","twenty-year-old Noah is","Noah is a","is a competent","a competent guide","Only 14-year-old Eliza","14-year-old Eliza has","Eliza has fears","has fears about","fears about whitewater","about whitewater and","whitewater and is","and is ill","is ill at","ill at ease","While the wilderness","the wilderness hazards","wilderness hazards of","hazards of rainstorms","of rainstorms ,","rainstorms , sandstorms",", sandstorms ,","sandstorms , sunburn",", sunburn ,","sunburn , dehydration",", dehydration ,","dehydration , extreme",", extreme winds","extreme winds ,","winds , poisonous",", poisonous reptiles","poisonous reptiles ,","reptiles , and",", and turbulent","and turbulent waters","turbulent waters are","waters are challenging","are challenging ;","challenging ;

{"title":"Mondays in the Sun","plot":"2001: men without jobs, in the port city of Vigo. Six men worked in a shipyard, now shuttered. They pass the time at La Naval, a bar opened by one of them after the yard closed. They face their futures in makeshift ways: Rico has his bar and a sharp 15-year-old daughter, Reina has become a watchman and a moralizer, Lino fills out job applications, Amador drinks heavily and talks of his wife's return; José is married to Ana, who works at a cannery and tires of being the breadwinner amidst José's emasculated moodiness; Santa, the group's conscience and troublemaker, occasionally fantasizes about Australia. In truth, all are joined like Siamese twins, adrift.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["2001",":","men","without","job",",","in","the","port","citi","of","Vigo",".","Six","men","work","in","a","shipyard",",","now","shutter",".","They","pass","the","time","at","La","Naval",",","a","bar","open","by","one","of","them","after","the","yard","close",".","They","face","their","futur","in","makeshift","way",":","Rico","has","his","bar","and","a","sharp","15-year-old","daughter",",","Reina","has","becom","a","watchman","and","a","moral",",","Lino","fill","out","job","applic",",","Amador","drink","heavili","and","talk","of","his","wife","'s","return",";","José","is","marri","to","Ana",",","who","work","at","a","canneri","and","tire","of","be","the","breadwinn","amidst","José","'s","emascul","moodi",";","Santa",",","the","group","'s","conscienc","and","troublemak",",","occasion","fantas","about","Australia",".","In","truth",",","all","are","join","like","Siames","twin",",","adrift","."],"lemmas":["2001",":","man","without","job",",","in","the","port","city","of","Vigo",".","six","man","work","in","a","shipyard",",","now","shutter",".","they","pass","the","time","at","La","Naval",",","a","bar","open","by","one","of","they","after","the","yard","close",".","they","face","they","future","in","makeshift","way",":","Rico","have","he","bar","and","a","sharp","15-year-old","daughter",",","Reina","have","become","a","watchman","and","a","moralizer",",","Lino","fill","out","job","application",",","Amador","drink","heavily","and","talk","of","he","wife","'s","return",";","José","be","marry","to","Ana",",","who","work","at","a","cannery","and","tire","of","be","the","breadwinner","amidst","José","'s","emasculate","moodiness",";","Santa",",","the","group","'s","conscience","and","troublemaker",",","occasionally","fantasize","about","Australia",".","in","truth",",","all","be","join","like","Siamese","twin",",","adrift","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["2001 : men",": men without","men without jobs","without jobs ,","jobs , in",", in the","in the port","the port city","port city of","city of Vigo","Six men worked","men worked in","worked in a","in a shipyard","a shipyard ,","shipyard , now",", now shuttered","They pass the","pass the time","the time at","time at La","at La Naval","La Naval ,","Naval , a",", a bar","a bar opened","bar opened by","opened by one","by one of","one of them","of them after","them after the","after the yard","the yard closed","They face their","face their futures","their futures in","futures in makeshift","in makeshift ways","makeshift ways :","ways : Rico",": Rico has","Rico has his","has his bar","his bar and","bar and a","and a sharp","a sharp 15-year-old","sharp 15-year-old daughter","15-year-old daughter ,","daughter , Reina",", Reina has","Reina has become","has become a","become a watchman","a watchman and","watchman and a","and a moralizer","a moralizer ,","moralizer , Lino",", Lino fills","Lino fills out","fills out job","out job applications","job applications ,","applications , Amador",", Amador drinks","Amador drinks heavily","drinks heavily and","heavily and talks","and talks of","talks of his","of his wife","his wife 's","wife 's return","'s return ;","return ;

{"title":"Mother of Normandy: The Story of Simone Renaud","plot":"This is the story of one remarkable woman, whose devotion to a generation of heroes transcended all boundries. Madame Simone Renaud witnessed the liberation of France on June 6, 1944 for a very unique point the- the small town of St. Mere Eglise- the first town liberated in the D Day invasion. It was here that she & her husband, the mayor of St. Mere Eglise watched the triumph & tragedy unfold during a day that defined history. And it was here that so many American soldiers, who gave their lives to protect freedom and democracy, found their final resting place. Madame Renaud spent a lifetime tending to the graves of those American soldiers and corresponding with their loved ones back home. She became friend, family and touchstone to those whose lives were forever changed by D Day. The mark she left is indelible. Her story is too.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Drama"],"stems":["This","is","the","stori","of","one","remark","woman",",","whose","devot","to","a","generat","of","hero","transcend","all","boundri",".","Madam","Simon","Renaud","wit","the","liber","of","Franc","on","June","6",",","1944","for","a","veri","uniqu","point","the","-","the","small","town","of","St.","Mere","Eglise","-","the","first","town","liber","in","the","D","Day","invas",".","It","was","here","that","she","&","her","husband",",","the","mayor","of","St.","Mere","Eglise","watch","the","triumph","&","tragedi","unfold","dure","a","day","that","defin","histori",".","And","it","was","here","that","so","mani","American","soldier",",","who","gave","their","live","to","protect","freedom","and","democraci",",","found","their","final","rest","place",".","Madam","Renaud","spent","a","lifetim","tend","to","the","grave","of","those","American","soldier","and","correspond","with","their","love","one","back","home",".","She","becam","friend",",","famili","and","touchston","to","those","whose","live","were","forev","chang","by","D","Day",".","The","mark","she","left","is","indel",".","Her","stori","is","too","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","story","of","one","remarkable","woman",",","whose","devotion","to","a","generation","of","hero","transcend","all","boundry",".","Madame","Simone","Renaud","witness","the","liberation","of","France","on","June","6",",","1944","for","a","very","unique","point","the","-","the","small","town","of","St.","Mere","Eglise","-","the","first","town","liberate","in","the","d","day","invasion",".","it","be","here","that","she","&","she","husband",",","the","mayor","of","St.","Mere","Eglise","watch","the","triumph","&","tragedy","unfold","during","a","day","that","define","history",".","and","it","be","here","that","so","many","american","soldier",",","who","give","they","life","to","protect","freedom","and","democracy",",","find","they","final","rest","place",".","Madame","Renaud","spend","a","lifetime","tend","to","the","grave","of","those","american","soldier","and","correspond","with","they","love","one","back","home",".","she","become","friend",",","family","and","touchstone","to","those","whose","life","be","forever","change","by","d","day",".","the","mark","she","leave","be","indelible",".","she","story","be","too","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is the","is the story","the story of","story of one","of one remarkable","one remarkable woman","remarkable woman ,","woman , whose",", whose devotion","whose devotion to","devotion to a","to a generation","a generation of","generation of heroes","of heroes transcended","heroes transcended all","transcended all boundries","Madame Simone Renaud","Simone Renaud witnessed","Renaud witnessed the","witnessed the liberation","the liberation of","liberation of France","of France on","France on June","on June 6","June 6 ,","6 , 1944",", 1944 for","1944 for a","for a very","a very unique","very unique point","unique point the","point the -","the -

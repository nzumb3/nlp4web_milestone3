{"title":"Fata Morgana","plot":"The director, Zaradasht Ahmed (1968), turns into a character in the film. His background and, not least, his inquisitiveness and fascination guide us as we enter this world of his. He himself has made the journey into Europe, albeit for separate and possibly more serious reasons than our other characters, but he has no trouble comprehending their motive power. Zaradasht fled from the First Gulf War; he had just graduated from the Kirkuk Institute of Technology in Northern Iraq. He wandered through the minefields in the Kurdish part of Iraq, and eventually reached Syria and later Lebanon. After five years on the run, he arrived in Norway in 1995 as a quota refugee. He still lives here, he has passed 40, and feels he has to move on. Life in Norway is safe and comfortable, but something is lacking. Fata Morgana lies to the south, beyond Gibraltar. Here he meets someone who reminds him of the dream he had as a young man.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","director",",","Zaradasht","Ahmed","(","1968",")",",","turn","into","a","charact","in","the","film",".","His","background","and",",","not","least",",","his","inquisit","and","fascin","guid","us","as","we","enter","this","world","of","his",".","He","himself","has","made","the","journey","into","Europ",",","albeit","for","separ","and","possibl","more","serious","reason","than","our","other","charact",",","but","he","has","no","troubl","comprehend","their","motiv","power",".","Zaradasht","fled","from","the","First","Gulf","War",";","he","had","just","graduat","from","the","Kirkuk","Institut","of","Technolog","in","Northern","Iraq",".","He","wander","through","the","minefield","in","the","Kurdish","part","of","Iraq",",","and","eventu","reach","Syria","and","later","Lebanon",".","After","five","year","on","the","run",",","he","arriv","in","Norway","in","1995","as","a","quota","refuge",".","He","still","live","here",",","he","has","pass","40",",","and","feel","he","has","to","move","on",".","Life","in","Norway","is","safe","and","comfort",",","but","someth","is","lack",".","Fata","Morgana","lie","to","the","south",",","beyond","Gibraltar",".","Here","he","meet","someon","who","remind","him","of","the","dream","he","had","as","a","young","man","."],"lemmas":["the","director",",","Zaradasht","Ahmed","-lrb-","1968","-rrb-",",","turn","into","a","character","in","the","film",".","he","background","and",",","not","least",",","he","inquisitiveness","and","fascination","guide","we","as","we","enter","this","world","of","he",".","he","himself","have","make","the","journey","into","Europe",",","albeit","for","separate","and","possibly","more","serious","reason","than","we","other","character",",","but","he","have","no","trouble","comprehend","they","motive","power",".","Zaradasht","flee","from","the","First","Gulf","War",";","he","have","just","graduate","from","the","Kirkuk","Institute","of","Technology","in","Northern","Iraq",".","he","wander","through","the","minefield","in","the","kurdish","part","of","Iraq",",","and","eventually","reach","Syria","and","later","Lebanon",".","after","five","year","on","the","run",",","he","arrive","in","Norway","in","1995","as","a","quota","refugee",".","he","still","live","here",",","he","have","pass","40",",","and","feel","he","have","to","move","on",".","life","in","Norway","be","safe","and","comfortable",",","but","something","be","lack",".","Fata","Morgana","lie","to","the","south",",","beyond","Gibraltar",".","here","he","meet","someone","who","remind","he","of","the","dream","he","have","as","a","young","man","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The director ,","director , Zaradasht",", Zaradasht Ahmed","Zaradasht Ahmed (","Ahmed ( 1968","( 1968 )","1968 ) ,",") , turns",", turns into","turns into a","into a character","a character in","character in the","in the film","His background and","background and ,","and , not",", not least","not least ,","least , his",", his inquisitiveness","his inquisitiveness and","inquisitiveness and fascination","and fascination guide","fascination guide us","guide us as","us as we","as we enter","we enter this","enter this world","this world of","world of his","He himself has","himself has made","has made the","made the journey","the journey into","journey into Europe","into Europe ,","Europe , albeit",", albeit for","albeit for separate","for separate and","separate and possibly","and possibly more","possibly more serious","more serious reasons","serious reasons than","reasons than our","than our other","our other characters","other characters ,","characters , but",", but he","but he has","he has no","has no trouble","no trouble comprehending","trouble comprehending their","comprehending their motive","their motive power","Zaradasht fled from","fled from the","from the First","the First Gulf","First Gulf War","Gulf War ;","War ;

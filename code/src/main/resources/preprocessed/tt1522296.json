{"title":"Snowman's Land","plot":"Walter is a professional killer and has messed up a job. He has to leave the city and takes up an offer of crime boss Berger to protect Berger's house in a remote region of the Carpathian Mountains. At his side: old friend Mickey. By accident Berger's young wife Sybille is killed and Walter and Mickey hide her body because they fear Berger's vengeance. What seemed to be a nice holiday trip with little work for Walter and Mickey soon becomes a fight for survival for all parties involved.","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["Walter","is","a","profession","killer","and","has","mess","up","a","job",".","He","has","to","leav","the","citi","and","take","up","an","offer","of","crime","boss","Berger","to","protect","Berger","'s","hous","in","a","remot","region","of","the","Carpathian","Mountain",".","At","his","side",":","old","friend","Mickey",".","By","accid","Berger","'s","young","wife","Sybill","is","kill","and","Walter","and","Mickey","hide","her","bodi","becaus","they","fear","Berger","'s","vengeanc",".","What","seem","to","be","a","nice","holiday","trip","with","littl","work","for","Walter","and","Mickey","soon","becom","a","fight","for","surviv","for","all","parti","involv","."],"lemmas":["Walter","be","a","professional","killer","and","have","mess","up","a","job",".","he","have","to","leave","the","city","and","take","up","a","offer","of","crime","boss","Berger","to","protect","Berger","'s","house","in","a","remote","region","of","the","carpathian","mountain",".","at","he","side",":","old","friend","Mickey",".","by","accident","Berger","'s","young","wife","Sybille","be","kill","and","Walter","and","Mickey","hide","she","body","because","they","fear","Berger","'s","vengeance",".","what","seem","to","be","a","nice","holiday","trip","with","little","work","for","Walter","and","Mickey","soon","become","a","fight","for","survival","for","all","party","involve","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Walter is a","is a professional","a professional killer","professional killer and","killer and has","and has messed","has messed up","messed up a","up a job","He has to","has to leave","to leave the","leave the city","the city and","city and takes","and takes up","takes up an","up an offer","an offer of","offer of crime","of crime boss","crime boss Berger","boss Berger to","Berger to protect","to protect Berger","protect Berger 's","Berger 's house","'s house in","house in a","in a remote","a remote region","remote region of","region of the","of the Carpathian","the Carpathian Mountains","At his side","his side :","side : old",": old friend","old friend Mickey","By accident Berger","accident Berger 's","Berger 's young","'s young wife","young wife Sybille","wife Sybille is","Sybille is killed","is killed and","killed and Walter","and Walter and","Walter and Mickey","and Mickey hide","Mickey hide her","hide her body","her body because","body because they","because they fear","they fear Berger","fear Berger 's","Berger 's vengeance","What seemed to","seemed to be","to be a","be a nice","a nice holiday","nice holiday trip","holiday trip with","trip with little","with little work","little work for","work for Walter","for Walter and","Walter and Mickey","and Mickey soon","Mickey soon becomes","soon becomes a","becomes a fight","a fight for","fight for survival","for survival for","survival for all","for all parties","all parties involved"],"2grams":["Walter is","is a","a professional","professional killer","killer and","and has","has messed","messed up","up a","a job","He has","has to","to leave","leave the","the city","city and","and takes","takes up","up an","an offer","offer of","of crime","crime boss","boss Berger","Berger to","to protect","protect Berger","Berger 's","'s house","house in","in a","a remote","remote region","region of","of the","the Carpathian","Carpathian Mountains","At his","his side","side :",": old","old friend","friend Mickey","By accident","accident Berger","Berger 's","'s young","young wife","wife Sybille","Sybille is","is killed","killed and","and Walter","Walter and","and Mickey","Mickey hide","hide her","her body","body because","because they","they fear","fear Berger","Berger 's","'s vengeance","What seemed","seemed to","to be","be a","a nice","nice holiday","holiday trip","trip with","with little","little work","work for","for Walter","Walter and","and Mickey","Mickey soon","soon becomes","becomes a","a fight","fight for","for survival","survival for","for all","all parties","parties involved"]}

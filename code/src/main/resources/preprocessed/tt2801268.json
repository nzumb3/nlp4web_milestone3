{"title":"Mañana podría estar muerto","plot":"\"Tomorrow I Could Be Dead\" recalls the story of a group of reckless Spanish stuntmen active during the second half of last century. Their vibrating careers firstly introduced them to roman peplum and big budget historical films - Alexander the Great, Spartacus, Ursus, King of Kings, 55 Days in Peking- later on to spaghetti westerns - the Leone Dollar-Trilogy, Django, Keoma - and finally to big international productions during the 70's and 80's such as Conan the Barbarian, The Wind and the Lion, Breakout or Indiana Jones and the last crusade. These men, half brave, half crazy have become part of history of cinema and, thanks to their adventurous condition reveal themselves as extremely interesting characters whose stories still await to be told. Thanks to their commitment, Spanish stuntmen still are sought after for their extraordinary skills on horseback.","genres":["Action"," Documentary"," Adventure"],"stems":["\"","Tomorrow","I","Could","Be","Dead","\"","recal","the","stori","of","a","group","of","reckless","Spanish","stuntmen","activ","dure","the","second","half","of","last","centuri",".","Their","vibrat","career","first","introduc","them","to","roman","peplum","and","big","budget","histor","film","-","Alexand","the","Great",",","Spartacus",",","Ursus",",","King","of","King",",","55","Day","in","Peke","-","later","on","to","spaghetti","western","-","the","Leon","Dollar-Trilog",",","Django",",","Keoma","-","and","final","to","big","intern","product","dure","the","70","'s","and","80","'s","such","as","Conan","the","Barbarian",",","The","Wind","and","the","Lion",",","Breakout","or","Indiana","Jone","and","the","last","crusad",".","These","men",",","half","brave",",","half","crazi","have","becom","part","of","histori","of","cinema","and",",","thank","to","their","adventur","condit","reveal","themselv","as","extrem","interest","charact","whose","stori","still","await","to","be","told",".","Thank","to","their","commit",",","Spanish","stuntmen","still","are","sought","after","for","their","extraordinari","skill","on","horseback","."],"lemmas":["``","tomorrow","I","could","be","dead","''","recall","the","story","of","a","group","of","reckless","spanish","stuntman","active","during","the","second","half","of","last","century",".","they","vibrate","career","firstly","introduce","they","to","roman","peplum","and","big","budget","historical","film","-","Alexander","the","Great",",","Spartacus",",","Ursus",",","King","of","Kings",",","55","day","in","Peking","-","later","on","to","spaghetti","western","-","the","Leone","Dollar-Trilogy",",","Django",",","Keoma","-","and","finally","to","big","international","production","during","the","70","'s","and","80","'s","such","as","Conan","the","Barbarian",",","the","wind","and","the","Lion",",","Breakout","or","Indiana","Jones","and","the","last","crusade",".","these","man",",","half","brave",",","half","crazy","have","become","part","of","history","of","cinema","and",",","thanks","to","they","adventurous","condition","reveal","themselves","as","extremely","interesting","character","whose","story","still","await","to","be","tell",".","thanks","to","they","commitment",",","spanish","stuntman","still","be","seek","after","for","they","extraordinary","skill","on","horseback","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["\" Tomorrow I","Tomorrow I Could","I Could Be","Could Be Dead","Be Dead \"","Dead \" recalls","\" recalls the","recalls the story","the story of","story of a","of a group","a group of","group of reckless","of reckless Spanish","reckless Spanish stuntmen","Spanish stuntmen active","stuntmen active during","active during the","during the second","the second half","second half of","half of last","of last century","Their vibrating careers","vibrating careers firstly","careers firstly introduced","firstly introduced them","introduced them to","them to roman","to roman peplum","roman peplum and","peplum and big","and big budget","big budget historical","budget historical films","historical films -","films -

When his junior colleague, a fundamentalist named Stephen, clashes with a prostitute who preys on Catholic priests, Anthony finds his private world invaded and his deepest secrets exposed by a modern day Mary Magdalene.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Hidden","away","in","small","town","America",",","in","an","anem","parish","on","the","brink","of","bankruptci",",","Father","Anthoni","Romano","find","himself","at","a","mid-car","crisi","in","the","wake","of","both","his","person","conflict","and","the","real","world","scandal","that","have","left","the","Cathol","Church","an","anathema","to","so","mani",".","When","his","junior","colleagu",",","a","fundamentalist","name","Stephen",",","clash","with","a","prostitut","who","prey","on","Cathol","priest",",","Anthoni","find","his","privat","world","invad","and","his","deepest","secret","expos","by","a","modern","day","Mari","Magdalen","."],"lemmas":["hide","away","in","small","town","America",",","in","a","anemic","parish","on","the","brink","of","bankruptcy",",","Father","Anthony","Romano","find","himself","at","a","mid-career","crisis","in","the","wake","of","both","he","personal","conflict","and","the","real","world","scandal","that","have","leave","the","Catholic","Church","a","anathema","to","so","many",".","when","he","junior","colleague",",","a","fundamentalist","name","Stephen",",","clash","with","a","prostitute","who","prey","on","Catholic","priest",",","Anthony","find","he","private","world","invade","and","he","deepest","secret","expose","by","a","modern","day","Mary","Magdalene","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hidden away in","away in small","in small town","small town America","town America ,","America , in",", in an","in an anemic","an anemic parish","anemic parish on","parish on the","on the brink","the brink of","brink of bankruptcy","of bankruptcy ,","bankruptcy , Father",", Father Anthony","Father Anthony Romano","Anthony Romano finds","Romano finds himself","finds himself at","himself at a","at a mid-career","a mid-career crisis","mid-career crisis in","crisis in the","in the wake","the wake of","wake of both","of both his","both his personal","his personal conflicts","personal conflicts and","conflicts and the","and the real","the real world","real world scandals","world scandals that","scandals that have","that have left","have left the","left the Catholic","the Catholic Church","Catholic Church an","Church an anathema","an anathema to","anathema to so","to so many","When his junior","his junior colleague","junior colleague ,","colleague , a",", a fundamentalist","a fundamentalist named","fundamentalist named Stephen","named Stephen ,","Stephen , clashes",", clashes with","clashes with a","with a prostitute","a prostitute who","prostitute who preys","who preys on","preys on Catholic","on Catholic priests","Catholic priests ,","priests , Anthony",", Anthony finds","Anthony finds his","finds his private","his private world","private world invaded","world invaded and","invaded and his","and his deepest","his deepest secrets","deepest secrets exposed","secrets exposed by","exposed by a","by a modern","a modern day","modern day Mary","day Mary Magdalene"],"2grams":["Hidden away","away in","in small","small town","town America","America ,",", in","in an","an anemic","anemic parish","parish on","on the","the brink","brink of","of bankruptcy","bankruptcy ,",", Father","Father Anthony","Anthony Romano","Romano finds","finds himself","himself at","at a","a mid-career","mid-career crisis","crisis in","in the","the wake","wake of","of both","both his","his personal","personal conflicts","conflicts and","and the","the real","real world","world scandals","scandals that","that have","have left","left the","the Catholic","Catholic Church","Church an","an anathema","anathema to","to so","so many","When his","his junior","junior colleague","colleague ,",", a","a fundamentalist","fundamentalist named","named Stephen","Stephen ,",", clashes","clashes with","with a","a prostitute","prostitute who","who preys","preys on","on Catholic","Catholic priests","priests ,",", Anthony","Anthony finds","finds his","his private","private world","world invaded","invaded and","and his","his deepest","deepest secrets","secrets exposed","exposed by","by a","a modern","modern day","day Mary","Mary Magdalene"]}

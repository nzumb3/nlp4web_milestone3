{"title":"Home for the Weekend","plot":"Marko is in his mid-thirties, has just published his first book, and has been living in Berlin since his university days - far enough away from his parents Gitte and Günter whose bourgeois lifestyle he could never quite get used to. He visits them once or twice a year, mainly to give them a chance to spend a few days with their grandson. His hopes of spending a quiet weekend with the family fall short when Gitte, who has been mentally unstable since Marko was a child, feels so healthy after a homeopathic treatment that she stops taking her medication. Her announcement triggers reserved reactions in the family, and a series of revelations tip his family's structure out of balance.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Marko","is","in","his","mid-thirti",",","has","just","publish","his","first","book",",","and","has","been","live","in","Berlin","sinc","his","univers","day","-","far","enough","away","from","his","parent","Gitt","and","Günter","whose","bourgeoi","lifestyl","he","could","never","quit","get","use","to",".","He","visit","them","onc","or","twice","a","year",",","main","to","give","them","a","chanc","to","spend","a","few","day","with","their","grandson",".","His","hope","of","spend","a","quiet","weekend","with","the","famili","fall","short","when","Gitt",",","who","has","been","mental","unstabl","sinc","Marko","was","a","child",",","feel","so","healthi","after","a","homeopath","treatment","that","she","stop","take","her","medic",".","Her","announc","trigger","reserv","reaction","in","the","famili",",","and","a","seri","of","revel","tip","his","famili","'s","structur","out","of","balanc","."],"lemmas":["Marko","be","in","he","mid-thirty",",","have","just","publish","he","first","book",",","and","have","be","live","in","Berlin","since","he","university","day","-","far","enough","away","from","he","parent","Gitte","and","Günter","whose","bourgeois","lifestyle","he","could","never","quite","get","use","to",".","he","visit","they","once","or","twice","a","year",",","mainly","to","give","they","a","chance","to","spend","a","few","day","with","they","grandson",".","he","hope","of","spend","a","quiet","weekend","with","the","family","fall","short","when","Gitte",",","who","have","be","mentally","unstable","since","Marko","be","a","child",",","feel","so","healthy","after","a","homeopathic","treatment","that","she","stop","take","she","medication",".","she","announcement","trigger","reserved","reaction","in","the","family",",","and","a","series","of","revelation","tip","he","family","'s","structure","out","of","balance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Marko is in","is in his","in his mid-thirties","his mid-thirties ,","mid-thirties , has",", has just","has just published","just published his","published his first","his first book","first book ,","book , and",", and has","and has been","has been living","been living in","living in Berlin","in Berlin since","Berlin since his","since his university","his university days","university days -","days -

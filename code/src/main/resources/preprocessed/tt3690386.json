{"title":"A Summer Hamlet","plot":"A Summer Hamlet follows the company and their director, Dominic Dromgoole (Artistic Director of Shakespeare's Globe) as they tour the production from opening night at the Theatre Royal, Margate to their final performance at Hamlet's own home of Elsinore Castle, Denmark. Remaining backstage with the cast for every performance, this first feature by director Helen Lawson offers a rare insight behind the scenes of the production. We glimpse into rehearsal room mayhem, pre-show high jinks and backstage nerves as the team battle with the elements and a temperamental Ford Escort. Revealing the creativity, laughter and unfolding friendships that develop throughout the tour, A Summer Hamlet offers a hilarious insight into acting, touring and the highs and lows of life on the road.","genres":["Comedy","

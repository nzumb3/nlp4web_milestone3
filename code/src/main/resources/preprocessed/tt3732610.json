{"title":"Hoodfella All In","plot":"P is locked up with his 2 homeboys for multiple years, once they all get out after at least putting in 10 years, they get into the free world only to find out it's not that easy to make it on the straight path especially with murder on your record. So P, thought his brothers, Carlito and Tony are trying to help, he's never been one for handouts and so talks to his old prison, homey to get them linked into the cartels. So they meet Rico, the coldest bloodest guy to walk the earth and hell. He takes them in under his wing and gets them to start with dope and people, but a setup makes P realize that almost being killed over little money's not worth it so is put on for something more worthwhile, murder for hire. In a web of trickery and deceit, P has to find a way to keep his family out of the mix, while still trying to find out who his real friends and enemies are. In this world, you keep your friends close and enemies only closer if they're dead, and P sure doesn't wanna make the wrong move or him and his fam may well be...","genres":["Action"],"stems":["P","is","lock","up","with","his","2","homeboy","for","multipl","year",",","onc","they","all","get","out","after","at","least","put","in","10","year",",","they","get","into","the","free","world","onli","to","find","out","it","'s","not","that","easi","to","make","it","on","the","straight","path","especi","with","murder","on","your","record",".","So","P",",","thought","his","brother",",","Carlito","and","Toni","are","tri","to","help",",","he","'s","never","been","one","for","handout","and","so","talk","to","his","old","prison",",","homey","to","get","them","link","into","the","cartel",".","So","they","meet","Rico",",","the","coldest","bloodest","guy","to","walk","the","earth","and","hell",".","He","take","them","in","under","his","wing","and","get","them","to","start","with","dope","and","peopl",",","but","a","setup","make","P","realiz","that","almost","be","kill","over","littl","money","'s","not","worth","it","so","is","put","on","for","someth","more","worthwhil",",","murder","for","hire",".","In","a","web","of","trickeri","and","deceit",",","P","has","to","find","a","way","to","keep","his","famili","out","of","the","mix",",","while","still","tri","to","find","out","who","his","real","friend","and","enemi","are",".","In","this","world",",","you","keep","your","friend","close","and","enemi","onli","closer","if","they","re","dead",",","and","P","sure","doe","n't","wan","na","make","the","wrong","move","or","him","and","his","fam","may","well","be","..."],"lemmas":["p","be","lock","up","with","he","2","homeboy","for","multiple","year",",","once","they","all","get","out","after","at","least","put","in","10","year",",","they","get","into","the","free","world","only","to","find","out","it","be","not","that","easy","to","make","it","on","the","straight","path","especially","with","murder","on","you","record",".","so","p",",","think","he","brother",",","Carlito","and","Tony","be","try","to","help",",","he","be","never","be","one","for","handout","and","so","talk","to","he","old","prison",",","homey","to","get","they","link","into","the","cartel",".","so","they","meet","Rico",",","the","coldest","bloodest","guy","to","walk","the","earth","and","hell",".","he","take","they","in","under","he","wing","and","get","they","to","start","with","dope","and","people",",","but","a","setup","make","p","realize","that","almost","be","kill","over","little","money","be","not","worth","it","so","be","put","on","for","something","more","worthwhile",",","murder","for","hire",".","in","a","web","of","trickery","and","deceit",",","p","have","to","find","a","way","to","keep","he","family","out","of","the","mix",",","while","still","try","to","find","out","who","he","real","friend","and","enemy","be",".","in","this","world",",","you","keep","you","friend","close","and","enemy","only","closer","if","they","be","dead",",","and","p","sure","do","not","wan","na","make","the","wrong","move","or","he","and","he","fam","may","well","be","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["P

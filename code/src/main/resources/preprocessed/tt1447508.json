{"title":"Peepli (Live)","plot":"In the lead up to state elections in the Indian village of Peepli, two poor farmers, Natha and Budhia, face losing their land over an unpaid bank loan. Desperate, they seek help from an apathetic local politician, who scornfully suggests they commit suicide to benefit from a government program that aids the families of indebted deceased farmers. When a journalist overhears Budhia urge Natha to \"do what needs to be done\" for the sake of their families, a media frenzy ignites around whether or not Natha will commit suicide.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","lead","up","to","state","elect","in","the","Indian","villag","of","Peepli",",","two","poor","farmer",",","Natha","and","Budhia",",","face","lose","their","land","over","an","unpaid","bank","loan",".","Desper",",","they","seek","help","from","an","apathet","local","politician",",","who","scorn","suggest","they","commit","suicid","to","benefit","from","a","govern","program","that","aid","the","famili","of","indebt","deceas","farmer",".","When","a","journalist","overhear","Budhia","urg","Natha","to","\"","do","what","need","to","be","done","\"","for","the","sake","of","their","famili",",","a","media","frenzi","ignit","around","whether","or","not","Natha","will","commit","suicid","."],"lemmas":["in","the","lead","up","to","state","election","in","the","indian","village","of","Peepli",",","two","poor","farmer",",","Natha","and","Budhia",",","face","lose","they","land","over","a","unpaid","bank","loan",".","desperate",",","they","seek","help","from","a","apathetic","local","politician",",","who","scornfully","suggest","they","commit","suicide","to","benefit","from","a","government","program","that","aid","the","family","of","indebted","deceased","farmer",".","when","a","journalist","overhear","Budhia","urge","natha","to","``","do","what","need","to","be","do","''","for","the","sake","of","they","family",",","a","media","frenzy","ignite","around","whether","or","not","Natha","will","commit","suicide","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the lead","the lead up","lead up to","up to state","to state elections","state elections in","elections in the","in the Indian","the Indian village","Indian village of","village of Peepli","of Peepli ,","Peepli , two",", two poor","two poor farmers","poor farmers ,","farmers , Natha",", Natha and","Natha and Budhia","and Budhia ,","Budhia , face",", face losing","face losing their","losing their land","their land over","land over an","over an unpaid","an unpaid bank","unpaid bank loan","Desperate , they",", they seek","they seek help","seek help from","help from an","from an apathetic","an apathetic local","apathetic local politician","local politician ,","politician , who",", who scornfully","who scornfully suggests","scornfully suggests they","suggests they commit","they commit suicide","commit suicide to","suicide to benefit","to benefit from","benefit from a","from a government","a government program","government program that","program that aids","that aids the","aids the families","the families of","families of indebted","of indebted deceased","indebted deceased farmers","When a journalist","a journalist overhears","journalist overhears Budhia","overhears Budhia urge","Budhia urge Natha","urge Natha to","Natha to \"","to \" do","\" do what","do what needs","what needs to","needs to be","to be done","be done \"","done \" for","\" for the","for the sake","the sake of","sake of their","of their families","their families ,","families , a",", a media","a media frenzy","media frenzy ignites","frenzy ignites around","ignites around whether","around whether or","whether or not","or not Natha","not Natha will","Natha will commit","will commit suicide"],"2grams":["In the","the lead","lead up","up to","to state","state elections","elections in","in the","the Indian","Indian village","village of","of Peepli","Peepli ,",", two","two poor","poor farmers","farmers ,",", Natha","Natha and","and Budhia","Budhia ,",", face","face losing","losing their","their land","land over","over an","an unpaid","unpaid bank","bank loan","Desperate ,",", they","they seek","seek help","help from","from an","an apathetic","apathetic local","local politician","politician ,",", who","who scornfully","scornfully suggests","suggests they","they commit","commit suicide","suicide to","to benefit","benefit from","from a","a government","government program","program that","that aids","aids the","the families","families of","of indebted","indebted deceased","deceased farmers","When a","a journalist","journalist overhears","overhears Budhia","Budhia urge","urge Natha","Natha to","to \"","\" do","do what","what needs","needs to","to be","be done","done \"","\" for","for the","the sake","sake of","of their","their families","families ,",", a","a media","media frenzy","frenzy ignites","ignites around","around whether","whether or","or not","not Natha","Natha will","will commit","commit suicide"]}

{"title":"Two Weeks","plot":"A positive depiction of a young African-American fathers relationship with his family specifically, his young daughter during stressful economic times. The film is meant to showcase some of the extra efforts that are necessary for a young family to survive in 2009s economic atmosphere; both financially and personally with each other. This film is also meant to demonstrate that during this current state of economic despair, it is even more critical that families find ways to escape and get out and enjoy each others company even if its something as simple as driving to the neighborhood diner for breakfast, or turning off the television and opening up a book.","genres":["Family"],"stems":["A","posit","depict","of","a","young","African-American","father","relationship","with","his","famili","specif",",","his","young","daughter","dure","stress","econom","time",".","The","film","is","meant","to","showcas","some","of","the","extra","effort","that","are","necessari","for","a","young","famili","to","surviv","in","2009s","econom","atmospher",";","both","financi","and","person","with","each","other",".","This","film","is","also","meant","to","demonstr","that","dure","this","current","state","of","econom","despair",",","it","is","even","more","critic","that","famili","find","way","to","escap","and","get","out","and","enjoy","each","other","compani","even","if","it","someth","as","simpl","as","drive","to","the","neighborhood","diner","for","breakfast",",","or","turn","off","the","televis","and","open","up","a","book","."],"lemmas":["a","positive","depiction","of","a","young","african-american","father","relationship","with","he","family","specifically",",","he","young","daughter","during","stressful","economic","time",".","the","film","be","mean","to","showcase","some","of","the","extra","effort","that","be","necessary","for","a","young","family","to","survive","in","2009s","economic","atmosphere",";","both","financially","and","personally","with","each","other",".","this","film","be","also","mean","to","demonstrate","that","during","this","current","state","of","economic","despair",",","it","be","even","more","critical","that","family","find","way","to","escape","and","get","out","and","enjoy","each","other","company","even","if","its","something","as","simple","as","drive","to","the","neighborhood","diner","for","breakfast",",","or","turn","off","the","television","and","open","up","a","book","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A positive depiction","positive depiction of","depiction of a","of a young","a young African-American","young African-American fathers","African-American fathers relationship","fathers relationship with","relationship with his","with his family","his family specifically","family specifically ,","specifically , his",", his young","his young daughter","young daughter during","daughter during stressful","during stressful economic","stressful economic times","The film is","film is meant","is meant to","meant to showcase","to showcase some","showcase some of","some of the","of the extra","the extra efforts","extra efforts that","efforts that are","that are necessary","are necessary for","necessary for a","for a young","a young family","young family to","family to survive","to survive in","survive in 2009s","in 2009s economic","2009s economic atmosphere","economic atmosphere ;","atmosphere ;

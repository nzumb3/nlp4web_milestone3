{"title":"Tik & the Turkey","plot":"The townships in the suburbs of Cape Town, SA are blighted by the highly addictive, heroin-based 'unga,' which is mixed with cleaning detergents; and Crystal Meth known locally as 'tik' which are slowly crippling the population. Lainey Richardson's debut documentary follows 27 year old, party girl addict Analese, and her 25 year old childhood friend Trevino, who is struggling to hold his family together, having lied about his heroin addiction until he was married. Tik and the Turkey is the human face of an abandoned community facing a drug abuse epidemic.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["The","township","in","the","suburb","of","Cape","Town",",","SA","are","blight","by","the","high","addict",",","heroin-bas","'","unga",",","'","which","is","mix","with","clean","deterg",";","and","Crystal","Meth","known","local","as","'","tik","'","which","are","slowli","crippl","the","popul",".","Lainey","Richardson","'s","debut","documentari","follow","27","year","old",",","parti","girl","addict","Anales",",","and","her","25","year","old","childhood","friend","Trevino",",","who","is","struggl","to","hold","his","famili","togeth",",","have","lie","about","his","heroin","addict","until","he","was","marri",".","Tik","and","the","Turkey","is","the","human","face","of","an","abandon","communiti","face","a","drug","abus","epidem","."],"lemmas":["the","township","in","the","suburb","of","Cape","Town",",","SA","be","blighted","by","the","highly","addictive",",","heroin-based","'","unga",",","'","which","be","mix","with","cleaning","detergent",";","and","Crystal","Meth","know","locally","as","'","tik","'","which","be","slowly","crippling","the","population",".","Lainey","Richardson","'s","debut","documentary","follow","27","year","old",",","party","girl","addict","analese",",","and","she","25","year","old","childhood","friend","Trevino",",","who","be","struggle","to","hold","he","family","together",",","have","lie","about","he","heroin","addiction","until","he","be","marry",".","tik","and","the","Turkey","be","the","human","face","of","a","abandoned","community","face","a","drug","abuse","epidemic","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The townships in","townships in the","in the suburbs","the suburbs of","suburbs of Cape","of Cape Town","Cape Town ,","Town , SA",", SA are","SA are blighted","are blighted by","blighted by the","by the highly","the highly addictive","highly addictive ,","addictive , heroin-based",", heroin-based '","heroin-based ' unga","' unga ,","unga , '",", ' which","' which is","which is mixed","is mixed with","mixed with cleaning","with cleaning detergents","cleaning detergents ;","detergents ; and","; and Crystal","and Crystal Meth","Crystal Meth known","Meth known locally","known locally as","locally as '","as ' tik","' tik '","tik ' which","' which are","which are slowly","are slowly crippling","slowly crippling the","crippling the population","Lainey Richardson 's","Richardson 's debut","'s debut documentary","debut documentary follows","documentary follows 27","follows 27 year","27 year old","year old ,","old , party",", party girl","party girl addict","girl addict Analese","addict Analese ,","Analese , and",", and her","and her 25","her 25 year","25 year old","year old childhood","old childhood friend","childhood friend Trevino","friend Trevino ,","Trevino , who",", who is","who is struggling","is struggling to","struggling to hold","to hold his","hold his family","his family together","family together ,","together , having",", having lied","having lied about","lied about his","about his heroin","his heroin addiction","heroin addiction until","addiction until he","until he was","he was married","Tik and the","and the Turkey","the Turkey is","Turkey is the","is the human","the human face","human face of","face of an","of an abandoned","an abandoned community","abandoned community facing","community facing a","facing a drug","a drug abuse","drug abuse epidemic"],"2grams":["The townships","townships in","in the","the suburbs","suburbs of","of Cape","Cape Town","Town ,",", SA","SA are","are blighted","blighted by","by the","the highly","highly addictive","addictive ,",", heroin-based","heroin-based '","' unga","unga ,",", '","' which","which is","is mixed","mixed with","with cleaning","cleaning detergents","detergents ;","; and","and Crystal","Crystal Meth","Meth known","known locally","locally as","as '","' tik","tik '","' which","which are","are slowly","slowly crippling","crippling the","the population","Lainey Richardson","Richardson 's","'s debut","debut documentary","documentary follows","follows 27","27 year","year old","old ,",", party","party girl","girl addict","addict Analese","Analese ,",", and","and her","her 25","25 year","year old","old childhood","childhood friend","friend Trevino","Trevino ,",", who","who is","is struggling","struggling to","to hold","hold his","his family","family together","together ,",", having","having lied","lied about","about his","his heroin","heroin addiction","addiction until","until he","he was","was married","Tik and","and the","the Turkey","Turkey is","is the","the human","human face","face of","of an","an abandoned","abandoned community","community facing","facing a","a drug","drug abuse","abuse epidemic"]}

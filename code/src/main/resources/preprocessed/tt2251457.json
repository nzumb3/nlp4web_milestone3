{"title":"Raga Revelry","plot":"RAGA REVELRY, a feature documentary in English, showcases North Indian classical music colloquially referred to as Raga music. This heritage, preserved by dedicated musicians for thousands of years, promises nothing short of self-transformation. A deep emotional attachment between guru (teacher) and shishya (student) is essential for the oral transfer of knowledge to the next generation. The film documents renowned musicologist Vijay Kichlu's successful endeavor to create a permanent sanctuary for this music in independent India whilst sparking a passion amongst a generation of leading musicians and spreading this joyful sound globally. The philosophical context and the structures of melody (raga) and rhythm (tala) are made accessible and the love, reverence and camaraderie demonstrated between musicians reflect the Rasa, the essence or soul of this music.","genres":["Biography"," Family","

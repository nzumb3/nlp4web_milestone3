{"title":"Movin' In","plot":"A comedy about a young man from Switzerland who travels to Los Angeles to escape his dead-end life and to reconnect with a female pen pal with whom he has lost touch. Everything falls apart when the pen pal turns out to be a complete fraud and he is reunited with an old friend (a real trouble magnet) who keeps pulling him into the most awkward situations. The story takes unexpected turns when the two - somewhere between moving into an old folks home, going to auditions, and dealing with a phony agent and a group of gangsters - fall for the same girl.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["A","comedi","about","a","young","man","from","Switzerland","who","travel","to","Los","Angele","to","escap","his","dead-end","life","and","to","reconnect","with","a","femal","pen","pal","with","whom","he","has","lost","touch",".","Everyth","fall","apart","when","the","pen","pal","turn","out","to","be","a","complet","fraud","and","he","is","reunit","with","an","old","friend","(","a","real","troubl","magnet",")","who","keep","pull","him","into","the","most","awkward","situat",".","The","stori","take","unexpect","turn","when","the","two","-","somewher","between","move","into","an","old","folk","home",",","go","to","audit",",","and","deal","with","a","phoni","agent","and","a","group","of","gangster","-","fall","for","the","same","girl","."],"lemmas":["a","comedy","about","a","young","man","from","Switzerland","who","travel","to","Los","Angeles","to","escape","he","dead-end","life","and","to","reconnect","with","a","female","pen","pal","with","whom","he","have","lose","touch",".","Everything","fall","apart","when","the","pen","pal","turn","out","to","be","a","complete","fraud","and","he","be","reunite","with","a","old","friend","-lrb-","a","real","trouble","magnet","-rrb-","who","keep","pull","he","into","the","most","awkward","situation",".","the","story","take","unexpected","turn","when","the","two","-","somewhere","between","move","into","a","old","folk","home",",","go","to","audition",",","and","deal","with","a","phony","agent","and","a","group","of","gangster","-","fall","for","the","same","girl","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A comedy about","comedy about a","about a young","a young man","young man from","man from Switzerland","from Switzerland who","Switzerland who travels","who travels to","travels to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles to","Angeles to escape","to escape his","escape his dead-end","his dead-end life","dead-end life and","life and to","and to reconnect","to reconnect with","reconnect with a","with a female","a female pen","female pen pal","pen pal with","pal with whom","with whom he","whom he has","he has lost","has lost touch","Everything falls apart","falls apart when","apart when the","when the pen","the pen pal","pen pal turns","pal turns out","turns out to","out to be","to be a","be a complete","a complete fraud","complete fraud and","fraud and he","and he is","he is reunited","is reunited with","reunited with an","with an old","an old friend","old friend (","friend ( a","( a real","a real trouble","real trouble magnet","trouble magnet )","magnet ) who",") who keeps","who keeps pulling","keeps pulling him","pulling him into","him into the","into the most","the most awkward","most awkward situations","The story takes","story takes unexpected","takes unexpected turns","unexpected turns when","turns when the","when the two","the two -","two - somewhere","- somewhere between","somewhere between moving","between moving into","moving into an","into an old","an old folks","old folks home","folks home ,","home , going",", going to","going to auditions","to auditions ,","auditions , and",", and dealing","and dealing with","dealing with a","with a phony","a phony agent","phony agent and","agent and a","and a group","a group of","group of gangsters","of gangsters -","gangsters - fall","- fall for","fall for the","for the same","the same girl"],"2grams":["A comedy","comedy about","about a","a young","young man","man from","from Switzerland","Switzerland who","who travels","travels to","to Los","Los Angeles","Angeles to","to escape","escape his","his dead-end","dead-end life","life and","and to","to reconnect","reconnect with","with a","a female","female pen","pen pal","pal with","with whom","whom he","he has","has lost","lost touch","Everything falls","falls apart","apart when","when the","the pen","pen pal","pal turns","turns out","out to","to be","be a","a complete","complete fraud","fraud and","and he","he is","is reunited","reunited with","with an","an old","old friend","friend (","( a","a real","real trouble","trouble magnet","magnet )",") who","who keeps","keeps pulling","pulling him","him into","into the","the most","most awkward","awkward situations","The story","story takes","takes unexpected","unexpected turns","turns when","when the","the two","two -","- somewhere","somewhere between","between moving","moving into","into an","an old","old folks","folks home","home ,",", going","going to","to auditions","auditions ,",", and","and dealing","dealing with","with a","a phony","phony agent","agent and","and a","a group","group of","of gangsters","gangsters -","- fall","fall for","for the","the same","same girl"]}

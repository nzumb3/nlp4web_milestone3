{"title":"The Crack","plot":"A family embarks on a journey for a weekend at a remote cabin to reconnect and revitalize the family union they lost after a tragic death. But this trip soon becomes a collective hell, where everyone is overpowered by their inner monster. The nephew is in love with his aunt, the mother can not forget her daughter and pretends nothing ever happened, and the ten year old twins are convinced the forest in which the cabin stands is haunted... What was planned as a peaceful weekend goes horribly wrong.","genres":["Drama"," Horror"],"stems":["A","famili","embark","on","a","journey","for","a","weekend","at","a","remot","cabin","to","reconnect","and","revit","the","famili","union","they","lost","after","a","tragic","death",".","But","this","trip","soon","becom","a","collect","hell",",","where","everyon","is","overpow","by","their","inner","monster",".","The","nephew","is","in","love","with","his","aunt",",","the","mother","can","not","forget","her","daughter","and","pretend","noth","ever","happen",",","and","the","ten","year","old","twin","are","convinc","the","forest","in","which","the","cabin","stand","is","haunt","...","What","was","plan","as","a","peac","weekend","goe","horribl","wrong","."],"lemmas":["a","family","embark","on","a","journey","for","a","weekend","at","a","remote","cabin","to","reconnect","and","revitalize","the","family","union","they","lose","after","a","tragic","death",".","but","this","trip","soon","become","a","collective","hell",",","where","everyone","be","overpower","by","they","inner","monster",".","the","nephew","be","in","love","with","he","aunt",",","the","mother","can","not","forget","she","daughter","and","pretend","nothing","ever","happen",",","and","the","ten","year","old","twin","be","convince","the","forest","in","which","the","cabin","stands","be","haunt","...","what","be","plan","as","a","peaceful","weekend","go","horribly","wrong","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A family embarks","family embarks on","embarks on a","on a journey","a journey for","journey for a","for a weekend","a weekend at","weekend at a","at a remote","a remote cabin","remote cabin to","cabin to reconnect","to reconnect and","reconnect and revitalize","and revitalize the","revitalize the family","the family union","family union they","union they lost","they lost after","lost after a","after a tragic","a tragic death","But this trip","this trip soon","trip soon becomes","soon becomes a","becomes a collective","a collective hell","collective hell ,","hell , where",", where everyone","where everyone is","everyone is overpowered","is overpowered by","overpowered by their","by their inner","their inner monster","The nephew is","nephew is in","is in love","in love with","love with his","with his aunt","his aunt ,","aunt , the",", the mother","the mother can","mother can not","can not forget","not forget her","forget her daughter","her daughter and","daughter and pretends","and pretends nothing","pretends nothing ever","nothing ever happened","ever happened ,","happened , and",", and the","and the ten","the ten year","ten year old","year old twins","old twins are","twins are convinced","are convinced the","convinced the forest","the forest in","forest in which","in which the","which the cabin","the cabin stands","cabin stands is","stands is haunted","is haunted ...","haunted ...

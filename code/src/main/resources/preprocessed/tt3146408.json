{"title":"Wavemakers","plot":"Since its triumphant premiere at the Paris Opera in 1928, the Ondes Martenot has generated fascination and inspired legions of musicians. Invented by the musician and educator Maurice Martenot (1898-1980), this rare and fragile electronic instrument has been widely featured in popular and classical music-from the first film soundtracks, to Hollywood classics, science-fiction TV series and the works of Olivier Messiaen,Edith Piaf and the rock band Radiohead. So extraordinarily sensitive is the Martenot that nearly a century after its invention, musicians, artisans and scientists are still trying to unravel its secrets. Integrating verite and never-before-seen archives, this documentary features a soundtrack that contains a rich repertoire of the Martenot's haunting and lyrical sounds. Lend an ear - Wavemakers is a journey into the very heart of the mystery of of music.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sinc","it","triumphant","premier","at","the","Pari","Opera","in","1928",",","the","Ondes","Martenot","has","generat","fascin","and","inspir","legion","of","musician",".","Invent","by","the","musician","and","educ","Mauric","Martenot","(","1898-1980",")",",","this","rare","and","fragil","electron","instrument","has","been","wide","featur","in","popular","and","classic","music-from","the","first","film","soundtrack",",","to","Hollywood","classic",",","science-fict","TV","seri","and","the","work","of","Olivier","Messiaen",",","Edith","Piaf","and","the","rock","band","Radiohead",".","So","extraordinarili","sensit","is","the","Martenot","that","near","a","centuri","after","it","invent",",","musician",",","artisan","and","scientist","are","still","tri","to","unravel","it","secret",".","Integrat","verit","and","never-before-seen","archiv",",","this","documentari","featur","a","soundtrack","that","contain","a","rich","repertoir","of","the","Martenot","'s","haunt","and","lyric","sound",".","Lend","an","ear","-","Wavemak","is","a","journey","into","the","veri","heart","of","the","mysteri","of","of","music","."],"lemmas":["since","its","triumphant","premiere","at","the","Paris","Opera","in","1928",",","the","Ondes","Martenot","have","generate","fascination","and","inspired","legion","of","musician",".","invent","by","the","musician","and","educator","Maurice","Martenot","-lrb-","1898-1980","-rrb-",",","this","rare","and","fragile","electronic","instrument","have","be","widely","feature","in","popular","and","classical","music-from","the","first","film","soundtrack",",","to","Hollywood","classic",",","science-fiction","tv","series","and","the","work","of","Olivier","Messiaen",",","Edith","Piaf","and","the","rock","band","radiohead",".","so","extraordinarily","sensitive","be","the","Martenot","that","nearly","a","century","after","its","invention",",","musician",",","artisan","and","scientist","be","still","try","to","unravel","its","secret",".","integrate","verite","and","never-before-seen","archive",",","this","documentary","feature","a","soundtrack","that","contain","a","rich","repertoire","of","the","Martenot","'s","haunting","and","lyrical","sound",".","lend","a","ear","-","wavemaker","be","a","journey","into","the","very","heart","of","the","mystery","of","of","music","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Since

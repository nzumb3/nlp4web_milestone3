{"title":"Plan C","plot":"Ronald Plasmeyer (Ruben Van Der Meer) is a small-time Amsterdam detective, struggling with financial problems because of his gambling habit. When the Chinese crime boss Hao threatens Ronald's ex-wife and son to get his money back, Ronald comes up with a plan that will solve all his problems. Ronald enlists two petty criminals (Ton Kas and René Van 't Hof) to rob an illegal poker tournament he's taking part in, providing him with a perfect alibi. Quick, simple and non-violent; the plan is foolproof... until people start getting killed. Soon, Ronald's partners take off with the money, leaving him empty handed. To make matters worse Ronald's colleagues in the police force begin to suspect him of the robbery, setting the stage for a nerve-racking game of cat and mouse. Ronald is all-in... holding the worst hand of his life.","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["Ronald","Plasmey","(","Ruben","Van","Der","Meer",")","is","a","small-tim","Amsterdam","detect",",","struggl","with","financi","problem","becaus","of","his","gambl","habit",".","When","the","Chines","crime","boss","Hao","threaten","Ronald","'s","ex-wif","and","son","to","get","his","money","back",",","Ronald","come","up","with","a","plan","that","will","solv","all","his","problem",".","Ronald","enlist","two","petti","crimin","(","Ton","Kas","and","René","Van","'","t","Hof",")","to","rob","an","illeg","poker","tournament","he","'s","take","part","in",",","provid","him","with","a","perfect","alibi",".","Quick",",","simpl","and","non-viol",";","the","plan","is","foolproof","...","until","peopl","start","get","kill",".","Soon",",","Ronald","'s","partner","take","off","with","the","money",",","leav","him","empti","hand",".","To","make","matter","wors","Ronald","'s","colleagu","in","the","polic","forc","begin","to","suspect","him","of","the","robberi",",","set","the","stage","for","a","nerve-rack","game","of","cat","and","mous",".","Ronald","is","all-in","...","hold","the","worst","hand","of","his","life","."],"lemmas":["Ronald","Plasmeyer","-lrb-","Ruben","Van","Der","Meer","-rrb-","be","a","small-time","Amsterdam","detective",",","struggle","with","financial","problem","because","of","he","gambling","habit",".","when","the","chinese","crime","boss","hao","threaten","Ronald","'s","ex-wife","and","son","to","get","he","money","back",",","Ronald","come","up","with","a","plan","that","will","solve","all","he","problem",".","Ronald","enlist","two","petty","criminal","-lrb-","Ton","Kas","and","René","Van","'","t","hof","-rrb-","to","rob","a","illegal","poker","tournament","he","be","take","part","in",",","provide","he","with","a","perfect","alibi",".","quick",",","simple","and","non-violent",";","the","plan","be","foolproof","...","until","people","start","get","kill",".","soon",",","Ronald","'s","partner","take","off","with","the","money",",","leave","he","empty","handed",".","to","make","matter","worse","Ronald","'s","colleague","in","the","police","force","begin","to","suspect","he","of","the","robbery",",","set","the","stage","for","a","nerve-racking","game","of","cat","and","mouse",".","Ronald","be","all-in","...","hold","the","worst","hand","of","he","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ronald Plasmeyer (","Plasmeyer ( Ruben","( Ruben Van","Ruben Van Der","Van Der Meer","Der Meer )","Meer ) is",") is a","is a small-time","a small-time Amsterdam","small-time Amsterdam detective","Amsterdam detective ,","detective , struggling",", struggling with","struggling with financial","with financial problems","financial problems because","problems because of","because of his","of his gambling","his gambling habit","When the Chinese","the Chinese crime","Chinese crime boss","crime boss Hao","boss Hao threatens","Hao threatens Ronald","threatens Ronald 's","Ronald 's ex-wife","'s ex-wife and","ex-wife and son","and son to","son to get","to get his","get his money","his money back","money back ,","back , Ronald",", Ronald comes","Ronald comes up","comes up with","up with a","with a plan","a plan that","plan that will","that will solve","will solve all","solve all his","all his problems","Ronald enlists two","enlists two petty","two petty criminals","petty criminals (","criminals ( Ton","( Ton Kas","Ton Kas and","Kas and René","and René Van","René Van '","Van ' t","' t Hof","t Hof )","Hof ) to",") to rob","to rob an","rob an illegal","an illegal poker","illegal poker tournament","poker tournament he","tournament he 's","he 's taking","'s taking part","taking part in","part in ,","in , providing",", providing him","providing him with","him with a","with a perfect","a perfect alibi","Quick , simple",", simple and","simple and non-violent","and non-violent ;","non-violent ;

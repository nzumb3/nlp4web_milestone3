{"title":"The Twilight Samurai","plot":"Seibei Iguchi, a low-ranking samurai, leads a life without glory as a bureaucrat in the mid-XIX century Japan. A widower, he has charge of two daughters (whom he adores) and a senile mother; he must therefore work in the fields and accept piecework to make ends meet. New prospects seem to open up when Tomoe, his long-time love, divorces a brutal husband. However, even as the Japanese feudal system is unraveling, Seibei remains bound by the code of honour of the samurai and by his own sense of social precedences. The consequences are cruel.","genres":["Drama"," History"],"stems":["Seibei","Iguchi",",","a","low-rank","samurai",",","lead","a","life","without","glori","as","a","bureaucrat","in","the","mid-XIX","centuri","Japan",".","A","widow",",","he","has","charg","of","two","daughter","(","whom","he","ador",")","and","a","senil","mother",";","he","must","therefor","work","in","the","field","and","accept","piecework","to","make","end","meet",".","New","prospect","seem","to","open","up","when","Tomo",",","his","long-tim","love",",","divorc","a","brutal","husband",".","Howev",",","even","as","the","Japanes","feudal","system","is","unravel",",","Seibei","remain","bound","by","the","code","of","honour","of","the","samurai","and","by","his","own","sens","of","social","preced",".","The","consequ","are","cruel","."],"lemmas":["Seibei","Iguchi",",","a","low-ranking","samurai",",","lead","a","life","without","glory","as","a","bureaucrat","in","the","mid-xix","century","Japan",".","a","widower",",","he","have","charge","of","two","daughter","-lrb-","whom","he","adore","-rrb-","and","a","senile","mother",";","he","must","therefore","work","in","the","field","and","accept","piecework","to","make","end","meet",".","new","prospects","seem","to","open","up","when","Tomoe",",","he","long-time","love",",","divorce","a","brutal","husband",".","however",",","even","as","the","japanese","feudal","system","be","unraveling",",","Seibei","remain","bind","by","the","code","of","honour","of","the","samurai","and","by","he","own","sense","of","social","precedence",".","the","consequence","be","cruel","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Seibei Iguchi ,","Iguchi , a",", a low-ranking","a low-ranking samurai","low-ranking samurai ,","samurai , leads",", leads a","leads a life","a life without","life without glory","without glory as","glory as a","as a bureaucrat","a bureaucrat in","bureaucrat in the","in the mid-XIX","the mid-XIX century","mid-XIX century Japan","A widower ,","widower , he",", he has","he has charge","has charge of","charge of two","of two daughters","two daughters (","daughters ( whom","( whom he","whom he adores","he adores )","adores ) and",") and a","and a senile","a senile mother","senile mother ;","mother ; he","; he must","he must therefore","must therefore work","therefore work in","work in the","in the fields","the fields and","fields and accept","and accept piecework","accept piecework to","piecework to make","to make ends","make ends meet","New prospects seem","prospects seem to","seem to open","to open up","open up when","up when Tomoe","when Tomoe ,","Tomoe , his",", his long-time","his long-time love","long-time love ,","love , divorces",", divorces a","divorces a brutal","a brutal husband","However , even",", even as","even as the","as the Japanese","the Japanese feudal","Japanese feudal system","feudal system is","system is unraveling","is unraveling ,","unraveling , Seibei",", Seibei remains","Seibei remains bound","remains bound by","bound by the","by the code","the code of","code of honour","of honour of","honour of the","of the samurai","the samurai and","samurai and by","and by his","by his own","his own sense","own sense of","sense of social","of social precedences","The consequences are","consequences are cruel"],"2grams":["Seibei Iguchi","Iguchi ,",", a","a low-ranking","low-ranking samurai","samurai ,",", leads","leads a","a life","life without","without glory","glory as","as a","a bureaucrat","bureaucrat in","in the","the mid-XIX","mid-XIX century","century Japan","A widower","widower ,",", he","he has","has charge","charge of","of two","two daughters","daughters (","( whom","whom he","he adores","adores )",") and","and a","a senile","senile mother","mother ;","; he","he must","must therefore","therefore work","work in","in the","the fields","fields and","and accept","accept piecework","piecework to","to make","make ends","ends meet","New prospects","prospects seem","seem to","to open","open up","up when","when Tomoe","Tomoe ,",", his","his long-time","long-time love","love ,",", divorces","divorces a","a brutal","brutal husband","However ,",", even","even as","as the","the Japanese","Japanese feudal","feudal system","system is","is unraveling","unraveling ,",", Seibei","Seibei remains","remains bound","bound by","by the","the code","code of","of honour","honour of","of the","the samurai","samurai and","and by","by his","his own","own sense","sense of","of social","social precedences","The consequences","consequences are","are cruel"]}

{"title":"Angels","plot":"\"Angels\" is a trilogy. The three episodes featured in the movies are: \"Angel of Mine\", \"Daddy's Angel\" and \"Angel of Love\". \"Angel of Mine,\" directed by Gina Alajar, features a career woman forced to tend to a child left by this problematic mother. \"Daddy's Angel\" follows the bitter father-and-son relationship between a (dying) ex-convict and this affectionate young boy who bore miserable stigmas of a brutal past. A young man is imprisoned for killing a close friend, who raped his wife on his wedding day. While in prison, his wife gets pregnant, giving birth to this angelic boy. The wife dies before his sentence is due. In \"Angel of Love\", Bianang, a frustrated musician, is caught in a tangle of family concerns. Orphaned by their mother and abandoned by their father, she is left to look after her two younger siblings and fend for their needs by finding her niche in the music industry. By some twist of fate, guised through Kerubina, her path crosses with Jude, a guy from a matriarchal clan of aristocrats who battles with repercussions of ending a heavily laden relationship.","genres":["Comedy","

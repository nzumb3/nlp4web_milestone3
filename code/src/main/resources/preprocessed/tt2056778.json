{"title":"In a Bedroom","plot":"Edyta is forty and in the midst of a crisis. She has left her family, her husband and son and their house on the Baltic Sea behind her. She spends her nights in a Warsaw hotel room and her days driving around the unfamiliar city. When she runs out of cash, she hatches a plan: An ad in the newspaper - sex for money. Edyta never lets things get that far though, as she drugs her clients and then uses their apartments as a refuge for the night. Then she meets an artist, Patryk. A smidgen of luck and Edyta can no longer maintain her dismissive attitude. In this enthralling character study, Tomasz Wasilewski uses film minimalism to ensure that glances and gestures say more than words. He portrays a lonely woman in both fragility and strength, using precise image composition.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Edyta","is","forti","and","in","the","midst","of","a","crisi",".","She","has","left","her","famili",",","her","husband","and","son","and","their","hous","on","the","Baltic","Sea","behind","her",".","She","spend","her","night","in","a","Warsaw","hotel","room","and","her","day","drive","around","the","unfamiliar","citi",".","When","she","run","out","of","cash",",","she","hatch","a","plan",":","An","ad","in","the","newspap","-","sex","for","money",".","Edyta","never","let","thing","get","that","far","though",",","as","she","drug","her","client","and","then","use","their","apart","as","a","refug","for","the","night",".","Then","she","meet","an","artist",",","Patryk",".","A","smidgen","of","luck","and","Edyta","can","no","longer","maintain","her","dismiss","attitud",".","In","this","enthral","charact","studi",",","Tomasz","Wasilewski","use","film","minim","to","ensur","that","glanc","and","gestur","say","more","than","word",".","He","portray","a","lone","woman","in","both","fragil","and","strength",",","use","precis","imag","composit","."],"lemmas":["Edyta","be","forty","and","in","the","midst","of","a","crisis",".","she","have","leave","she","family",",","she","husband","and","son","and","they","house","on","the","baltic","sea","behind","she",".","she","spend","she","night","in","a","Warsaw","hotel","room","and","she","day","drive","around","the","unfamiliar","city",".","when","she","run","out","of","cash",",","she","hatch","a","plan",":","a","ad","in","the","newspaper","-","sex","for","money",".","Edyta","never","let","thing","get","that","far","though",",","as","she","drug","she","client","and","then","use","they","apartment","as","a","refuge","for","the","night",".","then","she","meet","a","artist",",","Patryk",".","a","smidgen","of","luck","and","Edyta","can","no","longer","maintain","she","dismissive","attitude",".","in","this","enthralling","character","study",",","Tomasz","Wasilewski","use","film","minimalism","to","ensure","that","glance","and","gesture","say","more","than","word",".","he","portray","a","lonely","woman","in","both","fragility","and","strength",",","use","precise","image","composition","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Edyta is forty","is forty and","forty and in","and in the","in the midst","the midst of","midst of a","of a crisis","She has left","has left her","left her family","her family ,","family , her",", her husband","her husband and","husband and son","and son and","son and their","and their house","their house on","house on the","on the Baltic","the Baltic Sea","Baltic Sea behind","Sea behind her","She spends her","spends her nights","her nights in","nights in a","in a Warsaw","a Warsaw hotel","Warsaw hotel room","hotel room and","room and her","and her days","her days driving","days driving around","driving around the","around the unfamiliar","the unfamiliar city","When she runs","she runs out","runs out of","out of cash","of cash ,","cash , she",", she hatches","she hatches a","hatches a plan","a plan :","plan : An",": An ad","An ad in","ad in the","in the newspaper","the newspaper -","newspaper -

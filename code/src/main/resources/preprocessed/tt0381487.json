{"title":"People","plot":"John-John is the best party promoter in Ibiza. He's responsible for the wildest parties ever. A party fixed by John-John is bound to be a success, and everyone will queue to get on the guest list. The former party prince among the jet setters in Paris, Charles de Poulignac, is therefore in no doubt about where he should go in order to revenge his former clients. He flies to Ibiza, where he hopes to make an alliance with John-John, and put an end to life as persona non grata in Paris, and again take his place as the party prince of Paris.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["John-John","is","the","best","parti","promot","in","Ibiza",".","He","'s","respons","for","the","wildest","parti","ever",".","A","parti","fix","by","John-John","is","bound","to","be","a","success",",","and","everyon","will","queue","to","get","on","the","guest","list",".","The","former","parti","princ","among","the","jet","setter","in","Pari",",","Charl","de","Poulignac",",","is","therefor","in","no","doubt","about","where","he","should","go","in","order","to","reveng","his","former","client",".","He","fli","to","Ibiza",",","where","he","hope","to","make","an","allianc","with","John-John",",","and","put","an","end","to","life","as","persona","non","grata","in","Pari",",","and","again","take","his","place","as","the","parti","princ","of","Pari","."],"lemmas":["John-John","be","the","best","party","promoter","in","Ibiza",".","he","be","responsible","for","the","wildest","party","ever",".","a","party","fix","by","John-John","be","bind","to","be","a","success",",","and","everyone","will","queue","to","get","on","the","guest","list",".","the","former","party","prince","among","the","jet","setter","in","Paris",",","Charles","de","Poulignac",",","be","therefore","in","no","doubt","about","where","he","should","go","in","order","to","revenge","he","former","client",".","he","fly","to","Ibiza",",","where","he","hope","to","make","a","alliance","with","John-John",",","and","put","a","end","to","life","as","persona","non","grata","in","Paris",",","and","again","take","he","place","as","the","party","prince","of","Paris","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["John-John is the","is the best","the best party","best party promoter","party promoter in","promoter in Ibiza","He 's responsible","'s responsible for","responsible for the","for the wildest","the wildest parties","wildest parties ever","A party fixed","party fixed by","fixed by John-John","by John-John is","John-John is bound","is bound to","bound to be","to be a","be a success","a success ,","success , and",", and everyone","and everyone will","everyone will queue","will queue to","queue to get","to get on","get on the","on the guest","the guest list","The former party","former party prince","party prince among","prince among the","among the jet","the jet setters","jet setters in","setters in Paris","in Paris ,","Paris , Charles",", Charles de","Charles de Poulignac","de Poulignac ,","Poulignac , is",", is therefore","is therefore in","therefore in no","in no doubt","no doubt about","doubt about where","about where he","where he should","he should go","should go in","go in order","in order to","order to revenge","to revenge his","revenge his former","his former clients","He flies to","flies to Ibiza","to Ibiza ,","Ibiza , where",", where he","where he hopes","he hopes to","hopes to make","to make an","make an alliance","an alliance with","alliance with John-John","with John-John ,","John-John , and",", and put","and put an","put an end","an end to","end to life","to life as","life as persona","as persona non","persona non grata","non grata in","grata in Paris","in Paris ,","Paris , and",", and again","and again take","again take his","take his place","his place as","place as the","as the party","the party prince","party prince of","prince of Paris"],"2grams":["John-John is","is the","the best","best party","party promoter","promoter in","in Ibiza","He 's","'s responsible","responsible for","for the","the wildest","wildest parties","parties ever","A party","party fixed","fixed by","by John-John","John-John is","is bound","bound to","to be","be a","a success","success ,",", and","and everyone","everyone will","will queue","queue to","to get","get on","on the","the guest","guest list","The former","former party","party prince","prince among","among the","the jet","jet setters","setters in","in Paris","Paris ,",", Charles","Charles de","de Poulignac","Poulignac ,",", is","is therefore","therefore in","in no","no doubt","doubt about","about where","where he","he should","should go","go in","in order","order to","to revenge","revenge his","his former","former clients","He flies","flies to","to Ibiza","Ibiza ,",", where","where he","he hopes","hopes to","to make","make an","an alliance","alliance with","with John-John","John-John ,",", and","and put","put an","an end","end to","to life","life as","as persona","persona non","non grata","grata in","in Paris","Paris ,",", and","and again","again take","take his","his place","place as","as the","the party","party prince","prince of","of Paris"]}

Their violent break-up at the altar makes him a fugitive in search of a new identity. He lands in a trashy trailer park where he touches the lives of several dysfunctional residents. Two of them are adult buxom woman, who's somewhat interested in Eli, and her young teen sister, who's still a virgin. The impressionable teen falls for Eli hard to which he reciprocates, so the kid decides to run away with him even if it means getting her big sister out of the way first.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Eli","is","a","burglar","who","is","caught","in","the","act","by","Twinkl",",","a","crazi","heiress","who","coerc","him","into","a","sexual","relationship",".","Their","violent","break-up","at","the","altar","make","him","a","fugit","in","search","of","a","new","ident",".","He","land","in","a","trashi","trailer","park","where","he","touch","the","live","of","sever","dysfunct","resid",".","Two","of","them","are","adult","buxom","woman",",","who","'s","somewhat","interest","in","Eli",",","and","her","young","teen","sister",",","who","'s","still","a","virgin",".","The","impression","teen","fall","for","Eli","hard","to","which","he","reciproc",",","so","the","kid","decid","to","run","away","with","him","even","if","it","mean","get","her","big","sister","out","of","the","way","first","."],"lemmas":["Eli","be","a","burglar","who","be","catch","in","the","act","by","Twinkle",",","a","crazy","heiress","who","coerce","he","into","a","sexual","relationship",".","they","violent","break-up","at","the","altar","make","he","a","fugitive","in","search","of","a","new","identity",".","he","land","in","a","trashy","trailer","park","where","he","touch","the","life","of","several","dysfunctional","resident",".","two","of","they","be","adult","buxom","woman",",","who","be","somewhat","interested","in","Eli",",","and","she","young","teen","sister",",","who","be","still","a","virgin",".","the","impressionable","teen","fall","for","Eli","hard","to","which","he","reciprocate",",","so","the","kid","decide","to","run","away","with","he","even","if","it","mean","get","she","big","sister","out","of","the","way","first","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Eli is a","is a burglar","a burglar who","burglar who is","who is caught","is caught in","caught in the","in the act","the act by","act by Twinkle","by Twinkle ,","Twinkle , a",", a crazy","a crazy heiress","crazy heiress who","heiress who coerces","who coerces him","coerces him into","him into a","into a sexual","a sexual relationship","Their violent break-up","violent break-up at","break-up at the","at the altar","the altar makes","altar makes him","makes him a","him a fugitive","a fugitive in","fugitive in search","in search of","search of a","of a new","a new identity","He lands in","lands in a","in a trashy","a trashy trailer","trashy trailer park","trailer park where","park where he","where he touches","he touches the","touches the lives","the lives of","lives of several","of several dysfunctional","several dysfunctional residents","Two of them","of them are","them are adult","are adult buxom","adult buxom woman","buxom woman ,","woman , who",", who 's","who 's somewhat","'s somewhat interested","somewhat interested in","interested in Eli","in Eli ,","Eli , and",", and her","and her young","her young teen","young teen sister","teen sister ,","sister , who",", who 's","who 's still","'s still a","still a virgin","The impressionable teen","impressionable teen falls","teen falls for","falls for Eli","for Eli hard","Eli hard to","hard to which","to which he","which he reciprocates","he reciprocates ,","reciprocates , so",", so the","so the kid","the kid decides","kid decides to","decides to run","to run away","run away with","away with him","with him even","him even if","even if it","if it means","it means getting","means getting her","getting her big","her big sister","big sister out","sister out of","out of the","of the way","the way first"],"2grams":["Eli is","is a","a burglar","burglar who","who is","is caught","caught in","in the","the act","act by","by Twinkle","Twinkle ,",", a","a crazy","crazy heiress","heiress who","who coerces","coerces him","him into","into a","a sexual","sexual relationship","Their violent","violent break-up","break-up at","at the","the altar","altar makes","makes him","him a","a fugitive","fugitive in","in search","search of","of a","a new","new identity","He lands","lands in","in a","a trashy","trashy trailer","trailer park","park where","where he","he touches","touches the","the lives","lives of","of several","several dysfunctional","dysfunctional residents","Two of","of them","them are","are adult","adult buxom","buxom woman","woman ,",", who","who 's","'s somewhat","somewhat interested","interested in","in Eli","Eli ,",", and","and her","her young","young teen","teen sister","sister ,",", who","who 's","'s still","still a","a virgin","The impressionable","impressionable teen","teen falls","falls for","for Eli","Eli hard","hard to","to which","which he","he reciprocates","reciprocates ,",", so","so the","the kid","kid decides","decides to","to run","run away","away with","with him","him even","even if","if it","it means","means getting","getting her","her big","big sister","sister out","out of","of the","the way","way first"]}

{"title":"For My Wife","plot":"In December 2006, a torrential rainstorm hit Seattle. Tragic circumstances found Kate Fleming, a celebrated recording artist, trapped in her basement studio. Her spouse of nine years, Charlene Strong, returned home to find Kate sealed behind the studio door as the waters rose. Her efforts to free Kate ended when the water reached ceiling level. Rushed to the hospital, the ER staff from Kate's side unless she received permission from a 'blood relative.' Time was lost as Charlene made frantic calls to Kate's family. Kate died minutes after Charlene was granted permission. After facing this loss and the humiliation of a funeral director's bigotry, Charlene decided to take a stand. She contacted members of Washington's legislature, who at the time were debating Domestic Partnership rights.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," Family"],"stems":["In","Decemb","2006",",","a","torrenti","rainstorm","hit","Seattl",".","Tragic","circumst","found","Kate","Fleme",",","a","celebr","record","artist",",","trap","in","her","basement","studio",".","Her","spous","of","nine","year",",","Charlen","Strong",",","return","home","to","find","Kate","seal","behind","the","studio","door","as","the","water","rose",".","Her","effort","to","free","Kate","end","when","the","water","reach","ceil","level",".","Rush","to","the","hospit",",","the","ER","staff","from","Kate","'s","side","unless","she","receiv","permiss","from","a","'","blood","relat",".","'","Time","was","lost","as","Charlen","made","frantic","call","to","Kate","'s","famili",".","Kate","die","minut","after","Charlen","was","grant","permiss",".","After","face","this","loss","and","the","humili","of","a","funer","director","'s","bigotri",",","Charlen","decid","to","take","a","stand",".","She","contact","member","of","Washington","'s","legislatur",",","who","at","the","time","were","debat","Domest","Partnership","right","."],"lemmas":["in","December","2006",",","a","torrential","rainstorm","hit","Seattle",".","tragic","circumstance","find","Kate","Fleming",",","a","celebrated","recording","artist",",","trap","in","she","basement","studio",".","she","spouse","of","nine","year",",","Charlene","strong",",","return","home","to","find","Kate","seal","behind","the","studio","door","as","the","water","rise",".","she","effort","to","free","Kate","end","when","the","water","reach","ceiling","level",".","rush","to","the","hospital",",","the","er","staff","from","Kate","'s","side","unless","she","receive","permission","from","a","'","blood","relative",".","'","Time","be","lose","as","Charlene","make","frantic","call","to","Kate","'s","family",".","Kate","die","minute","after","Charlene","be","grant","permission",".","after","face","this","loss","and","the","humiliation","of","a","funeral","director","'s","bigotry",",","Charlene","decide","to","take","a","stand",".","she","contact","member","of","Washington","'s","legislature",",","who","at","the","time","be","debate","Domestic","Partnership","rights","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In December 2006","December 2006 ,","2006 , a",", a torrential","a torrential rainstorm","torrential rainstorm hit","rainstorm hit Seattle","Tragic circumstances found","circumstances found Kate","found Kate Fleming","Kate Fleming ,","Fleming , a",", a celebrated","a celebrated recording","celebrated recording artist","recording artist ,","artist , trapped",", trapped in","trapped in her","in her basement","her basement studio","Her spouse of","spouse of nine","of nine years","nine years ,","years , Charlene",", Charlene Strong","Charlene Strong ,","Strong , returned",", returned home","returned home to","home to find","to find Kate","find Kate sealed","Kate sealed behind","sealed behind the","behind the studio","the studio door","studio door as","door as the","as the waters","the waters rose","Her efforts to","efforts to free","to free Kate","free Kate ended","Kate ended when","ended when the","when the water","the water reached","water reached ceiling","reached ceiling level","Rushed to the","to the hospital","the hospital ,","hospital , the",", the ER","the ER staff","ER staff from","staff from Kate","from Kate 's","Kate 's side","'s side unless","side unless she","unless she received","she received permission","received permission from","permission from a","from a '","a ' blood","' blood relative","blood relative .","relative .

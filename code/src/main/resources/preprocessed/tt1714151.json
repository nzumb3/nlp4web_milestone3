{"title":"Three Shadows","plot":"An ancient vampire, an immortal man, and a mysterious old house. These are the terrors we face in Director Ansel Faraj's Gothic horror trilogy. Kevin Shayer stars in all three, as Nosferatu, the vampire who has lived for over 900 years searching for his lost love in the first tale Nosferatu Beyond Death; Then as the elusive Dorian Grey, who's true rotting visage is displayed on a painting hidden away from prying eyes in The Picture of Dorian Grey, from Oscar Wilde's novel; and finally as Abner Whateley, a young man who inherits a decaying mansion which harbors something not altogether human in The Shuttered Room, based on the story by H.P. Lovecraft. Three Shadows is a journey into the forgotten horrors of old.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["An","ancient","vampir",",","an","immort","man",",","and","a","mysteri","old","hous",".","These","are","the","terror","we","face","in","Director","Ansel","Faraj","'s","Gothic","horror","trilog",".","Kevin","Shayer","star","in","all","three",",","as","Nosferatu",",","the","vampir","who","has","live","for","over","900","year","search","for","his","lost","love","in","the","first","tale","Nosferatu","Beyond","Death",";","Then","as","the","elus","Dorian","Grey",",","who","'s","true","rot","visag","is","display","on","a","paint","hidden","away","from","pri","eye","in","The","Pictur","of","Dorian","Grey",",","from","Oscar","Wild","'s","novel",";","and","final","as","Abner","Whateley",",","a","young","man","who","inherit","a","decay","mansion","which","harbor","someth","not","altogeth","human","in","The","Shutter","Room",",","base","on","the","stori","by","H.P.","Lovecraft",".","Three","Shadow","is","a","journey","into","the","forgotten","horror","of","old","."],"lemmas":["a","ancient","vampire",",","a","immortal","man",",","and","a","mysterious","old","house",".","these","be","the","terror","we","face","in","Director","Ansel","Faraj","'s","gothic","horror","trilogy",".","Kevin","Shayer","star","in","all","three",",","as","Nosferatu",",","the","vampire","who","have","live","for","over","900","year","search","for","he","lost","love","in","the","first","tale","Nosferatu","Beyond","Death",";","then","as","the","elusive","Dorian","Grey",",","who","be","true","rot","visage","be","display","on","a","painting","hide","away","from","prying","eye","in","the","Picture","of","Dorian","Grey",",","from","Oscar","Wilde","'s","novel",";","and","finally","as","Abner","Whateley",",","a","young","man","who","inherit","a","decaying","mansion","which","harbor","something","not","altogether","human","in","the","Shuttered","Room",",","base","on","the","story","by","H.P.","Lovecraft",".","three","shadow","be","a","journey","into","the","forget","horror","of","old","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["An ancient vampire","ancient vampire ,","vampire , an",", an immortal","an immortal man","immortal man ,","man , and",", and a","and a mysterious","a mysterious old","mysterious old house","These are the","are the terrors","the terrors we","terrors we face","we face in","face in Director","in Director Ansel","Director Ansel Faraj","Ansel Faraj 's","Faraj 's Gothic","'s Gothic horror","Gothic horror trilogy","Kevin Shayer stars","Shayer stars in","stars in all","in all three","all three ,","three , as",", as Nosferatu","as Nosferatu ,","Nosferatu , the",", the vampire","the vampire who","vampire who has","who has lived","has lived for","lived for over","for over 900","over 900 years","900 years searching","years searching for","searching for his","for his lost","his lost love","lost love in","love in the","in the first","the first tale","first tale Nosferatu","tale Nosferatu Beyond","Nosferatu Beyond Death","Beyond Death ;","Death ; Then","; Then as","Then as the","as the elusive","the elusive Dorian","elusive Dorian Grey","Dorian Grey ,","Grey , who",", who 's","who 's true","'s true rotting","true rotting visage","rotting visage is","visage is displayed","is displayed on","displayed on a","on a painting","a painting hidden","painting hidden away","hidden away from","away from prying","from prying eyes","prying eyes in","eyes in The","in The Picture","The Picture of","Picture of Dorian","of Dorian Grey","Dorian Grey ,","Grey , from",", from Oscar","from Oscar Wilde","Oscar Wilde 's","Wilde 's novel","'s novel ;","novel ; and","; and finally","and finally as","finally as Abner","as Abner Whateley","Abner Whateley ,","Whateley , a",", a young","a young man","young man who","man who inherits","who inherits a","inherits a decaying","a decaying mansion","decaying mansion which","mansion which harbors","which harbors something","harbors something not","something not altogether","not altogether human","altogether human in","human in The","in The Shuttered","The Shuttered Room","Shuttered Room ,","Room , based",", based on","based on the","on the story","the story by","story by H.P.","by H.P.

{"title":"Circus IMAGO One Chance in a Million","plot":"We are in a dreamworld with two Circus-camps IMAGO, where everything is possible and dreams can come true. The world is much darker at OBSTINATE, ruled by the mean and pompous MACHIAVELLI. A crowded summer-festival full of artists and jesters. Machiavelli humiliates his best artist Dag. Anna from Circus Imago saves Dag that flees to Imago. From now on Machiavelli only tries to get his artist back. At Circus Imago everything is in chaos with the broken Director all alone. Will they manage to make a new show and will the wannabee Morgan add something? While Machiavelli stops at nothing to harm Imago and get Dag back.","genres":["Action"," Family"," Comedy"],"stems":["We","are","in","a","dreamworld","with","two","Circus-camp","IMAGO",",","where","everyth","is","possibl","and","dream","can","come","true",".","The","world","is","much","darker","at","OBSTINATE",",","rule","by","the","mean","and","pompous","MACHIAVELLI",".","A","crowd","summer-festiv","full","of","artist","and","jester",".","Machiavelli","humili","his","best","artist","Dag",".","Anna","from","Circus","Imago","save","Dag","that","flee","to","Imago",".","From","now","on","Machiavelli","onli","tri","to","get","his","artist","back",".","At","Circus","Imago","everyth","is","in","chao","with","the","broken","Director","all","alon",".","Will","they","manag","to","make","a","new","show","and","will","the","wannabe","Morgan","add","someth","?","While","Machiavelli","stop","at","noth","to","harm","Imago","and","get","Dag","back","."],"lemmas":["we","be","in","a","dreamworld","with","two","circus-camp","IMAGO",",","where","everything","be","possible","and","dream","can","come","true",".","the","world","be","much","darker","at","OBSTINATE",",","rule","by","the","mean","and","pompous","MACHIAVELLI",".","a","crowded","summer-festival","full","of","artist","and","jester",".","Machiavelli","humiliate","he","best","artist","dag",".","Anna","from","Circus","Imago","save","Dag","that","flee","to","Imago",".","from","now","on","Machiavelli","only","try","to","get","he","artist","back",".","at","Circus","Imago","everything","be","in","chaos","with","the","broken","Director","all","alone",".","will","they","manage","to","make","a","new","show","and","will","the","wannabee","Morgan","add","something","?","while","Machiavelli","stop","at","nothing","to","harm","Imago","and","get","Dag","back","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["We are in","are in a","in a dreamworld","a dreamworld with","dreamworld with two","with two Circus-camps","two Circus-camps IMAGO","Circus-camps IMAGO ,","IMAGO , where",", where everything","where everything is","everything is possible","is possible and","possible and dreams","and dreams can","dreams can come","can come true","The world is","world is much","is much darker","much darker at","darker at OBSTINATE","at OBSTINATE ,","OBSTINATE , ruled",", ruled by","ruled by the","by the mean","the mean and","mean and pompous","and pompous MACHIAVELLI","A crowded summer-festival","crowded summer-festival full","summer-festival full of","full of artists","of artists and","artists and jesters","Machiavelli humiliates his","humiliates his best","his best artist","best artist Dag","Anna from Circus","from Circus Imago","Circus Imago saves","Imago saves Dag","saves Dag that","Dag that flees","that flees to","flees to Imago","From now on","now on Machiavelli","on Machiavelli only","Machiavelli only tries","only tries to","tries to get","to get his","get his artist","his artist back","At Circus Imago","Circus Imago everything","Imago everything is","everything is in","is in chaos","in chaos with","chaos with the","with the broken","the broken Director","broken Director all","Director all alone","Will they manage","they manage to","manage to make","to make a","make a new","a new show","new show and","show and will","and will the","will the wannabee","the wannabee Morgan","wannabee Morgan add","Morgan add something","While Machiavelli stops","Machiavelli stops at","stops at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to harm","to harm Imago","harm Imago and","Imago and get","and get Dag","get Dag back"],"2grams":["We are","are in","in a","a dreamworld","dreamworld with","with two","two Circus-camps","Circus-camps IMAGO","IMAGO ,",", where","where everything","everything is","is possible","possible and","and dreams","dreams can","can come","come true","The world","world is","is much","much darker","darker at","at OBSTINATE","OBSTINATE ,",", ruled","ruled by","by the","the mean","mean and","and pompous","pompous MACHIAVELLI","A crowded","crowded summer-festival","summer-festival full","full of","of artists","artists and","and jesters","Machiavelli humiliates","humiliates his","his best","best artist","artist Dag","Anna from","from Circus","Circus Imago","Imago saves","saves Dag","Dag that","that flees","flees to","to Imago","From now","now on","on Machiavelli","Machiavelli only","only tries","tries to","to get","get his","his artist","artist back","At Circus","Circus Imago","Imago everything","everything is","is in","in chaos","chaos with","with the","the broken","broken Director","Director all","all alone","Will they","they manage","manage to","to make","make a","a new","new show","show and","and will","will the","the wannabee","wannabee Morgan","Morgan add","add something","While Machiavelli","Machiavelli stops","stops at","at nothing","nothing to","to harm","harm Imago","Imago and","and get","get Dag","Dag back"]}

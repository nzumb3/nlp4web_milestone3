{"title":"Howards End","plot":"Encounter of three social classes of England at the beginning of the 20th century : the Victorian capitalists (the Wilcoxes) considering themselves as aristocrats, whose only god is money ; the enlightened bourgeois (the Schlegels), humanistic and philanthropic ; and the workers (the Basts), fighting to survive. The Schlegel sisters' humanism will be torn apart as they try both to softly knock down the Wilcox's prejudices and to help the Basts.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Encounter","of","three","social","class","of","England","at","the","begin","of","the","20th","centuri",":","the","Victorian","capitalist","(","the","Wilcox",")","consid","themselv","as","aristocrat",",","whose","onli","god","is","money",";","the","enlighten","bourgeoi","(","the","Schlegel",")",",","humanist","and","philanthrop",";","and","the","worker","(","the","Bast",")",",","fight","to","surviv",".","The","Schlegel","sister","'","human","will","be","torn","apart","as","they","tri","both","to","soft","knock","down","the","Wilcox","'s","prejudic","and","to","help","the","Bast","."],"lemmas":["encounter","of","three","social","class","of","England","at","the","beginning","of","the","20th","century",":","the","victorian","capitalist","-lrb-","the","Wilcoxes","-rrb-","consider","themselves","as","aristocrat",",","whose","only","god","be","money",";","the","enlighten","bourgeois","-lrb-","the","Schlegels","-rrb-",",","humanistic","and","philanthropic",";","and","the","worker","-lrb-","the","bast","-rrb-",",","fight","to","survive",".","the","Schlegel","sister","'","humanism","will","be","tear","apart","as","they","try","both","to","softly","knock","down","the","Wilcox","'s","prejudice","and","to","help","the","Basts","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Encounter of three","of three social","three social classes","social classes of","classes of England","of England at","England at the","at the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of the","of the 20th","the 20th century","20th century :","century : the",": the Victorian","the Victorian capitalists","Victorian capitalists (","capitalists ( the","( the Wilcoxes","the Wilcoxes )","Wilcoxes ) considering",") considering themselves","considering themselves as","themselves as aristocrats","as aristocrats ,","aristocrats , whose",", whose only","whose only god","only god is","god is money","is money ;","money ; the","; the enlightened","the enlightened bourgeois","enlightened bourgeois (","bourgeois ( the","( the Schlegels","the Schlegels )","Schlegels ) ,",") , humanistic",", humanistic and","humanistic and philanthropic","and philanthropic ;","philanthropic ; and","; and the","and the workers","the workers (","workers ( the","( the Basts","the Basts )","Basts ) ,",") , fighting",", fighting to","fighting to survive","The Schlegel sisters","Schlegel sisters '","sisters ' humanism","' humanism will","humanism will be","will be torn","be torn apart","torn apart as","apart as they","as they try","they try both","try both to","both to softly","to softly knock","softly knock down","knock down the","down the Wilcox","the Wilcox 's","Wilcox 's prejudices","'s prejudices and","prejudices and to","and to help","to help the","help the Basts"],"2grams":["Encounter of","of three","three social","social classes","classes of","of England","England at","at the","the beginning","beginning of","of the","the 20th","20th century","century :",": the","the Victorian","Victorian capitalists","capitalists (","( the","the Wilcoxes","Wilcoxes )",") considering","considering themselves","themselves as","as aristocrats","aristocrats ,",", whose","whose only","only god","god is","is money","money ;","; the","the enlightened","enlightened bourgeois","bourgeois (","( the","the Schlegels","Schlegels )",") ,",", humanistic","humanistic and","and philanthropic","philanthropic ;","; and","and the","the workers","workers (","( the","the Basts","Basts )",") ,",", fighting","fighting to","to survive","The Schlegel","Schlegel sisters","sisters '","' humanism","humanism will","will be","be torn","torn apart","apart as","as they","they try","try both","both to","to softly","softly knock","knock down","down the","the Wilcox","Wilcox 's","'s prejudices","prejudices and","and to","to help","help the","the Basts"]}

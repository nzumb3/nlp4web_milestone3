{"title":"2021","plot":"John Cooper is a computer programming genius who starts working on a project to reverse engineer human intelligence using a map of the human genome. John becomes increasingly disillusioned and severely depressed as he begins to question any possible meaning of human thoughts and emotions that can be replicated on computer software. On the verge of a mental breakdown, he meets Emily-a shy, bohemian novelist that is unable to find emotional sustenance outside of the world of her own writing. This is the story of two lost souls searching for a shadow of love in an increasingly alienating modern world.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["John","Cooper","is","a","comput","program","genius","who","start","work","on","a","project","to","revers","engin","human","intellig","use","a","map","of","the","human","genom",".","John","becom","increas","disillus","and","sever","depress","as","he","begin","to","question","ani","possibl","mean","of","human","thought","and","emot","that","can","be","replic","on","comput","softwar",".","On","the","verg","of","a","mental","breakdown",",","he","meet","Emily-a","shi",",","bohemian","novelist","that","is","unabl","to","find","emot","susten","outsid","of","the","world","of","her","own","write",".","This","is","the","stori","of","two","lost","soul","search","for","a","shadow","of","love","in","an","increas","alien","modern","world","."],"lemmas":["John","Cooper","be","a","computer","programming","genius","who","start","work","on","a","project","to","reverse","engineer","human","intelligence","use","a","map","of","the","human","genome",".","John","become","increasingly","disillusioned","and","severely","depressed","as","he","begin","to","question","any","possible","meaning","of","human","thought","and","emotion","that","can","be","replicate","on","computer","software",".","on","the","verge","of","a","mental","breakdown",",","he","meet","emily-a","shy",",","bohemian","novelist","that","be","unable","to","find","emotional","sustenance","outside","of","the","world","of","she","own","writing",".","this","be","the","story","of","two","lose","soul","search","for","a","shadow","of","love","in","a","increasingly","alienate","modern","world","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["John Cooper is","Cooper is a","is a computer","a computer programming","computer programming genius","programming genius who","genius who starts","who starts working","starts working on","working on a","on a project","a project to","project to reverse","to reverse engineer","reverse engineer human","engineer human intelligence","human intelligence using","intelligence using a","using a map","a map of","map of the","of the human","the human genome","John becomes increasingly","becomes increasingly disillusioned","increasingly disillusioned and","disillusioned and severely","and severely depressed","severely depressed as","depressed as he","as he begins","he begins to","begins to question","to question any","question any possible","any possible meaning","possible meaning of","meaning of human","of human thoughts","human thoughts and","thoughts and emotions","and emotions that","emotions that can","that can be","can be replicated","be replicated on","replicated on computer","on computer software","On the verge","the verge of","verge of a","of a mental","a mental breakdown","mental breakdown ,","breakdown , he",", he meets","he meets Emily-a","meets Emily-a shy","Emily-a shy ,","shy , bohemian",", bohemian novelist","bohemian novelist that","novelist that is","that is unable","is unable to","unable to find","to find emotional","find emotional sustenance","emotional sustenance outside","sustenance outside of","outside of the","of the world","the world of","world of her","of her own","her own writing","This is the","is the story","the story of","story of two","of two lost","two lost souls","lost souls searching","souls searching for","searching for a","for a shadow","a shadow of","shadow of love","of love in","love in an","in an increasingly","an increasingly alienating","increasingly alienating modern","alienating modern world"],"2grams":["John Cooper","Cooper is","is a","a computer","computer programming","programming genius","genius who","who starts","starts working","working on","on a","a project","project to","to reverse","reverse engineer","engineer human","human intelligence","intelligence using","using a","a map","map of","of the","the human","human genome","John becomes","becomes increasingly","increasingly disillusioned","disillusioned and","and severely","severely depressed","depressed as","as he","he begins","begins to","to question","question any","any possible","possible meaning","meaning of","of human","human thoughts","thoughts and","and emotions","emotions that","that can","can be","be replicated","replicated on","on computer","computer software","On the","the verge","verge of","of a","a mental","mental breakdown","breakdown ,",", he","he meets","meets Emily-a","Emily-a shy","shy ,",", bohemian","bohemian novelist","novelist that","that is","is unable","unable to","to find","find emotional","emotional sustenance","sustenance outside","outside of","of the","the world","world of","of her","her own","own writing","This is","is the","the story","story of","of two","two lost","lost souls","souls searching","searching for","for a","a shadow","shadow of","of love","love in","in an","an increasingly","increasingly alienating","alienating modern","modern world"]}

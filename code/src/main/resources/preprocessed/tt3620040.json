{"title":"Legion: Patria Nostra","plot":"The Legion is our Homeland, Honour and Fidelity or French by Spilled Blood, rather than by blood received - those are mottos of the French Foreign Legion, where a number of Czech soldiers have served. Some of them speak up in the film about reasons that led them to join in, and describe often different experience serving to France and its interests. Major part of the film includes amateur video recordings and private photographs of modern legionnaires.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Legion","is","our","Homeland",",","Honour","and","Fidel","or","French","by","Spill","Blood",",","rather","than","by","blood","receiv","-","those","are","motto","of","the","French","Foreign","Legion",",","where","a","number","of","Czech","soldier","have","serv",".","Some","of","them","speak","up","in","the","film","about","reason","that","led","them","to","join","in",",","and","describ","often","differ","experi","serv","to","Franc","and","it","interest",".","Major","part","of","the","film","includ","amateur","video","record","and","privat","photograph","of","modern","legionnair","."],"lemmas":["the","Legion","be","we","Homeland",",","Honour","and","Fidelity","or","French","by","Spilled","Blood",",","rather","than","by","blood","receive","-","those","be","motto","of","the","French","Foreign","Legion",",","where","a","number","of","czech","soldier","have","serve",".","some","of","they","speak","up","in","the","film","about","reason","that","lead","they","to","join","in",",","and","describe","often","different","experience","serve","to","France","and","its","interest",".","major","part","of","the","film","include","amateur","video","recording","and","private","photograph","of","modern","legionnaire","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Legion is","Legion is our","is our Homeland","our Homeland ,","Homeland , Honour",", Honour and","Honour and Fidelity","and Fidelity or","Fidelity or French","or French by","French by Spilled","by Spilled Blood","Spilled Blood ,","Blood , rather",", rather than","rather than by","than by blood","by blood received","blood received -","received - those","- those are","those are mottos","are mottos of","mottos of the","of the French","the French Foreign","French Foreign Legion","Foreign Legion ,","Legion , where",", where a","where a number","a number of","number of Czech","of Czech soldiers","Czech soldiers have","soldiers have served","Some of them","of them speak","them speak up","speak up in","up in the","in the film","the film about","film about reasons","about reasons that","reasons that led","that led them","led them to","them to join","to join in","join in ,","in , and",", and describe","and describe often","describe often different","often different experience","different experience serving","experience serving to","serving to France","to France and","France and its","and its interests","Major part of","part of the","of the film","the film includes","film includes amateur","includes amateur video","amateur video recordings","video recordings and","recordings and private","and private photographs","private photographs of","photographs of modern","of modern legionnaires"],"2grams":["The Legion","Legion is","is our","our Homeland","Homeland ,",", Honour","Honour and","and Fidelity","Fidelity or","or French","French by","by Spilled","Spilled Blood","Blood ,",", rather","rather than","than by","by blood","blood received","received -","- those","those are","are mottos","mottos of","of the","the French","French Foreign","Foreign Legion","Legion ,",", where","where a","a number","number of","of Czech","Czech soldiers","soldiers have","have served","Some of","of them","them speak","speak up","up in","in the","the film","film about","about reasons","reasons that","that led","led them","them to","to join","join in","in ,",", and","and describe","describe often","often different","different experience","experience serving","serving to","to France","France and","and its","its interests","Major part","part of","of the","the film","film includes","includes amateur","amateur video","video recordings","recordings and","and private","private photographs","photographs of","of modern","modern legionnaires"]}

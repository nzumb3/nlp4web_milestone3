{"title":"Voz de Murga","plot":"Uruguay, a small country that has managed to come up with a complex form of art. A professional performance with a constant need to discuss the previous year's events and reflect on them in public. A popular theatrical event found during carnival, watched by more people than any other event year-round. A genre that evolves together with the country, representing the best and the worst Uruguayans can give. Because murga is the voice of Uruguay, a voice that nobody has been able to silence.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Uruguay",",","a","small","countri","that","has","manag","to","come","up","with","a","complex","form","of","art",".","A","profession","perform","with","a","constant","need","to","discuss","the","previous","year","'s","event","and","reflect","on","them","in","public",".","A","popular","theatric","event","found","dure","carniv",",","watch","by","more","peopl","than","ani","other","event","year-round",".","A","genr","that","evolv","togeth","with","the","countri",",","repres","the","best","and","the","worst","Uruguayan","can","give",".","Becaus","murga","is","the","voic","of","Uruguay",",","a","voic","that","nobodi","has","been","abl","to","silenc","."],"lemmas":["Uruguay",",","a","small","country","that","have","manage","to","come","up","with","a","complex","form","of","art",".","a","professional","performance","with","a","constant","need","to","discuss","the","previous","year","'s","event","and","reflect","on","they","in","public",".","a","popular","theatrical","event","find","during","carnival",",","watch","by","more","people","than","any","other","event","year-round",".","a","genre","that","evolve","together","with","the","country",",","represent","the","best","and","the","worst","Uruguayans","can","give",".","because","murga","be","the","voice","of","Uruguay",",","a","voice","that","nobody","have","be","able","to","silence","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Uruguay , a",", a small","a small country","small country that","country that has","that has managed","has managed to","managed to come","to come up","come up with","up with a","with a complex","a complex form","complex form of","form of art","A professional performance","professional performance with","performance with a","with a constant","a constant need","constant need to","need to discuss","to discuss the","discuss the previous","the previous year","previous year 's","year 's events","'s events and","events and reflect","and reflect on","reflect on them","on them in","them in public","A popular theatrical","popular theatrical event","theatrical event found","event found during","found during carnival","during carnival ,","carnival , watched",", watched by","watched by more","by more people","more people than","people than any","than any other","any other event","other event year-round","A genre that","genre that evolves","that evolves together","evolves together with","together with the","with the country","the country ,","country , representing",", representing the","representing the best","the best and","best and the","and the worst","the worst Uruguayans","worst Uruguayans can","Uruguayans can give","Because murga is","murga is the","is the voice","the voice of","voice of Uruguay","of Uruguay ,","Uruguay , a",", a voice","a voice that","voice that nobody","that nobody has","nobody has been","has been able","been able to","able to silence"],"2grams":["Uruguay ,",", a","a small","small country","country that","that has","has managed","managed to","to come","come up","up with","with a","a complex","complex form","form of","of art","A professional","professional performance","performance with","with a","a constant","constant need","need to","to discuss","discuss the","the previous","previous year","year 's","'s events","events and","and reflect","reflect on","on them","them in","in public","A popular","popular theatrical","theatrical event","event found","found during","during carnival","carnival ,",", watched","watched by","by more","more people","people than","than any","any other","other event","event year-round","A genre","genre that","that evolves","evolves together","together with","with the","the country","country ,",", representing","representing the","the best","best and","and the","the worst","worst Uruguayans","Uruguayans can","can give","Because murga","murga is","is the","the voice","voice of","of Uruguay","Uruguay ,",", a","a voice","voice that","that nobody","nobody has","has been","been able","able to","to silence"]}

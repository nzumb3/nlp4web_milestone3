{"title":"Rammbock","plot":"Just when Michael arrives in Berlin to visit his ex-girlfriend Gabi, a terrible virus starts spreading across the city at a rapid pace, turning people into mindless homicidal maniacs. Much to Michael's concern, Gabi's not home; instead, he meets Harper, a teenage plumber's apprentice at work in her apartment block. Together, they manage to barricade themselves when raging hordes of infected people swarm the building. Surrounded by these thirsty zombies, Michael and Harper have their hands full to survive - and it will take all of their ingenuity to make their way out to try and find Gabi.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Just","when","Michael","arriv","in","Berlin","to","visit","his","ex-girlfriend","Gabi",",","a","terribl","virus","start","spread","across","the","citi","at","a","rapid","pace",",","turn","peopl","into","mindless","homicid","maniac",".","Much","to","Michael","'s","concern",",","Gabi","'s","not","home",";","instead",",","he","meet","Harper",",","a","teenag","plumber","'s","apprentic","at","work","in","her","apart","block",".","Togeth",",","they","manag","to","barricad","themselv","when","rage","hord","of","infect","peopl","swarm","the","build",".","Surround","by","these","thirsti","zombi",",","Michael","and","Harper","have","their","hand","full","to","surviv","-","and","it","will","take","all","of","their","ingenu","to","make","their","way","out","to","tri","and","find","Gabi","."],"lemmas":["just","when","Michael","arrive","in","Berlin","to","visit","he","ex-girlfriend","Gabi",",","a","terrible","virus","start","spreading","across","the","city","at","a","rapid","pace",",","turn","people","into","mindless","homicidal","maniac",".","much","to","Michael","'s","concern",",","Gabi","'s","not","home",";","instead",",","he","meet","Harper",",","a","teenage","plumber","'s","apprentice","at","work","in","she","apartment","block",".","together",",","they","manage","to","barricade","themselves","when","rage","horde","of","infected","people","swarm","the","building",".","surround","by","these","thirsty","zombie",",","Michael","and","Harper","have","they","hand","full","to","survive","-","and","it","will","take","all","of","they","ingenuity","to","make","they","way","out","to","try","and","find","Gabi","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Just when Michael","when Michael arrives","Michael arrives in","arrives in Berlin","in Berlin to","Berlin to visit","to visit his","visit his ex-girlfriend","his ex-girlfriend Gabi","ex-girlfriend Gabi ,","Gabi , a",", a terrible","a terrible virus","terrible virus starts","virus starts spreading","starts spreading across","spreading across the","across the city","the city at","city at a","at a rapid","a rapid pace","rapid pace ,","pace , turning",", turning people","turning people into","people into mindless","into mindless homicidal","mindless homicidal maniacs","Much to Michael","to Michael 's","Michael 's concern","'s concern ,","concern , Gabi",", Gabi 's","Gabi 's not","'s not home","not home ;","home ;

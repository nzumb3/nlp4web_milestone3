{"title":"Harvest of Innocents: Investigating Chinese Organ Murder","plot":"Tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners may be being murdered for their organs in China. The Chinese government denies this, but four years after the allegations surfaced, three separate investigations have uncovered compelling evidence that Chinese courts, hospitals, labor camps, and prisons are involved in a conspiracy to illegally execute imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners and harvest their organs for profit. 'Harvest of Innocents' brings together these investigations in the hope that the issue of Chinese organ murder can be addressed and resolved by both China and the world. 'Harvest of Innocents' also examines the history of China's transplantation industry, the origin and context of the allegations, and the response of the international community.","genres":["Crime"," Mystery"," Documentary"],"stems":["Ten","of","thousand","of","Falun","Gong","practition","may","be","be","murder","for","their","organ","in","China",".","The","Chines","govern","deni","this",",","but","four","year","after","the","alleg","surfac",",","three","separ","investig","have","uncov","compel","evid","that","Chines","court",",","hospit",",","labor","camp",",","and","prison","are","involv","in","a","conspiraci","to","illeg","execut","imprison","Falun","Gong","practition","and","harvest","their","organ","for","profit",".","'","Harvest","of","Innocent","'","bring","togeth","these","investig","in","the","hope","that","the","issu","of","Chines","organ","murder","can","be","address","and","resolv","by","both","China","and","the","world",".","'","Harvest","of","Innocent","'","also","examin","the","histori","of","China","'s","transplant","industri",",","the","origin","and","context","of","the","alleg",",","and","the","respons","of","the","intern","communiti","."],"lemmas":["ten","of","thousand","of","Falun","Gong","practitioner","may","be","be","murder","for","they","organ","in","China",".","the","chinese","government","deny","this",",","but","four","year","after","the","allegation","surface",",","three","separate","investigation","have","uncover","compelling","evidence","that","chinese","court",",","hospital",",","labor","camp",",","and","prison","be","involve","in","a","conspiracy","to","illegally","execute","imprison","Falun","Gong","practitioner","and","harvest","they","organ","for","profit",".","'","harvest","of","innocent","'","bring","together","these","investigation","in","the","hope","that","the","issue","of","chinese","organ","murder","can","be","address","and","resolve","by","both","China","and","the","world",".","'","harvest","of","innocent","'","also","examine","the","history","of","China","'s","transplantation","industry",",","the","origin","and","context","of","the","allegation",",","and","the","response","of","the","international","community","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Tens of thousands","of thousands of","thousands of Falun","of Falun Gong","Falun Gong practitioners","Gong practitioners may","practitioners may be","may be being","be being murdered","being murdered for","murdered for their","for their organs","their organs in","organs in China","The Chinese government","Chinese government denies","government denies this","denies this ,","this , but",", but four","but four years","four years after","years after the","after the allegations","the allegations surfaced","allegations surfaced ,","surfaced , three",", three separate","three separate investigations","separate investigations have","investigations have uncovered","have uncovered compelling","uncovered compelling evidence","compelling evidence that","evidence that Chinese","that Chinese courts","Chinese courts ,","courts , hospitals",", hospitals ,","hospitals , labor",", labor camps","labor camps ,","camps , and",", and prisons","and prisons are","prisons are involved","are involved in","involved in a","in a conspiracy","a conspiracy to","conspiracy to illegally","to illegally execute","illegally execute imprisoned","execute imprisoned Falun","imprisoned Falun Gong","Falun Gong practitioners","Gong practitioners and","practitioners and harvest","and harvest their","harvest their organs","their organs for","organs for profit","for profit .","profit .

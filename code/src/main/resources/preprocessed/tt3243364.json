{"title":"The Sentimentalists","plot":"An aged , above any suspicion, bourgeois by the nickname 'The Master', lives isolated in a luxurious beachfront villa with his teenage daughter. In reality, however, he is an illicit trade in antiquities, a loan shark and a black market trader of antiquities. The 'Master' has two henchmen to do his 'dirty work', Mercury and John, both of committing a fatal mistake: while Mercury falls for the daughter of 'Master', John is obsessed with a prostitute. Both of them , as 'sentimentalists', must be whacked.","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["An","age",",","abov","ani","suspicion",",","bourgeoi","by","the","nicknam","'","The","Master","'",",","live","isol","in","a","luxuri","beachfront","villa","with","his","teenag","daughter",".","In","realiti",",","howev",",","he","is","an","illicit","trade","in","antiqu",",","a","loan","shark","and","a","black","market","trader","of","antiqu",".","The","'","Master","'","has","two","henchmen","to","do","his","'","dirti","work","'",",","Mercuri","and","John",",","both","of","commit","a","fatal","mistak",":","while","Mercuri","fall","for","the","daughter","of","'","Master","'",",","John","is","obsess","with","a","prostitut",".","Both","of","them",",","as","'","sentimentalist","'",",","must","be","whack","."],"lemmas":["a","aged",",","above","any","suspicion",",","bourgeois","by","the","nickname","'","the","master","'",",","life","isolate","in","a","luxurious","beachfront","villa","with","he","teenage","daughter",".","in","reality",",","however",",","he","be","a","illicit","trade","in","antiquity",",","a","loan","shark","and","a","black","market","trader","of","antiquity",".","the","'","master","'","have","two","henchman","to","do","he","'","dirty","work","'",",","Mercury","and","John",",","both","of","commit","a","fatal","mistake",":","while","Mercury","fall","for","the","daughter","of","'","master","'",",","John","be","obsess","with","a","prostitute",".","both","of","they",",","as","'","sentimentalist","'",",","must","be","whack","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An aged ,","aged , above",", above any","above any suspicion","any suspicion ,","suspicion , bourgeois",", bourgeois by","bourgeois by the","by the nickname","the nickname '","nickname ' The","' The Master","The Master '","Master ' ,","' , lives",", lives isolated","lives isolated in","isolated in a","in a luxurious","a luxurious beachfront","luxurious beachfront villa","beachfront villa with","villa with his","with his teenage","his teenage daughter","In reality ,","reality , however",", however ,","however , he",", he is","he is an","is an illicit","an illicit trade","illicit trade in","trade in antiquities","in antiquities ,","antiquities , a",", a loan","a loan shark","loan shark and","shark and a","and a black","a black market","black market trader","market trader of","trader of antiquities","The ' Master","' Master '","Master ' has","' has two","has two henchmen","two henchmen to","henchmen to do","to do his","do his '","his ' dirty","' dirty work","dirty work '","work ' ,","' , Mercury",", Mercury and","Mercury and John","and John ,","John , both",", both of","both of committing","of committing a","committing a fatal","a fatal mistake","fatal mistake :","mistake : while",": while Mercury","while Mercury falls","Mercury falls for","falls for the","for the daughter","the daughter of","daughter of '","of ' Master","' Master '","Master ' ,","' , John",", John is","John is obsessed","is obsessed with","obsessed with a","with a prostitute","Both of them","of them ,","them , as",", as '","as ' sentimentalists","' sentimentalists '","sentimentalists ' ,","' , must",", must be","must be whacked"],"2grams":["An aged","aged ,",", above","above any","any suspicion","suspicion ,",", bourgeois","bourgeois by","by the","the nickname","nickname '","' The","The Master","Master '","' ,",", lives","lives isolated","isolated in","in a","a luxurious","luxurious beachfront","beachfront villa","villa with","with his","his teenage","teenage daughter","In reality","reality ,",", however","however ,",", he","he is","is an","an illicit","illicit trade","trade in","in antiquities","antiquities ,",", a","a loan","loan shark","shark and","and a","a black","black market","market trader","trader of","of antiquities","The '","' Master","Master '","' has","has two","two henchmen","henchmen to","to do","do his","his '","' dirty","dirty work","work '","' ,",", Mercury","Mercury and","and John","John ,",", both","both of","of committing","committing a","a fatal","fatal mistake","mistake :",": while","while Mercury","Mercury falls","falls for","for the","the daughter","daughter of","of '","' Master","Master '","' ,",", John","John is","is obsessed","obsessed with","with a","a prostitute","Both of","of them","them ,",", as","as '","' sentimentalists","sentimentalists '","' ,",", must","must be","be whacked"]}

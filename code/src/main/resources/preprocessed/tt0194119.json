{"title":"Los Enchiladas!","plot":"About a half dozen slacker dudes dwell at their jobs at Los Enchiladas, the local Mexican sit-down joint. The 2 folks in \"management\" are both into their own authority and fill their days creating wild & stupid rules for the working folk. By mid-film, however, the manager has fled the cops after beating the crap out of a competing restaurant's dancing gyro... and the \"Chef\" has jumped ship to join a beatnik poet's groups which specializes in exotic menu-writing. This leaves the minimum-wage crowd to run the place as they see fit.... and they see a lot of debauchery, booze, and free steak in their future.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["About","a","half","dozen","slacker","dude","dwell","at","their","job","at","Los","Enchilada",",","the","local","Mexican","sit-down","joint",".","The","2","folk","in","\"","manag","\"","are","both","into","their","own","author","and","fill","their","day","creat","wild","&","stupid","rule","for","the","work","folk",".","By","mid-film",",","howev",",","the","manag","has","fled","the","cop","after","beat","the","crap","out","of","a","compet","restaur","'s","danc","gyro","...","and","the","\"","Chef","\"","has","jump","ship","to","join","a","beatnik","poet","'s","group","which","special","in","exot","menu-writ",".","This","leav","the","minimum-wag","crowd","to","run","the","place","as","they","see","fit","...",".","and","they","see","a","lot","of","debaucheri",",","booz",",","and","free","steak","in","their","futur","."],"lemmas":["about","a","half","dozen","slacker","dude","dwell","at","they","job","at","Los","Enchiladas",",","the","local","mexican","sit-down","joint",".","the","2","folk","in","``","management","''","be","both","into","they","own","authority","and","fill","they","day","create","wild","&","stupid","rule","for","the","work","folk",".","by","mid-film",",","however",",","the","manager","have","flee","the","cop","after","beat","the","crap","out","of","a","compete","restaurant","'s","dancing","gyro","...","and","the","``","Chef","''","have","jump","ship","to","join","a","beatnik","poet","'s","group","which","specialize","in","exotic","menu-writing",".","this","leave","the","minimum-wage","crowd","to","run","the","place","as","they","see","fit","...",".","and","they","see","a","lot","of","debauchery",",","booze",",","and","free","steak","in","they","future","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["About

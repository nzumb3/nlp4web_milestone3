{"title":"Memorias del Futuro","plot":"A woman writes love letters to a man who has abandoned her. Her passion and frustration intermix with the larger chaos of Mexico, drawing a parallel where a single personal tragedy mirrors the struggle of an entire country trying to find itself. Linking a film-essay to a direct cinema style, its visceral images reflect an adventurous production that led a pair of filmmakers through a four-month journey, living in a minivan on the back-roads of Mexico.","genres":["Documentary"," Sci-Fi"," History"],"stems":["A","woman","write","love","letter","to","a","man","who","has","abandon","her",".","Her","passion","and","frustrat","intermix","with","the","larger","chao","of","Mexico",",","draw","a","parallel","where","a","singl","person","tragedi","mirror","the","struggl","of","an","entir","countri","tri","to","find","itself",".","Link","a","film-essay","to","a","direct","cinema","style",",","it","viscer","imag","reflect","an","adventur","product","that","led","a","pair","of","filmmak","through","a","four-month","journey",",","live","in","a","minivan","on","the","back-road","of","Mexico","."],"lemmas":["a","woman","write","love","letter","to","a","man","who","have","abandon","she",".","she","passion","and","frustration","intermix","with","the","larger","chaos","of","Mexico",",","draw","a","parallel","where","a","single","personal","tragedy","mirror","the","struggle","of","a","entire","country","try","to","find","itself",".","link","a","film-essay","to","a","direct","cinema","style",",","its","visceral","image","reflect","a","adventurous","production","that","lead","a","pair","of","filmmaker","through","a","four-month","journey",",","live","in","a","minivan","on","the","back-road","of","Mexico","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A woman writes","woman writes love","writes love letters","love letters to","letters to a","to a man","a man who","man who has","who has abandoned","has abandoned her","Her passion and","passion and frustration","and frustration intermix","frustration intermix with","intermix with the","with the larger","the larger chaos","larger chaos of","chaos of Mexico","of Mexico ,","Mexico , drawing",", drawing a","drawing a parallel","a parallel where","parallel where a","where a single","a single personal","single personal tragedy","personal tragedy mirrors","tragedy mirrors the","mirrors the struggle","the struggle of","struggle of an","of an entire","an entire country","entire country trying","country trying to","trying to find","to find itself","Linking a film-essay","a film-essay to","film-essay to a","to a direct","a direct cinema","direct cinema style","cinema style ,","style , its",", its visceral","its visceral images","visceral images reflect","images reflect an","reflect an adventurous","an adventurous production","adventurous production that","production that led","that led a","led a pair","a pair of","pair of filmmakers","of filmmakers through","filmmakers through a","through a four-month","a four-month journey","four-month journey ,","journey , living",", living in","living in a","in a minivan","a minivan on","minivan on the","on the back-roads","the back-roads of","back-roads of Mexico"],"2grams":["A woman","woman writes","writes love","love letters","letters to","to a","a man","man who","who has","has abandoned","abandoned her","Her passion","passion and","and frustration","frustration intermix","intermix with","with the","the larger","larger chaos","chaos of","of Mexico","Mexico ,",", drawing","drawing a","a parallel","parallel where","where a","a single","single personal","personal tragedy","tragedy mirrors","mirrors the","the struggle","struggle of","of an","an entire","entire country","country trying","trying to","to find","find itself","Linking a","a film-essay","film-essay to","to a","a direct","direct cinema","cinema style","style ,",", its","its visceral","visceral images","images reflect","reflect an","an adventurous","adventurous production","production that","that led","led a","a pair","pair of","of filmmakers","filmmakers through","through a","a four-month","four-month journey","journey ,",", living","living in","in a","a minivan","minivan on","on the","the back-roads","back-roads of","of Mexico"]}

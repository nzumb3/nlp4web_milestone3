{"title":"War Zone/Comfort Zone","plot":"War Zone/Comfort Zone follows two women, Joy Kiss and Shalini Madaras---whose son was killed in Iraq in 2006---as they fight to open the first transitional supportive house for female veterans in Connecticut. Their fight, shown through emotional zoning meetings including copious neighborhood opposition, is interwoven with the personal stories of women veterans facing incredible hurdles as they transition back to civilian life. Jill, the only woman squad leader in her brigade, has PTSD and is living with her in-laws. Caroline was sexually assaulted by two fellow soldiers and has been homeless on and off for thirty years. Gladys has a traumatic brain injury and is sleeping on her ex-husband's couch. Will the city of Bridgeport find a place for these women?","genres":["Documentary"," War","

{"title":"Antardhan","plot":"The river Padma shrinks and like many other fishermen Moyej becomes unemployed. The struggle of Rumali starts and she tries to manage a living for the family comprising an unemployed husband, a nine-year-old daughter and octogenarian mother-in-law, and a cow. The fisherman's 13-year-old daughter Nodi is friends with his neighborhood boy Akash who comes from affluent family. While playing on the river bed, they start fighting over a dyke built to regulate water flow into two small puddles. Their quarrels, although childish, are allegorical enough to remind viewers about the old controversy surrounding the Farakka barrage project. The puddles act as motif in the film.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","river","Padma","shrink","and","like","mani","other","fishermen","Moyej","becom","unemploy",".","The","struggl","of","Rumali","start","and","she","tri","to","manag","a","live","for","the","famili","compris","an","unemploy","husband",",","a","nine-year-old","daughter","and","octogenarian","mother-in-law",",","and","a","cow",".","The","fisherman","'s","13-year-old","daughter","Nodi","is","friend","with","his","neighborhood","boy","Akash","who","come","from","affluent","famili",".","While","play","on","the","river","bed",",","they","start","fight","over","a","dyke","built","to","regul","water","flow","into","two","small","puddl",".","Their","quarrel",",","although","childish",",","are","allegor","enough","to","remind","viewer","about","the","old","controversi","surround","the","Farakka","barrag","project",".","The","puddl","act","as","motif","in","the","film","."],"lemmas":["the","river","padma","shrink","and","like","many","other","fisherman","Moyej","become","unemployed",".","the","struggle","of","Rumali","start","and","she","try","to","manage","a","living","for","the","family","comprise","a","unemployed","husband",",","a","nine-year-old","daughter","and","octogenarian","mother-in-law",",","and","a","cow",".","the","fisherman","'s","13-year-old","daughter","Nodi","be","friend","with","he","neighborhood","boy","akash","who","come","from","affluent","family",".","while","play","on","the","river","bed",",","they","start","fight","over","a","dyke","build","to","regulate","water","flow","into","two","small","puddle",".","they","quarrel",",","although","childish",",","be","allegorical","enough","to","remind","viewer","about","the","old","controversy","surround","the","Farakka","barrage","project",".","the","puddle","act","as","motif","in","the","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

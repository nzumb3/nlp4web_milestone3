{"title":"The Last Word","plot":"Evan keeps to himself, almost without affect. He's 30, a former foster child, living alone, writing suicide notes for people. He attends a client's funeral and meets Charlotte, the client's sister. She pursues Evan; he's silent about his real work and invents a friendship with the brother. About the same time, Evan starts working with Abel, a new client, a composer of phone-waiting music who's depressed. Evan confides in Abel about Charlotte as she begins to draw him out. Crises await the self-contained Evan: his relationship with Charlotte is based on a lie, and his incipient friendship with Abel is headed toward suicide. Are more dead ends ahead?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Evan","keep","to","himself",",","almost","without","affect",".","He","'s","30",",","a","former","foster","child",",","live","alon",",","write","suicid","note","for","peopl",".","He","attend","a","client","'s","funer","and","meet","Charlott",",","the","client","'s","sister",".","She","pursu","Evan",";","he","'s","silent","about","his","real","work","and","invent","a","friendship","with","the","brother",".","About","the","same","time",",","Evan","start","work","with","Abel",",","a","new","client",",","a","compos","of","phone-wait","music","who","'s","depress",".","Evan","confid","in","Abel","about","Charlott","as","she","begin","to","draw","him","out",".","Crise","await","the","self-contain","Evan",":","his","relationship","with","Charlott","is","base","on","a","lie",",","and","his","incipi","friendship","with","Abel","is","head","toward","suicid",".","Are","more","dead","end","ahead","?"],"lemmas":["Evan","keep","to","himself",",","almost","without","affect",".","he","be","30",",","a","former","foster","child",",","live","alone",",","write","suicide","note","for","people",".","he","attend","a","client","'s","funeral","and","meet","Charlotte",",","the","client","'s","sister",".","she","pursue","Evan",";","he","be","silent","about","he","real","work","and","invent","a","friendship","with","the","brother",".","about","the","same","time",",","Evan","start","work","with","Abel",",","a","new","client",",","a","composer","of","phone-waiting","music","who","be","depressed",".","Evan","confide","in","Abel","about","Charlotte","as","she","begin","to","draw","he","out",".","crisis","await","the","self-contained","Evan",":","he","relationship","with","Charlotte","be","base","on","a","lie",",","and","he","incipient","friendship","with","Abel","be","head","toward","suicide",".","be","more","dead","end","ahead","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Evan keeps to","keeps to himself","to himself ,","himself , almost",", almost without","almost without affect","He 's 30","'s 30 ,","30 , a",", a former","a former foster","former foster child","foster child ,","child , living",", living alone","living alone ,","alone , writing",", writing suicide","writing suicide notes","suicide notes for","notes for people","He attends a","attends a client","a client 's","client 's funeral","'s funeral and","funeral and meets","and meets Charlotte","meets Charlotte ,","Charlotte , the",", the client","the client 's","client 's sister","She pursues Evan","pursues Evan ;","Evan ;

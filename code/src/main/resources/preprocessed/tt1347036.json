{"title":"Eves' New Year","plot":"It is New Year's Eve in Auckland, New Zealand. Eva, a Filipino worker at the SkyCity Casino, just finished her shift. She calls her family in Manila but her wheelchair-bound Kiwi husband is not happy with their growing phone bills. Eve, a Parisian working in Auckland, is trying to contact her boyfriend through a phone booth. But her sister in Paris gets into a sticky situation making her use up her prepaid phone credits. Now she needs to find another phone card to connect with her boyfriend. Yves, an English student/wannabe rock star in Auckland, receives an unexpected phone call from his sister in Switzerland. Their parents are away on holiday and she needs to run their Cafe Vivendi all by herself as the waitress called in sick. She has no idea how to run it but Yves does. Ivo, the son of a powerful Colombian drug lord, is being taught a lesson by his father to not interfere with the family \"business\" again, until it is time. He wakes up in a rundown flat in Auckland with three strangers staring at him. Eve, a happily married Kiwi housewife, died in a car accident. Her husband blames himself for the accident and lost all the willpower to live. He decides to end his life but fate steps in through a random phone call. The characters meet in their pursuit of a phone card to connect with their loved ones. Their lives intersect briefly before they carry on to welcome the New Year.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

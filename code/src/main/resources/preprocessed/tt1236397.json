{"title":"The Invisible Woman","plot":"In Rio de Janeiro, the sensitive Pedro worships his wife Marina and expects to have a conventional married life with children. His next door neighbor Vitoria, who is married with a rude detective, dreams on the romanticism of Pedro and listens to him through the wall between her kitchen and his living room. When Marina discloses to Pedro that she is pregnant of her German lover and leaves Pedro, he becomes depressed, but his best friend Carlos convinces him to have sex with many women. However Pedro has a breakdown; quits his job; and decides to stay alone. One night, the beautiful and sexy neighbor Amanda knocks on Pedro's front door and asks for a cup of sugar. They immediately fall in love for each other and Pedro recovers the meaning of his life; but Carlos discovers that Amanda exists only in Pedro's imagination and that his friend is actually disturbed. When Pedro finds the truth, he becomes confused and without sense of reality. Meanwhile Vitoria's husband dies and her sister Lucia convinces her to meet Pedro; but the guy is not sure that Vitoria does exist.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["In","Rio","de","Janeiro",",","the","sensit","Pedro","worship","his","wife","Marina","and","expect","to","have","a","convent","marri","life","with","children",".","His","next","door","neighbor","Vitoria",",","who","is","marri","with","a","rude","detect",",","dream","on","the","romantic","of","Pedro","and","listen","to","him","through","the","wall","between","her","kitchen","and","his","live","room",".","When","Marina","disclos","to","Pedro","that","she","is","pregnant","of","her","German","lover","and","leav","Pedro",",","he","becom","depress",",","but","his","best","friend","Carlo","convinc","him","to","have","sex","with","mani","women",".","Howev","Pedro","has","a","breakdown",";","quit","his","job",";","and","decid","to","stay","alon",".","One","night",",","the","beauti","and","sexi","neighbor","Amanda","knock","on","Pedro","'s","front","door","and","ask","for","a","cup","of","sugar",".","They","immedi","fall","in","love","for","each","other","and","Pedro","recov","the","mean","of","his","life",";","but","Carlo","discov","that","Amanda","exist","onli","in","Pedro","'s","imagin","and","that","his","friend","is","actual","disturb",".","When","Pedro","find","the","truth",",","he","becom","confus","and","without","sens","of","realiti",".","Meanwhil","Vitoria","'s","husband","die","and","her","sister","Lucia","convinc","her","to","meet","Pedro",";","but","the","guy","is","not","sure","that","Vitoria","doe","exist","."],"lemmas":["in","Rio","de","Janeiro",",","the","sensitive","Pedro","worship","he","wife","Marina","and","expect","to","have","a","conventional","married","life","with","child",".","he","next","door","neighbor","Vitoria",",","who","be","marry","with","a","rude","detective",",","dream","on","the","romanticism","of","Pedro","and","listen","to","he","through","the","wall","between","she","kitchen","and","he","living","room",".","when","Marina","disclose","to","Pedro","that","she","be","pregnant","of","she","german","lover","and","leave","Pedro",",","he","become","depressed",",","but","he","best","friend","Carlos","convince","he","to","have","sex","with","many","woman",".","however","Pedro","have","a","breakdown",";","quit","he","job",";","and","decide","to","stay","alone",".","one","night",",","the","beautiful","and","sexy","neighbor","Amanda","knock","on","Pedro","'s","front","door","and","ask","for","a","cup","of","sugar",".","they","immediately","fall","in","love","for","each","other","and","Pedro","recover","the","meaning","of","he","life",";","but","Carlos","discover","that","Amanda","exist","only","in","Pedro","'s","imagination","and","that","he","friend","be","actually","disturb",".","when","Pedro","find","the","truth",",","he","become","confuse","and","without","sense","of","reality",".","meanwhile","Vitoria","'s","husband","die","and","she","sister","Lucia","convince","she","to","meet","Pedro",";","but","the","guy","be","not","sure","that","Vitoria","do","exist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In Rio de","Rio de Janeiro","de Janeiro ,","Janeiro , the",", the sensitive","the sensitive Pedro","sensitive Pedro worships","Pedro worships his","worships his wife","his wife Marina","wife Marina and","Marina and expects","and expects to","expects to have","to have a","have a conventional","a conventional married","conventional married life","married life with","life with children","His next door","next door neighbor","door neighbor Vitoria","neighbor Vitoria ,","Vitoria , who",", who is","who is married","is married with","married with a","with a rude","a rude detective","rude detective ,","detective , dreams",", dreams on","dreams on the","on the romanticism","the romanticism of","romanticism of Pedro","of Pedro and","Pedro and listens","and listens to","listens to him","to him through","him through the","through the wall","the wall between","wall between her","between her kitchen","her kitchen and","kitchen and his","and his living","his living room","When Marina discloses","Marina discloses to","discloses to Pedro","to Pedro that","Pedro that she","that she is","she is pregnant","is pregnant of","pregnant of her","of her German","her German lover","German lover and","lover and leaves","and leaves Pedro","leaves Pedro ,","Pedro , he",", he becomes","he becomes depressed","becomes depressed ,","depressed , but",", but his","but his best","his best friend","best friend Carlos","friend Carlos convinces","Carlos convinces him","convinces him to","him to have","to have sex","have sex with","sex with many","with many women","However Pedro has","Pedro has a","has a breakdown","a breakdown ;","breakdown ;

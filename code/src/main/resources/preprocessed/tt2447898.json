{"title":"George 2012","plot":"George 2012 is a globe-hopping (Indonesia, India, Peru) existential tragicomedy about one man's self-imposed quest to save humankind from an extinction event expected by the end of 2012. The film follows the survivalist quest of the 54-year-old surfer George, who gives his first name because of the secrecy around his preparations for the impending end of the world. Behind the facade of a wise and ascetic spiritualist chosen to make the renewed world a better place, a disillusioned and aging traveler burns bridges in pursuit of fulfilled life and proper love. Will he trade Balinese paradise for high altitude sickness and a diet of boiled potatoes? Will he finish the 'open bunker'? This is a vérité work with a feel of a narrative feature film.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary","

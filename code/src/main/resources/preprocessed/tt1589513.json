{"title":"WWW.","plot":"Under one common Internet happen several stories that take place in cities across the world. They are stories of love, heartbreak, friendship, personal growth, sex, crime, espionage, political, seemingly unrelated, have something in common: the loneliness of its characters, and little by little by chance will converge together. Among our heroes, some living their own reality, usually reduced to parallel universe that provides exclusive Internet, while others opt for fantasizing, perhaps to feel free and made, perhaps to give vent to his personal ghosts. Both sides seem convinced that the virtual world of cyberspace is the new home of the mind, where governments cannot exercise its sovereignty, and they can exist and express themselves freely. In cyberspace, everything is possible.","genres":["Crime"," Mystery","

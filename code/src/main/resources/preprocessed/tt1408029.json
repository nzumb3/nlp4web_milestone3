{"title":"Krantiveer: The Revolution","plot":"Afraid of traveling in trains due to bomb blasts, outspoken critic of corruption in modern secular India, Roshni, the daughter of activist, Pratap Narayan Tilak, gets hired with Live India as a news reporter and decides to expose corruption - especially at the hands of two politicians, P.P. Patankar and Chita Singh. The latter invites her and Vishal Singh Rathod to meet him and warns the duo that they will meet the same fate as their parents if they even dare to mention their names on TV. The politicians then conceive a novel scheme - not the age-old method of religious and sectarian violence - but of modern day terrorism - that will not only ensure their political future but also distract attention from themselves.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Afraid","of","travel","in","train","due","to","bomb","blast",",","outspoken","critic","of","corrupt","in","modern","secular","India",",","Roshni",",","the","daughter","of","activist",",","Pratap","Narayan","Tilak",",","get","hire","with","Live","India","as","a","news","report","and","decid","to","expos","corrupt","-","especi","at","the","hand","of","two","politician",",","P.P.","Patankar","and","Chita","Singh",".","The","latter","invit","her","and","Vishal","Singh","Rathod","to","meet","him","and","warn","the","duo","that","they","will","meet","the","same","fate","as","their","parent","if","they","even","dare","to","mention","their","name","on","TV",".","The","politician","then","conceiv","a","novel","scheme","-","not","the","age-old","method","of","religi","and","sectarian","violenc","-","but","of","modern","day","terror","-","that","will","not","onli","ensur","their","polit","futur","but","also","distract","attent","from","themselv","."],"lemmas":["afraid","of","travel","in","train","due","to","bomb","blast",",","outspoken","critic","of","corruption","in","modern","secular","India",",","Roshni",",","the","daughter","of","activist",",","Pratap","Narayan","Tilak",",","get","hire","with","Live","India","as","a","news","reporter","and","decide","to","expose","corruption","-","especially","at","the","hand","of","two","politician",",","P.P.","Patankar","and","Chita","Singh",".","the","latter","invite","she","and","Vishal","Singh","Rathod","to","meet","he","and","warn","the","duo","that","they","will","meet","the","same","fate","as","they","parent","if","they","even","dare","to","mention","they","name","on","tv",".","the","politician","then","conceive","a","novel","scheme","-","not","the","age-old","method","of","religious","and","sectarian","violence","-","but","of","modern","day","terrorism","-","that","will","not","only","ensure","they","political","future","but","also","distract","attention","from","themselves","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Afraid of traveling","of traveling in","traveling in trains","in trains due","trains due to","due to bomb","to bomb blasts","bomb blasts ,","blasts , outspoken",", outspoken critic","outspoken critic of","critic of corruption","of corruption in","corruption in modern","in modern secular","modern secular India","secular India ,","India , Roshni",", Roshni ,","Roshni , the",", the daughter","the daughter of","daughter of activist","of activist ,","activist , Pratap",", Pratap Narayan","Pratap Narayan Tilak","Narayan Tilak ,","Tilak , gets",", gets hired","gets hired with","hired with Live","with Live India","Live India as","India as a","as a news","a news reporter","news reporter and","reporter and decides","and decides to","decides to expose","to expose corruption","expose corruption -","corruption - especially","- especially at","especially at the","at the hands","the hands of","hands of two","of two politicians","two politicians ,","politicians , P.P.",", P.P.

{"title":"Chicken","plot":"RICHARD, 15 with learning difficulties, longs to put down roots but his restless and destructive brother, POLLY, needs to keep moving. When the land they live on is bought by a new landowner, and the electricity supply to their caravan is cut, their already precarious living conditions get even worse. Then a chance meeting with the new landowner's daughter, 17 year old ANNABEL (Yasmin Paige), leaves RICHARD besotted; whilst POLLY befriends the guys who run a seedy traveling fair. Richards optimistic view on life becomes increasingly difficult to maintain as Polly's abusive behavior worsens, family secrets are revealed, and he is torn between loyalty to his brother and his first true friend in ANNABEL. For better or worse, Richards life is about to change forever.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["RICHARD",",","15","with","learn","difficulti",",","long","to","put","down","root","but","his","restless","and","destruct","brother",",","POLLi",",","need","to","keep","move",".","When","the","land","they","live","on","is","bought","by","a","new","landown",",","and","the","electr","suppli","to","their","caravan","is","cut",",","their","alreadi","precari","live","condit","get","even","wors",".","Then","a","chanc","meet","with","the","new","landown","'s","daughter",",","17","year","old","ANNABEL","(","Yasmin","Paig",")",",","leav","RICHARD","besot",";","whilst","POLLi","befriend","the","guy","who","run","a","seedi","travel","fair",".","Richard","optimist","view","on","life","becom","increas","difficult","to","maintain","as","Polli","'s","abus","behavior","worsen",",","famili","secret","are","reveal",",","and","he","is","torn","between","loyalti","to","his","brother","and","his","first","true","friend","in","ANNABEL",".","For","better","or","wors",",","Richard","life","is","about","to","chang","forev","."],"lemmas":["RICHARD",",","15","with","learn","difficulty",",","long","to","put","down","root","but","he","restless","and","destructive","brother",",","polly",",","need","to","keep","move",".","when","the","land","they","live","on","be","buy","by","a","new","landowner",",","and","the","electricity","supply","to","they","caravan","be","cut",",","they","already","precarious","living","condition","get","even","worse",".","then","a","chance","meeting","with","the","new","landowner","'s","daughter",",","17","year","old","ANNABEL","-lrb-","Yasmin","Paige","-rrb-",",","leave","RICHARD","besot",";","whilst","polly","befriend","the","guy","who","run","a","seedy","travel","fair",".","Richards","optimistic","view","on","life","become","increasingly","difficult","to","maintain","as","Polly","'s","abusive","behavior","worsen",",","family","secret","be","reveal",",","and","he","be","tear","between","loyalty","to","he","brother","and","he","first","true","friend","in","ANNABEL",".","for","better","or","worse",",","Richards","life","be","about","to","change","forever","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["RICHARD , 15",", 15 with","15 with learning","with learning difficulties","learning difficulties ,","difficulties , longs",", longs to","longs to put","to put down","put down roots","down roots but","roots but his","but his restless","his restless and","restless and destructive","and destructive brother","destructive brother ,","brother , POLLY",", POLLY ,","POLLY , needs",", needs to","needs to keep","to keep moving","When the land","the land they","land they live","they live on","live on is","on is bought","is bought by","bought by a","by a new","a new landowner","new landowner ,","landowner , and",", and the","and the electricity","the electricity supply","electricity supply to","supply to their","to their caravan","their caravan is","caravan is cut","is cut ,","cut , their",", their already","their already precarious","already precarious living","precarious living conditions","living conditions get","conditions get even","get even worse","Then a chance","a chance meeting","chance meeting with","meeting with the","with the new","the new landowner","new landowner 's","landowner 's daughter","'s daughter ,","daughter , 17",", 17 year","17 year old","year old ANNABEL","old ANNABEL (","ANNABEL ( Yasmin","( Yasmin Paige","Yasmin Paige )","Paige ) ,",") , leaves",", leaves RICHARD","leaves RICHARD besotted","RICHARD besotted ;","besotted ;

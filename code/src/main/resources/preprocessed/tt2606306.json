{"title":"Milk Mustache","plot":"The film follows five orphan brothers (all cast by real-life biological siblings) who struggle to survive together in a desolate Appalachian community riddled with economic stress. Over the course of one summer, they each make a personal journey of their own, whether it be catching a legendary fish that resides in the lake or committing various crimes about the town to support the family. Their endeavors later lead to rifts in their relationships, and in turn, become testaments to the strength of brotherhood.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["The","film","follow","five","orphan","brother","(","all","cast","by","real-lif","biolog","sibl",")","who","struggl","to","surviv","togeth","in","a","desol","Appalachian","communiti","riddl","with","econom","stress",".","Over","the","cours","of","one","summer",",","they","each","make","a","person","journey","of","their","own",",","whether","it","be","catch","a","legendari","fish","that","resid","in","the","lake","or","commit","various","crime","about","the","town","to","support","the","famili",".","Their","endeavor","later","lead","to","rift","in","their","relationship",",","and","in","turn",",","becom","testament","to","the","strength","of","brotherhood","."],"lemmas":["the","film","follow","five","orphan","brother","-lrb-","all","cast","by","real-life","biological","sibling","-rrb-","who","struggle","to","survive","together","in","a","desolate","Appalachian","community","riddled","with","economic","stress",".","over","the","course","of","one","summer",",","they","each","make","a","personal","journey","of","they","own",",","whether","it","be","catch","a","legendary","fish","that","reside","in","the","lake","or","commit","various","crime","about","the","town","to","support","the","family",".","they","endeavor","later","lead","to","rift","in","they","relationship",",","and","in","turn",",","become","testament","to","the","strength","of","brotherhood","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The film follows","film follows five","follows five orphan","five orphan brothers","orphan brothers (","brothers ( all","( all cast","all cast by","cast by real-life","by real-life biological","real-life biological siblings","biological siblings )","siblings ) who",") who struggle","who struggle to","struggle to survive","to survive together","survive together in","together in a","in a desolate","a desolate Appalachian","desolate Appalachian community","Appalachian community riddled","community riddled with","riddled with economic","with economic stress","Over the course","the course of","course of one","of one summer","one summer ,","summer , they",", they each","they each make","each make a","make a personal","a personal journey","personal journey of","journey of their","of their own","their own ,","own , whether",", whether it","whether it be","it be catching","be catching a","catching a legendary","a legendary fish","legendary fish that","fish that resides","that resides in","resides in the","in the lake","the lake or","lake or committing","or committing various","committing various crimes","various crimes about","crimes about the","about the town","the town to","town to support","to support the","support the family","Their endeavors later","endeavors later lead","later lead to","lead to rifts","to rifts in","rifts in their","in their relationships","their relationships ,","relationships , and",", and in","and in turn","in turn ,","turn , become",", become testaments","become testaments to","testaments to the","to the strength","the strength of","strength of brotherhood"],"2grams":["The film","film follows","follows five","five orphan","orphan brothers","brothers (","( all","all cast","cast by","by real-life","real-life biological","biological siblings","siblings )",") who","who struggle","struggle to","to survive","survive together","together in","in a","a desolate","desolate Appalachian","Appalachian community","community riddled","riddled with","with economic","economic stress","Over the","the course","course of","of one","one summer","summer ,",", they","they each","each make","make a","a personal","personal journey","journey of","of their","their own","own ,",", whether","whether it","it be","be catching","catching a","a legendary","legendary fish","fish that","that resides","resides in","in the","the lake","lake or","or committing","committing various","various crimes","crimes about","about the","the town","town to","to support","support the","the family","Their endeavors","endeavors later","later lead","lead to","to rifts","rifts in","in their","their relationships","relationships ,",", and","and in","in turn","turn ,",", become","become testaments","testaments to","to the","the strength","strength of","of brotherhood"]}

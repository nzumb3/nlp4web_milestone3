{"title":"The Incomplete","plot":"\"Can you describe yourself?\" \"Odenwald-Gay... or Gollum... or Klaus! 60 years old... gay... slave!\" A documentary portrait of Klaus Johannes Wolf, who decided to live as a slave. Chained to his bed, he talks about his decision to be a slave, his parents and what it means to be naked. Finally he leaves everything behind to go to a slave camp, to put the finishing touches on his slave's life and become the perfect servant. Director's statement To be a slave in modern society is very similar to being a documentarian. It's about trying to attain the greatest possible freedom within your own set limits.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Can","you","describ","yourself","?","\"","\"","Odenwald-Gay","...","or","Gollum","...","or","Klaus","!","60","year","old","...","gay","...","slave","!","\"","A","documentari","portrait","of","Klaus","Johann","Wolf",",","who","decid","to","live","as","a","slave",".","Chain","to","his","bed",",","he","talk","about","his","decis","to","be","a","slave",",","his","parent","and","what","it","mean","to","be","nake",".","Final","he","leav","everyth","behind","to","go","to","a","slave","camp",",","to","put","the","finish","touch","on","his","slave","'s","life","and","becom","the","perfect","servant",".","Director","'s","statement","To","be","a","slave","in","modern","societi","is","veri","similar","to","be","a","documentarian",".","It","'s","about","tri","to","attain","the","greatest","possibl","freedom","within","your","own","set","limit","."],"lemmas":["``","can","you","describe","yourself","?","''","``","Odenwald-Gay","...","or","Gollum","...","or","Klaus","!","60","year","old","...","gay","...","slave","!","''","a","documentary","portrait","of","Klaus","Johannes","Wolf",",","who","decide","to","live","as","a","slave",".","chain","to","he","bed",",","he","talk","about","he","decision","to","be","a","slave",",","he","parent","and","what","it","mean","to","be","naked",".","finally","he","leave","everything","behind","to","go","to","a","slave","camp",",","to","put","the","finishing","touch","on","he","slave","'s","life","and","become","the","perfect","servant",".","Director","'s","statement","to","be","a","slave","in","modern","society","be","very","similar","to","be","a","documentarian",".","it","be","about","try","to","attain","the","greatest","possible","freedom","within","you","own","set","limit","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Can you","Can you describe","you describe yourself","describe yourself ?","yourself ?

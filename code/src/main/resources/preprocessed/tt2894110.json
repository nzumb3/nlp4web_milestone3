{"title":"Manapanmirr, in Christmas Spirit","plot":"Yolngu Christmas rituals start in October when the first wolma thunder clouds form, heralding the coming wet season. As the distant rumbling triggers memories of lost loved ones, quiet tears start to flow. So begins a season in which stories brought by missionaries in the mid 20th century provide the basis for a celebration of the cycling transformations of life, death and rebirth - and for claiming the enduring place of the ancestral in the contemporary world. Manapanmirr means being joined or brought together. In this film, what begins as an experiment with using digital media to 'connect cultures through feeling' as director Paul Gurrumuruwuy put it becomes through the very process of image-making a catalyst for vision, innovation and connection for Yolngu themselves.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["Yolngu","Christma","ritual","start","in","October","when","the","first","wolma","thunder","cloud","form",",","herald","the","come","wet","season",".","As","the","distant","rumbl","trigger","memori","of","lost","love","one",",","quiet","tear","start","to","flow",".","So","begin","a","season","in","which","stori","brought","by","missionari","in","the","mid","20th","centuri","provid","the","basi","for","a","celebr","of","the","cycl","transform","of","life",",","death","and","rebirth","-","and","for","claim","the","endur","place","of","the","ancestr","in","the","contemporari","world",".","Manapanmirr","mean","be","join","or","brought","togeth",".","In","this","film",",","what","begin","as","an","experi","with","use","digit","media","to","'","connect","cultur","through","feel","'","as","director","Paul","Gurrumuruwuy","put","it","becom","through","the","veri","process","of","image-mak","a","catalyst","for","vision",",","innov","and","connect","for","Yolngu","themselv","."],"lemmas":["Yolngu","Christmas","ritual","start","in","October","when","the","first","wolma","thunder","cloud","form",",","herald","the","come","wet","season",".","as","the","distant","rumble","trigger","memory","of","lost","love","one",",","quiet","tear","start","to","flow",".","so","begin","a","season","in","which","story","bring","by","missionary","in","the","mid","20th","century","provide","the","basis","for","a","celebration","of","the","cycling","transformation","of","life",",","death","and","rebirth","-","and","for","claim","the","endure","place","of","the","ancestral","in","the","contemporary","world",".","Manapanmirr","mean","be","join","or","bring","together",".","in","this","film",",","what","begin","as","a","experiment","with","use","digital","media","to","'","connect","culture","through","feeling","'","as","director","Paul","Gurrumuruwuy","put","it","become","through","the","very","process","of","image-making","a","catalyst","for","vision",",","innovation","and","connection","for","Yolngu","themselves","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Yolngu Christmas rituals","Christmas rituals start","rituals start in","start in October","in October when","October when the","when the first","the first wolma","first wolma thunder","wolma thunder clouds","thunder clouds form","clouds form ,","form , heralding",", heralding the","heralding the coming","the coming wet","coming wet season","As the distant","the distant rumbling","distant rumbling triggers","rumbling triggers memories","triggers memories of","memories of lost","of lost loved","lost loved ones","loved ones ,","ones , quiet",", quiet tears","quiet tears start","tears start to","start to flow","So begins a","begins a season","a season in","season in which","in which stories","which stories brought","stories brought by","brought by missionaries","by missionaries in","missionaries in the","in the mid","the mid 20th","mid 20th century","20th century provide","century provide the","provide the basis","the basis for","basis for a","for a celebration","a celebration of","celebration of the","of the cycling","the cycling transformations","cycling transformations of","transformations of life","of life ,","life , death",", death and","death and rebirth","and rebirth -","rebirth -

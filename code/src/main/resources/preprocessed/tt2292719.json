{"title":"Hello JaiHind","plot":"The Marathi feature film 'Hello Jai Hind' attempts to picturise the transformation that has taken place in the life of a police constable in the aftermath of the devastatingly heinous terrorist attack on Mumbai. 'Durga' (Ms. Trupti Bhoir) is but a commoner girl from a Marathi middle-class family. She surrenders before the verdict of destiny and wholeheartedly accepts the turn fate has given to her life when she is forced to marry a man she has not liked. Her ordinary husband, Shivaji Pawar (Mr. Nitin Desai), is an erstwhile simple police constable. However, he once commits an unmatched and supreme act of courage and is felicitated with a medal for his bravery. While everything else was passing on smoothly, came that day of thunderbolt, 26/11, arousing the courageous spirit hidden in Shivaji's character. Shivaji Pawar faced this fracas with all his strength but soon lost the very faith in living this, erstwhile respect-worthy, life. He continued to live the saddening saga of his life with the same suffocating memories of frustration and agony but one day this bubble of depression burst into a raging volcano. Shivaji gets charged with a single thought that arouses his mettle and he takes one unbelievably extra-ordinary step. Durga injects the necessary strength in her husband's willful act and stands behind him with her Himalayan support. No wonder, 'Hello Jai Hind' is essentially a film that acquaints the ordinary with their extra-ordinary ability to face head-on, be ruthless and devastate the challenges life poses before them.","genres":["Action","

{"title":"The Judge and the General","plot":"When in 1998 Chilean judge Juan Guzmán was assigned the first criminal cases against the country's ex-dictator, General Augusto Pinochet, no one expected much. Guzmán had supported Pinochet's 1973 coup against the democratically elected president, Salvador Allende, and had worked as a judge during Pinochet's dictatorship. The filmmakers trace Guzmán descent into what he calls \"the abyss,\" where he uncovers the past - including his own role in the tragedy.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["When","in","1998","Chilean","judg","Juan","Guzmán","was","assign","the","first","crimin","case","against","the","countri","'s","ex-dict",",","Gener","Augusto","Pinochet",",","no","one","expect","much",".","Guzmán","had","support","Pinochet","'s","1973","coup","against","the","democrat","elect","presid",",","Salvador","Allend",",","and","had","work","as","a","judg","dure","Pinochet","'s","dictatorship",".","The","filmmak","trace","Guzmán","descent","into","what","he","call","\"","the","abyss",",","\"","where","he","uncov","the","past","-","includ","his","own","role","in","the","tragedi","."],"lemmas":["when","in","1998","chilean","judge","Juan","Guzmán","be","assign","the","first","criminal","case","against","the","country","'s","ex-dictator",",","General","Augusto","Pinochet",",","no","one","expect","much",".","Guzmán","have","support","Pinochet","'s","1973","coup","against","the","democratically","elect","president",",","Salvador","Allende",",","and","have","work","as","a","judge","during","Pinochet","'s","dictatorship",".","the","filmmaker","trace","Guzmán","descent","into","what","he","call","``","the","abyss",",","''","where","he","uncover","the","past","-","include","he","own","role","in","the","tragedy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When in 1998","in 1998 Chilean","1998 Chilean judge","Chilean judge Juan","judge Juan Guzmán","Juan Guzmán was","Guzmán was assigned","was assigned the","assigned the first","the first criminal","first criminal cases","criminal cases against","cases against the","against the country","the country 's","country 's ex-dictator","'s ex-dictator ,","ex-dictator , General",", General Augusto","General Augusto Pinochet","Augusto Pinochet ,","Pinochet , no",", no one","no one expected","one expected much","Guzmán had supported","had supported Pinochet","supported Pinochet 's","Pinochet 's 1973","'s 1973 coup","1973 coup against","coup against the","against the democratically","the democratically elected","democratically elected president","elected president ,","president , Salvador",", Salvador Allende","Salvador Allende ,","Allende , and",", and had","and had worked","had worked as","worked as a","as a judge","a judge during","judge during Pinochet","during Pinochet 's","Pinochet 's dictatorship","The filmmakers trace","filmmakers trace Guzmán","trace Guzmán descent","Guzmán descent into","descent into what","into what he","what he calls","he calls \"","calls \" the","\" the abyss","the abyss ,","abyss , \"",", \" where","\" where he","where he uncovers","he uncovers the","uncovers the past","the past -","past - including","- including his","including his own","his own role","own role in","role in the","in the tragedy"],"2grams":["When in","in 1998","1998 Chilean","Chilean judge","judge Juan","Juan Guzmán","Guzmán was","was assigned","assigned the","the first","first criminal","criminal cases","cases against","against the","the country","country 's","'s ex-dictator","ex-dictator ,",", General","General Augusto","Augusto Pinochet","Pinochet ,",", no","no one","one expected","expected much","Guzmán had","had supported","supported Pinochet","Pinochet 's","'s 1973","1973 coup","coup against","against the","the democratically","democratically elected","elected president","president ,",", Salvador","Salvador Allende","Allende ,",", and","and had","had worked","worked as","as a","a judge","judge during","during Pinochet","Pinochet 's","'s dictatorship","The filmmakers","filmmakers trace","trace Guzmán","Guzmán descent","descent into","into what","what he","he calls","calls \"","\" the","the abyss","abyss ,",", \"","\" where","where he","he uncovers","uncovers the","the past","past -","- including","including his","his own","own role","role in","in the","the tragedy"]}

{"title":"Sheeps Clothing","plot":"Detective Michael Sikes is a dead beat cop on the ragged edge. Through a random turn of events he is assigned to investigate the brutal murder of a female police officer. As Michael and his newly assigned partner track the killer, bodies begin to pile up which appear to be random except that each has the number 44 carved into their back. It's a race against time as Detective Sikes uncovers and conceals clues of the case to hide his secret addiction and connection to each of the victims. The Line between Cops and Killers begin to blur as all roads lead to the Wolf in Sheep's Clothing.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["Detect","Michael","Sike","is","a","dead","beat","cop","on","the","rag","edg",".","Through","a","random","turn","of","event","he","is","assign","to","investig","the","brutal","murder","of","a","femal","polic","offic",".","As","Michael","and","his","newli","assign","partner","track","the","killer",",","bodi","begin","to","pile","up","which","appear","to","be","random","except","that","each","has","the","number","44","carv","into","their","back",".","It","'s","a","race","against","time","as","Detect","Sike","uncov","and","conceal","clue","of","the","case","to","hide","his","secret","addict","and","connect","to","each","of","the","victim",".","The","Line","between","Cop","and","Killer","begin","to","blur","as","all","road","lead","to","the","Wolf","in","Sheep","'s","Cloth","."],"lemmas":["Detective","Michael","Sikes","be","a","dead","beat","cop","on","the","ragged","edge",".","through","a","random","turn","of","event","he","be","assign","to","investigate","the","brutal","murder","of","a","female","police","officer",".","as","Michael","and","he","newly","assign","partner","track","the","killer",",","body","begin","to","pile","up","which","appear","to","be","random","except","that","each","have","the","number","44","carve","into","they","back",".","it","be","a","race","against","time","as","Detective","Sikes","uncover","and","conceal","clue","of","the","case","to","hide","he","secret","addiction","and","connection","to","each","of","the","victim",".","the","Line","between","Cops","and","Killers","begin","to","blur","as","all","road","lead","to","the","Wolf","in","Sheep","'s","Clothing","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Detective Michael Sikes","Michael Sikes is","Sikes is a","is a dead","a dead beat","dead beat cop","beat cop on","cop on the","on the ragged","the ragged edge","Through a random","a random turn","random turn of","turn of events","of events he","events he is","he is assigned","is assigned to","assigned to investigate","to investigate the","investigate the brutal","the brutal murder","brutal murder of","murder of a","of a female","a female police","female police officer","As Michael and","Michael and his","and his newly","his newly assigned","newly assigned partner","assigned partner track","partner track the","track the killer","the killer ,","killer , bodies",", bodies begin","bodies begin to","begin to pile","to pile up","pile up which","up which appear","which appear to","appear to be","to be random","be random except","random except that","except that each","that each has","each has the","has the number","the number 44","number 44 carved","44 carved into","carved into their","into their back","It 's a","'s a race","a race against","race against time","against time as","time as Detective","as Detective Sikes","Detective Sikes uncovers","Sikes uncovers and","uncovers and conceals","and conceals clues","conceals clues of","clues of the","of the case","the case to","case to hide","to hide his","hide his secret","his secret addiction","secret addiction and","addiction and connection","and connection to","connection to each","to each of","each of the","of the victims","The Line between","Line between Cops","between Cops and","Cops and Killers","and Killers begin","Killers begin to","begin to blur","to blur as","blur as all","as all roads","all roads lead","roads lead to","lead to the","to the Wolf","the Wolf in","Wolf in Sheep","in Sheep 's","Sheep 's Clothing"],"2grams":["Detective Michael","Michael Sikes","Sikes is","is a","a dead","dead beat","beat cop","cop on","on the","the ragged","ragged edge","Through a","a random","random turn","turn of","of events","events he","he is","is assigned","assigned to","to investigate","investigate the","the brutal","brutal murder","murder of","of a","a female","female police","police officer","As Michael","Michael and","and his","his newly","newly assigned","assigned partner","partner track","track the","the killer","killer ,",", bodies","bodies begin","begin to","to pile","pile up","up which","which appear","appear to","to be","be random","random except","except that","that each","each has","has the","the number","number 44","44 carved","carved into","into their","their back","It 's","'s a","a race","race against","against time","time as","as Detective","Detective Sikes","Sikes uncovers","uncovers and","and conceals","conceals clues","clues of","of the","the case","case to","to hide","hide his","his secret","secret addiction","addiction and","and connection","connection to","to each","each of","of the","the victims","The Line","Line between","between Cops","Cops and","and Killers","Killers begin","begin to","to blur","blur as","as all","all roads","roads lead","lead to","to the","the Wolf","Wolf in","in Sheep","Sheep 's","'s Clothing"]}

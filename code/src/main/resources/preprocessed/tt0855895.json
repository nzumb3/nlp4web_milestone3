{"title":"Private Property","plot":"Since Luc granted a divorce to Pascale ten years ago, he paid generous alimony and left a fine country house as long as their twin sons remain at home. Pascale always acted as if she was the provider and head of the household, even now the inseparable brothers are twenty. But she started a secret affair with Flemish neighbor, cook Jan, whose ambition is to start a restaurant and B&B with her. As the boys learn she wants to cancel her job and sell the house for the project, college-man Thierry, who has a steady girl Anne, naturally refuses to let her spend dad's money meant for them. Gentler François, content to remain a handyman, would consider letting her and maybe working in the 'family business'. This causes trouble, even after Pascale moves out to Gerda's indefinitely, leading to tragedy.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Sinc","Luc","grant","a","divorc","to","Pascal","ten","year","ago",",","he","paid","generous","alimoni","and","left","a","fine","countri","hous","as","long","as","their","twin","son","remain","at","home",".","Pascal","alway","act","as","if","she","was","the","provid","and","head","of","the","household",",","even","now","the","insepar","brother","are","twenti",".","But","she","start","a","secret","affair","with","Flemish","neighbor",",","cook","Jan",",","whose","ambit","is","to","start","a","restaur","and","B&B","with","her",".","As","the","boy","learn","she","want","to","cancel","her","job","and","sell","the","hous","for","the","project",",","college-man","Thierri",",","who","has","a","steadi","girl","Anne",",","natur","refus","to","let","her","spend","dad","'s","money","meant","for","them",".","Gentler","Françoi",",","content","to","remain","a","handyman",",","would","consid","let","her","and","mayb","work","in","the","'","famili","busi","'",".","This","caus","troubl",",","even","after","Pascal","move","out","to","Gerda","'s","indefinit",",","lead","to","tragedi","."],"lemmas":["since","luc","grant","a","divorce","to","Pascale","ten","year","ago",",","he","pay","generous","alimony","and","leave","a","fine","country","house","as","long","as","they","twin","son","remain","at","home",".","Pascale","always","act","as","if","she","be","the","provider","and","head","of","the","household",",","even","now","the","inseparable","brother","be","twenty",".","but","she","start","a","secret","affair","with","flemish","neighbor",",","cook","Jan",",","whose","ambition","be","to","start","a","restaurant","and","b&b","with","she",".","as","the","boy","learn","she","want","to","cancel","she","job","and","sell","the","house","for","the","project",",","college-man","Thierry",",","who","have","a","steady","girl","Anne",",","naturally","refuse","to","let","she","spend","dad","'s","money","mean","for","they",".","Gentler","François",",","content","to","remain","a","handyman",",","would","consider","let","she","and","maybe","work","in","the","'","family","business","'",".","this","cause","trouble",",","even","after","Pascale","move","out","to","Gerda","'s","indefinitely",",","lead","to","tragedy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Since

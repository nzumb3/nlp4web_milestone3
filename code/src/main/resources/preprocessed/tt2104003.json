{"title":"Changing Keys: Billy McLaughlin and the Mysteries of Dystonia","plot":"Minneapolis native Billy McLaughlin astounded audiences with his innovative guitar technique and composing style. In the late 1990s he began to lose control of his hand and arm and was soon unable to play his own music. Many thought his career was over when he was diagnosed with focal dystonia, an incurable neuromuscular disorder. Billy had other ideas: He began the arduous task of retraining himself to play left-handed, one note at a time. Suzanne Jurva followed McLaughlin during these years. Through her eyes, we witness his miraculous and inspiring story.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Minneapoli","nativ","Billi","McLaughlin","astound","audienc","with","his","innov","guitar","techniqu","and","compos","style",".","In","the","late","1990s","he","began","to","lose","control","of","his","hand","and","arm","and","was","soon","unabl","to","play","his","own","music",".","Mani","thought","his","career","was","over","when","he","was","diagnos","with","focal","dystonia",",","an","incur","neuromuscular","disord",".","Billi","had","other","idea",":","He","began","the","arduous","task","of","retrain","himself","to","play","left-hand",",","one","note","at","a","time",".","Suzann","Jurva","follow","McLaughlin","dure","these","year",".","Through","her","eye",",","we","wit","his","miracul","and","inspir","stori","."],"lemmas":["Minneapolis","native","Billy","McLaughlin","astounded","audience","with","he","innovative","guitar","technique","and","compose","style",".","in","the","late","1990","he","begin","to","lose","control","of","he","hand","and","arm","and","be","soon","unable","to","play","he","own","music",".","many","think","he","career","be","over","when","he","be","diagnose","with","focal","dystonia",",","a","incurable","neuromuscular","disorder",".","Billy","have","other","idea",":","he","begin","the","arduous","task","of","retrain","himself","to","play","left-handed",",","one","note","at","a","time",".","Suzanne","Jurva","follow","McLaughlin","during","these","year",".","through","she","eye",",","we","witness","he","miraculous","and","inspiring","story","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Minneapolis native Billy","native Billy McLaughlin","Billy McLaughlin astounded","McLaughlin astounded audiences","astounded audiences with","audiences with his","with his innovative","his innovative guitar","innovative guitar technique","guitar technique and","technique and composing","and composing style","In the late","the late 1990s","late 1990s he","1990s he began","he began to","began to lose","to lose control","lose control of","control of his","of his hand","his hand and","hand and arm","and arm and","arm and was","and was soon","was soon unable","soon unable to","unable to play","to play his","play his own","his own music","Many thought his","thought his career","his career was","career was over","was over when","over when he","when he was","he was diagnosed","was diagnosed with","diagnosed with focal","with focal dystonia","focal dystonia ,","dystonia , an",", an incurable","an incurable neuromuscular","incurable neuromuscular disorder","Billy had other","had other ideas","other ideas :","ideas : He",": He began","He began the","began the arduous","the arduous task","arduous task of","task of retraining","of retraining himself","retraining himself to","himself to play","to play left-handed","play left-handed ,","left-handed , one",", one note","one note at","note at a","at a time","Suzanne Jurva followed","Jurva followed McLaughlin","followed McLaughlin during","McLaughlin during these","during these years","Through her eyes","her eyes ,","eyes , we",", we witness","we witness his","witness his miraculous","his miraculous and","miraculous and inspiring","and inspiring story"],"2grams":["Minneapolis native","native Billy","Billy McLaughlin","McLaughlin astounded","astounded audiences","audiences with","with his","his innovative","innovative guitar","guitar technique","technique and","and composing","composing style","In the","the late","late 1990s","1990s he","he began","began to","to lose","lose control","control of","of his","his hand","hand and","and arm","arm and","and was","was soon","soon unable","unable to","to play","play his","his own","own music","Many thought","thought his","his career","career was","was over","over when","when he","he was","was diagnosed","diagnosed with","with focal","focal dystonia","dystonia ,",", an","an incurable","incurable neuromuscular","neuromuscular disorder","Billy had","had other","other ideas","ideas :",": He","He began","began the","the arduous","arduous task","task of","of retraining","retraining himself","himself to","to play","play left-handed","left-handed ,",", one","one note","note at","at a","a time","Suzanne Jurva","Jurva followed","followed McLaughlin","McLaughlin during","during these","these years","Through her","her eyes","eyes ,",", we","we witness","witness his","his miraculous","miraculous and","and inspiring","inspiring story"]}

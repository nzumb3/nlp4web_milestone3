{"title":"Pizza! The Movie","plot":"The U.S. Pizza Team? Acrobatic dough tossing? The World Pizza Championship in Italy? You might not believe what you see. Drama, controversy, and hilarity abound as uniquely talented and passionate pizza makers battle it out as they attempt to go for the gold against their international counterparts. Their quest is followed while exploring the pizza industry. The amazing and highly competitive world of acrobatic pizza-dough tossing is examined as competitors vie for spots on the U.S. Pizza Team and the chance to compete for the gold medal at the World Pizza Championship in Italy where teams perform choreographed dough-tossing routines to music while being scored by a panel of judges. Along the way, the pizza industry's two rival magazines clash as former members of the U.S. Pizza Team clandestinely form their own splinter team, and then jump ship from one magazine's pizza team to the other, bringing the industry's spotlight of publicity with them. While these determined pizza acrobats battle through a scandal- and controversy-ridden preliminary dough-tossing competition in New York City, the vast and colorful world of the pizza industry is explored. Segments on regional pizza styles throughout the country include legendary New York City pizzerias, Chicago deep dish, and California gourmet pizza. Trade shows, drivers trying to unionize, pizza delivered by airplane and in electric cars, as well as the history of pizza are all woven throughout the compelling story, which culminates at the annual \"Super Bowl,\" the World Pizza Championship in Italy.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","U.S.","Pizza","Team","?","Acrobat","dough","toss","?","The","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Itali","?","You","might","not","believ","what","you","see",".","Drama",",","controversi",",","and","hilar","abound","as","uniqu","talent","and","passion","pizza","maker","battl","it","out","as","they","attempt","to","go","for","the","gold","against","their","intern","counterpart",".","Their","quest","is","follow","while","explor","the","pizza","industri",".","The","amaz","and","high","competit","world","of","acrobat","pizza-dough","toss","is","examin","as","competitor","vie","for","spot","on","the","U.S.","Pizza","Team","and","the","chanc","to","compet","for","the","gold","medal","at","the","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Itali","where","team","perform","choreograph","dough-toss","routin","to","music","while","be","score","by","a","panel","of","judg",".","Along","the","way",",","the","pizza","industri","'s","two","rival","magazin","clash","as","former","member","of","the","U.S.","Pizza","Team","clandestin","form","their","own","splinter","team",",","and","then","jump","ship","from","one","magazin","'s","pizza","team","to","the","other",",","bring","the","industri","'s","spotlight","of","public","with","them",".","While","these","determin","pizza","acrobat","battl","through","a","scandal","-","and","controversy-ridden","preliminari","dough-toss","competit","in","New","York","Citi",",","the","vast","and","color","world","of","the","pizza","industri","is","explor",".","Segment","on","region","pizza","style","throughout","the","countri","includ","legendari","New","York","Citi","pizzeria",",","Chicago","deep","dish",",","and","California","gourmet","pizza",".","Trade","show",",","driver","tri","to","union",",","pizza","deliv","by","airplan","and","in","electr","car",",","as","well","as","the","histori","of","pizza","are","all","woven","throughout","the","compel","stori",",","which","culmin","at","the","annual","\"","Super","Bowl",",","\"","the","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Itali","."],"lemmas":["the","U.S.","Pizza","Team","?","acrobatic","dough","toss","?","the","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Italy","?","you","might","not","believe","what","you","see",".","drama",",","controversy",",","and","hilarity","abound","as","uniquely","talented","and","passionate","pizza","maker","battle","it","out","as","they","attempt","to","go","for","the","gold","against","they","international","counterpart",".","they","quest","be","follow","while","explore","the","pizza","industry",".","the","amazing","and","highly","competitive","world","of","acrobatic","pizza-dough","toss","be","examine","as","competitor","vie","for","spot","on","the","U.S.","Pizza","Team","and","the","chance","to","compete","for","the","gold","medal","at","the","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Italy","where","team","perform","choreograph","dough-tossing","routine","to","music","while","be","score","by","a","panel","of","judge",".","along","the","way",",","the","pizza","industry","'s","two","rival","magazine","clash","as","former","member","of","the","U.S.","Pizza","Team","clandestinely","form","they","own","splinter","team",",","and","then","jump","ship","from","one","magazine","'s","pizza","team","to","the","other",",","bring","the","industry","'s","spotlight","of","publicity","with","they",".","while","these","determine","pizza","acrobat","battle","through","a","scandal","-","and","controversy-ridden","preliminary","dough-tossing","competition","in","New","York","City",",","the","vast","and","colorful","world","of","the","pizza","industry","be","explore",".","segment","on","regional","pizza","style","throughout","the","country","include","legendary","New","York","City","pizzeria",",","Chicago","deep","dish",",","and","California","gourmet","pizza",".","Trade","show",",","driver","try","to","unionize",",","pizza","deliver","by","airplane","and","in","electric","car",",","as","well","as","the","history","of","pizza","be","all","weave","throughout","the","compelling","story",",","which","culminate","at","the","annual","``","Super","Bowl",",","''","the","World","Pizza","Championship","in","Italy","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

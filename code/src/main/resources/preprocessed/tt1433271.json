{"title":"Baby Let Your Hair Hang Down","plot":"Georgia Van Cuylenburg is a young Australian Actress and Comedian who currently lives in Hollywood California. Her life goal has always been to change the world - one smile at a time. In 2007 Georgia suddenly lost all of her hair and was diagnosed with Alopecia Areata. For the first time in her life she found it hard to smile. Rather than hiding away, choosing an easier career and giving in to her disorder Georgia decided to go loud and proud. She allowed cameras into her daily life to experience what it is like to be a woman, especially one who relies on her appearance to make a living, and to loose one's hair. She shared her tears, her pain and her triumphs. And she put them all together into one film to show the world how she learned that life is not about the hair on your head, it is about the lessons you learn the friends you find and the difference you can make. Her triumph through this movie is a message for millions of people around the world suffering from this disease, adults and children alike.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Georgia","Van","Cuylenburg","is","a","young","Australian","Actress","and","Comedian","who","current","live","in","Hollywood","California",".","Her","life","goal","has","alway","been","to","chang","the","world","-","one","smile","at","a","time",".","In","2007","Georgia","sudden","lost","all","of","her","hair","and","was","diagnos","with","Alopecia","Areata",".","For","the","first","time","in","her","life","she","found","it","hard","to","smile",".","Rather","than","hide","away",",","choos","an","easier","career","and","give","in","to","her","disord","Georgia","decid","to","go","loud","and","proud",".","She","allow","camera","into","her","daili","life","to","experi","what","it","is","like","to","be","a","woman",",","especi","one","who","reli","on","her","appear","to","make","a","live",",","and","to","loos","one","'s","hair",".","She","share","her","tear",",","her","pain","and","her","triumph",".","And","she","put","them","all","togeth","into","one","film","to","show","the","world","how","she","learn","that","life","is","not","about","the","hair","on","your","head",",","it","is","about","the","lesson","you","learn","the","friend","you","find","and","the","differ","you","can","make",".","Her","triumph","through","this","movi","is","a","messag","for","million","of","peopl","around","the","world","suffer","from","this","diseas",",","adult","and","children","alik","."],"lemmas":["Georgia","Van","Cuylenburg","be","a","young","australian","actress","and","comedian","who","currently","live","in","Hollywood","California",".","she","life","goal","have","always","be","to","change","the","world","-","one","smile","at","a","time",".","in","2007","Georgia","suddenly","lose","all","of","she","hair","and","be","diagnose","with","Alopecia","Areata",".","for","the","first","time","in","she","life","she","find","it","hard","to","smile",".","rather","than","hide","away",",","choose","a","easier","career","and","give","in","to","she","disorder","Georgia","decide","to","go","loud","and","proud",".","she","allow","camera","into","she","daily","life","to","experience","what","it","be","like","to","be","a","woman",",","especially","one","who","rely","on","she","appearance","to","make","a","living",",","and","to","loose","one","'s","hair",".","she","share","she","tear",",","she","pain","and","she","triumph",".","and","she","put","they","all","together","into","one","film","to","show","the","world","how","she","learn","that","life","be","not","about","the","hair","on","you","head",",","it","be","about","the","lesson","you","learn","the","friend","you","find","and","the","difference","you","can","make",".","she","triumph","through","this","movie","be","a","message","for","million","of","people","around","the","world","suffer","from","this","disease",",","adult","and","child","alike","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Georgia Van Cuylenburg","Van Cuylenburg is","Cuylenburg is a","is a young","a young Australian","young Australian Actress","Australian Actress and","Actress and Comedian","and Comedian who","Comedian who currently","who currently lives","currently lives in","lives in Hollywood","in Hollywood California","Her life goal","life goal has","goal has always","has always been","always been to","been to change","to change the","change the world","the world -","world -

Two college roommates (victims of a mutually unrequited love) meet up again five years after school at their housemate's wedding. With the introduction of a Bellamy-esque soap star, the sparks, sexual and verbal, start to fly, as the ex-roommates try to navigate their new romance.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Screwbal","comedi","with","a","modern","twist",";","instead","of","Kate","Hepburn","and","Cari","Grant",",","it","'s","Cari","Grant","and","Jimmi","Stewart",".","Two","colleg","roommat","(","victim","of","a","mutual","unrequit","love",")","meet","up","again","five","year","after","school","at","their","housem","'s","wed",".","With","the","introduct","of","a","Bellamy-esqu","soap","star",",","the","spark",",","sexual","and","verbal",",","start","to","fli",",","as","the","ex-roomm","tri","to","navig","their","new","romanc","."],"lemmas":["screwball","comedy","with","a","modern","twist",";","instead","of","Kate","Hepburn","and","Cary","Grant",",","it","be","Cary","Grant","and","Jimmy","Stewart",".","two","college","roommate","-lrb-","victim","of","a","mutually","unrequited","love","-rrb-","meet","up","again","five","year","after","school","at","they","housemate","'s","wedding",".","with","the","introduction","of","a","bellamy-esque","soap","star",",","the","spark",",","sexual","and","verbal",",","start","to","fly",",","as","the","ex-roommate","try","to","navigate","they","new","romance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Screwball comedy with","comedy with a","with a modern","a modern twist","modern twist ;","twist ; instead","; instead of","instead of Kate","of Kate Hepburn","Kate Hepburn and","Hepburn and Cary","and Cary Grant","Cary Grant ,","Grant , it",", it 's","it 's Cary","'s Cary Grant","Cary Grant and","Grant and Jimmy","and Jimmy Stewart","Two college roommates","college roommates (","roommates ( victims","( victims of","victims of a","of a mutually","a mutually unrequited","mutually unrequited love","unrequited love )","love ) meet",") meet up","meet up again","up again five","again five years","five years after","years after school","after school at","school at their","at their housemate","their housemate 's","housemate 's wedding","With the introduction","the introduction of","introduction of a","of a Bellamy-esque","a Bellamy-esque soap","Bellamy-esque soap star","soap star ,","star , the",", the sparks","the sparks ,","sparks , sexual",", sexual and","sexual and verbal","and verbal ,","verbal , start",", start to","start to fly","to fly ,","fly , as",", as the","as the ex-roommates","the ex-roommates try","ex-roommates try to","try to navigate","to navigate their","navigate their new","their new romance"],"2grams":["Screwball comedy","comedy with","with a","a modern","modern twist","twist ;","; instead","instead of","of Kate","Kate Hepburn","Hepburn and","and Cary","Cary Grant","Grant ,",", it","it 's","'s Cary","Cary Grant","Grant and","and Jimmy","Jimmy Stewart","Two college","college roommates","roommates (","( victims","victims of","of a","a mutually","mutually unrequited","unrequited love","love )",") meet","meet up","up again","again five","five years","years after","after school","school at","at their","their housemate","housemate 's","'s wedding","With the","the introduction","introduction of","of a","a Bellamy-esque","Bellamy-esque soap","soap star","star ,",", the","the sparks","sparks ,",", sexual","sexual and","and verbal","verbal ,",", start","start to","to fly","fly ,",", as","as the","the ex-roommates","ex-roommates try","try to","to navigate","navigate their","their new","new romance"]}

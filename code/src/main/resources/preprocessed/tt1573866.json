{"title":"Love Letters: A Legacy of Torment and Addiction","plot":"In his over ninety three years, New Orleans native Roswell Weill has demonstrated uncommon love and compassion for all who have crossed his path. During his time in England during World War Two, his devotion to his parents resulted in him writing an amazing cache of over one thousand letters that survive to this day. However, his near perfect life would be turned upside down by the woman he met and fell in love with during his war service. Cicely, his future wife, was a medical student and medic who became addicted to prescription drugs during this stressful time. Ros was warned by Cicely's parents and a voice in his own head that a marriage would probably never work. but Ros was a stubborn romantic. Nothing in his life to that point could have prepared him for the enormous challenge he would have to confront over the next thirty years. For their entire married life, Cicely was continuously addicted to a variety of prescription drugs, leaving her emotionally unavailable to her and Ros' three children. In fact, her behavior was dramatically traumatizing and emotionally scarring for her children. This is the story of what can happen when it turns out there is no such thing as happily ever after.","genres":["Biography"," Family","

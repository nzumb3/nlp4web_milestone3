{"title":"The Last Hope","plot":"The main character is an old (Peter Williamson) man who questions his way of life. While he accepts the fact that he is becoming senile, he wonders why he is still single. He reminisces three girls he really loved in his life. The passion brought on by his memories about these relationships makes him forget his imminent death. This half length film that sublimates an unstable man is a typical example of how Harold Martinez subtly combines drama and psychology with a message of hope.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","main","charact","is","an","old","(","Peter","Williamson",")","man","who","question","his","way","of","life",".","While","he","accept","the","fact","that","he","is","becom","senil",",","he","wonder","whi","he","is","still","singl",".","He","reminisc","three","girl","he","realli","love","in","his","life",".","The","passion","brought","on","by","his","memori","about","these","relationship","make","him","forget","his","immin","death",".","This","half","length","film","that","sublim","an","unstabl","man","is","a","typic","exampl","of","how","Harold","Martinez","subt","combin","drama","and","psycholog","with","a","messag","of","hope","."],"lemmas":["the","main","character","be","a","old","-lrb-","Peter","Williamson","-rrb-","man","who","question","he","way","of","life",".","while","he","accept","the","fact","that","he","be","become","senile",",","he","wonder","why","he","be","still","single",".","he","reminisce","three","girl","he","really","love","in","he","life",".","the","passion","bring","on","by","he","memory","about","these","relationship","make","he","forget","he","imminent","death",".","this","half","length","film","that","sublimate","a","unstable","man","be","a","typical","example","of","how","Harold","Martinez","subtly","combine","drama","and","psychology","with","a","message","of","hope","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The main character","main character is","character is an","is an old","an old (","old ( Peter","( Peter Williamson","Peter Williamson )","Williamson ) man",") man who","man who questions","who questions his","questions his way","his way of","way of life","While he accepts","he accepts the","accepts the fact","the fact that","fact that he","that he is","he is becoming","is becoming senile","becoming senile ,","senile , he",", he wonders","he wonders why","wonders why he","why he is","he is still","is still single","He reminisces three","reminisces three girls","three girls he","girls he really","he really loved","really loved in","loved in his","in his life","The passion brought","passion brought on","brought on by","on by his","by his memories","his memories about","memories about these","about these relationships","these relationships makes","relationships makes him","makes him forget","him forget his","forget his imminent","his imminent death","This half length","half length film","length film that","film that sublimates","that sublimates an","sublimates an unstable","an unstable man","unstable man is","man is a","is a typical","a typical example","typical example of","example of how","of how Harold","how Harold Martinez","Harold Martinez subtly","Martinez subtly combines","subtly combines drama","combines drama and","drama and psychology","and psychology with","psychology with a","with a message","a message of","message of hope"],"2grams":["The main","main character","character is","is an","an old","old (","( Peter","Peter Williamson","Williamson )",") man","man who","who questions","questions his","his way","way of","of life","While he","he accepts","accepts the","the fact","fact that","that he","he is","is becoming","becoming senile","senile ,",", he","he wonders","wonders why","why he","he is","is still","still single","He reminisces","reminisces three","three girls","girls he","he really","really loved","loved in","in his","his life","The passion","passion brought","brought on","on by","by his","his memories","memories about","about these","these relationships","relationships makes","makes him","him forget","forget his","his imminent","imminent death","This half","half length","length film","film that","that sublimates","sublimates an","an unstable","unstable man","man is","is a","a typical","typical example","example of","of how","how Harold","Harold Martinez","Martinez subtly","subtly combines","combines drama","drama and","and psychology","psychology with","with a","a message","message of","of hope"]}

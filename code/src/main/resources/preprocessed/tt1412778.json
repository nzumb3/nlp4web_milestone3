{"title":"Yolcularin gece sarkisi","plot":"The old tailor, Yolan, just released from an Iranian prison, sets out in search of the village in Turkey where he was born. By his side is Ozal, a 9-year old boy. Together they wander through the mountains of Eastern Anatolia and discover a country whose realities are as fabulous as they are simple. Chance encounters abound - talkative truckers, gamblers, suspicious villagers, shop keepers, bickering couples, wanderers, cattle wranglers - but it slowly emerges that the object of the quest, a village no longer shown on any map, is becoming less and less clear. What are Ozal and Yolan really seeking ? What is their place in a world that they find harder and harder to understand ? After a long journey, they come across a fortune teller and leave it to her to enlighten them on their destiny. A road in the dark leads them to the seaside. Yolan starts dancing on the beach to the music of Armenian musicians...","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","old","tailor",",","Yolan",",","just","releas","from","an","Iranian","prison",",","set","out","in","search","of","the","villag","in","Turkey","where","he","was","born",".","By","his","side","is","Ozal",",","a","9-year","old","boy",".","Togeth","they","wander","through","the","mountain","of","Eastern","Anatolia","and","discov","a","countri","whose","realiti","are","as","fabul","as","they","are","simpl",".","Chanc","encount","abound","-","talkat","trucker",",","gambler",",","suspici","villag",",","shop","keeper",",","bicker","coupl",",","wander",",","cattl","wrangler","-","but","it","slowli","emerg","that","the","object","of","the","quest",",","a","villag","no","longer","shown","on","ani","map",",","is","becom","less","and","less","clear",".","What","are","Ozal","and","Yolan","realli","seek","?","What","is","their","place","in","a","world","that","they","find","harder","and","harder","to","understand","?","After","a","long","journey",",","they","come","across","a","fortun","teller","and","leav","it","to","her","to","enlighten","them","on","their","destini",".","A","road","in","the","dark","lead","them","to","the","seasid",".","Yolan","start","danc","on","the","beach","to","the","music","of","Armenian","musician","..."],"lemmas":["the","old","tailor",",","Yolan",",","just","release","from","a","iranian","prison",",","set","out","in","search","of","the","village","in","Turkey","where","he","be","bear",".","by","he","side","be","Ozal",",","a","9-year","old","boy",".","together","they","wander","through","the","mountain","of","Eastern","Anatolia","and","discover","a","country","whose","reality","be","as","fabulous","as","they","be","simple",".","chance","encounter","abound","-","talkative","trucker",",","gambler",",","suspicious","villager",",","shop","keeper",",","bicker","couple",",","wanderer",",","cattle","wrangler","-","but","it","slowly","emerge","that","the","object","of","the","quest",",","a","village","no","longer","show","on","any","map",",","be","become","less","and","less","clear",".","what","be","Ozal","and","Yolan","really","seek","?","what","be","they","place","in","a","world","that","they","find","harder","and","harder","to","understand","?","after","a","long","journey",",","they","come","across","a","fortune","teller","and","leave","it","to","she","to","enlighten","they","on","they","destiny",".","a","road","in","the","dark","lead","they","to","the","seaside",".","Yolan","start","dancing","on","the","beach","to","the","music","of","armenian","musician","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The old tailor","old tailor ,","tailor , Yolan",", Yolan ,","Yolan , just",", just released","just released from","released from an","from an Iranian","an Iranian prison","Iranian prison ,","prison , sets",", sets out","sets out in","out in search","in search of","search of the","of the village","the village in","village in Turkey","in Turkey where","Turkey where he","where he was","he was born","By his side","his side is","side is Ozal","is Ozal ,","Ozal , a",", a 9-year","a 9-year old","9-year old boy","Together they wander","they wander through","wander through the","through the mountains","the mountains of","mountains of Eastern","of Eastern Anatolia","Eastern Anatolia and","Anatolia and discover","and discover a","discover a country","a country whose","country whose realities","whose realities are","realities are as","are as fabulous","as fabulous as","fabulous as they","as they are","they are simple","Chance encounters abound","encounters abound -","abound -

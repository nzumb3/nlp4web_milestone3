{"title":"Counting Days","plot":"Dad was always there for us... Ray, a cab driver, views the world to be as lost as the passengers he picks up. Contact with his brother, Dr. Tom McCormack and father is non-existent. Except for his friendship with May, the elderly owner of the hotel where he lives, he is content just being left alone. Ray's only passion is his love of art. Tom's world takes a turn when he finds out that his father is dying of cancer. In an effort to bring the family together before his fathers impending death, Tom decides to reach out to Ray who was always the \"black sheep\" of the family. Isabel, a young woman from Chile, moves in down the hall and in doing so becomes a part of Ray's world. In a chance meeting during a cab ride, Ray is introduced to the Rev. John Santos, a family counselor. Ray's only hope to heal the wounds of his past and his fears of a lonely future are to confront his demons. He must find the courage to put aside his pre-conceived notions of religion, fatherhood and love, to start living his life again.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Dad","was","alway","there","for","us","...","Ray",",","a","cab","driver",",","view","the","world","to","be","as","lost","as","the","passeng","he","pick","up",".","Contact","with","his","brother",",","Dr.","Tom","McCormack","and","father","is","non-exist",".","Except","for","his","friendship","with","May",",","the","elder","owner","of","the","hotel","where","he","live",",","he","is","content","just","be","left","alon",".","Ray","'s","onli","passion","is","his","love","of","art",".","Tom","'s","world","take","a","turn","when","he","find","out","that","his","father","is","die","of","cancer",".","In","an","effort","to","bring","the","famili","togeth","befor","his","father","impend","death",",","Tom","decid","to","reach","out","to","Ray","who","was","alway","the","\"","black","sheep","\"","of","the","famili",".","Isabel",",","a","young","woman","from","Chile",",","move","in","down","the","hall","and","in","do","so","becom","a","part","of","Ray","'s","world",".","In","a","chanc","meet","dure","a","cab","ride",",","Ray","is","introduc","to","the","Rev.","John","Santo",",","a","famili","counselor",".","Ray","'s","onli","hope","to","heal","the","wound","of","his","past","and","his","fear","of","a","lone","futur","are","to","confront","his","demon",".","He","must","find","the","courag","to","put","asid","his","pre-conceiv","notion","of","religion",",","fatherhood","and","love",",","to","start","live","his","life","again","."],"lemmas":["Dad","be","always","there","for","we","...","Ray",",","a","cab","driver",",","view","the","world","to","be","as","lose","as","the","passenger","he","pick","up",".","contact","with","he","brother",",","Dr.","Tom","McCormack","and","father","be","non-existent",".","except","for","he","friendship","with","May",",","the","elderly","owner","of","the","hotel","where","he","live",",","he","be","content","just","be","leave","alone",".","Ray","'s","only","passion","be","he","love","of","art",".","Tom","'s","world","take","a","turn","when","he","find","out","that","he","father","be","die","of","cancer",".","in","a","effort","to","bring","the","family","together","before","he","father","impend","death",",","Tom","decide","to","reach","out","to","Ray","who","be","always","the","``","black","sheep","''","of","the","family",".","Isabel",",","a","young","woman","from","Chile",",","move","in","down","the","hall","and","in","do","so","become","a","part","of","Ray","'s","world",".","in","a","chance","meeting","during","a","cab","ride",",","Ray","be","introduce","to","the","Rev.","John","Santos",",","a","family","counselor",".","Ray","'s","only","hope","to","heal","the","wound","of","he","past","and","he","fear","of","a","lonely","future","be","to","confront","he","demon",".","he","must","find","the","courage","to","put","aside","he","pre-conceived","notion","of","religion",",","fatherhood","and","love",",","to","start","live","he","life","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Dad was always","was always there","always there for","there for us","for us ...","us ...

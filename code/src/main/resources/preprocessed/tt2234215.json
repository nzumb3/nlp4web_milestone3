{"title":"Love: As You Like It","plot":"LOVE: As You Like It - adapted from Shakespeare's romantic comedy As You Like It - takes viewers on a wild ride through San Francisco's artistic and culturally diverse Mission District as a group of dynamic characters struggle with what it means to love, and to be loved. Using Shakespeare's original language, the film follows free-spirited Rosalind and her cheeky cousin Celia as they throw off the shackles of childhood, disguise themselves as hipsters and run away to the city in order to experience life and love at its fullest. Along the way, they encounter a motley crew of San Francisco misfits including sensitive Silvius and his unrequited punk love Phebe, lugubrious stand-up comic Jacques and his blue-haired friend Audrey, and more. When the girls stumble on lovesick Orlando, who, blinded by love, is unable to see past Rosalind's masculine disguise, they decide to have a little fun. Rosalind, seizing the opportunity to test her love's love, offers to cure his sickness - all he has to do is call her Rosalind. After some hesitation, he agrees, and with that, she enacts every single womanly cliché she can think of in an attempt to make him hate her - something, she finally realizes, he is simply not capable of doing.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["LOVE",":","As","You","Like","It","-","adapt","from","Shakespear","'s","romant","comedi","As","You","Like","It","-","take","viewer","on","a","wild","ride","through","San","Francisco","'s","artist","and","cultur","divers","Mission","District","as","a","group","of","dynam","charact","struggl","with","what","it","mean","to","love",",","and","to","be","love",".","Using","Shakespear","'s","origin","languag",",","the","film","follow","free-spirit","Rosalind","and","her","cheeki","cousin","Celia","as","they","throw","off","the","shackl","of","childhood",",","disguis","themselv","as","hipster","and","run","away","to","the","citi","in","order","to","experi","life","and","love","at","it","fullest",".","Along","the","way",",","they","encount","a","motley","crew","of","San","Francisco","misfit","includ","sensit","Silvius","and","his","unrequit","punk","love","Phebe",",","lugubri","stand-up","comic","Jacqu","and","his","blue-hair","friend","Audrey",",","and","more",".","When","the","girl","stumbl","on","lovesick","Orlando",",","who",",","blind","by","love",",","is","unabl","to","see","past","Rosalind","'s","masculin","disguis",",","they","decid","to","have","a","littl","fun",".","Rosalind",",","seiz","the","opportun","to","test","her","love","'s","love",",","offer","to","cure","his","sick","-","all","he","has","to","do","is","call","her","Rosalind",".","After","some","hesit",",","he","agre",",","and","with","that",",","she","enact","everi","singl","woman","cliché","she","can","think","of","in","an","attempt","to","make","him","hate","her","-","someth",",","she","final","realiz",",","he","is","simpli","not","capabl","of","do","."],"lemmas":["love",":","as","you","like","it","-","adapt","from","Shakespeare","'s","romantic","comedy","as","you","like","it","-","take","viewer","on","a","wild","ride","through","San","Francisco","'s","artistic","and","culturally","diverse","Mission","District","as","a","group","of","dynamic","character","struggle","with","what","it","mean","to","love",",","and","to","be","love",".","use","Shakespeare","'s","original","language",",","the","film","follow","free-spirited","Rosalind","and","she","cheeky","cousin","Celia","as","they","throw","off","the","shackle","of","childhood",",","disguise","themselves","as","hipster","and","run","away","to","the","city","in","order","to","experience","life","and","love","at","its","fullest",".","along","the","way",",","they","encounter","a","motley","crew","of","San","Francisco","misfit","include","sensitive","Silvius","and","he","unrequited","punk","love","Phebe",",","lugubrious","stand-up","comic","Jacques","and","he","blue-haired","friend","Audrey",",","and","more",".","when","the","girl","stumble","on","lovesick","Orlando",",","who",",","blind","by","love",",","be","unable","to","see","past","Rosalind","'s","masculine","disguise",",","they","decide","to","have","a","little","fun",".","Rosalind",",","seize","the","opportunity","to","test","she","love","'s","love",",","offer","to","cure","he","sickness","-","all","he","have","to","do","be","call","she","Rosalind",".","after","some","hesitation",",","he","agree",",","and","with","that",",","she","enact","every","single","womanly","cliché","she","can","think","of","in","a","attempt","to","make","he","hate","she","-","something",",","she","finally","realize",",","he","be","simply","not","capable","of","do","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["LOVE : As",": As You","As You Like","You Like It","Like It -","It -

{"title":"What Is Hidden, May Be Found","plot":"What Is Hidden, May Be Found takes its audience to South America, opening up a world of culture, antiquity, myth and adventure. Archaeologist Robert Farrugia delves into the lesser-known cultures and history of the region around Ecuador and Peru, seeking to explore off-the-beaten tracks and find that which may be hidden. Robert acquaints us with tales and legends of South American exploration. His adventures see him traveling along remote roads and rivers finding figurines, idols and other artifacts, following in the footsteps of the explorers of old. Robert finds a wealth of items, information, new sites and discusses how and why this journey could be made; how the 'little guy' can become an adventurer and that there really is much more waiting to be found.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["What","Is","Hidden",",","May","Be","Found","take","it","audienc","to","South","America",",","open","up","a","world","of","cultur",",","antiqu",",","myth","and","adventur",".","Archaeologist","Robert","Farrugia","delv","into","the","lesser-known","cultur","and","histori","of","the","region","around","Ecuador","and","Peru",",","seek","to","explor","off-the-beaten","track","and","find","that","which","may","be","hidden",".","Robert","acquaint","us","with","tale","and","legend","of","South","American","explor",".","His","adventur","see","him","travel","along","remot","road","and","river","find","figurin",",","idol","and","other","artifact",",","follow","in","the","footstep","of","the","explor","of","old",".","Robert","find","a","wealth","of","item",",","inform",",","new","site","and","discuss","how","and","whi","this","journey","could","be","made",";","how","the","'","littl","guy","'","can","becom","an","adventur","and","that","there","realli","is","much","more","wait","to","be","found","."],"lemmas":["what","be","Hidden",",","may","be","Found","take","its","audience","to","South","America",",","open","up","a","world","of","culture",",","antiquity",",","myth","and","adventure",".","Archaeologist","Robert","Farrugia","delve","into","the","lesser-known","culture","and","history","of","the","region","around","Ecuador","and","Peru",",","seek","to","explore","off-the-beaten","track","and","find","that","which","may","be","hide",".","Robert","acquaint","we","with","tale","and","legend","of","south","american","exploration",".","he","adventure","see","he","travel","along","remote","road","and","river","find","figurine",",","idol","and","other","artifact",",","follow","in","the","footstep","of","the","explorer","of","old",".","Robert","find","a","wealth","of","item",",","information",",","new","site","and","discuss","how","and","why","this","journey","could","be","make",";","how","the","'","little","guy","'","can","become","a","adventurer","and","that","there","really","be","much","more","waiting","to","be","find","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What Is Hidden","Is Hidden ,","Hidden , May",", May Be","May Be Found","Be Found takes","Found takes its","takes its audience","its audience to","audience to South","to South America","South America ,","America , opening",", opening up","opening up a","up a world","a world of","world of culture","of culture ,","culture , antiquity",", antiquity ,","antiquity , myth",", myth and","myth and adventure","Archaeologist Robert Farrugia","Robert Farrugia delves","Farrugia delves into","delves into the","into the lesser-known","the lesser-known cultures","lesser-known cultures and","cultures and history","and history of","history of the","of the region","the region around","region around Ecuador","around Ecuador and","Ecuador and Peru","and Peru ,","Peru , seeking",", seeking to","seeking to explore","to explore off-the-beaten","explore off-the-beaten tracks","off-the-beaten tracks and","tracks and find","and find that","find that which","that which may","which may be","may be hidden","Robert acquaints us","acquaints us with","us with tales","with tales and","tales and legends","and legends of","legends of South","of South American","South American exploration","His adventures see","adventures see him","see him traveling","him traveling along","traveling along remote","along remote roads","remote roads and","roads and rivers","and rivers finding","rivers finding figurines","finding figurines ,","figurines , idols",", idols and","idols and other","and other artifacts","other artifacts ,","artifacts , following",", following in","following in the","in the footsteps","the footsteps of","footsteps of the","of the explorers","the explorers of","explorers of old","Robert finds a","finds a wealth","a wealth of","wealth of items","of items ,","items , information",", information ,","information , new",", new sites","new sites and","sites and discusses","and discusses how","discusses how and","how and why","and why this","why this journey","this journey could","journey could be","could be made","be made ;","made ;

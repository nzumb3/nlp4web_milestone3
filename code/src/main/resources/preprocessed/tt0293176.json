{"title":"Get Well Soon","plot":"Wildly popular TV talk show host Bobby Bishop has a nervous breakdown during an on-camera interview with a pop starlet, with whom he makes a rather crude observation and offer. This lapse of taste sets off a series of scandals in his off-camera life, which his beleaguered agent is helpless to stop. Desperate for love, Bobby rushes to New York City to find his former girlfriend, Lily, who doesn't even like his show, and neither does her cross-dressing boyfriend. Can true love straighten out the messes that are these folks' lives?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Wild","popular","TV","talk","show","host","Bobbi","Bishop","has","a","nervous","breakdown","dure","an","on-camera","interview","with","a","pop","starlet",",","with","whom","he","make","a","rather","crude","observ","and","offer",".","This","laps","of","tast","set","off","a","seri","of","scandal","in","his","off-camera","life",",","which","his","beleagu","agent","is","helpless","to","stop",".","Desper","for","love",",","Bobbi","rush","to","New","York","Citi","to","find","his","former","girlfriend",",","Lili",",","who","doe","n't","even","like","his","show",",","and","neither","doe","her","cross-dress","boyfriend",".","Can","true","love","straighten","out","the","mess","that","are","these","folk","'","live","?"],"lemmas":["wildly","popular","tv","talk","show","host","Bobby","Bishop","have","a","nervous","breakdown","during","a","on-camera","interview","with","a","pop","starlet",",","with","whom","he","make","a","rather","crude","observation","and","offer",".","this","lapse","of","taste","set","off","a","series","of","scandal","in","he","off-camera","life",",","which","he","beleaguered","agent","be","helpless","to","stop",".","desperate","for","love",",","Bobby","rush","to","New","York","City","to","find","he","former","girlfriend",",","Lily",",","who","do","not","even","like","he","show",",","and","neither","do","she","cross-dressing","boyfriend",".","can","true","love","straighten","out","the","mess","that","be","these","folk","'","life","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wildly popular TV","popular TV talk","TV talk show","talk show host","show host Bobby","host Bobby Bishop","Bobby Bishop has","Bishop has a","has a nervous","a nervous breakdown","nervous breakdown during","breakdown during an","during an on-camera","an on-camera interview","on-camera interview with","interview with a","with a pop","a pop starlet","pop starlet ,","starlet , with",", with whom","with whom he","whom he makes","he makes a","makes a rather","a rather crude","rather crude observation","crude observation and","observation and offer","This lapse of","lapse of taste","of taste sets","taste sets off","sets off a","off a series","a series of","series of scandals","of scandals in","scandals in his","in his off-camera","his off-camera life","off-camera life ,","life , which",", which his","which his beleaguered","his beleaguered agent","beleaguered agent is","agent is helpless","is helpless to","helpless to stop","Desperate for love","for love ,","love , Bobby",", Bobby rushes","Bobby rushes to","rushes to New","to New York","New York City","York City to","City to find","to find his","find his former","his former girlfriend","former girlfriend ,","girlfriend , Lily",", Lily ,","Lily , who",", who does","who does n't","does n't even","n't even like","even like his","like his show","his show ,","show , and",", and neither","and neither does","neither does her","does her cross-dressing","her cross-dressing boyfriend","Can true love","true love straighten","love straighten out","straighten out the","out the messes","the messes that","messes that are","that are these","are these folks","these folks '","folks ' lives"],"2grams":["Wildly popular","popular TV","TV talk","talk show","show host","host Bobby","Bobby Bishop","Bishop has","has a","a nervous","nervous breakdown","breakdown during","during an","an on-camera","on-camera interview","interview with","with a","a pop","pop starlet","starlet ,",", with","with whom","whom he","he makes","makes a","a rather","rather crude","crude observation","observation and","and offer","This lapse","lapse of","of taste","taste sets","sets off","off a","a series","series of","of scandals","scandals in","in his","his off-camera","off-camera life","life ,",", which","which his","his beleaguered","beleaguered agent","agent is","is helpless","helpless to","to stop","Desperate for","for love","love ,",", Bobby","Bobby rushes","rushes to","to New","New York","York City","City to","to find","find his","his former","former girlfriend","girlfriend ,",", Lily","Lily ,",", who","who does","does n't","n't even","even like","like his","his show","show ,",", and","and neither","neither does","does her","her cross-dressing","cross-dressing boyfriend","Can true","true love","love straighten","straighten out","out the","the messes","messes that","that are","are these","these folks","folks '","' lives"]}

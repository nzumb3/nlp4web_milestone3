Why am I only CP when I talk and not when I think? Why is it always me who has to console and never be consoled? Why can she not love me? The six characters are fighting with all their inner demons in a Stockholm where time just flows by. Who has the strength to change and who will always remain in their own bubble of self-denial?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["What","is","a","bad","person","?","Whi","is","there","no","one","els","who","see","all","wrong","in","the","societi","?","Whi","doe","it","feel","as","I","do","not","live","?","Whi","am","I","onli","CP","when","I","talk","and","not","when","I","think","?","Whi","is","it","alway","me","who","has","to","consol","and","never","be","consol","?","Whi","can","she","not","love","me","?","The","six","charact","are","fight","with","all","their","inner","demon","in","a","Stockholm","where","time","just","flow","by",".","Who","has","the","strength","to","chang","and","who","will","alway","remain","in","their","own","bubbl","of","self-deni","?"],"lemmas":["what","be","a","bad","person","?","why","be","there","no","one","else","who","see","all","wrong","in","the","society","?","why","do","it","feel","as","I","do","not","live","?","why","be","I","only","cp","when","I","talk","and","not","when","I","think","?","why","be","it","always","I","who","have","to","console","and","never","be","console","?","why","can","she","not","love","I","?","the","six","character","be","fight","with","all","they","inner","demon","in","a","Stockholm","where","time","just","flow","by",".","who","have","the","strength","to","change","and","who","will","always","remain","in","they","own","bubble","of","self-denial","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["What is a","is a bad","a bad person","Why is there","is there no","there no one","no one else","one else who","else who sees","who sees all","sees all wrong","all wrong in","wrong in the","in the society","Why does it","does it feel","it feel as","feel as I","as I do","I do not","do not live","Why am I","am I only","I only CP","only CP when","CP when I","when I talk","I talk and","talk and not","and not when","not when I","when I think","Why is it","is it always","it always me","always me who","me who has","who has to","has to console","to console and","console and never","and never be","never be consoled","Why can she","can she not","she not love","not love me","The six characters","six characters are","characters are fighting","are fighting with","fighting with all","with all their","all their inner","their inner demons","inner demons in","demons in a","in a Stockholm","a Stockholm where","Stockholm where time","where time just","time just flows","just flows by","Who has the","has the strength","the strength to","strength to change","to change and","change and who","and who will","who will always","will always remain","always remain in","remain in their","in their own","their own bubble","own bubble of","bubble of self-denial"],"2grams":["What is","is a","a bad","bad person","Why is","is there","there no","no one","one else","else who","who sees","sees all","all wrong","wrong in","in the","the society","Why does","does it","it feel","feel as","as I","I do","do not","not live","Why am","am I","I only","only CP","CP when","when I","I talk","talk and","and not","not when","when I","I think","Why is","is it","it always","always me","me who","who has","has to","to console","console and","and never","never be","be consoled","Why can","can she","she not","not love","love me","The six","six characters","characters are","are fighting","fighting with","with all","all their","their inner","inner demons","demons in","in a","a Stockholm","Stockholm where","where time","time just","just flows","flows by","Who has","has the","the strength","strength to","to change","change and","and who","who will","will always","always remain","remain in","in their","their own","own bubble","bubble of","of self-denial"]}

{"title":"Bali: Hope in Paradise","plot":"This is the powerful story of a young woman, Sri Kebon, who devoted all her time and efforts to helping the Balinese who were affected by the Bali bombing of October 2002, widows and children of the victims. Her tireless efforts have made a real difference to some who had little hope at all. Also documented is her rescue and fostering of two young children who lost their mother in the blast, and her ultimately triumphant struggle against political bureacracy to have them reunited with their father.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","the","power","stori","of","a","young","woman",",","Sri","Kebon",",","who","devot","all","her","time","and","effort","to","help","the","Balines","who","were","affect","by","the","Bali","bomb","of","October","2002",",","widow","and","children","of","the","victim",".","Her","tireless","effort","have","made","a","real","differ","to","some","who","had","littl","hope","at","all",".","Also","document","is","her","rescu","and","foster","of","two","young","children","who","lost","their","mother","in","the","blast",",","and","her","ultim","triumphant","struggl","against","polit","bureacraci","to","have","them","reunit","with","their","father","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","powerful","story","of","a","young","woman",",","Sri","Kebon",",","who","devote","all","she","time","and","effort","to","help","the","Balinese","who","be","affect","by","the","Bali","bombing","of","October","2002",",","widow","and","child","of","the","victim",".","she","tireless","effort","have","make","a","real","difference","to","some","who","have","little","hope","at","all",".","also","document","be","she","rescue","and","foster","of","two","young","child","who","lose","they","mother","in","the","blast",",","and","she","ultimately","triumphant","struggle","against","political","bureacracy","to","have","they","reunite","with","they","father","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is the","is the powerful","the powerful story","powerful story of","story of a","of a young","a young woman","young woman ,","woman , Sri",", Sri Kebon","Sri Kebon ,","Kebon , who",", who devoted","who devoted all","devoted all her","all her time","her time and","time and efforts","and efforts to","efforts to helping","to helping the","helping the Balinese","the Balinese who","Balinese who were","who were affected","were affected by","affected by the","by the Bali","the Bali bombing","Bali bombing of","bombing of October","of October 2002","October 2002 ,","2002 , widows",", widows and","widows and children","and children of","children of the","of the victims","Her tireless efforts","tireless efforts have","efforts have made","have made a","made a real","a real difference","real difference to","difference to some","to some who","some who had","who had little","had little hope","little hope at","hope at all","Also documented is","documented is her","is her rescue","her rescue and","rescue and fostering","and fostering of","fostering of two","of two young","two young children","young children who","children who lost","who lost their","lost their mother","their mother in","mother in the","in the blast","the blast ,","blast , and",", and her","and her ultimately","her ultimately triumphant","ultimately triumphant struggle","triumphant struggle against","struggle against political","against political bureacracy","political bureacracy to","bureacracy to have","to have them","have them reunited","them reunited with","reunited with their","with their father"],"2grams":["This is","is the","the powerful","powerful story","story of","of a","a young","young woman","woman ,",", Sri","Sri Kebon","Kebon ,",", who","who devoted","devoted all","all her","her time","time and","and efforts","efforts to","to helping","helping the","the Balinese","Balinese who","who were","were affected","affected by","by the","the Bali","Bali bombing","bombing of","of October","October 2002","2002 ,",", widows","widows and","and children","children of","of the","the victims","Her tireless","tireless efforts","efforts have","have made","made a","a real","real difference","difference to","to some","some who","who had","had little","little hope","hope at","at all","Also documented","documented is","is her","her rescue","rescue and","and fostering","fostering of","of two","two young","young children","children who","who lost","lost their","their mother","mother in","in the","the blast","blast ,",", and","and her","her ultimately","ultimately triumphant","triumphant struggle","struggle against","against political","political bureacracy","bureacracy to","to have","have them","them reunited","reunited with","with their","their father"]}

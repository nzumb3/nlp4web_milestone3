{"title":"3 days of cinema","plot":"Three places which could not be more different from each other. Cinema Jenin is a failed peace-project in Palestine, designed as an escape from everyday life in an omnipresent conflict, defeated by the barriers in the streets and minds. Lichtburg Quernheim in the smallest German cinema town is both a cineastic palace of dreams and a rustic village pub. The cinema on the Croatian island of Goli Otok is a ruin with a bloody past. Tito's former concentration and reeducation camp, today a memorial site visited by sheep and Beach Bound tourists.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["Three","place","which","could","not","be","more","differ","from","each","other",".","Cinema","Jenin","is","a","fail","peace-project","in","Palestin",",","design","as","an","escap","from","everyday","life","in","an","omnipres","conflict",",","defeat","by","the","barrier","in","the","street","and","mind",".","Lichtburg","Quernheim","in","the","smallest","German","cinema","town","is","both","a","cineast","palac","of","dream","and","a","rustic","villag","pub",".","The","cinema","on","the","Croatian","island","of","Goli","Otok","is","a","ruin","with","a","bloodi","past",".","Tito","'s","former","concentr","and","reeduc","camp",",","today","a","memori","site","visit","by","sheep","and","Beach","Bound","tourist","."],"lemmas":["three","place","which","could","not","be","more","different","from","each","other",".","Cinema","Jenin","be","a","failed","peace-project","in","Palestine",",","design","as","a","escape","from","everyday","life","in","a","omnipresent","conflict",",","defeat","by","the","barrier","in","the","street","and","mind",".","Lichtburg","Quernheim","in","the","smallest","german","cinema","town","be","both","a","cineastic","palace","of","dream","and","a","rustic","village","pub",".","the","cinema","on","the","croatian","island","of","Goli","Otok","be","a","ruin","with","a","bloody","past",".","Tito","'s","former","concentration","and","reeducation","camp",",","today","a","memorial","site","visit","by","sheep","and","Beach","bind","tourist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Three places which","places which could","which could not","could not be","not be more","be more different","more different from","different from each","from each other","Cinema Jenin is","Jenin is a","is a failed","a failed peace-project","failed peace-project in","peace-project in Palestine","in Palestine ,","Palestine , designed",", designed as","designed as an","as an escape","an escape from","escape from everyday","from everyday life","everyday life in","life in an","in an omnipresent","an omnipresent conflict","omnipresent conflict ,","conflict , defeated",", defeated by","defeated by the","by the barriers","the barriers in","barriers in the","in the streets","the streets and","streets and minds","Lichtburg Quernheim in","Quernheim in the","in the smallest","the smallest German","smallest German cinema","German cinema town","cinema town is","town is both","is both a","both a cineastic","a cineastic palace","cineastic palace of","palace of dreams","of dreams and","dreams and a","and a rustic","a rustic village","rustic village pub","The cinema on","cinema on the","on the Croatian","the Croatian island","Croatian island of","island of Goli","of Goli Otok","Goli Otok is","Otok is a","is a ruin","a ruin with","ruin with a","with a bloody","a bloody past","Tito 's former","'s former concentration","former concentration and","concentration and reeducation","and reeducation camp","reeducation camp ,","camp , today",", today a","today a memorial","a memorial site","memorial site visited","site visited by","visited by sheep","by sheep and","sheep and Beach","and Beach Bound","Beach Bound tourists"],"2grams":["Three places","places which","which could","could not","not be","be more","more different","different from","from each","each other","Cinema Jenin","Jenin is","is a","a failed","failed peace-project","peace-project in","in Palestine","Palestine ,",", designed","designed as","as an","an escape","escape from","from everyday","everyday life","life in","in an","an omnipresent","omnipresent conflict","conflict ,",", defeated","defeated by","by the","the barriers","barriers in","in the","the streets","streets and","and minds","Lichtburg Quernheim","Quernheim in","in the","the smallest","smallest German","German cinema","cinema town","town is","is both","both a","a cineastic","cineastic palace","palace of","of dreams","dreams and","and a","a rustic","rustic village","village pub","The cinema","cinema on","on the","the Croatian","Croatian island","island of","of Goli","Goli Otok","Otok is","is a","a ruin","ruin with","with a","a bloody","bloody past","Tito 's","'s former","former concentration","concentration and","and reeducation","reeducation camp","camp ,",", today","today a","a memorial","memorial site","site visited","visited by","by sheep","sheep and","and Beach","Beach Bound","Bound tourists"]}

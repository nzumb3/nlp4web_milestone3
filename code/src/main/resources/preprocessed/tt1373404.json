{"title":"Beyond Biba: A Portrait of Barbara Hulanicki","plot":"Barbara Hulanicki will always be remembered for BIBA, the shop that changed the face of UK fashion in the 1960s and 70s. A phenomenon in the truest sense of the word, BIBA would leave an indelible mark on the minds and wardrobes of the customers who ventured through its doors. Following its closure in 1976, many have attempted to reproduce the magic. All have missed the key ingredient: the involvement of its creator, Barbara Hulanicki.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Barbara","Hulanicki","will","alway","be","rememb","for","BIBA",",","the","shop","that","chang","the","face","of","UK","fashion","in","the","1960s","and","70s",".","A","phenomenon","in","the","truest","sens","of","the","word",",","BIBA","would","leav","an","indel","mark","on","the","mind","and","wardrob","of","the","custom","who","ventur","through","it","door",".","Follow","it","closur","in","1976",",","mani","have","attempt","to","reproduc","the","magic",".","All","have","miss","the","key","ingredi",":","the","involv","of","it","creator",",","Barbara","Hulanicki","."],"lemmas":["Barbara","Hulanicki","will","always","be","remember","for","BIBA",",","the","shop","that","change","the","face","of","UK","fashion","in","the","1960","and","70",".","a","phenomenon","in","the","truest","sense","of","the","word",",","BIBA","would","leave","a","indelible","mark","on","the","mind","and","wardrobe","of","the","customer","who","venture","through","its","door",".","follow","its","closure","in","1976",",","many","have","attempt","to","reproduce","the","magic",".","all","have","miss","the","key","ingredient",":","the","involvement","of","its","creator",",","Barbara","Hulanicki","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Barbara Hulanicki will","Hulanicki will always","will always be","always be remembered","be remembered for","remembered for BIBA","for BIBA ,","BIBA , the",", the shop","the shop that","shop that changed","that changed the","changed the face","the face of","face of UK","of UK fashion","UK fashion in","fashion in the","in the 1960s","the 1960s and","1960s and 70s","A phenomenon in","phenomenon in the","in the truest","the truest sense","truest sense of","sense of the","of the word","the word ,","word , BIBA",", BIBA would","BIBA would leave","would leave an","leave an indelible","an indelible mark","indelible mark on","mark on the","on the minds","the minds and","minds and wardrobes","and wardrobes of","wardrobes of the","of the customers","the customers who","customers who ventured","who ventured through","ventured through its","through its doors","Following its closure","its closure in","closure in 1976","in 1976 ,","1976 , many",", many have","many have attempted","have attempted to","attempted to reproduce","to reproduce the","reproduce the magic","All have missed","have missed the","missed the key","the key ingredient","key ingredient :","ingredient : the",": the involvement","the involvement of","involvement of its","of its creator","its creator ,","creator , Barbara",", Barbara Hulanicki"],"2grams":["Barbara Hulanicki","Hulanicki will","will always","always be","be remembered","remembered for","for BIBA","BIBA ,",", the","the shop","shop that","that changed","changed the","the face","face of","of UK","UK fashion","fashion in","in the","the 1960s","1960s and","and 70s","A phenomenon","phenomenon in","in the","the truest","truest sense","sense of","of the","the word","word ,",", BIBA","BIBA would","would leave","leave an","an indelible","indelible mark","mark on","on the","the minds","minds and","and wardrobes","wardrobes of","of the","the customers","customers who","who ventured","ventured through","through its","its doors","Following its","its closure","closure in","in 1976","1976 ,",", many","many have","have attempted","attempted to","to reproduce","reproduce the","the magic","All have","have missed","missed the","the key","key ingredient","ingredient :",": the","the involvement","involvement of","of its","its creator","creator ,",", Barbara","Barbara Hulanicki"]}

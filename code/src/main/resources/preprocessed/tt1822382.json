{"title":"Reagan","plot":"Ronald Reagan as a man, as compared to his legacy, is rich territory for exploration, and a line from Shakespeare's Julius Caesar is just one of the many things that springs to mind after viewing filmmaker Eugene Jarecki's latest opus, Reagan (Jarecki's Why We Fight won the 2005 Sundance Film Festival Grand Jury Prize: Documentary). Speaking at his funeral, Mark Antony said of Caesar, \"The evil that men do lives after them; the good is oft interred with their bones.\" With a firm grasp of Reagan's story, Jarecki avoids the predictable and takes the long view on Reagan's life and influence, while staying centered on him as a man of deep contradiction; an American whose patriotism paradoxically led him to impeachable acts, a liberal Democrat who came to define the modern conservative movement.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Ronald","Reagan","as","a","man",",","as","compar","to","his","legaci",",","is","rich","territori","for","explor",",","and","a","line","from","Shakespear","'s","Julius","Caesar","is","just","one","of","the","mani","thing","that","spring","to","mind","after","view","filmmak","Eugen","Jarecki","'s","latest","opus",",","Reagan","(","Jarecki","'s","Whi","We","Fight","won","the","2005","Sundanc","Film","Festiv","Grand","Juri","Prize",":","Documentari",")",".","Speak","at","his","funer",",","Mark","Antoni","said","of","Caesar",",","\"","The","evil","that","men","do","live","after","them",";","the","good","is","oft","inter","with","their","bone",".","\"","With","a","firm","grasp","of","Reagan","'s","stori",",","Jarecki","avoid","the","predict","and","take","the","long","view","on","Reagan","'s","life","and","influenc",",","while","stay","center","on","him","as","a","man","of","deep","contradict",";","an","American","whose","patriot","paradox","led","him","to","impeach","act",",","a","liber","Democrat","who","came","to","defin","the","modern","conserv","movement","."],"lemmas":["Ronald","Reagan","as","a","man",",","as","compare","to","he","legacy",",","be","rich","territory","for","exploration",",","and","a","line","from","Shakespeare","'s","Julius","Caesar","be","just","one","of","the","many","thing","that","spring","to","mind","after","view","filmmaker","Eugene","Jarecki","'s","latest","opus",",","Reagan","-lrb-","Jarecki","'s","why","we","fight","win","the","2005","Sundance","Film","Festival","Grand","Jury","Prize",":","documentary","-rrb-",".","speak","at","he","funeral",",","Mark","Antony","say","of","Caesar",",","``","the","evil","that","man","do","life","after","they",";","the","good","be","oft","inter","with","they","bone",".","''","with","a","firm","grasp","of","Reagan","'s","story",",","Jarecki","avoid","the","predictable","and","take","the","long","view","on","Reagan","'s","life","and","influence",",","while","stay","centered","on","he","as","a","man","of","deep","contradiction",";","a","american","whose","patriotism","paradoxically","lead","he","to","impeachable","act",",","a","liberal","Democrat","who","come","to","define","the","modern","conservative","movement","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ronald Reagan as","Reagan as a","as a man","a man ,","man , as",", as compared","as compared to","compared to his","to his legacy","his legacy ,","legacy , is",", is rich","is rich territory","rich territory for","territory for exploration","for exploration ,","exploration , and",", and a","and a line","a line from","line from Shakespeare","from Shakespeare 's","Shakespeare 's Julius","'s Julius Caesar","Julius Caesar is","Caesar is just","is just one","just one of","one of the","of the many","the many things","many things that","things that springs","that springs to","springs to mind","to mind after","mind after viewing","after viewing filmmaker","viewing filmmaker Eugene","filmmaker Eugene Jarecki","Eugene Jarecki 's","Jarecki 's latest","'s latest opus","latest opus ,","opus , Reagan",", Reagan (","Reagan ( Jarecki","( Jarecki 's","Jarecki 's Why","'s Why We","Why We Fight","We Fight won","Fight won the","won the 2005","the 2005 Sundance","2005 Sundance Film","Sundance Film Festival","Film Festival Grand","Festival Grand Jury","Grand Jury Prize","Jury Prize :","Prize : Documentary",": Documentary )","Speaking at his","at his funeral","his funeral ,","funeral , Mark",", Mark Antony","Mark Antony said","Antony said of","said of Caesar","of Caesar ,","Caesar , \"",", \" The","\" The evil","The evil that","evil that men","that men do","men do lives","do lives after","lives after them","after them ;","them ;

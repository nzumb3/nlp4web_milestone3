{"title":"Kirill Sokolov","plot":"Kirill Sokolov (1930 - 2004) trained as an artist in Moscow, under the Stalinist dictatorship. His interest in Western art during the Soviet years was considered dangerously subversive and had to be explored in secret. Following his wedding to British research student Avril Pyman (in the first foreign marriage personally approved by Krushchev himself), he moved to north-east England and overcoming depression and artistic isolation gained a reputation as a leading international artist. The documentary explores his story through his art and his widow Avril Sokolov.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Kiril","Sokolov","(","1930","-","2004",")","train","as","an","artist","in","Moscow",",","under","the","Stalinist","dictatorship",".","His","interest","in","Western","art","dure","the","Soviet","year","was","consid","danger","subvers","and","had","to","be","explor","in","secret",".","Follow","his","wed","to","British","research","student","Avril","Pyman","(","in","the","first","foreign","marriag","person","approv","by","Krushchev","himself",")",",","he","move","to","north-east","England","and","overcom","depress","and","artist","isol","gain","a","reput","as","a","lead","intern","artist",".","The","documentari","explor","his","stori","through","his","art","and","his","widow","Avril","Sokolov","."],"lemmas":["Kirill","Sokolov","-lrb-","1930","-","2004","-rrb-","train","as","a","artist","in","Moscow",",","under","the","Stalinist","dictatorship",".","he","interest","in","western","art","during","the","soviet","year","be","consider","dangerously","subversive","and","have","to","be","explore","in","secret",".","follow","he","wedding","to","british","research","student","Avril","Pyman","-lrb-","in","the","first","foreign","marriage","personally","approve","by","Krushchev","himself","-rrb-",",","he","move","to","north-east","England","and","overcome","depression","and","artistic","isolation","gain","a","reputation","as","a","lead","international","artist",".","the","documentary","explore","he","story","through","he","art","and","he","widow","Avril","Sokolov","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kirill Sokolov (","Sokolov ( 1930","( 1930 -","1930 - 2004","- 2004 )","2004 ) trained",") trained as","trained as an","as an artist","an artist in","artist in Moscow","in Moscow ,","Moscow , under",", under the","under the Stalinist","the Stalinist dictatorship","His interest in","interest in Western","in Western art","Western art during","art during the","during the Soviet","the Soviet years","Soviet years was","years was considered","was considered dangerously","considered dangerously subversive","dangerously subversive and","subversive and had","and had to","had to be","to be explored","be explored in","explored in secret","Following his wedding","his wedding to","wedding to British","to British research","British research student","research student Avril","student Avril Pyman","Avril Pyman (","Pyman ( in","( in the","in the first","the first foreign","first foreign marriage","foreign marriage personally","marriage personally approved","personally approved by","approved by Krushchev","by Krushchev himself","Krushchev himself )","himself ) ,",") , he",", he moved","he moved to","moved to north-east","to north-east England","north-east England and","England and overcoming","and overcoming depression","overcoming depression and","depression and artistic","and artistic isolation","artistic isolation gained","isolation gained a","gained a reputation","a reputation as","reputation as a","as a leading","a leading international","leading international artist","The documentary explores","documentary explores his","explores his story","his story through","story through his","through his art","his art and","art and his","and his widow","his widow Avril","widow Avril Sokolov"],"2grams":["Kirill Sokolov","Sokolov (","( 1930","1930 -","- 2004","2004 )",") trained","trained as","as an","an artist","artist in","in Moscow","Moscow ,",", under","under the","the Stalinist","Stalinist dictatorship","His interest","interest in","in Western","Western art","art during","during the","the Soviet","Soviet years","years was","was considered","considered dangerously","dangerously subversive","subversive and","and had","had to","to be","be explored","explored in","in secret","Following his","his wedding","wedding to","to British","British research","research student","student Avril","Avril Pyman","Pyman (","( in","in the","the first","first foreign","foreign marriage","marriage personally","personally approved","approved by","by Krushchev","Krushchev himself","himself )",") ,",", he","he moved","moved to","to north-east","north-east England","England and","and overcoming","overcoming depression","depression and","and artistic","artistic isolation","isolation gained","gained a","a reputation","reputation as","as a","a leading","leading international","international artist","The documentary","documentary explores","explores his","his story","story through","through his","his art","art and","and his","his widow","widow Avril","Avril Sokolov"]}

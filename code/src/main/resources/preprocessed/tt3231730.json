{"title":"Morgan Agren's Conundrum: A Percussive Misadventure","plot":"What do Frank Zappa, Devin Townsend, and Fredrik Thordendal of Meshuggah have in common? They all re-invented rock music, and they all selected Morgan as their drummer. Yet his 'intentionally broken' and complex drumming makes most musicians plug their ears, go home and practice, or just quit. Praised only by the enlightened few, this 45-year-old husband and humble father remains unknown to popular music listeners. But why? Watch this 2-hour documentary as Morgan visits L.A. in search of an answer to his continuing conundrum: 'The Music or The Money?' Special Guest Appearances by Mats Oberg, Devin Townsend, Marco Minnemann, Mike Keneally, Dweezil Zappa, Tosin Abasi, Thomas Lang, Danny Carey, Brendon Small, Dave Elitch, Simon Phillips, Joe Travers, Raanen Bozzio, Daedelus And Others.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["What","do","Frank","Zappa",",","Devin","Townsend",",","and","Fredrik","Thordend","of","Meshuggah","have","in","common","?","They","all","re-inv","rock","music",",","and","they","all","select","Morgan","as","their","drummer",".","Yet","his","'","intent","broken","'","and","complex","drum","make","most","musician","plug","their","ear",",","go","home","and","practic",",","or","just","quit",".","Prais","onli","by","the","enlighten","few",",","this","45-year-old","husband","and","humbl","father","remain","unknown","to","popular","music","listen",".","But","whi","?","Watch","this","2-hour","documentari","as","Morgan","visit","L.A.","in","search","of","an","answer","to","his","continu","conundrum",":","'","The","Music","or","The","Money","?","'","Special","Guest","Appearanc","by","Mat","Oberg",",","Devin","Townsend",",","Marco","Minnemann",",","Mike","Keneal",",","Dweezil","Zappa",",","Tosin","Abasi",",","Thoma","Lang",",","Danni","Carey",",","Brendon","Small",",","Dave","Elitch",",","Simon","Phillip",",","Joe","Traver",",","Raanen","Bozzio",",","Daedelus","And","Other","."],"lemmas":["what","do","Frank","Zappa",",","Devin","Townsend",",","and","Fredrik","Thordendal","of","Meshuggah","have","in","common","?","they","all","re-invented","rock","music",",","and","they","all","select","Morgan","as","they","drummer",".","yet","he","'","intentionally","broken","'","and","complex","drum","make","most","musician","plug","they","ear",",","go","home","and","practice",",","or","just","quit",".","praise","only","by","the","enlighten","few",",","this","45-year-old","husband","and","humble","father","remain","unknown","to","popular","music","listener",".","but","why","?","watch","this","2-hour","documentary","as","Morgan","visit","L.A.","in","search","of","a","answer","to","he","continue","conundrum",":","'","the","Music","or","The","Money","?","'","special","Guest","Appearances","by","Mats","Oberg",",","Devin","Townsend",",","Marco","Minnemann",",","Mike","Keneally",",","Dweezil","Zappa",",","Tosin","Abasi",",","Thomas","Lang",",","Danny","Carey",",","Brendon","Small",",","Dave","Elitch",",","Simon","Phillips",",","Joe","Travers",",","Raanen","Bozzio",",","Daedelus","and","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What do Frank","do Frank Zappa","Frank Zappa ,","Zappa , Devin",", Devin Townsend","Devin Townsend ,","Townsend , and",", and Fredrik","and Fredrik Thordendal","Fredrik Thordendal of","Thordendal of Meshuggah","of Meshuggah have","Meshuggah have in","have in common","They all re-invented","all re-invented rock","re-invented rock music","rock music ,","music , and",", and they","and they all","they all selected","all selected Morgan","selected Morgan as","Morgan as their","as their drummer","Yet his '","his ' intentionally","' intentionally broken","intentionally broken '","broken ' and","' and complex","and complex drumming","complex drumming makes","drumming makes most","makes most musicians","most musicians plug","musicians plug their","plug their ears","their ears ,","ears , go",", go home","go home and","home and practice","and practice ,","practice , or",", or just","or just quit","Praised only by","only by the","by the enlightened","the enlightened few","enlightened few ,","few , this",", this 45-year-old","this 45-year-old husband","45-year-old husband and","husband and humble","and humble father","humble father remains","father remains unknown","remains unknown to","unknown to popular","to popular music","popular music listeners","Watch this 2-hour","this 2-hour documentary","2-hour documentary as","documentary as Morgan","as Morgan visits","Morgan visits L.A.","visits L.A. in","L.A. in search","in search of","search of an","of an answer","an answer to","answer to his","to his continuing","his continuing conundrum","continuing conundrum :","conundrum : '",": ' The","' The Music","The Music or","Music or The","or The Money","The Money ?","Money ?

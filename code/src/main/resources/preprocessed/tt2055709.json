{"title":"Blindsided","plot":"It's New Year's Eve in New York City and everyone's getting ready to party. Watching, waiting, a man called Hollander has a different kind of party in mind. Alone in her high-rise apartment, Sara has no idea that her boyfriend was a thief. But what he stole - and from whom - is about to put her life on the line. Trapped in the penthouse with Hollander and his sadistic partner, these two will kill, maim, tear the place apart to find a fortune in diamonds. While the party rages outside, inside Sara fights desperately for her life. It's kill or be killed in a pulse-pounding , non-stop fight to the finish - and it all takes place in Penthouse North.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["It","'s","New","Year","'s","Eve","in","New","York","Citi","and","everyon","'s","get","readi","to","parti",".","Watch",",","wait",",","a","man","call","Holland","has","a","differ","kind","of","parti","in","mind",".","Alone","in","her","high-ris","apart",",","Sara","has","no","idea","that","her","boyfriend","was","a","thief",".","But","what","he","stole","-","and","from","whom","-","is","about","to","put","her","life","on","the","line",".","Trap","in","the","penthous","with","Holland","and","his","sadist","partner",",","these","two","will","kill",",","maim",",","tear","the","place","apart","to","find","a","fortun","in","diamond",".","While","the","parti","rage","outsid",",","insid","Sara","fight","desper","for","her","life",".","It","'s","kill","or","be","kill","in","a","pulse-pound",",","non-stop","fight","to","the","finish","-","and","it","all","take","place","in","Penthous","North","."],"lemmas":["it","be","New","Year","'s","Eve","in","New","York","City","and","everyone","'s","get","ready","to","party",".","watch",",","wait",",","a","man","call","Hollander","have","a","different","kind","of","party","in","mind",".","alone","in","she","high-rise","apartment",",","Sara","have","no","idea","that","she","boyfriend","be","a","thief",".","but","what","he","steal","-","and","from","whom","-","be","about","to","put","she","life","on","the","line",".","trap","in","the","penthouse","with","Hollander","and","he","sadistic","partner",",","these","two","will","kill",",","maim",",","tear","the","place","apart","to","find","a","fortune","in","diamond",".","while","the","party","rage","outside",",","inside","Sara","fight","desperately","for","she","life",".","it","be","kill","or","be","kill","in","a","pulse-pounding",",","non-stop","fight","to","the","finish","-","and","it","all","take","place","in","Penthouse","North","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It 's New","'s New Year","New Year 's","Year 's Eve","'s Eve in","Eve in New","in New York","New York City","York City and","City and everyone","and everyone 's","everyone 's getting","'s getting ready","getting ready to","ready to party","Watching , waiting",", waiting ,","waiting , a",", a man","a man called","man called Hollander","called Hollander has","Hollander has a","has a different","a different kind","different kind of","kind of party","of party in","party in mind","Alone in her","in her high-rise","her high-rise apartment","high-rise apartment ,","apartment , Sara",", Sara has","Sara has no","has no idea","no idea that","idea that her","that her boyfriend","her boyfriend was","boyfriend was a","was a thief","But what he","what he stole","he stole -","stole -

The world of constant appreciation. The world of constant recognition. The question is despite all odds, all competition, does this overly reactive middle aged teenager make it? Yes and No.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","desir","to","be","famous","is","as","old","as","the","desir","to","desir",".","The","stori","of","countless","mani",",","yet","can","this","one","stand","apart",".","Fame","has","anoth","wannabe-queen",",","anoth","to-be-victim",",","anoth","doormat",".","Optimist","girl","wear","opportunist","glass","set","out","into","a","world","most","(","even","if","they","have","n't","admit","it","to","themselv","yet",")","want","to","be","in",".","The","world","of","fame",".","The","world","of","movi",".","The","world","of","constant","appreci",".","The","world","of","constant","recognit",".","The","question","is","despit","all","odd",",","all","competit",",","doe","this","over","reactiv","middl","age","teenag","make","it","?","Yes","and","No","."],"lemmas":["the","desire","to","be","famous","be","as","old","as","the","desire","to","desire",".","the","story","of","countless","many",",","yet","can","this","one","stand","apart",".","Fame","have","another","wannabe-queen",",","another","to-be-victim",",","another","doormat",".","optimistic","girl","wear","opportunistic","glass","set","out","into","a","world","most","-lrb-","even","if","they","have","not","admit","it","to","themselves","yet","-rrb-","want","to","be","in",".","the","world","of","fame",".","the","world","of","movie",".","the","world","of","constant","appreciation",".","the","world","of","constant","recognition",".","the","question","be","despite","all","odds",",","all","competition",",","do","this","overly","reactive","middle","aged","teenager","make","it","?","Yes","and","No","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The desire to","desire to be","to be famous","be famous is","famous is as","is as old","as old as","old as the","as the desire","the desire to","desire to desire","The story of","story of countless","of countless many","countless many ,","many , yet",", yet can","yet can this","can this one","this one stand","one stand apart","Fame has another","has another wannabe-queen","another wannabe-queen ,","wannabe-queen , another",", another to-be-victim","another to-be-victim ,","to-be-victim , another",", another doormat","Optimistic girl wearing","girl wearing opportunistic","wearing opportunistic glasses","opportunistic glasses sets","glasses sets out","sets out into","out into a","into a world","a world most","world most (","most ( even","( even if","even if they","if they have","they have n't","have n't admitted","n't admitted it","admitted it to","it to themselves","to themselves yet","themselves yet )","yet ) want",") want to","want to be","to be in","The world of","world of fame","The world of","world of movies","The world of","world of constant","of constant appreciation","The world of","world of constant","of constant recognition","The question is","question is despite","is despite all","despite all odds","all odds ,","odds , all",", all competition","all competition ,","competition , does",", does this","does this overly","this overly reactive","overly reactive middle","reactive middle aged","middle aged teenager","aged teenager make","teenager make it","Yes and No"],"2grams":["The desire","desire to","to be","be famous","famous is","is as","as old","old as","as the","the desire","desire to","to desire","The story","story of","of countless","countless many","many ,",", yet","yet can","can this","this one","one stand","stand apart","Fame has","has another","another wannabe-queen","wannabe-queen ,",", another","another to-be-victim","to-be-victim ,",", another","another doormat","Optimistic girl","girl wearing","wearing opportunistic","opportunistic glasses","glasses sets","sets out","out into","into a","a world","world most","most (","( even","even if","if they","they have","have n't","n't admitted","admitted it","it to","to themselves","themselves yet","yet )",") want","want to","to be","be in","The world","world of","of fame","The world","world of","of movies","The world","world of","of constant","constant appreciation","The world","world of","of constant","constant recognition","The question","question is","is despite","despite all","all odds","odds ,",", all","all competition","competition ,",", does","does this","this overly","overly reactive","reactive middle","middle aged","aged teenager","teenager make","make it","Yes and","and No"]}

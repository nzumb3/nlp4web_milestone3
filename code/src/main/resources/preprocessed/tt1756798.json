{"title":"The Cold Equations","plot":"When relief pilot John Barton is sent on an emergency rescue mission to an unexplored planet, he is shocked to find young Marilyn Cross hiding aboard his ship. Barton discovers they have only enough fuel to carry himself and his precious cargo, and Marilyn's added weight insures that they will crash if she stays on board. They have gone too far to turn back, and the computer calculations have made it brutally clear: Someone must go, or all will die.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","relief","pilot","John","Barton","is","sent","on","an","emerg","rescu","mission","to","an","unexplor","planet",",","he","is","shock","to","find","young","Marilyn","Cross","hide","aboard","his","ship",".","Barton","discov","they","have","onli","enough","fuel","to","carri","himself","and","his","precious","cargo",",","and","Marilyn","'s","ad","weight","insur","that","they","will","crash","if","she","stay","on","board",".","They","have","gone","too","far","to","turn","back",",","and","the","comput","calcul","have","made","it","brutal","clear",":","Someon","must","go",",","or","all","will","die","."],"lemmas":["when","relief","pilot","John","Barton","be","send","on","a","emergency","rescue","mission","to","a","unexplored","planet",",","he","be","shock","to","find","young","Marilyn","Cross","hiding","aboard","he","ship",".","Barton","discover","they","have","only","enough","fuel","to","carry","himself","and","he","precious","cargo",",","and","Marilyn","'s","add","weight","insure","that","they","will","crash","if","she","stay","on","board",".","they","have","go","too","far","to","turn","back",",","and","the","computer","calculation","have","make","it","brutally","clear",":","someone","must","go",",","or","all","will","die","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When relief pilot","relief pilot John","pilot John Barton","John Barton is","Barton is sent","is sent on","sent on an","on an emergency","an emergency rescue","emergency rescue mission","rescue mission to","mission to an","to an unexplored","an unexplored planet","unexplored planet ,","planet , he",", he is","he is shocked","is shocked to","shocked to find","to find young","find young Marilyn","young Marilyn Cross","Marilyn Cross hiding","Cross hiding aboard","hiding aboard his","aboard his ship","Barton discovers they","discovers they have","they have only","have only enough","only enough fuel","enough fuel to","fuel to carry","to carry himself","carry himself and","himself and his","and his precious","his precious cargo","precious cargo ,","cargo , and",", and Marilyn","and Marilyn 's","Marilyn 's added","'s added weight","added weight insures","weight insures that","insures that they","that they will","they will crash","will crash if","crash if she","if she stays","she stays on","stays on board","They have gone","have gone too","gone too far","too far to","far to turn","to turn back","turn back ,","back , and",", and the","and the computer","the computer calculations","computer calculations have","calculations have made","have made it","made it brutally","it brutally clear","brutally clear :","clear : Someone",": Someone must","Someone must go","must go ,","go , or",", or all","or all will","all will die"],"2grams":["When relief","relief pilot","pilot John","John Barton","Barton is","is sent","sent on","on an","an emergency","emergency rescue","rescue mission","mission to","to an","an unexplored","unexplored planet","planet ,",", he","he is","is shocked","shocked to","to find","find young","young Marilyn","Marilyn Cross","Cross hiding","hiding aboard","aboard his","his ship","Barton discovers","discovers they","they have","have only","only enough","enough fuel","fuel to","to carry","carry himself","himself and","and his","his precious","precious cargo","cargo ,",", and","and Marilyn","Marilyn 's","'s added","added weight","weight insures","insures that","that they","they will","will crash","crash if","if she","she stays","stays on","on board","They have","have gone","gone too","too far","far to","to turn","turn back","back ,",", and","and the","the computer","computer calculations","calculations have","have made","made it","it brutally","brutally clear","clear :",": Someone","Someone must","must go","go ,",", or","or all","all will","will die"]}

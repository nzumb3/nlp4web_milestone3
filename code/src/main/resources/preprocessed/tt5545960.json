{"title":"Balls","plot":"A short form documentary about the body part most associated with manhood and what happens when that's taken away. Our society imbues a man's testicles with the constructs of masculinity, sexuality, virility and overall male-hood. So what happens when a man is faced with losing one or both? There are four main incidents that can lead a man to be faced with the removal of a ball - testicular cancer, torsion, an infection, or gender reassignment. An exploration around the decision to replace or not replace, options of replacements, dating and disclosure, parenthood possibilities, and likely most importantly the psychology surrounding moving forward without feeling emasculated make Balls well rounded, talk-worthy, and shareable.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","short","form","documentari","about","the","bodi","part","most","associ","with","manhood","and","what","happen","when","that","'s","taken","away",".","Our","societi","imbu","a","man","'s","testicl","with","the","construct","of","masculin",",","sexual",",","viril","and","overal","male-hood",".","So","what","happen","when","a","man","is","face","with","lose","one","or","both","?","There","are","four","main","incid","that","can","lead","a","man","to","be","face","with","the","remov","of","a","ball","-","testicular","cancer",",","torsion",",","an","infect",",","or","gender","reassign",".","An","explor","around","the","decis","to","replac","or","not","replac",",","option","of","replac",",","date","and","disclosur",",","parenthood","possibl",",","and","like","most","import","the","psycholog","surround","move","forward","without","feel","emascul","make","Ball","well","round",",","talk-worthi",",","and","shareabl","."],"lemmas":["a","short","form","documentary","about","the","body","part","most","associate","with","manhood","and","what","happen","when","that","be","take","away",".","we","society","imbue","a","man","'s","testicle","with","the","construct","of","masculinity",",","sexuality",",","virility","and","overall","male-hood",".","so","what","happen","when","a","man","be","face","with","lose","one","or","both","?","there","be","four","main","incident","that","can","lead","a","man","to","be","face","with","the","removal","of","a","ball","-","testicular","cancer",",","torsion",",","a","infection",",","or","gender","reassignment",".","a","exploration","around","the","decision","to","replace","or","not","replace",",","option","of","replacement",",","date","and","disclosure",",","parenthood","possibility",",","and","likely","most","importantly","the","psychology","surrounding","move","forward","without","feel","emasculate","make","ball","well","round",",","talk-worthy",",","and","shareable","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A short form","short form documentary","form documentary about","documentary about the","about the body","the body part","body part most","part most associated","most associated with","associated with manhood","with manhood and","manhood and what","and what happens","what happens when","happens when that","when that 's","that 's taken","'s taken away","Our society imbues","society imbues a","imbues a man","a man 's","man 's testicles","'s testicles with","testicles with the","with the constructs","the constructs of","constructs of masculinity","of masculinity ,","masculinity , sexuality",", sexuality ,","sexuality , virility",", virility and","virility and overall","and overall male-hood","So what happens","what happens when","happens when a","when a man","a man is","man is faced","is faced with","faced with losing","with losing one","losing one or","one or both","There are four","are four main","four main incidents","main incidents that","incidents that can","that can lead","can lead a","lead a man","a man to","man to be","to be faced","be faced with","faced with the","with the removal","the removal of","removal of a","of a ball","a ball -","ball -

{"title":"YERT: Your Environmental Road Trip","plot":"YERT (Your Environmental Road Trip) is an adventure and a celebration of the American spirit in the face of adversity - a thought-provoking, inspiring, and sometimes hilarious, documentary about the courageous and creative individuals, groups, businesses and leaders of this country who are tackling the greatest environmental threats in history. Called into action by the ever increasing threats of planetary catastrophe (from climate change to toxic pollution, from water scarcity to habitat destruction), the three of us - Mark Dixon, Ben Evans, and Julie Dingman Evans - upended our lives, pooled our collective life-savings, and set off on a first-of-its-kind, 50-state, year-long journey of discovery to personalize sustainability and to answer a critical question: Are we doomed?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["YERT","(","Your","Environment","Road","Trip",")","is","an","adventur","and","a","celebr","of","the","American","spirit","in","the","face","of","advers","-","a","thought-provok",",","inspir",",","and","sometim","hilari",",","documentari","about","the","courag","and","creativ","individu",",","group",",","busi","and","leader","of","this","countri","who","are","tackl","the","greatest","environment","threat","in","histori",".","Call","into","action","by","the","ever","increas","threat","of","planetari","catastroph","(","from","climat","chang","to","toxic","pollut",",","from","water","scarciti","to","habitat","destruct",")",",","the","three","of","us","-","Mark","Dixon",",","Ben","Evan",",","and","Juli","Dingman","Evan","-","upend","our","live",",","pool","our","collect","life-sav",",","and","set","off","on","a","first-of-its-kind",",","50-state",",","year-long","journey","of","discoveri","to","person","sustain","and","to","answer","a","critic","question",":","Are","we","doom","?"],"lemmas":["yert","-lrb-","you","Environmental","Road","Trip","-rrb-","be","a","adventure","and","a","celebration","of","the","american","spirit","in","the","face","of","adversity","-","a","thought-provoking",",","inspiring",",","and","sometimes","hilarious",",","documentary","about","the","courageous","and","creative","individual",",","group",",","business","and","leader","of","this","country","who","be","tackle","the","greatest","environmental","threat","in","history",".","call","into","action","by","the","ever","increase","threat","of","planetary","catastrophe","-lrb-","from","climate","change","to","toxic","pollution",",","from","water","scarcity","to","habitat","destruction","-rrb-",",","the","three","of","we","-","Mark","Dixon",",","Ben","Evans",",","and","Julie","Dingman","Evans","-","upend","we","life",",","pool","we","collective","life-savings",",","and","set","off","on","a","first-of-its-kind",",","50-state",",","year-long","journey","of","discovery","to","personalize","sustainability","and","to","answer","a","critical","question",":","be","we","doom","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["YERT ( Your","( Your Environmental","Your Environmental Road","Environmental Road Trip","Road Trip )","Trip ) is",") is an","is an adventure","an adventure and","adventure and a","and a celebration","a celebration of","celebration of the","of the American","the American spirit","American spirit in","spirit in the","in the face","the face of","face of adversity","of adversity -","adversity -

{"title":"War Reporter","plot":"January 2011. Events in Tunisia triggered massive uprisings throughout the Arab world. It was a historical moment that could not be missed by the journalists on the ground. They were the soldiers in the shadows, constantly on a quest for information and the truth. They operated as our eyes and our ears, even in the midst of the most violent conflicts, sometimes at the expense of their own lives. Lucas, Nicolas, Rémi, Nassim, Eyad and Ahmad are the reporters in WAR REPORTER, as the film follows them on their perilous journey starting from Tunisia through Egypt, Libya and Syria.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Januari","2011",".","Event","in","Tunisia","trigger","massiv","upris","throughout","the","Arab","world",".","It","was","a","histor","moment","that","could","not","be","miss","by","the","journalist","on","the","ground",".","They","were","the","soldier","in","the","shadow",",","constant","on","a","quest","for","inform","and","the","truth",".","They","oper","as","our","eye","and","our","ear",",","even","in","the","midst","of","the","most","violent","conflict",",","sometim","at","the","expens","of","their","own","live",".","Luca",",","Nicola",",","Rémi",",","Nassim",",","Eyad","and","Ahmad","are","the","report","in","WAR","REPORTER",",","as","the","film","follow","them","on","their","peril","journey","start","from","Tunisia","through","Egypt",",","Libya","and","Syria","."],"lemmas":["January","2011",".","event","in","Tunisia","trigger","massive","uprising","throughout","the","Arab","world",".","it","be","a","historical","moment","that","could","not","be","miss","by","the","journalist","on","the","ground",".","they","be","the","soldier","in","the","shadow",",","constantly","on","a","quest","for","information","and","the","truth",".","they","operate","as","we","eye","and","we","ear",",","even","in","the","midst","of","the","most","violent","conflict",",","sometimes","at","the","expense","of","they","own","life",".","Lucas",",","Nicolas",",","Rémi",",","Nassim",",","Eyad","and","Ahmad","be","the","reporter","in","war","reporter",",","as","the","film","follow","they","on","they","perilous","journey","start","from","Tunisia","through","Egypt",",","Libya","and","Syria","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Events

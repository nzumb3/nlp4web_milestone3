{"title":"Whimsy: The Scot Augustson Odyssey","plot":"Whimsy is a stylized and playfully constructed feature-length documentary about the life and work of Seattle's mercurial playwright, Scot Augustson. His shadow puppet theater is bawdy, whimsical and irreverent with a sense of heart. Whimsy draws the viewer into Scot's imaginative world, where they discover that self-doubt, loneliness and regret are his constant companions. Whimsy documents the production of Scot's latest shadow puppet creation 'Where the River Styx Meets Route 66,' a hilarious adaptation of Homer's Odyssey performed in a circus tent. By blending elements of magical realism and fiction, the documentary relies on non-traditional story telling to evoke curiosity and create an atmosphere of spectacle.","genres":["Biography","

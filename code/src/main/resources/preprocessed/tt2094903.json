{"title":"On Down the Line","plot":"Our story concerns a couple in their early 30s - Paul and Molly - who inherit a river house on a plot of land just outside of Austin, Texas. They excitedly spend their nights and weekends there, fixing it up and trying to get a hang of rural life. Gordon, a farmer in his 50s who has leased and tended the acreage for decades, is hesitant to accept his new landlords as members of his home; Molly and Paul have not yet earned their country credentials, so he takes it upon himself to test their fortitude. As Gordon's trials intensify the couple is faced with the threatening consequences of their own inexperience.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Our","stori","concern","a","coupl","in","their","earli","30s","-","Paul","and","Molli","-","who","inherit","a","river","hous","on","a","plot","of","land","just","outsid","of","Austin",",","Texa",".","They","excit","spend","their","night","and","weekend","there",",","fix","it","up","and","tri","to","get","a","hang","of","rural","life",".","Gordon",",","a","farmer","in","his","50s","who","has","leas","and","tend","the","acreag","for","decad",",","is","hesit","to","accept","his","new","landlord","as","member","of","his","home",";","Molli","and","Paul","have","not","yet","earn","their","countri","credenti",",","so","he","take","it","upon","himself","to","test","their","fortitud",".","As","Gordon","'s","trial","intensifi","the","coupl","is","face","with","the","threaten","consequ","of","their","own","inexperi","."],"lemmas":["we","story","concern","a","couple","in","they","early","30","-","Paul","and","Molly","-","who","inherit","a","river","house","on","a","plot","of","land","just","outside","of","Austin",",","Texas",".","they","excitedly","spend","they","night","and","weekend","there",",","fix","it","up","and","try","to","get","a","hang","of","rural","life",".","Gordon",",","a","farmer","in","he","50","who","have","lease","and","tend","the","acreage","for","decade",",","be","hesitant","to","accept","he","new","landlord","as","member","of","he","home",";","Molly","and","Paul","have","not","yet","earn","they","country","credentials",",","so","he","take","it","upon","himself","to","test","they","fortitude",".","as","Gordon","'s","trial","intensify","the","couple","be","face","with","the","threatening","consequence","of","they","own","inexperience","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Our story concerns","story concerns a","concerns a couple","a couple in","couple in their","in their early","their early 30s","early 30s -","30s - Paul","- Paul and","Paul and Molly","and Molly -","Molly - who","- who inherit","who inherit a","inherit a river","a river house","river house on","house on a","on a plot","a plot of","plot of land","of land just","land just outside","just outside of","outside of Austin","of Austin ,","Austin , Texas","They excitedly spend","excitedly spend their","spend their nights","their nights and","nights and weekends","and weekends there","weekends there ,","there , fixing",", fixing it","fixing it up","it up and","up and trying","and trying to","trying to get","to get a","get a hang","a hang of","hang of rural","of rural life","Gordon , a",", a farmer","a farmer in","farmer in his","in his 50s","his 50s who","50s who has","who has leased","has leased and","leased and tended","and tended the","tended the acreage","the acreage for","acreage for decades","for decades ,","decades , is",", is hesitant","is hesitant to","hesitant to accept","to accept his","accept his new","his new landlords","new landlords as","landlords as members","as members of","members of his","of his home","his home ;","home ;

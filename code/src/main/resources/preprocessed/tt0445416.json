{"title":"Hawa Kay Naam","plot":"Hawa Kay Naam (For a place under the Heavens) is Sabiha's personal journey through the Islamization of Pakistan. From her own perspective, she depicts the transformation of the Pakistani from a vibrant, liberal society into a more conservative, religious-oriented one. Sabiha interviews five women, in search of answers regarding the issue of this growing religiosity. Why are more and more women taking to the hijab when there is no state directive to do so? What is the true nature of this creeping Islamization? What are the liberal forces doing?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Hawa","Kay","Naam","(","For","a","place","under","the","Heaven",")","is","Sabiha","'s","person","journey","through","the","Islamiz","of","Pakistan",".","From","her","own","perspect",",","she","depict","the","transform","of","the","Pakistani","from","a","vibrant",",","liber","societi","into","a","more","conserv",",","religious-ori","one",".","Sabiha","interview","five","women",",","in","search","of","answer","regard","the","issu","of","this","grow","religios",".","Whi","are","more","and","more","women","take","to","the","hijab","when","there","is","no","state","direct","to","do","so","?","What","is","the","true","natur","of","this","creep","Islamiz","?","What","are","the","liber","forc","do","?"],"lemmas":["Hawa","Kay","Naam","-lrb-","for","a","place","under","the","heaven","-rrb-","be","Sabiha","'s","personal","journey","through","the","Islamization","of","Pakistan",".","from","she","own","perspective",",","she","depict","the","transformation","of","the","Pakistani","from","a","vibrant",",","liberal","society","into","a","more","conservative",",","religious-oriented","one",".","Sabiha","interview","five","woman",",","in","search","of","answer","regard","the","issue","of","this","grow","religiosity",".","why","be","more","and","more","woman","take","to","the","hijab","when","there","be","no","state","directive","to","do","so","?","what","be","the","true","nature","of","this","creep","islamization","?","what","be","the","liberal","force","do","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hawa Kay Naam","Kay Naam (","Naam ( For","( For a","For a place","a place under","place under the","under the Heavens","the Heavens )","Heavens ) is",") is Sabiha","is Sabiha 's","Sabiha 's personal","'s personal journey","personal journey through","journey through the","through the Islamization","the Islamization of","Islamization of Pakistan","From her own","her own perspective","own perspective ,","perspective , she",", she depicts","she depicts the","depicts the transformation","the transformation of","transformation of the","of the Pakistani","the Pakistani from","Pakistani from a","from a vibrant","a vibrant ,","vibrant , liberal",", liberal society","liberal society into","society into a","into a more","a more conservative","more conservative ,","conservative , religious-oriented",", religious-oriented one","Sabiha interviews five","interviews five women","five women ,","women , in",", in search","in search of","search of answers","of answers regarding","answers regarding the","regarding the issue","the issue of","issue of this","of this growing","this growing religiosity","Why are more","are more and","more and more","and more women","more women taking","women taking to","taking to the","to the hijab","the hijab when","hijab when there","when there is","there is no","is no state","no state directive","state directive to","directive to do","to do so","What is the","is the true","the true nature","true nature of","nature of this","of this creeping","this creeping Islamization","What are the","are the liberal","the liberal forces","liberal forces doing"],"2grams":["Hawa Kay","Kay Naam","Naam (","( For","For a","a place","place under","under the","the Heavens","Heavens )",") is","is Sabiha","Sabiha 's","'s personal","personal journey","journey through","through the","the Islamization","Islamization of","of Pakistan","From her","her own","own perspective","perspective ,",", she","she depicts","depicts the","the transformation","transformation of","of the","the Pakistani","Pakistani from","from a","a vibrant","vibrant ,",", liberal","liberal society","society into","into a","a more","more conservative","conservative ,",", religious-oriented","religious-oriented one","Sabiha interviews","interviews five","five women","women ,",", in","in search","search of","of answers","answers regarding","regarding the","the issue","issue of","of this","this growing","growing religiosity","Why are","are more","more and","and more","more women","women taking","taking to","to the","the hijab","hijab when","when there","there is","is no","no state","state directive","directive to","to do","do so","What is","is the","the true","true nature","nature of","of this","this creeping","creeping Islamization","What are","are the","the liberal","liberal forces","forces doing"]}

{"title":"American Dreamz","plot":"Martin Tweed is the host of a talent show called American Dreamz, and whilst he despises each new season, it's a hit with the ratings. Tweed decides it's time for a new and interesting batch of contestants, and sends out his team to find the weirdest bunch possible. Whilst all this is happening, the President of the United States is becoming more and more depressed, and relies on his Chief of Staff to talk him through everything, even into appearing as a judge on the TV show. Perfect news for the terrorists who use the talent contest as a way to reach the President.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"],"stems":["Martin","Tweed","is","the","host","of","a","talent","show","call","American","Dreamz",",","and","whilst","he","despis","each","new","season",",","it","'s","a","hit","with","the","rate",".","Tweed","decid","it","'s","time","for","a","new","and","interest","batch","of","contest",",","and","send","out","his","team","to","find","the","weirdest","bunch","possibl",".","Whilst","all","this","is","happen",",","the","Presid","of","the","Unite","State","is","becom","more","and","more","depress",",","and","reli","on","his","Chief","of","Staff","to","talk","him","through","everyth",",","even","into","appear","as","a","judg","on","the","TV","show",".","Perfect","news","for","the","terrorist","who","use","the","talent","contest","as","a","way","to","reach","the","Presid","."],"lemmas":["Martin","Tweed","be","the","host","of","a","talent","show","call","American","Dreamz",",","and","whilst","he","despise","each","new","season",",","it","be","a","hit","with","the","rating",".","Tweed","decide","it","be","time","for","a","new","and","interesting","batch","of","contestant",",","and","send","out","he","team","to","find","the","weirdest","bunch","possible",".","whilst","all","this","be","happen",",","the","President","of","the","United","States","be","become","more","and","more","depressed",",","and","rely","on","he","Chief","of","Staff","to","talk","he","through","everything",",","even","into","appear","as","a","judge","on","the","tv","show",".","Perfect","news","for","the","terrorist","who","use","the","talent","contest","as","a","way","to","reach","the","President","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Martin Tweed is","Tweed is the","is the host","the host of","host of a","of a talent","a talent show","talent show called","show called American","called American Dreamz","American Dreamz ,","Dreamz , and",", and whilst","and whilst he","whilst he despises","he despises each","despises each new","each new season","new season ,","season , it",", it 's","it 's a","'s a hit","a hit with","hit with the","with the ratings","Tweed decides it","decides it 's","it 's time","'s time for","time for a","for a new","a new and","new and interesting","and interesting batch","interesting batch of","batch of contestants","of contestants ,","contestants , and",", and sends","and sends out","sends out his","out his team","his team to","team to find","to find the","find the weirdest","the weirdest bunch","weirdest bunch possible","Whilst all this","all this is","this is happening","is happening ,","happening , the",", the President","the President of","President of the","of the United","the United States","United States is","States is becoming","is becoming more","becoming more and","more and more","and more depressed","more depressed ,","depressed , and",", and relies","and relies on","relies on his","on his Chief","his Chief of","Chief of Staff","of Staff to","Staff to talk","to talk him","talk him through","him through everything","through everything ,","everything , even",", even into","even into appearing","into appearing as","appearing as a","as a judge","a judge on","judge on the","on the TV","the TV show","Perfect news for","news for the","for the terrorists","the terrorists who","terrorists who use","who use the","use the talent","the talent contest","talent contest as","contest as a","as a way","a way to","way to reach","to reach the","reach the President"],"2grams":["Martin Tweed","Tweed is","is the","the host","host of","of a","a talent","talent show","show called","called American","American Dreamz","Dreamz ,",", and","and whilst","whilst he","he despises","despises each","each new","new season","season ,",", it","it 's","'s a","a hit","hit with","with the","the ratings","Tweed decides","decides it","it 's","'s time","time for","for a","a new","new and","and interesting","interesting batch","batch of","of contestants","contestants ,",", and","and sends","sends out","out his","his team","team to","to find","find the","the weirdest","weirdest bunch","bunch possible","Whilst all","all this","this is","is happening","happening ,",", the","the President","President of","of the","the United","United States","States is","is becoming","becoming more","more and","and more","more depressed","depressed ,",", and","and relies","relies on","on his","his Chief","Chief of","of Staff","Staff to","to talk","talk him","him through","through everything","everything ,",", even","even into","into appearing","appearing as","as a","a judge","judge on","on the","the TV","TV show","Perfect news","news for","for the","the terrorists","terrorists who","who use","use the","the talent","talent contest","contest as","as a","a way","way to","to reach","reach the","the President"]}

{"title":"As Though Dead","plot":"We have pretended that it couldn't happen again but it has happen before and it will happen again. Do you believe? Is your faith strong enough? And are you close enough to him? The end is near and the rapture process has started and during this event the wrath of God will be revealed and the faith of others will be tested. Michael is a down and out sales person tired of going from job to job. He involves his friends in a plot to make a fake documentary. Jenni the local preacher's daughters let's Michael and his friends use the church late one night to film his fake documentary about a guy named Mr. Johnson seeing Jesus. A unexpected guest comes to the church and reveals something terrible is happening. It appears that people are killing each other and the first stage of the end of the world has started. They must come together in the church and take sides before each of them get taken one by one but during the rapture process the soul is pulled from the body and the soulless body attacks the closest person to them in search of a soul but the question is what one person believes is the rapture process could be something terrible. The future of our society is put in the hands of a few but they must find the faith and courage it takes to save what's left.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["We","have","pretend","that","it","could","n't","happen","again","but","it","has","happen","befor","and","it","will","happen","again",".","Do","you","believ","?","Is","your","faith","strong","enough","?","And","are","you","close","enough","to","him","?","The","end","is","near","and","the","raptur","process","has","start","and","dure","this","event","the","wrath","of","God","will","be","reveal","and","the","faith","of","other","will","be","test",".","Michael","is","a","down","and","out","sale","person","tire","of","go","from","job","to","job",".","He","involv","his","friend","in","a","plot","to","make","a","fake","documentari",".","Jenni","the","local","preacher","'s","daughter","let","'s","Michael","and","his","friend","use","the","church","late","one","night","to","film","his","fake","documentari","about","a","guy","name","Mr.","Johnson","see","Jesus",".","A","unexpect","guest","come","to","the","church","and","reveal","someth","terribl","is","happen",".","It","appear","that","peopl","are","kill","each","other","and","the","first","stage","of","the","end","of","the","world","has","start",".","They","must","come","togeth","in","the","church","and","take","side","befor","each","of","them","get","taken","one","by","one","but","dure","the","raptur","process","the","soul","is","pull","from","the","bodi","and","the","soulless","bodi","attack","the","closest","person","to","them","in","search","of","a","soul","but","the","question","is","what","one","person","believ","is","the","raptur","process","could","be","someth","terribl",".","The","futur","of","our","societi","is","put","in","the","hand","of","a","few","but","they","must","find","the","faith","and","courag","it","take","to","save","what","'s","left","."],"lemmas":["we","have","pretend","that","it","could","not","happen","again","but","it","have","happen","before","and","it","will","happen","again",".","do","you","believe","?","be","you","faith","strong","enough","?","and","be","you","close","enough","to","he","?","the","end","be","near","and","the","rapture","process","have","start","and","during","this","event","the","wrath","of","God","will","be","reveal","and","the","faith","of","other","will","be","test",".","Michael","be","a","down","and","out","sale","person","tire","of","go","from","job","to","job",".","he","involve","he","friend","in","a","plot","to","make","a","fake","documentary",".","jenni","the","local","preacher","'s","daughter","let","'s","Michael","and","he","friend","use","the","church","late","one","night","to","film","he","fake","documentary","about","a","guy","name","Mr.","Johnson","see","Jesus",".","a","unexpected","guest","come","to","the","church","and","reveal","something","terrible","be","happen",".","it","appear","that","people","be","kill","each","other","and","the","first","stage","of","the","end","of","the","world","have","start",".","they","must","come","together","in","the","church","and","take","side","before","each","of","they","get","take","one","by","one","but","during","the","rapture","process","the","soul","be","pull","from","the","body","and","the","soulless","body","attack","the","closest","person","to","they","in","search","of","a","soul","but","the","question","be","what","one","person","believe","be","the","rapture","process","could","be","something","terrible",".","the","future","of","we","society","be","put","in","the","hand","of","a","few","but","they","must","find","the","faith","and","courage","it","take","to","save","what","be","leave","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["We

Caged and waiting for their limbs to be severed, cooked and eaten one at a time, the Harver family must overcome their differences and unite in order to escape alive!","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["In","the","British","countrysid",",","the","Harver","famili","head","out","on","an","idyl","summer","camp","trip","where","they","can","buri","past","tension","and","enjoy","some","famili","bond",".","But","when","their","camp","is","sabotag","by","an","unseen","intrud","in","the","night",",","they","head","to","the","nearbi","creepi","old","farm","desper","for","help",",","where","veng","farmer","Hunt","Hansen","and","his","hideous","deform","son","are","n't","farm","anim","...","Cage","and","wait","for","their","limb","to","be","sever",",","cook","and","eaten","one","at","a","time",",","the","Harver","famili","must","overcom","their","differ","and","unit","in","order","to","escap","aliv","!"],"lemmas":["in","the","british","countryside",",","the","Harver","family","head","out","on","a","idyllic","summer","camping","trip","where","they","can","bury","past","tension","and","enjoy","some","family","bonding",".","but","when","they","camp","be","sabotage","by","a","unseen","intruder","in","the","night",",","they","head","to","the","nearby","creepy","old","farm","desperate","for","help",",","where","vengeful","farmer","Hunt","Hansen","and","he","hideously","deform","son","be","not","farm","animal","...","caged","and","wait","for","they","limb","to","be","sever",",","cook","and","eat","one","at","a","time",",","the","Harver","family","must","overcome","they","difference","and","unite","in","order","to","escape","alive","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the British","the British countryside","British countryside ,","countryside , the",", the Harver","the Harver family","Harver family head","family head out","head out on","out on an","on an idyllic","an idyllic summer","idyllic summer camping","summer camping trip","camping trip where","trip where they","where they can","they can bury","can bury past","bury past tensions","past tensions and","tensions and enjoy","and enjoy some","enjoy some family","some family bonding","But when their","when their camp","their camp is","camp is sabotaged","is sabotaged by","sabotaged by an","by an unseen","an unseen intruder","unseen intruder in","intruder in the","in the night","the night ,","night , they",", they head","they head to","head to the","to the nearby","the nearby creepy","nearby creepy old","creepy old farm","old farm desperate","farm desperate for","desperate for help","for help ,","help , where",", where vengeful","where vengeful farmer","vengeful farmer Hunt","farmer Hunt Hansen","Hunt Hansen and","Hansen and his","and his hideously","his hideously deformed","hideously deformed son","deformed son are","son are n't","are n't farming","n't farming animals","farming animals ...","animals ...

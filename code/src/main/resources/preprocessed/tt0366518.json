{"title":"Breaking Dawn","plot":"A dedicated young medical student is assigned to probe into the mind of Don Wake, a patient at a psychiatric hospital loaded with secrets. She pushes him to reveal the truth about the brutal murder of his mother, but Don instead warns her of danger looming in the outside world, including a mysterious and threatening man named Malachi. Don pleads with her to break him out of the hospital in order to bring the truth to the surface. But the student dismisses his claims as paranoia... until someone begins to follow her every step. Soon Don's delusions become her reality, and she must determine what is real and what is merely the rambling of a madman. Teetering on the edge of sanity, she is faced with one last decision - whether or not to take an extraordinary risk that could bring about a spectacular healing in Don's mind... and her own.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["A","dedic","young","medic","student","is","assign","to","probe","into","the","mind","of","Don","Wake",",","a","patient","at","a","psychiatr","hospit","load","with","secret",".","She","push","him","to","reveal","the","truth","about","the","brutal","murder","of","his","mother",",","but","Don","instead","warn","her","of","danger","loom","in","the","outsid","world",",","includ","a","mysteri","and","threaten","man","name","Malachi",".","Don","plead","with","her","to","break","him","out","of","the","hospit","in","order","to","bring","the","truth","to","the","surfac",".","But","the","student","dismiss","his","claim","as","paranoia","...","until","someon","begin","to","follow","her","everi","step",".","Soon","Don","'s","delus","becom","her","realiti",",","and","she","must","determin","what","is","real","and","what","is","mere","the","rambl","of","a","madman",".","Teeter","on","the","edg","of","saniti",",","she","is","face","with","one","last","decis","-","whether","or","not","to","take","an","extraordinari","risk","that","could","bring","about","a","spectacular","heal","in","Don","'s","mind","...","and","her","own","."],"lemmas":["a","dedicated","young","medical","student","be","assign","to","probe","into","the","mind","of","Don","wake",",","a","patient","at","a","psychiatric","hospital","load","with","secret",".","she","push","he","to","reveal","the","truth","about","the","brutal","murder","of","he","mother",",","but","Don","instead","warn","she","of","danger","loom","in","the","outside","world",",","include","a","mysterious","and","threatening","man","name","Malachi",".","Don","plead","with","she","to","break","he","out","of","the","hospital","in","order","to","bring","the","truth","to","the","surface",".","but","the","student","dismiss","he","claim","as","paranoia","...","until","someone","begin","to","follow","she","every","step",".","soon","Don","'s","delusion","become","she","reality",",","and","she","must","determine","what","be","real","and","what","be","merely","the","rambling","of","a","madman",".","teeter","on","the","edge","of","sanity",",","she","be","face","with","one","last","decision","-","whether","or","not","to","take","a","extraordinary","risk","that","could","bring","about","a","spectacular","healing","in","Don","'s","mind","...","and","she","own","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A dedicated young","dedicated young medical","young medical student","medical student is","student is assigned","is assigned to","assigned to probe","to probe into","probe into the","into the mind","the mind of","mind of Don","of Don Wake","Don Wake ,","Wake , a",", a patient","a patient at","patient at a","at a psychiatric","a psychiatric hospital","psychiatric hospital loaded","hospital loaded with","loaded with secrets","She pushes him","pushes him to","him to reveal","to reveal the","reveal the truth","the truth about","truth about the","about the brutal","the brutal murder","brutal murder of","murder of his","of his mother","his mother ,","mother , but",", but Don","but Don instead","Don instead warns","instead warns her","warns her of","her of danger","of danger looming","danger looming in","looming in the","in the outside","the outside world","outside world ,","world , including",", including a","including a mysterious","a mysterious and","mysterious and threatening","and threatening man","threatening man named","man named Malachi","Don pleads with","pleads with her","with her to","her to break","to break him","break him out","him out of","out of the","of the hospital","the hospital in","hospital in order","in order to","order to bring","to bring the","bring the truth","the truth to","truth to the","to the surface","But the student","the student dismisses","student dismisses his","dismisses his claims","his claims as","claims as paranoia","as paranoia ...","paranoia ... until","... until someone","until someone begins","someone begins to","begins to follow","to follow her","follow her every","her every step","Soon Don 's","Don 's delusions","'s delusions become","delusions become her","become her reality","her reality ,","reality , and",", and she","and she must","she must determine","must determine what","determine what is","what is real","is real and","real and what","and what is","what is merely","is merely the","merely the rambling","the rambling of","rambling of a","of a madman","Teetering on the","on the edge","the edge of","edge of sanity","of sanity ,","sanity , she",", she is","she is faced","is faced with","faced with one","with one last","one last decision","last decision -","decision -

{"title":"The Amazing Grace","plot":"John Newton is captain of a slave ship moored off the coast of Nigeria. He stands at a crossroads in his life, his morality and religion at odds with the brutality of his chosen profession. Stepping ashore, he starts on a journey of redemption that will end in tragedy but prove the catalyst for greater achievements. A local anthem sung in adversity by the slaves he captures punctuates the film. It will be the inspiration for John Newton's redemption, and, years later, for his writing of the world's most enduring hymn, Amazing Grace.","genres":["Drama"," History"],"stems":["John","Newton","is","captain","of","a","slave","ship","moor","off","the","coast","of","Nigeria",".","He","stand","at","a","crossroad","in","his","life",",","his","moral","and","religion","at","odd","with","the","brutal","of","his","chosen","profess",".","Step","ashor",",","he","start","on","a","journey","of","redempt","that","will","end","in","tragedi","but","prove","the","catalyst","for","greater","achiev",".","A","local","anthem","sung","in","advers","by","the","slave","he","captur","punctuat","the","film",".","It","will","be","the","inspir","for","John","Newton","'s","redempt",",","and",",","year","later",",","for","his","write","of","the","world","'s","most","endur","hymn",",","Amaze","Grace","."],"lemmas":["John","Newton","be","captain","of","a","slave","ship","moor","off","the","coast","of","Nigeria",".","he","stand","at","a","crossroads","in","he","life",",","he","morality","and","religion","at","odds","with","the","brutality","of","he","chosen","profession",".","step","ashore",",","he","start","on","a","journey","of","redemption","that","will","end","in","tragedy","but","prove","the","catalyst","for","greater","achievement",".","a","local","anthem","sing","in","adversity","by","the","slave","he","capture","punctuate","the","film",".","it","will","be","the","inspiration","for","John","Newton","'s","redemption",",","and",",","year","later",",","for","he","writing","of","the","world","'s","most","enduring","hymn",",","amazing","grace","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["John Newton is","Newton is captain","is captain of","captain of a","of a slave","a slave ship","slave ship moored","ship moored off","moored off the","off the coast","the coast of","coast of Nigeria","He stands at","stands at a","at a crossroads","a crossroads in","crossroads in his","in his life","his life ,","life , his",", his morality","his morality and","morality and religion","and religion at","religion at odds","at odds with","odds with the","with the brutality","the brutality of","brutality of his","of his chosen","his chosen profession","Stepping ashore ,","ashore , he",", he starts","he starts on","starts on a","on a journey","a journey of","journey of redemption","of redemption that","redemption that will","that will end","will end in","end in tragedy","in tragedy but","tragedy but prove","but prove the","prove the catalyst","the catalyst for","catalyst for greater","for greater achievements","A local anthem","local anthem sung","anthem sung in","sung in adversity","in adversity by","adversity by the","by the slaves","the slaves he","slaves he captures","he captures punctuates","captures punctuates the","punctuates the film","It will be","will be the","be the inspiration","the inspiration for","inspiration for John","for John Newton","John Newton 's","Newton 's redemption","'s redemption ,","redemption , and",", and ,","and , years",", years later","years later ,","later , for",", for his","for his writing","his writing of","writing of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's most","'s most enduring","most enduring hymn","enduring hymn ,","hymn , Amazing",", Amazing Grace"],"2grams":["John Newton","Newton is","is captain","captain of","of a","a slave","slave ship","ship moored","moored off","off the","the coast","coast of","of Nigeria","He stands","stands at","at a","a crossroads","crossroads in","in his","his life","life ,",", his","his morality","morality and","and religion","religion at","at odds","odds with","with the","the brutality","brutality of","of his","his chosen","chosen profession","Stepping ashore","ashore ,",", he","he starts","starts on","on a","a journey","journey of","of redemption","redemption that","that will","will end","end in","in tragedy","tragedy but","but prove","prove the","the catalyst","catalyst for","for greater","greater achievements","A local","local anthem","anthem sung","sung in","in adversity","adversity by","by the","the slaves","slaves he","he captures","captures punctuates","punctuates the","the film","It will","will be","be the","the inspiration","inspiration for","for John","John Newton","Newton 's","'s redemption","redemption ,",", and","and ,",", years","years later","later ,",", for","for his","his writing","writing of","of the","the world","world 's","'s most","most enduring","enduring hymn","hymn ,",", Amazing","Amazing Grace"]}

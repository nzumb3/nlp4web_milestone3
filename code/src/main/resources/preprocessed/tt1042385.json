{"title":"Synapse","plot":"Seth Alden, a 28 year old graduate neural science student, has been experimenting with the possible electromagnetic manipulation of the brain. He is led to experiment on himself - giving him an ability similar to telepathy. Through a new perspective, Seth begins to experience other people's perceptions, vulnerabilities, ulterior motives, and inner-selves. As the telepathic ability grows, he experiences repeated blackouts and alternate realities. He becomes isolated and paranoid... and ultimately uncovers what existence truly means.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Mystery"],"stems":["Seth","Alden",",","a","28","year","old","graduat","neural","scienc","student",",","has","been","experi","with","the","possibl","electromagnet","manipul","of","the","brain",".","He","is","led","to","experi","on","himself","-","give","him","an","abil","similar","to","telepathi",".","Through","a","new","perspect",",","Seth","begin","to","experi","other","peopl","'s","percept",",","vulner",",","ulterior","motiv",",","and","inner-selv",".","As","the","telepath","abil","grow",",","he","experi","repeat","blackout","and","altern","realiti",".","He","becom","isol","and","paranoid","...","and","ultim","uncov","what","exist","truli","mean","."],"lemmas":["Seth","Alden",",","a","28","year","old","graduate","neural","science","student",",","have","be","experiment","with","the","possible","electromagnetic","manipulation","of","the","brain",".","he","be","lead","to","experiment","on","himself","-","give","he","a","ability","similar","to","telepathy",".","through","a","new","perspective",",","Seth","begin","to","experience","other","people","'s","perception",",","vulnerability",",","ulterior","motive",",","and","inner-self",".","as","the","telepathic","ability","grow",",","he","experience","repeated","blackout","and","alternate","reality",".","he","become","isolated","and","paranoid","...","and","ultimately","uncover","what","existence","truly","mean","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Seth Alden ,","Alden , a",", a 28","a 28 year","28 year old","year old graduate","old graduate neural","graduate neural science","neural science student","science student ,","student , has",", has been","has been experimenting","been experimenting with","experimenting with the","with the possible","the possible electromagnetic","possible electromagnetic manipulation","electromagnetic manipulation of","manipulation of the","of the brain","He is led","is led to","led to experiment","to experiment on","experiment on himself","on himself -","himself - giving","- giving him","giving him an","him an ability","an ability similar","ability similar to","similar to telepathy","Through a new","a new perspective","new perspective ,","perspective , Seth",", Seth begins","Seth begins to","begins to experience","to experience other","experience other people","other people 's","people 's perceptions","'s perceptions ,","perceptions , vulnerabilities",", vulnerabilities ,","vulnerabilities , ulterior",", ulterior motives","ulterior motives ,","motives , and",", and inner-selves","As the telepathic","the telepathic ability","telepathic ability grows","ability grows ,","grows , he",", he experiences","he experiences repeated","experiences repeated blackouts","repeated blackouts and","blackouts and alternate","and alternate realities","He becomes isolated","becomes isolated and","isolated and paranoid","and paranoid ...","paranoid ... and","... and ultimately","and ultimately uncovers","ultimately uncovers what","uncovers what existence","what existence truly","existence truly means"],"2grams":["Seth Alden","Alden ,",", a","a 28","28 year","year old","old graduate","graduate neural","neural science","science student","student ,",", has","has been","been experimenting","experimenting with","with the","the possible","possible electromagnetic","electromagnetic manipulation","manipulation of","of the","the brain","He is","is led","led to","to experiment","experiment on","on himself","himself -","- giving","giving him","him an","an ability","ability similar","similar to","to telepathy","Through a","a new","new perspective","perspective ,",", Seth","Seth begins","begins to","to experience","experience other","other people","people 's","'s perceptions","perceptions ,",", vulnerabilities","vulnerabilities ,",", ulterior","ulterior motives","motives ,",", and","and inner-selves","As the","the telepathic","telepathic ability","ability grows","grows ,",", he","he experiences","experiences repeated","repeated blackouts","blackouts and","and alternate","alternate realities","He becomes","becomes isolated","isolated and","and paranoid","paranoid ...","... and","and ultimately","ultimately uncovers","uncovers what","what existence","existence truly","truly means"]}

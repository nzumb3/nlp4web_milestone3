{"title":"Chorus","plot":"A separate couple meet again after ten years when we found the body of their missing son. During their forced reunion, they both handle the death of their child in their own way. Amid the guilt of losing a loved one, they haltingly move toward affirmation of life, acceptance of death and even the possibility of reconciliation. Chorus is a love story that emerges from mourning and leads to two survivors clinging to each other as if to heal the deepest cut of all.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","separ","coupl","meet","again","after","ten","year","when","we","found","the","bodi","of","their","miss","son",".","Dure","their","forc","reunion",",","they","both","handl","the","death","of","their","child","in","their","own","way",".","Amid","the","guilt","of","lose","a","love","one",",","they","halt","move","toward","affirm","of","life",",","accept","of","death","and","even","the","possibl","of","reconcili",".","Chorus","is","a","love","stori","that","emerg","from","mourn","and","lead","to","two","survivor","cling","to","each","other","as","if","to","heal","the","deepest","cut","of","all","."],"lemmas":["a","separate","couple","meet","again","after","ten","year","when","we","find","the","body","of","they","missing","son",".","during","they","forced","reunion",",","they","both","handle","the","death","of","they","child","in","they","own","way",".","amid","the","guilt","of","lose","a","love","one",",","they","haltingly","move","toward","affirmation","of","life",",","acceptance","of","death","and","even","the","possibility","of","reconciliation",".","chorus","be","a","love","story","that","emerge","from","mourning","and","lead","to","two","survivor","cling","to","each","other","as","if","to","heal","the","deepest","cut","of","all","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A separate couple","separate couple meet","couple meet again","meet again after","again after ten","after ten years","ten years when","years when we","when we found","we found the","found the body","the body of","body of their","of their missing","their missing son","During their forced","their forced reunion","forced reunion ,","reunion , they",", they both","they both handle","both handle the","handle the death","the death of","death of their","of their child","their child in","child in their","in their own","their own way","Amid the guilt","the guilt of","guilt of losing","of losing a","losing a loved","a loved one","loved one ,","one , they",", they haltingly","they haltingly move","haltingly move toward","move toward affirmation","toward affirmation of","affirmation of life","of life ,","life , acceptance",", acceptance of","acceptance of death","of death and","death and even","and even the","even the possibility","the possibility of","possibility of reconciliation","Chorus is a","is a love","a love story","love story that","story that emerges","that emerges from","emerges from mourning","from mourning and","mourning and leads","and leads to","leads to two","to two survivors","two survivors clinging","survivors clinging to","clinging to each","to each other","each other as","other as if","as if to","if to heal","to heal the","heal the deepest","the deepest cut","deepest cut of","cut of all"],"2grams":["A separate","separate couple","couple meet","meet again","again after","after ten","ten years","years when","when we","we found","found the","the body","body of","of their","their missing","missing son","During their","their forced","forced reunion","reunion ,",", they","they both","both handle","handle the","the death","death of","of their","their child","child in","in their","their own","own way","Amid the","the guilt","guilt of","of losing","losing a","a loved","loved one","one ,",", they","they haltingly","haltingly move","move toward","toward affirmation","affirmation of","of life","life ,",", acceptance","acceptance of","of death","death and","and even","even the","the possibility","possibility of","of reconciliation","Chorus is","is a","a love","love story","story that","that emerges","emerges from","from mourning","mourning and","and leads","leads to","to two","two survivors","survivors clinging","clinging to","to each","each other","other as","as if","if to","to heal","heal the","the deepest","deepest cut","cut of","of all"]}

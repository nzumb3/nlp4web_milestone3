{"title":"Burning Ice","plot":"David Buckland invites artists and Arctic scientists onto his ship, the Cape Farewell, for a trip along the western coast of Greenland. The scientists conduct research on climate change, and the artists, who include singer-songwriters, photographers, a comedian, performance artists, and others, absorb it all in hopes they will turn it into art - art that will tell the world about what they've seen and felt. Interviews with the participants mix with footage of the voyage and scenes of performance.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["David","Buckland","invit","artist","and","Arctic","scientist","onto","his","ship",",","the","Cape","Farewel",",","for","a","trip","along","the","western","coast","of","Greenland",".","The","scientist","conduct","research","on","climat","chang",",","and","the","artist",",","who","includ","singer-songwrit",",","photograph",",","a","comedian",",","perform","artist",",","and","other",",","absorb","it","all","in","hope","they","will","turn","it","into","art","-","art","that","will","tell","the","world","about","what","they","ve","seen","and","felt",".","Interview","with","the","particip","mix","with","footag","of","the","voyag","and","scene","of","perform","."],"lemmas":["David","Buckland","invite","artist","and","Arctic","scientist","onto","he","ship",",","the","Cape","Farewell",",","for","a","trip","along","the","western","coast","of","Greenland",".","the","scientist","conduct","research","on","climate","change",",","and","the","artist",",","who","include","singer-songwriter",",","photographer",",","a","comedian",",","performance","artist",",","and","other",",","absorb","it","all","in","hope","they","will","turn","it","into","art","-","art","that","will","tell","the","world","about","what","they","have","see","and","feel",".","interview","with","the","participant","mix","with","footage","of","the","voyage","and","scene","of","performance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["David Buckland invites","Buckland invites artists","invites artists and","artists and Arctic","and Arctic scientists","Arctic scientists onto","scientists onto his","onto his ship","his ship ,","ship , the",", the Cape","the Cape Farewell","Cape Farewell ,","Farewell , for",", for a","for a trip","a trip along","trip along the","along the western","the western coast","western coast of","coast of Greenland","The scientists conduct","scientists conduct research","conduct research on","research on climate","on climate change","climate change ,","change , and",", and the","and the artists","the artists ,","artists , who",", who include","who include singer-songwriters","include singer-songwriters ,","singer-songwriters , photographers",", photographers ,","photographers , a",", a comedian","a comedian ,","comedian , performance",", performance artists","performance artists ,","artists , and",", and others","and others ,","others , absorb",", absorb it","absorb it all","it all in","all in hopes","in hopes they","hopes they will","they will turn","will turn it","turn it into","it into art","into art -","art - art","- art that","art that will","that will tell","will tell the","tell the world","the world about","world about what","about what they","what they 've","they 've seen","'ve seen and","seen and felt","Interviews with the","with the participants","the participants mix","participants mix with","mix with footage","with footage of","footage of the","of the voyage","the voyage and","voyage and scenes","and scenes of","scenes of performance"],"2grams":["David Buckland","Buckland invites","invites artists","artists and","and Arctic","Arctic scientists","scientists onto","onto his","his ship","ship ,",", the","the Cape","Cape Farewell","Farewell ,",", for","for a","a trip","trip along","along the","the western","western coast","coast of","of Greenland","The scientists","scientists conduct","conduct research","research on","on climate","climate change","change ,",", and","and the","the artists","artists ,",", who","who include","include singer-songwriters","singer-songwriters ,",", photographers","photographers ,",", a","a comedian","comedian ,",", performance","performance artists","artists ,",", and","and others","others ,",", absorb","absorb it","it all","all in","in hopes","hopes they","they will","will turn","turn it","it into","into art","art -","- art","art that","that will","will tell","tell the","the world","world about","about what","what they","they 've","'ve seen","seen and","and felt","Interviews with","with the","the participants","participants mix","mix with","with footage","footage of","of the","the voyage","voyage and","and scenes","scenes of","of performance"]}

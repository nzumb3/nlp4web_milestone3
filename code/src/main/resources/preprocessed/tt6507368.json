{"title":"La ciudad perdida","plot":"Aysén, a region in Chilean Patagonia, is the size of England but has only 90 thousand inhabitants. They live isolated, with nearly no roads, in a stunning, rough landscape. Somewhere in this lost world, a mysterious city is hiding. Five hundred years ago a group of conquerors built a city entirely in gold. They are alive. Whoever sets foot on it becomes immortal, but loses memory. It is The Lost City of the Caesars and you are here to find it.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Aysén",",","a","region","in","Chilean","Patagonia",",","is","the","size","of","England","but","has","onli","90","thousand","inhabit",".","They","live","isol",",","with","near","no","road",",","in","a","stun",",","rough","landscap",".","Somewher","in","this","lost","world",",","a","mysteri","citi","is","hide",".","Five","hundr","year","ago","a","group","of","conqueror","built","a","citi","entir","in","gold",".","They","are","aliv",".","Whoever","set","foot","on","it","becom","immort",",","but","lose","memori",".","It","is","The","Lost","Citi","of","the","Caesar","and","you","are","here","to","find","it","."],"lemmas":["Aysén",",","a","region","in","chilean","Patagonia",",","be","the","size","of","England","but","have","only","90","thousand","inhabitant",".","they","live","isolate",",","with","nearly","no","road",",","in","a","stunning",",","rough","landscape",".","somewhere","in","this","lost","world",",","a","mysterious","city","be","hide",".","five","hundred","year","ago","a","group","of","conqueror","build","a","city","entirely","in","gold",".","they","be","alive",".","whoever","set","foot","on","it","become","immortal",",","but","lose","memory",".","it","be","the","Lost","City","of","the","Caesars","and","you","be","here","to","find","it","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Aysén , a",", a region","a region in","region in Chilean","in Chilean Patagonia","Chilean Patagonia ,","Patagonia , is",", is the","is the size","the size of","size of England","of England but","England but has","but has only","has only 90","only 90 thousand","90 thousand inhabitants","They live isolated","live isolated ,","isolated , with",", with nearly","with nearly no","nearly no roads","no roads ,","roads , in",", in a","in a stunning","a stunning ,","stunning , rough",", rough landscape","Somewhere in this","in this lost","this lost world","lost world ,","world , a",", a mysterious","a mysterious city","mysterious city is","city is hiding","Five hundred years","hundred years ago","years ago a","ago a group","a group of","group of conquerors","of conquerors built","conquerors built a","built a city","a city entirely","city entirely in","entirely in gold","They are alive","Whoever sets foot","sets foot on","foot on it","on it becomes","it becomes immortal","becomes immortal ,","immortal , but",", but loses","but loses memory","It is The","is The Lost","The Lost City","Lost City of","City of the","of the Caesars","the Caesars and","Caesars and you","and you are","you are here","are here to","here to find","to find it"],"2grams":["Aysén ,",", a","a region","region in","in Chilean","Chilean Patagonia","Patagonia ,",", is","is the","the size","size of","of England","England but","but has","has only","only 90","90 thousand","thousand inhabitants","They live","live isolated","isolated ,",", with","with nearly","nearly no","no roads","roads ,",", in","in a","a stunning","stunning ,",", rough","rough landscape","Somewhere in","in this","this lost","lost world","world ,",", a","a mysterious","mysterious city","city is","is hiding","Five hundred","hundred years","years ago","ago a","a group","group of","of conquerors","conquerors built","built a","a city","city entirely","entirely in","in gold","They are","are alive","Whoever sets","sets foot","foot on","on it","it becomes","becomes immortal","immortal ,",", but","but loses","loses memory","It is","is The","The Lost","Lost City","City of","of the","the Caesars","Caesars and","and you","you are","are here","here to","to find","find it"]}

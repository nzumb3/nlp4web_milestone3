{"title":"Red Road","plot":"Successful in the Hamilton construction business today, Hambly began his search for his birth parents and his cultural identity when an aboriginal person called him an \"apple\"-a slang expression referring to someone who is red on the outside, white on the inside. Red Road shadows Barry Hambly's journey, returning to Saskatchewan to confront his past and meet his birth mother. \"After my first call to her, I knew that one day I would have to meet her face-to-face, to help me deal with the anger and answer questions I have had all my life.\" The First Nation word \"waka\" refers to walking a spiritual path in search of one's origins. Barry Hambly has taken the first step down that road, the \"red road\". Finding the way home is not always easy.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Success","in","the","Hamilton","construct","busi","today",",","Hambl","began","his","search","for","his","birth","parent","and","his","cultur","ident","when","an","aborigin","person","call","him","an","\"","appl","\"","-","a","slang","express","refer","to","someon","who","is","red","on","the","outsid",",","white","on","the","insid",".","Red","Road","shadow","Barri","Hambl","'s","journey",",","return","to","Saskatchewan","to","confront","his","past","and","meet","his","birth","mother",".","\"","After","my","first","call","to","her",",","I","knew","that","one","day","I","would","have","to","meet","her","face-to-fac",",","to","help","me","deal","with","the","anger","and","answer","question","I","have","had","all","my","life",".","\"","The","First","Nation","word","\"","waka","\"","refer","to","walk","a","spiritu","path","in","search","of","one","'s","origin",".","Barri","Hambl","has","taken","the","first","step","down","that","road",",","the","\"","red","road","\"",".","Find","the","way","home","is","not","alway","easi","."],"lemmas":["successful","in","the","Hamilton","construction","business","today",",","Hambly","begin","he","search","for","he","birth","parent","and","he","cultural","identity","when","a","aboriginal","person","call","he","a","``","apple","''","-","a","slang","expression","refer","to","someone","who","be","red","on","the","outside",",","white","on","the","inside",".","Red","Road","shadow","Barry","Hambly","'s","journey",",","return","to","Saskatchewan","to","confront","he","past","and","meet","he","birth","mother",".","``","after","my","first","call","to","she",",","I","know","that","one","day","I","would","have","to","meet","she","face-to-face",",","to","help","I","deal","with","the","anger","and","answer","question","I","have","have","all","my","life",".","''","the","first","nation","word","``","waka","''","refer","to","walk","a","spiritual","path","in","search","of","one","'s","origin",".","Barry","Hambly","have","take","the","first","step","down","that","road",",","the","``","red","road","''",".","find","the","way","home","be","not","always","easy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Successful in the","in the Hamilton","the Hamilton construction","Hamilton construction business","construction business today","business today ,","today , Hambly",", Hambly began","Hambly began his","began his search","his search for","search for his","for his birth","his birth parents","birth parents and","parents and his","and his cultural","his cultural identity","cultural identity when","identity when an","when an aboriginal","an aboriginal person","aboriginal person called","person called him","called him an","him an \"","an \" apple","\" apple \"","apple \" -","\" -

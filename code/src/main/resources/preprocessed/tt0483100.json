{"title":"The Other Shoe","plot":"We are in Brooklyn. The most diverse ethnic groups live here without sharing a folklore or tradition, each one on its own, but united by two common elements: the exchange of money and personal space as a cause to defend. One street, Broadway, serves as boundary and as common ground for three communities: the recently arrived artists, the Dominicans and the ultra-Orthodox Jews, all together underneath the tracks of the elevated subway that goes to Manhattan. In this multicultural space, the stories of three characters are intertwined: Gonzalo a young theater director from Spain who demands too much from himself and the people around him; Richie, a young Hispanic drug dealer who dreams of escaping the basketball court where he carries out his business; and Abraham, a Jewish landlord who withdraws into his work in order to avoid a reality he can't bear to face.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["We","are","in","Brooklyn",".","The","most","divers","ethnic","group","live","here","without","share","a","folklor","or","tradit",",","each","one","on","it","own",",","but","unit","by","two","common","element",":","the","exchang","of","money","and","person","space","as","a","caus","to","defend",".","One","street",",","Broadway",",","serv","as","boundari","and","as","common","ground","for","three","communiti",":","the","recent","arriv","artist",",","the","Dominican","and","the","ultra-Orthodox","Jew",",","all","togeth","underneath","the","track","of","the","elev","subway","that","goe","to","Manhattan",".","In","this","multicultur","space",",","the","stori","of","three","charact","are","intertwin",":","Gonzalo","a","young","theater","director","from","Spain","who","demand","too","much","from","himself","and","the","peopl","around","him",";","Richi",",","a","young","Hispan","drug","dealer","who","dream","of","escap","the","basketbal","court","where","he","carri","out","his","busi",";","and","Abraham",",","a","Jewish","landlord","who","withdraw","into","his","work","in","order","to","avoid","a","realiti","he","ca","n't","bear","to","face","."],"lemmas":["we","be","in","Brooklyn",".","the","most","diverse","ethnic","group","live","here","without","share","a","folklore","or","tradition",",","each","one","on","its","own",",","but","unite","by","two","common","element",":","the","exchange","of","money","and","personal","space","as","a","cause","to","defend",".","one","street",",","Broadway",",","serve","as","boundary","and","as","common","ground","for","three","community",":","the","recently","arrive","artist",",","the","Dominicans","and","the","ultra-orthodox","Jews",",","all","together","underneath","the","track","of","the","elevated","subway","that","go","to","Manhattan",".","in","this","multicultural","space",",","the","story","of","three","character","be","intertwine",":","Gonzalo","a","young","theater","director","from","Spain","who","demand","too","much","from","himself","and","the","people","around","he",";","Richie",",","a","young","hispanic","drug","dealer","who","dream","of","escape","the","basketball","court","where","he","carry","out","he","business",";","and","Abraham",",","a","jewish","landlord","who","withdraw","into","he","work","in","order","to","avoid","a","reality","he","can","not","bear","to","face","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["We are in","are in Brooklyn","The most diverse","most diverse ethnic","diverse ethnic groups","ethnic groups live","groups live here","live here without","here without sharing","without sharing a","sharing a folklore","a folklore or","folklore or tradition","or tradition ,","tradition , each",", each one","each one on","one on its","on its own","its own ,","own , but",", but united","but united by","united by two","by two common","two common elements","common elements :","elements : the",": the exchange","the exchange of","exchange of money","of money and","money and personal","and personal space","personal space as","space as a","as a cause","a cause to","cause to defend","One street ,","street , Broadway",", Broadway ,","Broadway , serves",", serves as","serves as boundary","as boundary and","boundary and as","and as common","as common ground","common ground for","ground for three","for three communities","three communities :","communities : the",": the recently","the recently arrived","recently arrived artists","arrived artists ,","artists , the",", the Dominicans","the Dominicans and","Dominicans and the","and the ultra-Orthodox","the ultra-Orthodox Jews","ultra-Orthodox Jews ,","Jews , all",", all together","all together underneath","together underneath the","underneath the tracks","the tracks of","tracks of the","of the elevated","the elevated subway","elevated subway that","subway that goes","that goes to","goes to Manhattan","In this multicultural","this multicultural space","multicultural space ,","space , the",", the stories","the stories of","stories of three","of three characters","three characters are","characters are intertwined","are intertwined :","intertwined : Gonzalo",": Gonzalo a","Gonzalo a young","a young theater","young theater director","theater director from","director from Spain","from Spain who","Spain who demands","who demands too","demands too much","too much from","much from himself","from himself and","himself and the","and the people","the people around","people around him","around him ;","him ;

{"title":"Donkey Love","plot":"A documentary that introduces the unknown tradition of some people in rural areas of the Colombian Caribbean coast having sex and falling in love with donkeys. It starts off as a rite of passage ritual that fathers initiate with their sons and is carried on into their adulthood where men often end-up cheating on their wives with donkeys. There is belief among some people that boys should practice having sex with donkeys to prepare themselves for women, that it makes their penises bigger and also that it prevents them from becoming homosexuals.","genres":["Comedy"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","documentari","that","introduc","the","unknown","tradit","of","some","peopl","in","rural","area","of","the","Colombian","Caribbean","coast","have","sex","and","fall","in","love","with","donkey",".","It","start","off","as","a","rite","of","passag","ritual","that","father","initi","with","their","son","and","is","carri","on","into","their","adulthood","where","men","often","end-up","cheat","on","their","wive","with","donkey",".","There","is","belief","among","some","peopl","that","boy","should","practic","have","sex","with","donkey","to","prepar","themselv","for","women",",","that","it","make","their","penis","bigger","and","also","that","it","prevent","them","from","becom","homosexu","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","that","introduce","the","unknown","tradition","of","some","people","in","rural","area","of","the","colombian","caribbean","coast","have","sex","and","fall","in","love","with","donkey",".","it","start","off","as","a","rite","of","passage","ritual","that","father","initiate","with","they","son","and","be","carry","on","into","they","adulthood","where","man","often","end-up","cheating","on","they","wife","with","donkey",".","there","be","belief","among","some","people","that","boy","should","practice","have","sex","with","donkey","to","prepare","themselves","for","woman",",","that","it","make","they","penis","bigger","and","also","that","it","prevent","they","from","become","homosexual","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A documentary that","documentary that introduces","that introduces the","introduces the unknown","the unknown tradition","unknown tradition of","tradition of some","of some people","some people in","people in rural","in rural areas","rural areas of","areas of the","of the Colombian","the Colombian Caribbean","Colombian Caribbean coast","Caribbean coast having","coast having sex","having sex and","sex and falling","and falling in","falling in love","in love with","love with donkeys","It starts off","starts off as","off as a","as a rite","a rite of","rite of passage","of passage ritual","passage ritual that","ritual that fathers","that fathers initiate","fathers initiate with","initiate with their","with their sons","their sons and","sons and is","and is carried","is carried on","carried on into","on into their","into their adulthood","their adulthood where","adulthood where men","where men often","men often end-up","often end-up cheating","end-up cheating on","cheating on their","on their wives","their wives with","wives with donkeys","There is belief","is belief among","belief among some","among some people","some people that","people that boys","that boys should","boys should practice","should practice having","practice having sex","having sex with","sex with donkeys","with donkeys to","donkeys to prepare","to prepare themselves","prepare themselves for","themselves for women","for women ,","women , that",", that it","that it makes","it makes their","makes their penises","their penises bigger","penises bigger and","bigger and also","and also that","also that it","that it prevents","it prevents them","prevents them from","them from becoming","from becoming homosexuals"],"2grams":["A documentary","documentary that","that introduces","introduces the","the unknown","unknown tradition","tradition of","of some","some people","people in","in rural","rural areas","areas of","of the","the Colombian","Colombian Caribbean","Caribbean coast","coast having","having sex","sex and","and falling","falling in","in love","love with","with donkeys","It starts","starts off","off as","as a","a rite","rite of","of passage","passage ritual","ritual that","that fathers","fathers initiate","initiate with","with their","their sons","sons and","and is","is carried","carried on","on into","into their","their adulthood","adulthood where","where men","men often","often end-up","end-up cheating","cheating on","on their","their wives","wives with","with donkeys","There is","is belief","belief among","among some","some people","people that","that boys","boys should","should practice","practice having","having sex","sex with","with donkeys","donkeys to","to prepare","prepare themselves","themselves for","for women","women ,",", that","that it","it makes","makes their","their penises","penises bigger","bigger and","and also","also that","that it","it prevents","prevents them","them from","from becoming","becoming homosexuals"]}

{"title":"Crazy Wisdom: The Life & Times of Chogyam Trungpa Rinpoche","plot":"Crazy Wisdom is the long-awaited feature documentary to explore the life, teachings, and \"crazy wisdom\" of Chogyam Trungpa, Rinpoche, a pivotal figure in bringing Tibetan Buddhism to the West. Called a genius, rascal, and social visionary; 'one of the greatest spiritual teachers of the 20th century,' and 'the bad boy of Buddhism,' Trungpa defied categorization. Raised and trained in the rigorous Tibetan monastic tradition, Trungpa came to the West and shattered our preconceived notions about how an enlightened teacher should behave - he openly smoked, drank, and had intimate relations with students - yet his teachings are recognized as authentic, vast, and influential. Twenty years after his death, with unprecedented access and exclusive archival material, Crazy Wisdom looks at the man and the myths about him, and attempts to set the record straight.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Crazi","Wisdom","is","the","long-await","featur","documentari","to","explor","the","life",",","teach",",","and","\"","crazi","wisdom","\"","of","Chogyam","Trungpa",",","Rinpoch",",","a","pivot","figur","in","bring","Tibetan","Buddhism","to","the","West",".","Call","a","genius",",","rascal",",","and","social","visionari",";","'","one","of","the","greatest","spiritu","teacher","of","the","20th","centuri",",","'","and","'","the","bad","boy","of","Buddhism",",","'","Trungpa","defi","categor",".","Rais","and","train","in","the","rigor","Tibetan","monast","tradit",",","Trungpa","came","to","the","West","and","shatter","our","preconceiv","notion","about","how","an","enlighten","teacher","should","behav","-","he","open","smoke",",","drank",",","and","had","intim","relat","with","student","-","yet","his","teach","are","recogn","as","authent",",","vast",",","and","influenti",".","Twenti","year","after","his","death",",","with","unpreced","access","and","exclus","archiv","materi",",","Crazi","Wisdom","look","at","the","man","and","the","myth","about","him",",","and","attempt","to","set","the","record","straight","."],"lemmas":["Crazy","Wisdom","be","the","long-awaited","feature","documentary","to","explore","the","life",",","teaching",",","and","``","crazy","wisdom","''","of","Chogyam","Trungpa",",","Rinpoche",",","a","pivotal","figure","in","bring","Tibetan","Buddhism","to","the","West",".","call","a","genius",",","rascal",",","and","social","visionary",";","'","one","of","the","greatest","spiritual","teacher","of","the","20th","century",",","'","and","'","the","bad","boy","of","Buddhism",",","'","Trungpa","defy","categorization",".","raise","and","train","in","the","rigorous","tibetan","monastic","tradition",",","Trungpa","come","to","the","west","and","shatter","we","preconceived","notion","about","how","a","enlighten","teacher","should","behave","-","he","openly","smoke",",","drink",",","and","have","intimate","relation","with","student","-","yet","he","teaching","be","recognize","as","authentic",",","vast",",","and","influential",".","twenty","year","after","he","death",",","with","unprecedented","access","and","exclusive","archival","material",",","Crazy","Wisdom","look","at","the","man","and","the","myth","about","he",",","and","attempt","to","set","the","record","straight","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Crazy Wisdom is","Wisdom is the","is the long-awaited","the long-awaited feature","long-awaited feature documentary","feature documentary to","documentary to explore","to explore the","explore the life","the life ,","life , teachings",", teachings ,","teachings , and",", and \"","and \" crazy","\" crazy wisdom","crazy wisdom \"","wisdom \" of","\" of Chogyam","of Chogyam Trungpa","Chogyam Trungpa ,","Trungpa , Rinpoche",", Rinpoche ,","Rinpoche , a",", a pivotal","a pivotal figure","pivotal figure in","figure in bringing","in bringing Tibetan","bringing Tibetan Buddhism","Tibetan Buddhism to","Buddhism to the","to the West","Called a genius","a genius ,","genius , rascal",", rascal ,","rascal , and",", and social","and social visionary","social visionary ;","visionary ;

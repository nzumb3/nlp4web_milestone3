{"title":"Armenia","plot":"\"Armenia\" is a cinematic interweaving of film, literature and history. The day after his fiftieth birthday, Haig Boghos (Alain Croubalian), a world-weary singer embarks on a personal journey revisiting his family's history of genocide, exile, and diaspora. His journey leads from his current hometown Basel, to his childhood home Marseille to Armenia-the homeland of his forefathers. Haig's odyssey culminates in the discovery of a mass grave- the last resting place of many of the victims of the Armenian Genocide-including Haig's great-grand parents. Circling themes of family, identity, and spirituality, Armenia is a geographical, historical and psychological journey into one man's mind and into the collective consciousness of a troubled country and its people. However, Haig Boghos' odyssey is not solely a personal journey, it is much rather the journey of an archetype, a universal tale of displacement and forlornness that will resonate with everyone who feels a sense of spiritual homelessness.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["\"","Armenia","\"","is","a","cinemat","interweav","of","film",",","literatur","and","histori",".","The","day","after","his","fiftieth","birthday",",","Haig","Bogho","(","Alain","Croubalian",")",",","a","world-weari","singer","embark","on","a","person","journey","revisit","his","famili","'s","histori","of","genocid",",","exil",",","and","diaspora",".","His","journey","lead","from","his","current","hometown","Basel",",","to","his","childhood","home","Marseill","to","Armenia-th","homeland","of","his","forefath",".","Haig","'s","odyssey","culmin","in","the","discoveri","of","a","mass","grave","-","the","last","rest","place","of","mani","of","the","victim","of","the","Armenian","Genocide-includ","Haig","'s","great-grand","parent",".","Circl","theme","of","famili",",","ident",",","and","spiritu",",","Armenia","is","a","geograph",",","histor","and","psycholog","journey","into","one","man","'s","mind","and","into","the","collect","conscious","of","a","troubl","countri","and","it","peopl",".","Howev",",","Haig","Bogho","'","odyssey","is","not","sole","a","person","journey",",","it","is","much","rather","the","journey","of","an","archetyp",",","a","univers","tale","of","displac","and","forlorn","that","will","reson","with","everyon","who","feel","a","sens","of","spiritu","homeless","."],"lemmas":["``","Armenia","''","be","a","cinematic","interweaving","of","film",",","literature","and","history",".","the","day","after","he","fiftieth","birthday",",","Haig","Boghos","-lrb-","Alain","Croubalian","-rrb-",",","a","world-weary","singer","embark","on","a","personal","journey","revisit","he","family","'s","history","of","genocide",",","exile",",","and","diaspora",".","he","journey","lead","from","he","current","hometown","Basel",",","to","he","childhood","home","Marseille","to","armenia-the","homeland","of","he","forefather",".","Haig","'s","odyssey","culminate","in","the","discovery","of","a","mass","grave","-","the","last","rest","place","of","many","of","the","victim","of","the","armenian","genocide-including","Haig","'s","great-grand","parent",".","circle","theme","of","family",",","identity",",","and","spirituality",",","Armenia","be","a","geographical",",","historical","and","psychological","journey","into","one","man","'s","mind","and","into","the","collective","consciousness","of","a","troubled","country","and","its","people",".","however",",","Haig","Boghos","'","odyssey","be","not","solely","a","personal","journey",",","it","be","much","rather","the","journey","of","a","archetype",",","a","universal","tale","of","displacement","and","forlornness","that","will","resonate","with","everyone","who","feel","a","sense","of","spiritual","homelessness","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Armenia \"","Armenia \" is","\" is a","is a cinematic","a cinematic interweaving","cinematic interweaving of","interweaving of film","of film ,","film , literature",", literature and","literature and history","The day after","day after his","after his fiftieth","his fiftieth birthday","fiftieth birthday ,","birthday , Haig",", Haig Boghos","Haig Boghos (","Boghos ( Alain","( Alain Croubalian","Alain Croubalian )","Croubalian ) ,",") , a",", a world-weary","a world-weary singer","world-weary singer embarks","singer embarks on","embarks on a","on a personal","a personal journey","personal journey revisiting","journey revisiting his","revisiting his family","his family 's","family 's history","'s history of","history of genocide","of genocide ,","genocide , exile",", exile ,","exile , and",", and diaspora","His journey leads","journey leads from","leads from his","from his current","his current hometown","current hometown Basel","hometown Basel ,","Basel , to",", to his","to his childhood","his childhood home","childhood home Marseille","home Marseille to","Marseille to Armenia-the","to Armenia-the homeland","Armenia-the homeland of","homeland of his","of his forefathers","Haig 's odyssey","'s odyssey culminates","odyssey culminates in","culminates in the","in the discovery","the discovery of","discovery of a","of a mass","a mass grave","mass grave -","grave -

{"title":"D'Curse","plot":"NYPD cop Ruda, a cop during the day and a religious Santerio (High Ranking Priest) of \"Black Magic\" by night. One day a cop named James shoots and kills a son of a high priest in Santeria and Officer James plans to say the man did have a gun when he actually didn't. Being that it was a lie and the man that was killed had a mother and a brother that were High Preists in Santeria, they placed a Curse on the cop and everyone that's involved in the case that were testifying on the behalf of the cop that shot the man. Now a curse was placed and bad things started to happen to the cops. Now the NYPD needs Ruda's help to break the curse.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["NYPD","cop","Ruda",",","a","cop","dure","the","day","and","a","religi","Santerio","(","High","Rank","Priest",")","of","\"","Black","Magic","\"","by","night",".","One","day","a","cop","name","Jame","shoot","and","kill","a","son","of","a","high","priest","in","Santeria","and","Officer","Jame","plan","to","say","the","man","did","have","a","gun","when","he","actual","did","n't",".","Be","that","it","was","a","lie","and","the","man","that","was","kill","had","a","mother","and","a","brother","that","were","High","Preist","in","Santeria",",","they","place","a","Curs","on","the","cop","and","everyon","that","'s","involv","in","the","case","that","were","testifi","on","the","behalf","of","the","cop","that","shot","the","man",".","Now","a","curs","was","place","and","bad","thing","start","to","happen","to","the","cop",".","Now","the","NYPD","need","Ruda","'s","help","to","break","the","curs","."],"lemmas":["nypd","cop","Ruda",",","a","cop","during","the","day","and","a","religious","Santerio","-lrb-","High","Ranking","Priest","-rrb-","of","``","Black","Magic","''","by","night",".","one","day","a","cop","name","James","shoot","and","kill","a","son","of","a","high","priest","in","Santeria","and","Officer","James","plan","to","say","the","man","do","have","a","gun","when","he","actually","do","not",".","be","that","it","be","a","lie","and","the","man","that","be","kill","have","a","mother","and","a","brother","that","be","High","Preists","in","Santeria",",","they","place","a","curse","on","the","cop","and","everyone","that","be","involve","in","the","case","that","be","testify","on","the","behalf","of","the","cop","that","shoot","the","man",".","now","a","curse","be","place","and","bad","thing","start","to","happen","to","the","cop",".","now","the","NYPD","need","Ruda","'s","help","to","break","the","curse","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["NYPD

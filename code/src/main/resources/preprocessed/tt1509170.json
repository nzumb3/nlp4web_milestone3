{"title":"For the End of Time","plot":"For the End of Time is about the mind, about the body and the inability to merge these two entities. Two entities which shape a form of civilization known under the name of 'human'. A human is not a being unto itself, a human is a part of a civilization - related code of a certain precise time and place. A human is not a uniform creature. A human is a split between many things, but the worst is the split carried inside, that between the mind and the body. For the End of Time is a film on a quest, on the eternal longing to find the real thing.","genres":["Drama"," Fantasy"],"stems":["For","the","End","of","Time","is","about","the","mind",",","about","the","bodi","and","the","inabl","to","merg","these","two","entiti",".","Two","entiti","which","shape","a","form","of","civil","known","under","the","name","of","'","human","'",".","A","human","is","not","a","be","unto","itself",",","a","human","is","a","part","of","a","civil","-","relat","code","of","a","certain","precis","time","and","place",".","A","human","is","not","a","uniform","creatur",".","A","human","is","a","split","between","mani","thing",",","but","the","worst","is","the","split","carri","insid",",","that","between","the","mind","and","the","bodi",".","For","the","End","of","Time","is","a","film","on","a","quest",",","on","the","etern","long","to","find","the","real","thing","."],"lemmas":["for","the","End","of","Time","be","about","the","mind",",","about","the","body","and","the","inability","to","merge","these","two","entity",".","two","entity","which","shape","a","form","of","civilization","know","under","the","name","of","'","human","'",".","a","human","be","not","a","be","unto","itself",",","a","human","be","a","part","of","a","civilization","-","related","code","of","a","certain","precise","time","and","place",".","a","human","be","not","a","uniform","creature",".","a","human","be","a","split","between","many","thing",",","but","the","worst","be","the","split","carry","inside",",","that","between","the","mind","and","the","body",".","for","the","End","of","Time","be","a","film","on","a","quest",",","on","the","eternal","longing","to","find","the","real","thing","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["For the End","the End of","End of Time","of Time is","Time is about","is about the","about the mind","the mind ,","mind , about",", about the","about the body","the body and","body and the","and the inability","the inability to","inability to merge","to merge these","merge these two","these two entities","Two entities which","entities which shape","which shape a","shape a form","a form of","form of civilization","of civilization known","civilization known under","known under the","under the name","the name of","name of '","of ' human","' human '","A human is","human is not","is not a","not a being","a being unto","being unto itself","unto itself ,","itself , a",", a human","a human is","human is a","is a part","a part of","part of a","of a civilization","a civilization -","civilization - related","- related code","related code of","code of a","of a certain","a certain precise","certain precise time","precise time and","time and place","A human is","human is not","is not a","not a uniform","a uniform creature","A human is","human is a","is a split","a split between","split between many","between many things","many things ,","things , but",", but the","but the worst","the worst is","worst is the","is the split","the split carried","split carried inside","carried inside ,","inside , that",", that between","that between the","between the mind","the mind and","mind and the","and the body","For the End","the End of","End of Time","of Time is","Time is a","is a film","a film on","film on a","on a quest","a quest ,","quest , on",", on the","on the eternal","the eternal longing","eternal longing to","longing to find","to find the","find the real","the real thing"],"2grams":["For the","the End","End of","of Time","Time is","is about","about the","the mind","mind ,",", about","about the","the body","body and","and the","the inability","inability to","to merge","merge these","these two","two entities","Two entities","entities which","which shape","shape a","a form","form of","of civilization","civilization known","known under","under the","the name","name of","of '","' human","human '","A human","human is","is not","not a","a being","being unto","unto itself","itself ,",", a","a human","human is","is a","a part","part of","of a","a civilization","civilization -","- related","related code","code of","of a","a certain","certain precise","precise time","time and","and place","A human","human is","is not","not a","a uniform","uniform creature","A human","human is","is a","a split","split between","between many","many things","things ,",", but","but the","the worst","worst is","is the","the split","split carried","carried inside","inside ,",", that","that between","between the","the mind","mind and","and the","the body","For the","the End","End of","of Time","Time is","is a","a film","film on","on a","a quest","quest ,",", on","on the","the eternal","eternal longing","longing to","to find","find the","the real","real thing"]}

{"title":"Mission Park","plot":"Boston is the city where the superhero team Mission Park comes to life in a vivid comic book world. Despite the team's strained relations, a threat is festering in their home town, and with stakes at an all-time high, team Mission Park will unite for a single night to crush an evil plot initiated by the villainous Executive (Michael Tarara). Tessa Faux (Sam Pannier) leads the team as the seductive socialite vigilante. Apple Orchard (Lauren Guglielmello) is the prim and proper sidekick who doesn't swear, doesn't lie but does lug around an assault rifle to blow away criminals. Chris Ember (Chip Perro) is the fiery anarchist with a vast array of powers that are actually symptoms of a virus that's killing him. Timothy Note (Casey Preston) is only in the game for the glory, and Victor Strength (Christopher G. Pike) is the world's strongest man. The saga opens up as Chris Ember is recruited by the Boston Police Department to diffuse a time bomb situation, that if not controlled, will alter the fate of the entire world. Mission Park is a comic book extravaganza from writer/director Chip Perro.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi","

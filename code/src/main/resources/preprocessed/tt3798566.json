{"title":"Little Yellow Boots","plot":"What do we pass on to those who come after us, for both good and for bad? And what difference can one person make in the world? These are the universal questions that occupy director John Webster in this personal cinematic letter to his great-grandchild Dorit, a little girl who will be born in the 2060's, and who's little yellow boots will walk on a very different shoreline to the one we knew. The story seamlessly weaves together past, present and future into a beautiful, moving and hopeful documentary film about the power of each of us to make a difference.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["What","do","we","pass","on","to","those","who","come","after","us",",","for","both","good","and","for","bad","?","And","what","differ","can","one","person","make","in","the","world","?","These","are","the","univers","question","that","occupi","director","John","Webster","in","this","person","cinemat","letter","to","his","great-grandchild","Dorit",",","a","littl","girl","who","will","be","born","in","the","2060","'s",",","and","who","'s","littl","yellow","boot","will","walk","on","a","veri","differ","shorelin","to","the","one","we","knew",".","The","stori","seamless","weav","togeth","past",",","present","and","futur","into","a","beauti",",","move","and","hope","documentari","film","about","the","power","of","each","of","us","to","make","a","differ","."],"lemmas":["what","do","we","pass","on","to","those","who","come","after","we",",","for","both","good","and","for","bad","?","and","what","difference","can","one","person","make","in","the","world","?","these","be","the","universal","question","that","occupy","director","John","Webster","in","this","personal","cinematic","letter","to","he","great-grandchild","Dorit",",","a","little","girl","who","will","be","bear","in","the","2060","'s",",","and","who","be","little","yellow","boot","will","walk","on","a","very","different","shoreline","to","the","one","we","know",".","the","story","seamlessly","weave","together","past",",","present","and","future","into","a","beautiful",",","moving","and","hopeful","documentary","film","about","the","power","of","each","of","we","to","make","a","difference","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What do we","do we pass","we pass on","pass on to","on to those","to those who","those who come","who come after","come after us","after us ,","us , for",", for both","for both good","both good and","good and for","and for bad","And what difference","what difference can","difference can one","can one person","one person make","person make in","make in the","in the world","These are the","are the universal","the universal questions","universal questions that","questions that occupy","that occupy director","occupy director John","director John Webster","John Webster in","Webster in this","in this personal","this personal cinematic","personal cinematic letter","cinematic letter to","letter to his","to his great-grandchild","his great-grandchild Dorit","great-grandchild Dorit ,","Dorit , a",", a little","a little girl","little girl who","girl who will","who will be","will be born","be born in","born in the","in the 2060","the 2060 's","2060 's ,","'s , and",", and who","and who 's","who 's little","'s little yellow","little yellow boots","yellow boots will","boots will walk","will walk on","walk on a","on a very","a very different","very different shoreline","different shoreline to","shoreline to the","to the one","the one we","one we knew","The story seamlessly","story seamlessly weaves","seamlessly weaves together","weaves together past","together past ,","past , present",", present and","present and future","and future into","future into a","into a beautiful","a beautiful ,","beautiful , moving",", moving and","moving and hopeful","and hopeful documentary","hopeful documentary film","documentary film about","film about the","about the power","the power of","power of each","of each of","each of us","of us to","us to make","to make a","make a difference"],"2grams":["What do","do we","we pass","pass on","on to","to those","those who","who come","come after","after us","us ,",", for","for both","both good","good and","and for","for bad","And what","what difference","difference can","can one","one person","person make","make in","in the","the world","These are","are the","the universal","universal questions","questions that","that occupy","occupy director","director John","John Webster","Webster in","in this","this personal","personal cinematic","cinematic letter","letter to","to his","his great-grandchild","great-grandchild Dorit","Dorit ,",", a","a little","little girl","girl who","who will","will be","be born","born in","in the","the 2060","2060 's","'s ,",", and","and who","who 's","'s little","little yellow","yellow boots","boots will","will walk","walk on","on a","a very","very different","different shoreline","shoreline to","to the","the one","one we","we knew","The story","story seamlessly","seamlessly weaves","weaves together","together past","past ,",", present","present and","and future","future into","into a","a beautiful","beautiful ,",", moving","moving and","and hopeful","hopeful documentary","documentary film","film about","about the","the power","power of","of each","each of","of us","us to","to make","make a","a difference"]}

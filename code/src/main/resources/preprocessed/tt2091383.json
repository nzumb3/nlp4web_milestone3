{"title":"Pad Yatra: A Green Odyssey","plot":"PAD YATRA: A Green Odyssey is the adventure of 700 people trekking across the Himalayas with a call to save the planet's \"3rd pole,\" a glacial region now devastated by the climate chaos associated with global warming. Battling the most treacherous terrain on the planet, the trekkers spread their message of ecological compassion through human's most basic means -by walking on foot, village to village, and showing by example. Surviving harrowing injuries, illness, and starvation, they emerge with nearly half a ton of plastic litter strapped to their backs, triggering an historic green revolution across the rooftop of the world.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["PAD","YATRA",":","A","Green","Odyssey","is","the","adventur","of","700","peopl","trekk","across","the","Himalaya","with","a","call","to","save","the","planet","'s","\"","3rd","pole",",","\"","a","glacial","region","now","devast","by","the","climat","chao","associ","with","global","warm",".","Battl","the","most","treacher","terrain","on","the","planet",",","the","trekker","spread","their","messag","of","ecolog","compass","through","human","'s","most","basic","mean","-","by","walk","on","foot",",","villag","to","villag",",","and","show","by","exampl",".","Surviv","harrow","injuri",",","ill",",","and","starvat",",","they","emerg","with","near","half","a","ton","of","plastic","litter","strap","to","their","back",",","trigger","an","histor","green","revolut","across","the","rooftop","of","the","world","."],"lemmas":["PAD","YATRA",":","A","Green","Odyssey","be","the","adventure","of","700","people","trek","across","the","Himalayas","with","a","call","to","save","the","planet","'s","``","3rd","pole",",","''","a","glacial","region","now","devastate","by","the","climate","chaos","associate","with","global","warming",".","battle","the","most","treacherous","terrain","on","the","planet",",","the","trekker","spread","they","message","of","ecological","compassion","through","human","'s","most","basic","means","-","by","walk","on","foot",",","village","to","village",",","and","show","by","example",".","survive","harrowing","injury",",","illness",",","and","starvation",",","they","emerge","with","nearly","half","a","ton","of","plastic","litter","strap","to","they","back",",","trigger","a","historic","green","revolution","across","the","rooftop","of","the","world","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["PAD YATRA :","YATRA : A",": A Green","A Green Odyssey","Green Odyssey is","Odyssey is the","is the adventure","the adventure of","adventure of 700","of 700 people","700 people trekking","people trekking across","trekking across the","across the Himalayas","the Himalayas with","Himalayas with a","with a call","a call to","call to save","to save the","save the planet","the planet 's","planet 's \"","'s \" 3rd","\" 3rd pole","3rd pole ,","pole , \"",", \" a","\" a glacial","a glacial region","glacial region now","region now devastated","now devastated by","devastated by the","by the climate","the climate chaos","climate chaos associated","chaos associated with","associated with global","with global warming","Battling the most","the most treacherous","most treacherous terrain","treacherous terrain on","terrain on the","on the planet","the planet ,","planet , the",", the trekkers","the trekkers spread","trekkers spread their","spread their message","their message of","message of ecological","of ecological compassion","ecological compassion through","compassion through human","through human 's","human 's most","'s most basic","most basic means","basic means -","means -

{"title":"Nadia et les hippopotames","plot":"November/December 1995, and France is paralysed by the transportation strikes. The huge traffic jams oblige Parisians to walk or cycle their way through the winter months. Nadia is a young woman who survives on minimum allowance with her six-month-old son, Christopher. One day whilst watching the news, she thinks she recognises the baby's missing father in a crowd of striking rail-workers at Austerlitz station. She decides to go and find him.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["November/Decemb","1995",",","and","Franc","is","paralys","by","the","transport","strike",".","The","huge","traffic","jam","oblig","Parisian","to","walk","or","cycl","their","way","through","the","winter","month",".","Nadia","is","a","young","woman","who","surviv","on","minimum","allow","with","her","six-month-old","son",",","Christoph",".","One","day","whilst","watch","the","news",",","she","think","she","recognis","the","babi","'s","miss","father","in","a","crowd","of","strike","rail-work","at","Austerlitz","station",".","She","decid","to","go","and","find","him","."],"lemmas":["november/december","1995",",","and","France","be","paralyse","by","the","transportation","strike",".","the","huge","traffic","jam","oblige","Parisians","to","walk","or","cycle","they","way","through","the","winter","month",".","Nadia","be","a","young","woman","who","survive","on","minimum","allowance","with","she","six-month-old","son",",","Christopher",".","one","day","whilst","watch","the","news",",","she","think","she","recognise","the","baby","'s","miss","father","in","a","crowd","of","striking","rail-worker","at","Austerlitz","station",".","she","decide","to","go","and","find","he","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["November/December 1995 ,","1995 , and",", and France","and France is","France is paralysed","is paralysed by","paralysed by the","by the transportation","the transportation strikes","The huge traffic","huge traffic jams","traffic jams oblige","jams oblige Parisians","oblige Parisians to","Parisians to walk","to walk or","walk or cycle","or cycle their","cycle their way","their way through","way through the","through the winter","the winter months","Nadia is a","is a young","a young woman","young woman who","woman who survives","who survives on","survives on minimum","on minimum allowance","minimum allowance with","allowance with her","with her six-month-old","her six-month-old son","six-month-old son ,","son , Christopher","One day whilst","day whilst watching","whilst watching the","watching the news","the news ,","news , she",", she thinks","she thinks she","thinks she recognises","she recognises the","recognises the baby","the baby 's","baby 's missing","'s missing father","missing father in","father in a","in a crowd","a crowd of","crowd of striking","of striking rail-workers","striking rail-workers at","rail-workers at Austerlitz","at Austerlitz station","She decides to","decides to go","to go and","go and find","and find him"],"2grams":["November/December 1995","1995 ,",", and","and France","France is","is paralysed","paralysed by","by the","the transportation","transportation strikes","The huge","huge traffic","traffic jams","jams oblige","oblige Parisians","Parisians to","to walk","walk or","or cycle","cycle their","their way","way through","through the","the winter","winter months","Nadia is","is a","a young","young woman","woman who","who survives","survives on","on minimum","minimum allowance","allowance with","with her","her six-month-old","six-month-old son","son ,",", Christopher","One day","day whilst","whilst watching","watching the","the news","news ,",", she","she thinks","thinks she","she recognises","recognises the","the baby","baby 's","'s missing","missing father","father in","in a","a crowd","crowd of","of striking","striking rail-workers","rail-workers at","at Austerlitz","Austerlitz station","She decides","decides to","to go","go and","and find","find him"]}

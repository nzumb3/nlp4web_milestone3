{"title":"Focal Point","plot":"An Artist is stopped from jumping off a rooftop by a wanderer who convinces him to postpone his death just long enough to witness a nearby nest of baby birds hatching from their eggs. The experience moves the Artist into spending the day talking about life and art with the wanderer, who turns out to be a young psychologist who hates his job and other people - but is inclined to embrace the little artistic miracles in nature. The Artist and the Psychologist learn that they may be more suited if they switched professions and found new areas of focus in their lives.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["An","Artist","is","stop","from","jump","off","a","rooftop","by","a","wander","who","convinc","him","to","postpon","his","death","just","long","enough","to","wit","a","nearbi","nest","of","babi","bird","hatch","from","their","egg",".","The","experi","move","the","Artist","into","spend","the","day","talk","about","life","and","art","with","the","wander",",","who","turn","out","to","be","a","young","psychologist","who","hate","his","job","and","other","peopl","-","but","is","inclin","to","embrac","the","littl","artist","miracl","in","natur",".","The","Artist","and","the","Psychologist","learn","that","they","may","be","more","suit","if","they","switch","profess","and","found","new","area","of","focus","in","their","live","."],"lemmas":["a","Artist","be","stop","from","jump","off","a","rooftop","by","a","wanderer","who","convince","he","to","postpone","he","death","just","long","enough","to","witness","a","nearby","nest","of","baby","bird","hatch","from","they","egg",".","the","experience","move","the","Artist","into","spend","the","day","talk","about","life","and","art","with","the","wanderer",",","who","turn","out","to","be","a","young","psychologist","who","hate","he","job","and","other","people","-","but","be","incline","to","embrace","the","little","artistic","miracle","in","nature",".","the","Artist","and","the","psychologist","learn","that","they","may","be","more","suit","if","they","switch","profession","and","find","new","area","of","focus","in","they","life","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["An Artist is","Artist is stopped","is stopped from","stopped from jumping","from jumping off","jumping off a","off a rooftop","a rooftop by","rooftop by a","by a wanderer","a wanderer who","wanderer who convinces","who convinces him","convinces him to","him to postpone","to postpone his","postpone his death","his death just","death just long","just long enough","long enough to","enough to witness","to witness a","witness a nearby","a nearby nest","nearby nest of","nest of baby","of baby birds","baby birds hatching","birds hatching from","hatching from their","from their eggs","The experience moves","experience moves the","moves the Artist","the Artist into","Artist into spending","into spending the","spending the day","the day talking","day talking about","talking about life","about life and","life and art","and art with","art with the","with the wanderer","the wanderer ,","wanderer , who",", who turns","who turns out","turns out to","out to be","to be a","be a young","a young psychologist","young psychologist who","psychologist who hates","who hates his","hates his job","his job and","job and other","and other people","other people -","people - but","- but is","but is inclined","is inclined to","inclined to embrace","to embrace the","embrace the little","the little artistic","little artistic miracles","artistic miracles in","miracles in nature","The Artist and","Artist and the","and the Psychologist","the Psychologist learn","Psychologist learn that","learn that they","that they may","they may be","may be more","be more suited","more suited if","suited if they","if they switched","they switched professions","switched professions and","professions and found","and found new","found new areas","new areas of","areas of focus","of focus in","focus in their","in their lives"],"2grams":["An Artist","Artist is","is stopped","stopped from","from jumping","jumping off","off a","a rooftop","rooftop by","by a","a wanderer","wanderer who","who convinces","convinces him","him to","to postpone","postpone his","his death","death just","just long","long enough","enough to","to witness","witness a","a nearby","nearby nest","nest of","of baby","baby birds","birds hatching","hatching from","from their","their eggs","The experience","experience moves","moves the","the Artist","Artist into","into spending","spending the","the day","day talking","talking about","about life","life and","and art","art with","with the","the wanderer","wanderer ,",", who","who turns","turns out","out to","to be","be a","a young","young psychologist","psychologist who","who hates","hates his","his job","job and","and other","other people","people -","- but","but is","is inclined","inclined to","to embrace","embrace the","the little","little artistic","artistic miracles","miracles in","in nature","The Artist","Artist and","and the","the Psychologist","Psychologist learn","learn that","that they","they may","may be","be more","more suited","suited if","if they","they switched","switched professions","professions and","and found","found new","new areas","areas of","of focus","focus in","in their","their lives"]}

{"title":"An Unreal Dream: The Michael Morton Story","plot":"'Our procedure has been always haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. It is an unreal dream.' - Justice Learned Hand, 1923. The prospect of unjust imprisonment is a plight both easily imagined and terrifying, and we all wonder how we might fare in such a grim circumstance. No case in modern America illuminates this condition more completely than the story of Michael Morton. in 1986 his young wife was brutally murdered in front of their only child, and he was accused and convicted of the crime, spending a quarter century in Texas prisons. His unreal dream was and is a powerful journey through despair and abandonment to a greater freedom than most of us know, but all can appreciate.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"," Crime"],"stems":["'","Our","procedur","has","been","alway","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","the","innoc","man","convict",".","It","is","an","unreal","dream",".","'","-","Justic","Learn","Hand",",","1923",".","The","prospect","of","unjust","imprison","is","a","plight","both","easili","imagin","and","terrifi",",","and","we","all","wonder","how","we","might","fare","in","such","a","grim","circumst",".","No","case","in","modern","America","illumin","this","condit","more","complet","than","the","stori","of","Michael","Morton",".","in","1986","his","young","wife","was","brutal","murder","in","front","of","their","onli","child",",","and","he","was","accus","and","convict","of","the","crime",",","spend","a","quarter","centuri","in","Texa","prison",".","His","unreal","dream","was","and","is","a","power","journey","through","despair","and","abandon","to","a","greater","freedom","than","most","of","us","know",",","but","all","can","appreci","."],"lemmas":["'","we","procedure","have","be","always","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","the","innocent","man","convict",".","it","be","a","unreal","dream",".","'","-","Justice","Learned","hand",",","1923",".","the","prospect","of","unjust","imprisonment","be","a","plight","both","easily","imagine","and","terrifying",",","and","we","all","wonder","how","we","might","fare","in","such","a","grim","circumstance",".","no","case","in","modern","America","illuminate","this","condition","more","completely","than","the","story","of","Michael","Morton",".","in","1986","he","young","wife","be","brutally","murder","in","front","of","they","only","child",",","and","he","be","accuse","and","convict","of","the","crime",",","spend","a","quarter","century","in","Texas","prison",".","he","unreal","dream","be","and","be","a","powerful","journey","through","despair","and","abandonment","to","a","greater","freedom","than","most","of","we","know",",","but","all","can","appreciate","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Our procedure","Our procedure has","procedure has been","has been always","been always haunted","always haunted by","haunted by the","by the ghost","the ghost of","ghost of the","of the innocent","the innocent man","innocent man convicted","It is an","is an unreal","an unreal dream","unreal dream .","dream .

{"title":"Faith, Love and Charity","plot":"A woman goes aboard one of the big ships that docks at her local harbour, the Port of Århus. She is alone with her camera. She talks to sailors from all over the world. Each ship is like an expedition to a new country. A portrait of the sailor of today. A classic tale given a brand-new guise. A film about prejudices and myths, love and yearning, sailors and their women, with Christmas providing a framework for the story.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","woman","goe","aboard","one","of","the","big","ship","that","dock","at","her","local","harbour",",","the","Port","of","Århus",".","She","is","alon","with","her","camera",".","She","talk","to","sailor","from","all","over","the","world",".","Each","ship","is","like","an","expedit","to","a","new","countri",".","A","portrait","of","the","sailor","of","today",".","A","classic","tale","given","a","brand-new","guis",".","A","film","about","prejudic","and","myth",",","love","and","yearn",",","sailor","and","their","women",",","with","Christma","provid","a","framework","for","the","stori","."],"lemmas":["a","woman","go","aboard","one","of","the","big","ship","that","dock","at","she","local","harbour",",","the","Port","of","Århus",".","she","be","alone","with","she","camera",".","she","talk","to","sailor","from","all","over","the","world",".","each","ship","be","like","a","expedition","to","a","new","country",".","a","portrait","of","the","sailor","of","today",".","a","classic","tale","give","a","brand-new","guise",".","a","film","about","prejudice","and","myth",",","love","and","yearning",",","sailor","and","they","woman",",","with","Christmas","provide","a","framework","for","the","story","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A woman goes","woman goes aboard","goes aboard one","aboard one of","one of the","of the big","the big ships","big ships that","ships that docks","that docks at","docks at her","at her local","her local harbour","local harbour ,","harbour , the",", the Port","the Port of","Port of Århus","She is alone","is alone with","alone with her","with her camera","She talks to","talks to sailors","to sailors from","sailors from all","from all over","all over the","over the world","Each ship is","ship is like","is like an","like an expedition","an expedition to","expedition to a","to a new","a new country","A portrait of","portrait of the","of the sailor","the sailor of","sailor of today","A classic tale","classic tale given","tale given a","given a brand-new","a brand-new guise","A film about","film about prejudices","about prejudices and","prejudices and myths","and myths ,","myths , love",", love and","love and yearning","and yearning ,","yearning , sailors",", sailors and","sailors and their","and their women","their women ,","women , with",", with Christmas","with Christmas providing","Christmas providing a","providing a framework","a framework for","framework for the","for the story"],"2grams":["A woman","woman goes","goes aboard","aboard one","one of","of the","the big","big ships","ships that","that docks","docks at","at her","her local","local harbour","harbour ,",", the","the Port","Port of","of Århus","She is","is alone","alone with","with her","her camera","She talks","talks to","to sailors","sailors from","from all","all over","over the","the world","Each ship","ship is","is like","like an","an expedition","expedition to","to a","a new","new country","A portrait","portrait of","of the","the sailor","sailor of","of today","A classic","classic tale","tale given","given a","a brand-new","brand-new guise","A film","film about","about prejudices","prejudices and","and myths","myths ,",", love","love and","and yearning","yearning ,",", sailors","sailors and","and their","their women","women ,",", with","with Christmas","Christmas providing","providing a","a framework","framework for","for the","the story"]}

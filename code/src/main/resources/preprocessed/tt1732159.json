{"title":"Self Made","plot":"Hundreds of people responded to this advert when it was placed in local and national newspapers, online and in job centres around London and Newcastle. Seven people were selected to appear in Self Made, where they attend a Method Acting workshop to explore their fantasy selves. The workshops are led by experienced drama teacher Sam Rumbelow and form the core of the film. As the film progresses, the participants use real life experiences to bring their characters to life, and ultimately star in their own mini-film. Revelation is key to the process, as is creating an environment that allows the unexpected to happen.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Hundr","of","peopl","respond","to","this","advert","when","it","was","place","in","local","and","nation","newspap",",","onlin","and","in","job","centr","around","London","and","Newcastl",".","Seven","peopl","were","select","to","appear","in","Self","Made",",","where","they","attend","a","Method","Acting","workshop","to","explor","their","fantasi","selv",".","The","workshop","are","led","by","experienc","drama","teacher","Sam","Rumbelow","and","form","the","core","of","the","film",".","As","the","film","progress",",","the","particip","use","real","life","experi","to","bring","their","charact","to","life",",","and","ultim","star","in","their","own","mini-film",".","Revel","is","key","to","the","process",",","as","is","creat","an","environ","that","allow","the","unexpect","to","happen","."],"lemmas":["hundred","of","people","respond","to","this","advert","when","it","be","place","in","local","and","national","newspaper",",","online","and","in","job","centre","around","London","and","Newcastle",".","seven","people","be","select","to","appear","in","self","Made",",","where","they","attend","a","Method","Acting","workshop","to","explore","they","fantasy","self",".","the","workshop","be","lead","by","experienced","drama","teacher","Sam","Rumbelow","and","form","the","core","of","the","film",".","as","the","film","progress",",","the","participant","use","real","life","experience","to","bring","they","character","to","life",",","and","ultimately","star","in","they","own","mini-film",".","revelation","be","key","to","the","process",",","as","be","create","a","environment","that","allow","the","unexpected","to","happen","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hundreds

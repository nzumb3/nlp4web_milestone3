{"title":"Y'aura t'il de la neige à Noël?","plot":"A woman and her seven children live on a farm in Southern France. In spite of the hard work and the mediocre accommodation, their life would be a happy one, but for one person: the owner of the farm an egotistic and authoritarian individual, who is also the lover of the woman and the father of all her children. The farmer handles them as his property, uses them as cheap labour to work in the fields, and denies them the right to leave the farm. It is only the love of the woman for her children that allows them to endure their situation; but even for her, disenchantment has set in.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","woman","and","her","seven","children","live","on","a","farm","in","Southern","Franc",".","In","spite","of","the","hard","work","and","the","mediocr","accommod",",","their","life","would","be","a","happi","one",",","but","for","one","person",":","the","owner","of","the","farm","an","egotist","and","authoritarian","individu",",","who","is","also","the","lover","of","the","woman","and","the","father","of","all","her","children",".","The","farmer","handl","them","as","his","properti",",","use","them","as","cheap","labour","to","work","in","the","field",",","and","deni","them","the","right","to","leav","the","farm",".","It","is","onli","the","love","of","the","woman","for","her","children","that","allow","them","to","endur","their","situat",";","but","even","for","her",",","disenchant","has","set","in","."],"lemmas":["a","woman","and","she","seven","child","live","on","a","farm","in","Southern","France",".","in","spite","of","the","hard","work","and","the","mediocre","accommodation",",","they","life","would","be","a","happy","one",",","but","for","one","person",":","the","owner","of","the","farm","a","egotistic","and","authoritarian","individual",",","who","be","also","the","lover","of","the","woman","and","the","father","of","all","she","child",".","the","farmer","handle","they","as","he","property",",","use","they","as","cheap","labour","to","work","in","the","field",",","and","deny","they","the","right","to","leave","the","farm",".","it","be","only","the","love","of","the","woman","for","she","child","that","allow","they","to","endure","they","situation",";","but","even","for","she",",","disenchantment","have","set","in","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A woman and","woman and her","and her seven","her seven children","seven children live","children live on","live on a","on a farm","a farm in","farm in Southern","in Southern France","In spite of","spite of the","of the hard","the hard work","hard work and","work and the","and the mediocre","the mediocre accommodation","mediocre accommodation ,","accommodation , their",", their life","their life would","life would be","would be a","be a happy","a happy one","happy one ,","one , but",", but for","but for one","for one person","one person :","person : the",": the owner","the owner of","owner of the","of the farm","the farm an","farm an egotistic","an egotistic and","egotistic and authoritarian","and authoritarian individual","authoritarian individual ,","individual , who",", who is","who is also","is also the","also the lover","the lover of","lover of the","of the woman","the woman and","woman and the","and the father","the father of","father of all","of all her","all her children","The farmer handles","farmer handles them","handles them as","them as his","as his property","his property ,","property , uses",", uses them","uses them as","them as cheap","as cheap labour","cheap labour to","labour to work","to work in","work in the","in the fields","the fields ,","fields , and",", and denies","and denies them","denies them the","them the right","the right to","right to leave","to leave the","leave the farm","It is only","is only the","only the love","the love of","love of the","of the woman","the woman for","woman for her","for her children","her children that","children that allows","that allows them","allows them to","them to endure","to endure their","endure their situation","their situation ;","situation ;

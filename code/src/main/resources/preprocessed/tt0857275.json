{"title":"Wonderful World","plot":"Ben is a failed children's folk singer and less-than-extraordinary weekend dad. Deeply cynical, Ben's sole pleasure in life is derived from chess games with his Senegalese roommate Ibou. When Ibou is suddenly struck ill and an insensitive municipal employee exacerbates the emergency situation, Ben's pessimistic world view seems unequivocally confirmed. But when Ibou's sister Khadi takes his place in their apartment, what starts as an awkward living arrangement becomes something more, and Ben finds that cynicism may be all a matter of perspective.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Ben","is","a","fail","children","'s","folk","singer","and","less-than-extraordinari","weekend","dad",".","Deepli","cynic",",","Ben","'s","sole","pleasur","in","life","is","deriv","from","chess","game","with","his","Senegales","roommat","Ibou",".","When","Ibou","is","sudden","struck","ill","and","an","insensit","municip","employe","exacerb","the","emerg","situat",",","Ben","'s","pessimist","world","view","seem","unequivoc","confirm",".","But","when","Ibou","'s","sister","Khadi","take","his","place","in","their","apart",",","what","start","as","an","awkward","live","arrang","becom","someth","more",",","and","Ben","find","that","cynic","may","be","all","a","matter","of","perspect","."],"lemmas":["Ben","be","a","failed","children","'s","folk","singer","and","less-than-extraordinary","weekend","dad",".","deeply","cynical",",","Ben","'s","sole","pleasure","in","life","be","derive","from","chess","game","with","he","Senegalese","roommate","Ibou",".","when","Ibou","be","suddenly","strike","ill","and","a","insensitive","municipal","employee","exacerbate","the","emergency","situation",",","Ben","'s","pessimistic","world","view","seem","unequivocally","confirm",".","but","when","Ibou","'s","sister","Khadi","take","he","place","in","they","apartment",",","what","start","as","a","awkward","living","arrangement","become","something","more",",","and","Ben","find","that","cynicism","may","be","all","a","matter","of","perspective","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ben is a","is a failed","a failed children","failed children 's","children 's folk","'s folk singer","folk singer and","singer and less-than-extraordinary","and less-than-extraordinary weekend","less-than-extraordinary weekend dad","Deeply cynical ,","cynical , Ben",", Ben 's","Ben 's sole","'s sole pleasure","sole pleasure in","pleasure in life","in life is","life is derived","is derived from","derived from chess","from chess games","chess games with","games with his","with his Senegalese","his Senegalese roommate","Senegalese roommate Ibou","When Ibou is","Ibou is suddenly","is suddenly struck","suddenly struck ill","struck ill and","ill and an","and an insensitive","an insensitive municipal","insensitive municipal employee","municipal employee exacerbates","employee exacerbates the","exacerbates the emergency","the emergency situation","emergency situation ,","situation , Ben",", Ben 's","Ben 's pessimistic","'s pessimistic world","pessimistic world view","world view seems","view seems unequivocally","seems unequivocally confirmed","But when Ibou","when Ibou 's","Ibou 's sister","'s sister Khadi","sister Khadi takes","Khadi takes his","takes his place","his place in","place in their","in their apartment","their apartment ,","apartment , what",", what starts","what starts as","starts as an","as an awkward","an awkward living","awkward living arrangement","living arrangement becomes","arrangement becomes something","becomes something more","something more ,","more , and",", and Ben","and Ben finds","Ben finds that","finds that cynicism","that cynicism may","cynicism may be","may be all","be all a","all a matter","a matter of","matter of perspective"],"2grams":["Ben is","is a","a failed","failed children","children 's","'s folk","folk singer","singer and","and less-than-extraordinary","less-than-extraordinary weekend","weekend dad","Deeply cynical","cynical ,",", Ben","Ben 's","'s sole","sole pleasure","pleasure in","in life","life is","is derived","derived from","from chess","chess games","games with","with his","his Senegalese","Senegalese roommate","roommate Ibou","When Ibou","Ibou is","is suddenly","suddenly struck","struck ill","ill and","and an","an insensitive","insensitive municipal","municipal employee","employee exacerbates","exacerbates the","the emergency","emergency situation","situation ,",", Ben","Ben 's","'s pessimistic","pessimistic world","world view","view seems","seems unequivocally","unequivocally confirmed","But when","when Ibou","Ibou 's","'s sister","sister Khadi","Khadi takes","takes his","his place","place in","in their","their apartment","apartment ,",", what","what starts","starts as","as an","an awkward","awkward living","living arrangement","arrangement becomes","becomes something","something more","more ,",", and","and Ben","Ben finds","finds that","that cynicism","cynicism may","may be","be all","all a","a matter","matter of","of perspective"]}

{"title":"Poets of Mongolia","plot":"The film starts in Nalaikh where old Mongolchaan is one of the many former miners who - after the closure of the mine - continues digging for coal in order to survive. Despite the extremely severe working conditions, he perseveres to support his children. Mongolchaan sells his coal to Basandorj, a middleman between the coal pits and the power stations in the city. Basandorj delivers the coal to a power station where young Erdenetsetseg is in charge. Despite the harsh environment, she enjoys her life and work. The electricity produced by the power plant enlightens blind Amarjarkhal's apartment. Ever since she moved from Nalaikh to the capital she makes a living as a writer and performer of popular songs. On a trip back to her native town, Amarjarkhal expresses her desire to be able to see. Meanwhile, Oyuna, who lives in Belgium ever since she married a Belgian man, is preparing to return to her home country which she left eight years ago. She's eager to show her native land to her 3-year old son... Through poetry Mongolchaan praises nature, Erdenetsetseg evokes man's destiny, Amarjarkhal expresses individual desire, and Oyuna finds the strength to survive in a foreign country.

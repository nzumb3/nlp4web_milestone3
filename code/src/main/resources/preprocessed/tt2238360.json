{"title":"The Lost Secret of the Throne","plot":"The Lost Secret of the Throne is a documentary film developed as a project between three mothers and their respective daughters on the cusp of womanhood. Developed as a project to reinforce the girls' awareness of their own strength and the strength of women throughout history, the project explores the depiction of breastfeeding in Western popular culture. The exploration begins 6000 years back in history in ancient Egypt with images of Isis, continues through the catacombs of Rome and images of Mary, and on into the museums of the world. The girls, guided by their mothers and a wise grandmother, work to make sense of the evolving images of breastfeeding in art as a reflection of a cultural framework of women, beauty and power.","genres":["Documentary"," History","

{"title":"After the Cup: Sons of Sakhnin United","plot":"There are over 1.4 million Arabs who are citizens of Israel, facing the challenge of living in a Jewish state while maintaining their Arabic heritage. In Israel, soccer is king, and Bnei Sakhnin has become the first team from an Arab town to win the prestigious Israeli Cup- and represent Israel in European competition. Fielding Arab, Jewish and foreign-born players, owned by an Arab, and coached by a Jew, Bnei Sakhnin's success has begun to represent a symbol of coexistence, a potential bridge between Arabs and Jews in Israel. But as Bnei Sakhnin begins its first season after their unexpected win, they know it may well be their first and last in the limelight. Underfunded, lacking experience, and with a rift brewing between the star player and the coach, they face unprecedented challenges- impossible expectations have come with their sudden success, and failure to live up to them will carry consequences both on and off the field.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["There","are","over","1.4","million","Arab","who","are","citizen","of","Israel",",","face","the","challeng","of","live","in","a","Jewish","state","while","maintain","their","Arabic","heritag",".","In","Israel",",","soccer","is","king",",","and","Bnei","Sakhnin","has","becom","the","first","team","from","an","Arab","town","to","win","the","prestigi","Israeli","Cup","-","and","repres","Israel","in","European","competit",".","Field","Arab",",","Jewish","and","foreign-born","player",",","own","by","an","Arab",",","and","coach","by","a","Jew",",","Bnei","Sakhnin","'s","success","has","begun","to","repres","a","symbol","of","coexist",",","a","potenti","bridg","between","Arab","and","Jew","in","Israel",".","But","as","Bnei","Sakhnin","begin","it","first","season","after","their","unexpect","win",",","they","know","it","may","well","be","their","first","and","last","in","the","limelight",".","Underfund",",","lack","experi",",","and","with","a","rift","brew","between","the","star","player","and","the","coach",",","they","face","unpreced","challeng","-","imposs","expect","have","come","with","their","sudden","success",",","and","failur","to","live","up","to","them","will","carri","consequ","both","on","and","off","the","field","."],"lemmas":["there","be","over","1.4","million","Arabs","who","be","citizen","of","Israel",",","face","the","challenge","of","live","in","a","jewish","state","while","maintain","they","arabic","heritage",".","in","Israel",",","soccer","be","king",",","and","Bnei","Sakhnin","have","become","the","first","team","from","a","Arab","town","to","win","the","prestigious","Israeli","Cup","-","and","represent","Israel","in","european","competition",".","Fielding","Arab",",","Jewish","and","foreign-born","player",",","own","by","a","Arab",",","and","coach","by","a","Jew",",","Bnei","Sakhnin","'s","success","have","begin","to","represent","a","symbol","of","coexistence",",","a","potential","bridge","between","Arabs","and","Jews","in","Israel",".","but","as","Bnei","Sakhnin","begin","its","first","season","after","they","unexpected","win",",","they","know","it","may","well","be","they","first","and","last","in","the","limelight",".","underfunded",",","lack","experience",",","and","with","a","rift","brewing","between","the","star","player","and","the","coach",",","they","face","unprecedented","challenge","-","impossible","expectation","have","come","with","they","sudden","success",",","and","failure","to","live","up","to","they","will","carry","consequence","both","on","and","off","the","field","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["There are over","are over 1.4","over 1.4 million","1.4 million Arabs","million Arabs who","Arabs who are","who are citizens","are citizens of","citizens of Israel","of Israel ,","Israel , facing",", facing the","facing the challenge","the challenge of","challenge of living","of living in","living in a","in a Jewish","a Jewish state","Jewish state while","state while maintaining","while maintaining their","maintaining their Arabic","their Arabic heritage","In Israel ,","Israel , soccer",", soccer is","soccer is king","is king ,","king , and",", and Bnei","and Bnei Sakhnin","Bnei Sakhnin has","Sakhnin has become","has become the","become the first","the first team","first team from","team from an","from an Arab","an Arab town","Arab town to","town to win","to win the","win the prestigious","the prestigious Israeli","prestigious Israeli Cup","Israeli Cup -","Cup -

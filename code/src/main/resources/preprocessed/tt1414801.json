{"title":"A Cry from Iran","plot":"An Islamic judge in north of Iran condemned a zealous Christian convert, Mehdi Dibaj, from Islam to death. His crime was apostasy. Dibaj had already served ten years in prison. Haik Hovsepian, the leader of Evangelical Christians of Iran, chose to speak out and launch an international campaign for Dibaj's sentence to be overturned. Haik's campaign was successful, and Dibaj was released only a few days before his execution date. But, there was a price to pay... On January19,1994, Bishop Haik Hovsepian disappeared. Twelve days later his corpse was identified by his son. The body had been stabbed 26 times. He was not the last to be martyred. Since then several other Christians have been brutally tortured and put to death. This is the untold story of their sacrifices, courage, commitment and faith.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["An","Islamic","judg","in","north","of","Iran","condemn","a","zealous","Christian","convert",",","Mehdi","Dibaj",",","from","Islam","to","death",".","His","crime","was","apostasi",".","Dibaj","had","alreadi","serv","ten","year","in","prison",".","Haik","Hovsepian",",","the","leader","of","Evangel","Christian","of","Iran",",","chose","to","speak","out","and","launch","an","intern","campaign","for","Dibaj","'s","sentenc","to","be","overturn",".","Haik","'s","campaign","was","success",",","and","Dibaj","was","releas","onli","a","few","day","befor","his","execut","date",".","But",",","there","was","a","price","to","pay","...","On","January19",",1994",",","Bishop","Haik","Hovsepian","disappear",".","Twelv","day","later","his","corps","was","identifi","by","his","son",".","The","bodi","had","been","stab","26","time",".","He","was","not","the","last","to","be","martyr",".","Sinc","then","sever","other","Christian","have","been","brutal","tortur","and","put","to","death",".","This","is","the","untold","stori","of","their","sacrific",",","courag",",","commit","and","faith","."],"lemmas":["a","islamic","judge","in","north","of","Iran","condemn","a","zealous","Christian","convert",",","Mehdi","Dibaj",",","from","Islam","to","death",".","he","crime","be","apostasy",".","Dibaj","have","already","serve","ten","year","in","prison",".","Haik","Hovsepian",",","the","leader","of","evangelical","christian","of","Iran",",","choose","to","speak","out","and","launch","a","international","campaign","for","Dibaj","'s","sentence","to","be","overturn",".","Haik","'s","campaign","be","successful",",","and","Dibaj","be","release","only","a","few","day","before","he","execution","date",".","but",",","there","be","a","price","to","pay","...","on","january19",",1994",",","Bishop","Haik","Hovsepian","disappear",".","twelve","day","later","he","corpse","be","identify","by","he","son",".","the","body","have","be","stab","26","time",".","he","be","not","the","last","to","be","martyr",".","since","then","several","other","christian","have","be","brutally","tortured","and","put","to","death",".","this","be","the","untold","story","of","they","sacrifice",",","courage",",","commitment","and","faith","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An Islamic judge","Islamic judge in","judge in north","in north of","north of Iran","of Iran condemned","Iran condemned a","condemned a zealous","a zealous Christian","zealous Christian convert","Christian convert ,","convert , Mehdi",", Mehdi Dibaj","Mehdi Dibaj ,","Dibaj , from",", from Islam","from Islam to","Islam to death","His crime was","crime was apostasy","Dibaj had already","had already served","already served ten","served ten years","ten years in","years in prison","Haik Hovsepian ,","Hovsepian , the",", the leader","the leader of","leader of Evangelical","of Evangelical Christians","Evangelical Christians of","Christians of Iran","of Iran ,","Iran , chose",", chose to","chose to speak","to speak out","speak out and","out and launch","and launch an","launch an international","an international campaign","international campaign for","campaign for Dibaj","for Dibaj 's","Dibaj 's sentence","'s sentence to","sentence to be","to be overturned","Haik 's campaign","'s campaign was","campaign was successful","was successful ,","successful , and",", and Dibaj","and Dibaj was","Dibaj was released","was released only","released only a","only a few","a few days","few days before","days before his","before his execution","his execution date","But , there",", there was","there was a","was a price","a price to","price to pay","to pay ...","pay ...

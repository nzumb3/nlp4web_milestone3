{"title":"Straight A's","plot":"Years ago, Scott left common lover Katherine at the altar to become a hedonistic junkie. She married his brother William, a successful Louisiana workaholic, who sired a daughter but probably not bright nerd son Charles and is serially adulterous on his many business trips. Now Scott returns on horseback, having lost his drivers permit, inviting himself and proving a popular, yet unreliable uncle for Charles. Making up with father is impossible due to Alzheimer. As Scott keeps surprising his family, his sad secret emerges.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Year","ago",",","Scott","left","common","lover","Katherin","at","the","altar","to","becom","a","hedonist","junki",".","She","marri","his","brother","William",",","a","success","Louisiana","workahol",",","who","sire","a","daughter","but","probabl","not","bright","nerd","son","Charl","and","is","serial","adulter","on","his","mani","busi","trip",".","Now","Scott","return","on","horseback",",","have","lost","his","driver","permit",",","invit","himself","and","prove","a","popular",",","yet","unreli","uncl","for","Charl",".","Make","up","with","father","is","imposs","due","to","Alzheimer",".","As","Scott","keep","surpris","his","famili",",","his","sad","secret","emerg","."],"lemmas":["year","ago",",","Scott","leave","common","lover","Katherine","at","the","altar","to","become","a","hedonistic","junkie",".","she","marry","he","brother","William",",","a","successful","Louisiana","workaholic",",","who","sire","a","daughter","but","probably","not","bright","nerd","son","Charles","and","be","serially","adulterous","on","he","many","business","trip",".","now","Scott","return","on","horseback",",","have","lose","he","driver","permit",",","invite","himself","and","prove","a","popular",",","yet","unreliable","uncle","for","Charles",".","make","up","with","father","be","impossible","due","to","Alzheimer",".","as","Scott","keep","surprise","he","family",",","he","sad","secret","emerge","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Years ago ,","ago , Scott",", Scott left","Scott left common","left common lover","common lover Katherine","lover Katherine at","Katherine at the","at the altar","the altar to","altar to become","to become a","become a hedonistic","a hedonistic junkie","She married his","married his brother","his brother William","brother William ,","William , a",", a successful","a successful Louisiana","successful Louisiana workaholic","Louisiana workaholic ,","workaholic , who",", who sired","who sired a","sired a daughter","a daughter but","daughter but probably","but probably not","probably not bright","not bright nerd","bright nerd son","nerd son Charles","son Charles and","Charles and is","and is serially","is serially adulterous","serially adulterous on","adulterous on his","on his many","his many business","many business trips","Now Scott returns","Scott returns on","returns on horseback","on horseback ,","horseback , having",", having lost","having lost his","lost his drivers","his drivers permit","drivers permit ,","permit , inviting",", inviting himself","inviting himself and","himself and proving","and proving a","proving a popular","a popular ,","popular , yet",", yet unreliable","yet unreliable uncle","unreliable uncle for","uncle for Charles","Making up with","up with father","with father is","father is impossible","is impossible due","impossible due to","due to Alzheimer","As Scott keeps","Scott keeps surprising","keeps surprising his","surprising his family","his family ,","family , his",", his sad","his sad secret","sad secret emerges"],"2grams":["Years ago","ago ,",", Scott","Scott left","left common","common lover","lover Katherine","Katherine at","at the","the altar","altar to","to become","become a","a hedonistic","hedonistic junkie","She married","married his","his brother","brother William","William ,",", a","a successful","successful Louisiana","Louisiana workaholic","workaholic ,",", who","who sired","sired a","a daughter","daughter but","but probably","probably not","not bright","bright nerd","nerd son","son Charles","Charles and","and is","is serially","serially adulterous","adulterous on","on his","his many","many business","business trips","Now Scott","Scott returns","returns on","on horseback","horseback ,",", having","having lost","lost his","his drivers","drivers permit","permit ,",", inviting","inviting himself","himself and","and proving","proving a","a popular","popular ,",", yet","yet unreliable","unreliable uncle","uncle for","for Charles","Making up","up with","with father","father is","is impossible","impossible due","due to","to Alzheimer","As Scott","Scott keeps","keeps surprising","surprising his","his family","family ,",", his","his sad","sad secret","secret emerges"]}

{"title":"Amy's Orgasm","plot":"Amy is Jewish, nearing 30, single, and the successful author of \"Why Love Doesn't Work,\" a self-help book for women who aren't in love. She's also a self-described sexorexic - she hasn't had sex with a man in four years and has never had a \"mental orgasm.\" She gets plenty of advice - from her publicist, from her best friends (a married couple), from her parents, and from a priest to whom she goes to confession - so there's lots of conflicting emotion and analysis when she starts dating Matthew Starr, a good-looking playboy who's a popular L.A. male-chauvinist-pig radio shock jock. Each of Amy's theories and rules is put to the test - people may not change, but can love work?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Ami","is","Jewish",",","near","30",",","singl",",","and","the","success","author","of","\"","Whi","Love","Doe","n't","Work",",","\"","a","self-help","book","for","women","who","are","n't","in","love",".","She","'s","also","a","self-describ","sexorex","-","she","has","n't","had","sex","with","a","man","in","four","year","and","has","never","had","a","\"","mental","orgasm",".","\"","She","get","plenti","of","advic","-","from","her","publicist",",","from","her","best","friend","(","a","marri","coupl",")",",","from","her","parent",",","and","from","a","priest","to","whom","she","goe","to","confess","-","so","there","'s","lot","of","conflict","emot","and","analysi","when","she","start","date","Matthew","Starr",",","a","good-look","playboy","who","'s","a","popular","L.A.","male-chauvinist-pig","radio","shock","jock",".","Each","of","Ami","'s","theori","and","rule","is","put","to","the","test","-","peopl","may","not","chang",",","but","can","love","work","?"],"lemmas":["Amy","be","Jewish",",","near","30",",","single",",","and","the","successful","author","of","``","why","Love","Does","not","Work",",","''","a","self-help","book","for","woman","who","be","not","in","love",".","she","be","also","a","self-described","sexorexic","-","she","have","not","have","sex","with","a","man","in","four","year","and","have","never","have","a","``","mental","orgasm",".","''","she","get","plenty","of","advice","-","from","she","publicist",",","from","she","best","friend","-lrb-","a","married","couple","-rrb-",",","from","she","parent",",","and","from","a","priest","to","whom","she","go","to","confession","-","so","there","'s","lot","of","conflict","emotion","and","analysis","when","she","start","date","Matthew","Starr",",","a","good-looking","playboy","who","be","a","popular","L.A.","male-chauvinist-pig","radio","shock","jock",".","each","of","Amy","'s","theory","and","rule","be","put","to","the","test","-","people","may","not","change",",","but","can","love","work","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Amy is Jewish","is Jewish ,","Jewish , nearing",", nearing 30","nearing 30 ,","30 , single",", single ,","single , and",", and the","and the successful","the successful author","successful author of","author of \"","of \" Why","\" Why Love","Why Love Does","Love Does n't","Does n't Work","n't Work ,","Work , \"",", \" a","\" a self-help","a self-help book","self-help book for","book for women","for women who","women who are","who are n't","are n't in","n't in love","She 's also","'s also a","also a self-described","a self-described sexorexic","self-described sexorexic -","sexorexic -

{"title":"Isla Bonita","plot":"Summer in Menorca. The young Olivia has lost all understanding for the world. She just ended an affair in order to begin a real relationship, but no sooner had it started than this also ends. She is comforted and receives prosaic advice from her sculptor mother Nuria. When pensioned advertisement filmmaker Fernando moves into their guest house, a fresh wind blows over the island. While Olivia sees him as a father figure, Fernando tries to seduce Nuria. ISLA BONITA is a charming, wonderfully cheerful comedy full of misunderstandings - and a bijou homage to the idyllic holiday island of Menorca. Director and main actor Fernando Colomo delights us with this semi-autobiographic fiction film.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Summer","in","Menorca",".","The","young","Olivia","has","lost","all","understand","for","the","world",".","She","just","end","an","affair","in","order","to","begin","a","real","relationship",",","but","no","sooner","had","it","start","than","this","also","end",".","She","is","comfort","and","receiv","prosaic","advic","from","her","sculptor","mother","Nuria",".","When","pension","advertis","filmmak","Fernando","move","into","their","guest","hous",",","a","fresh","wind","blow","over","the","island",".","While","Olivia","see","him","as","a","father","figur",",","Fernando","tri","to","seduc","Nuria",".","ISLA","BONITA","is","a","charm",",","wonder","cheer","comedi","full","of","misunderstand","-","and","a","bijou","homag","to","the","idyl","holiday","island","of","Menorca",".","Director","and","main","actor","Fernando","Colomo","delight","us","with","this","semi-autobiograph","fiction","film","."],"lemmas":["Summer","in","Menorca",".","the","young","Olivia","have","lose","all","understanding","for","the","world",".","she","just","end","a","affair","in","order","to","begin","a","real","relationship",",","but","no","sooner","have","it","start","than","this","also","end",".","she","be","comfort","and","receive","prosaic","advice","from","she","sculptor","mother","Nuria",".","when","pension","advertisement","filmmaker","Fernando","move","into","they","guest","house",",","a","fresh","wind","blow","over","the","island",".","while","Olivia","see","he","as","a","father","figure",",","Fernando","try","to","seduce","Nuria",".","ISLA","BONITA","be","a","charming",",","wonderfully","cheerful","comedy","full","of","misunderstanding","-","and","a","bijou","homage","to","the","idyllic","holiday","island","of","Menorca",".","director","and","main","actor","Fernando","Colomo","delight","we","with","this","semi-autobiographic","fiction","film","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Summer in Menorca","The young Olivia","young Olivia has","Olivia has lost","has lost all","lost all understanding","all understanding for","understanding for the","for the world","She just ended","just ended an","ended an affair","an affair in","affair in order","in order to","order to begin","to begin a","begin a real","a real relationship","real relationship ,","relationship , but",", but no","but no sooner","no sooner had","sooner had it","had it started","it started than","started than this","than this also","this also ends","She is comforted","is comforted and","comforted and receives","and receives prosaic","receives prosaic advice","prosaic advice from","advice from her","from her sculptor","her sculptor mother","sculptor mother Nuria","When pensioned advertisement","pensioned advertisement filmmaker","advertisement filmmaker Fernando","filmmaker Fernando moves","Fernando moves into","moves into their","into their guest","their guest house","guest house ,","house , a",", a fresh","a fresh wind","fresh wind blows","wind blows over","blows over the","over the island","While Olivia sees","Olivia sees him","sees him as","him as a","as a father","a father figure","father figure ,","figure , Fernando",", Fernando tries","Fernando tries to","tries to seduce","to seduce Nuria","ISLA BONITA is","BONITA is a","is a charming","a charming ,","charming , wonderfully",", wonderfully cheerful","wonderfully cheerful comedy","cheerful comedy full","comedy full of","full of misunderstandings","of misunderstandings -","misunderstandings -

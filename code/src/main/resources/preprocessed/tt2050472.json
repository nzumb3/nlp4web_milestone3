{"title":"Carrière, 250 metros","plot":"A portrait documentary tracing the inspiration, philosophy and imagination of the celebrated theatre and screen writer - and Bunuel's long term collaborator - Jean Claude Carrière. Carrière predicts that between the house he was born in and the cemetery in which he will end there is a life journey of just 250 meters. \"Carrière: 250 Meters\" follows him as he reflects on the wealth of global traditions of storytelling, travelling through past and present, across countries and cultures from Paris to New York, Mexico and India and joined by his family, friends and collaborators. A testament to the life and work of an extraordinary man and a key architect in contemporary cinema.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","portrait","documentari","trace","the","inspir",",","philosophi","and","imagin","of","the","celebr","theatr","and","screen","writer","-","and","Bunuel","'s","long","term","collabor","-","Jean","Claud","Carrièr",".","Carrièr","predict","that","between","the","hous","he","was","born","in","and","the","cemeteri","in","which","he","will","end","there","is","a","life","journey","of","just","250","meter",".","\"","Carrièr",":","250","Meter","\"","follow","him","as","he","reflect","on","the","wealth","of","global","tradit","of","storytel",",","travel","through","past","and","present",",","across","countri","and","cultur","from","Pari","to","New","York",",","Mexico","and","India","and","join","by","his","famili",",","friend","and","collabor",".","A","testament","to","the","life","and","work","of","an","extraordinari","man","and","a","key","architect","in","contemporari","cinema","."],"lemmas":["a","portrait","documentary","trace","the","inspiration",",","philosophy","and","imagination","of","the","celebrated","theatre","and","screen","writer","-","and","Bunuel","'s","long","term","collaborator","-","Jean","Claude","Carrière",".","Carrière","predict","that","between","the","house","he","be","bear","in","and","the","cemetery","in","which","he","will","end","there","be","a","life","journey","of","just","250","meter",".","``","Carrière",":","250","meter","''","follow","he","as","he","reflect","on","the","wealth","of","global","tradition","of","storytelling",",","travel","through","past","and","present",",","across","country","and","culture","from","Paris","to","New","York",",","Mexico","and","India","and","join","by","he","family",",","friend","and","collaborator",".","a","testament","to","the","life","and","work","of","a","extraordinary","man","and","a","key","architect","in","contemporary","cinema","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A portrait documentary","portrait documentary tracing","documentary tracing the","tracing the inspiration","the inspiration ,","inspiration , philosophy",", philosophy and","philosophy and imagination","and imagination of","imagination of the","of the celebrated","the celebrated theatre","celebrated theatre and","theatre and screen","and screen writer","screen writer -","writer -

{"title":"Audrey of the Alps","plot":"Twenty-something Audrey isn't entirely sure what she wants to do with her life. Other young women in her position would most likely backpack or volunteer, but Audrey decides to sign on as a shepherd for the season. In the high pastures of the French Alps, Audrey and her boyfriend take on the daunting task of marshalling 1700 recalcitrant sheep, a handful of goats and six dogs. Often at odds with her pragmatic employers, Audrey struggles to learn shepherding ways, until she finally discovers her inner strength.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Twenty-someth","Audrey","is","n't","entir","sure","what","she","want","to","do","with","her","life",".","Other","young","women","in","her","posit","would","most","like","backpack","or","volunt",",","but","Audrey","decid","to","sign","on","as","a","shepherd","for","the","season",".","In","the","high","pastur","of","the","French","Alps",",","Audrey","and","her","boyfriend","take","on","the","daunt","task","of","marshal","1700","recalcitr","sheep",",","a","hand","of","goat","and","six","dog",".","Often","at","odd","with","her","pragmat","employ",",","Audrey","struggl","to","learn","shepherd","way",",","until","she","final","discov","her","inner","strength","."],"lemmas":["twenty-something","Audrey","be","not","entirely","sure","what","she","want","to","do","with","she","life",".","other","young","woman","in","she","position","would","most","likely","backpack","or","volunteer",",","but","Audrey","decide","to","sign","on","as","a","shepherd","for","the","season",".","in","the","high","pasture","of","the","French","Alps",",","Audrey","and","she","boyfriend","take","on","the","daunting","task","of","marshal","1700","recalcitrant","sheep",",","a","handful","of","goat","and","six","dog",".","often","at","odds","with","she","pragmatic","employer",",","Audrey","struggle","to","learn","shepherd","way",",","until","she","finally","discover","she","inner","strength","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Twenty-something Audrey is","Audrey is n't","is n't entirely","n't entirely sure","entirely sure what","sure what she","what she wants","she wants to","wants to do","to do with","do with her","with her life","Other young women","young women in","women in her","in her position","her position would","position would most","would most likely","most likely backpack","likely backpack or","backpack or volunteer","or volunteer ,","volunteer , but",", but Audrey","but Audrey decides","Audrey decides to","decides to sign","to sign on","sign on as","on as a","as a shepherd","a shepherd for","shepherd for the","for the season","In the high","the high pastures","high pastures of","pastures of the","of the French","the French Alps","French Alps ,","Alps , Audrey",", Audrey and","Audrey and her","and her boyfriend","her boyfriend take","boyfriend take on","take on the","on the daunting","the daunting task","daunting task of","task of marshalling","of marshalling 1700","marshalling 1700 recalcitrant","1700 recalcitrant sheep","recalcitrant sheep ,","sheep , a",", a handful","a handful of","handful of goats","of goats and","goats and six","and six dogs","Often at odds","at odds with","odds with her","with her pragmatic","her pragmatic employers","pragmatic employers ,","employers , Audrey",", Audrey struggles","Audrey struggles to","struggles to learn","to learn shepherding","learn shepherding ways","shepherding ways ,","ways , until",", until she","until she finally","she finally discovers","finally discovers her","discovers her inner","her inner strength"],"2grams":["Twenty-something Audrey","Audrey is","is n't","n't entirely","entirely sure","sure what","what she","she wants","wants to","to do","do with","with her","her life","Other young","young women","women in","in her","her position","position would","would most","most likely","likely backpack","backpack or","or volunteer","volunteer ,",", but","but Audrey","Audrey decides","decides to","to sign","sign on","on as","as a","a shepherd","shepherd for","for the","the season","In the","the high","high pastures","pastures of","of the","the French","French Alps","Alps ,",", Audrey","Audrey and","and her","her boyfriend","boyfriend take","take on","on the","the daunting","daunting task","task of","of marshalling","marshalling 1700","1700 recalcitrant","recalcitrant sheep","sheep ,",", a","a handful","handful of","of goats","goats and","and six","six dogs","Often at","at odds","odds with","with her","her pragmatic","pragmatic employers","employers ,",", Audrey","Audrey struggles","struggles to","to learn","learn shepherding","shepherding ways","ways ,",", until","until she","she finally","finally discovers","discovers her","her inner","inner strength"]}

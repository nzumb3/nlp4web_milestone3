{"title":"Eve of Destruction","plot":"Eve is a robot, modelled on \"her\" creator. Eve's armoury includes a nuclear bomb, which for unexplained reasons is on-board during Eve's testing. When things go wrong during the tests, Eve is lost in the big city. Enter the rescue team, which includes the real (human) Eve. They must find and disarm her before she goes \"bang\". Eve is programmed to protect herself at all costs, so when she runs into a problem, she resorts to her super strength; hence the destruction.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Eve","is","a","robot",",","model","on","\"","her","\"","creator",".","Eve","'s","armouri","includ","a","nuclear","bomb",",","which","for","unexplain","reason","is","on-board","dure","Eve","'s","test",".","When","thing","go","wrong","dure","the","test",",","Eve","is","lost","in","the","big","citi",".","Enter","the","rescu","team",",","which","includ","the","real","(","human",")","Eve",".","They","must","find","and","disarm","her","befor","she","goe","\"","bang","\"",".","Eve","is","program","to","protect","herself","at","all","cost",",","so","when","she","run","into","a","problem",",","she","resort","to","her","super","strength",";","henc","the","destruct","."],"lemmas":["Eve","be","a","robot",",","model","on","``","she","''","creator",".","Eve","'s","armoury","include","a","nuclear","bomb",",","which","for","unexplained","reason","be","on-board","during","Eve","'s","testing",".","when","thing","go","wrong","during","the","test",",","Eve","be","lose","in","the","big","city",".","enter","the","rescue","team",",","which","include","the","real","-lrb-","human","-rrb-","Eve",".","they","must","find","and","disarm","she","before","she","go","``","bang","''",".","Eve","be","program","to","protect","herself","at","all","cost",",","so","when","she","run","into","a","problem",",","she","resort","to","she","super","strength",";","hence","the","destruction","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Eve is a","is a robot","a robot ,","robot , modelled",", modelled on","modelled on \"","on \" her","\" her \"","her \" creator","Eve 's armoury","'s armoury includes","armoury includes a","includes a nuclear","a nuclear bomb","nuclear bomb ,","bomb , which",", which for","which for unexplained","for unexplained reasons","unexplained reasons is","reasons is on-board","is on-board during","on-board during Eve","during Eve 's","Eve 's testing","When things go","things go wrong","go wrong during","wrong during the","during the tests","the tests ,","tests , Eve",", Eve is","Eve is lost","is lost in","lost in the","in the big","the big city","Enter the rescue","the rescue team","rescue team ,","team , which",", which includes","which includes the","includes the real","the real (","real ( human","( human )","human ) Eve","They must find","must find and","find and disarm","and disarm her","disarm her before","her before she","before she goes","she goes \"","goes \" bang","\" bang \"","Eve is programmed","is programmed to","programmed to protect","to protect herself","protect herself at","herself at all","at all costs","all costs ,","costs , so",", so when","so when she","when she runs","she runs into","runs into a","into a problem","a problem ,","problem , she",", she resorts","she resorts to","resorts to her","to her super","her super strength","super strength ;","strength ; hence","; hence the","hence the destruction"],"2grams":["Eve is","is a","a robot","robot ,",", modelled","modelled on","on \"","\" her","her \"","\" creator","Eve 's","'s armoury","armoury includes","includes a","a nuclear","nuclear bomb","bomb ,",", which","which for","for unexplained","unexplained reasons","reasons is","is on-board","on-board during","during Eve","Eve 's","'s testing","When things","things go","go wrong","wrong during","during the","the tests","tests ,",", Eve","Eve is","is lost","lost in","in the","the big","big city","Enter the","the rescue","rescue team","team ,",", which","which includes","includes the","the real","real (","( human","human )",") Eve","They must","must find","find and","and disarm","disarm her","her before","before she","she goes","goes \"","\" bang","bang \"","Eve is","is programmed","programmed to","to protect","protect herself","herself at","at all","all costs","costs ,",", so","so when","when she","she runs","runs into","into a","a problem","problem ,",", she","she resorts","resorts to","to her","her super","super strength","strength ;","; hence","hence the","the destruction"]}

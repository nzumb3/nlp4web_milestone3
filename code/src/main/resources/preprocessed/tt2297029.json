{"title":"Tibi und seine MÃ¼tter","plot":"Tibi Lhundub Tsering was seven years old and had been living as a Tibetan refugee child in a children's home in Dharamsala when he moved to his foster mother in Switzerland in 1963. His mother, who remained behind in India, knew nothing of this. More than four decades later Tibi travelled with his Swiss family to his aged mother in the refugee settlement in Bylakuppe. This was the first time his Swiss children would meet their Tibetan grandmother in her foreign world. The film accompanies Tibi on this journey to India to visit his mother, and also meets his foster mother in Zurich Oberland. From the memories, the painful experiences emerge to the present.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Tibi","Lhundub","Tsere","was","seven","year","old","and","had","been","live","as","a","Tibetan","refuge","child","in","a","children","'s","home","in","Dharamsala","when","he","move","to","his","foster","mother","in","Switzerland","in","1963",".","His","mother",",","who","remain","behind","in","India",",","knew","noth","of","this",".","More","than","four","decad","later","Tibi","travel","with","his","Swiss","famili","to","his","age","mother","in","the","refuge","settlement","in","Bylakupp",".","This","was","the","first","time","his","Swiss","children","would","meet","their","Tibetan","grandmoth","in","her","foreign","world",".","The","film","accompani","Tibi","on","this","journey","to","India","to","visit","his","mother",",","and","also","meet","his","foster","mother","in","Zurich","Oberland",".","From","the","memori",",","the","pain","experi","emerg","to","the","present","."],"lemmas":["Tibi","Lhundub","Tsering","be","seven","year","old","and","have","be","live","as","a","tibetan","refugee","child","in","a","children","'s","home","in","Dharamsala","when","he","move","to","he","foster","mother","in","Switzerland","in","1963",".","he","mother",",","who","remain","behind","in","India",",","know","nothing","of","this",".","more","than","four","decade","later","Tibi","travel","with","he","swiss","family","to","he","aged","mother","in","the","refugee","settlement","in","Bylakuppe",".","this","be","the","first","time","he","swiss","child","would","meet","they","tibetan","grandmother","in","she","foreign","world",".","the","film","accompany","Tibi","on","this","journey","to","India","to","visit","he","mother",",","and","also","meet","he","foster","mother","in","Zurich","Oberland",".","from","the","memory",",","the","painful","experience","emerge","to","the","present","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Tibi

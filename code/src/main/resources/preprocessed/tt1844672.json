{"title":"Gorelovka: Episodes from the Life of a Disappearing Community","plot":"The village of Gorelovka is located in Southern Georgia. Doukhobors (Spirit-wrestlers), a group of Russian religious dissidents, founded it in the mid 19th century. Because of their anarchist and pacifist beliefs, the Doukhobors were banished from Russia by Tsar Nicholas I. They managed to keep their identity and traditions throughout the Soviet period. However, under political and economical pressure, many Doukhobors have now left Georgia and their heritage is disappearing with the last inhabitants.","genres":["History"],"stems":["The","villag","of","Gorelovka","is","locat","in","Southern","Georgia",".","Doukhobor","(","Spirit-wrestl",")",",","a","group","of","Russian","religi","dissid",",","found","it","in","the","mid","19th","centuri",".","Becaus","of","their","anarchist","and","pacifist","belief",",","the","Doukhobor","were","banish","from","Russia","by","Tsar","Nichola","I",".","They","manag","to","keep","their","ident","and","tradit","throughout","the","Soviet","period",".","Howev",",","under","polit","and","econom","pressur",",","mani","Doukhobor","have","now","left","Georgia","and","their","heritag","is","disappear","with","the","last","inhabit","."],"lemmas":["the","village","of","Gorelovka","be","located","in","Southern","Georgia",".","doukhobor","-lrb-","spirit-wrestler","-rrb-",",","a","group","of","russian","religious","dissident",",","found","it","in","the","mid","19th","century",".","because","of","they","anarchist","and","pacifist","belief",",","the","Doukhobors","be","banish","from","Russia","by","Tsar","Nicholas","I",".","they","manage","to","keep","they","identity","and","tradition","throughout","the","soviet","period",".","however",",","under","political","and","economical","pressure",",","many","doukhobor","have","now","leave","Georgia","and","they","heritage","be","disappear","with","the","last","inhabitant","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The village of","village of Gorelovka","of Gorelovka is","Gorelovka is located","is located in","located in Southern","in Southern Georgia","Doukhobors ( Spirit-wrestlers","( Spirit-wrestlers )","Spirit-wrestlers ) ,",") , a",", a group","a group of","group of Russian","of Russian religious","Russian religious dissidents","religious dissidents ,","dissidents , founded",", founded it","founded it in","it in the","in the mid","the mid 19th","mid 19th century","Because of their","of their anarchist","their anarchist and","anarchist and pacifist","and pacifist beliefs","pacifist beliefs ,","beliefs , the",", the Doukhobors","the Doukhobors were","Doukhobors were banished","were banished from","banished from Russia","from Russia by","Russia by Tsar","by Tsar Nicholas","Tsar Nicholas I","They managed to","managed to keep","to keep their","keep their identity","their identity and","identity and traditions","and traditions throughout","traditions throughout the","throughout the Soviet","the Soviet period","However , under",", under political","under political and","political and economical","and economical pressure","economical pressure ,","pressure , many",", many Doukhobors","many Doukhobors have","Doukhobors have now","have now left","now left Georgia","left Georgia and","Georgia and their","and their heritage","their heritage is","heritage is disappearing","is disappearing with","disappearing with the","with the last","the last inhabitants"],"2grams":["The village","village of","of Gorelovka","Gorelovka is","is located","located in","in Southern","Southern Georgia","Doukhobors (","( Spirit-wrestlers","Spirit-wrestlers )",") ,",", a","a group","group of","of Russian","Russian religious","religious dissidents","dissidents ,",", founded","founded it","it in","in the","the mid","mid 19th","19th century","Because of","of their","their anarchist","anarchist and","and pacifist","pacifist beliefs","beliefs ,",", the","the Doukhobors","Doukhobors were","were banished","banished from","from Russia","Russia by","by Tsar","Tsar Nicholas","Nicholas I","They managed","managed to","to keep","keep their","their identity","identity and","and traditions","traditions throughout","throughout the","the Soviet","Soviet period","However ,",", under","under political","political and","and economical","economical pressure","pressure ,",", many","many Doukhobors","Doukhobors have","have now","now left","left Georgia","Georgia and","and their","their heritage","heritage is","is disappearing","disappearing with","with the","the last","last inhabitants"]}

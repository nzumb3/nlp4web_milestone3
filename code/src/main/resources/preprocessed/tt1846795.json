{"title":"Through Our Own Eyes","plot":"It's not very often that you hear news from Africa that is made by Africans themselves. Journalists work under difficult circumstances; there is a lack of facilities and journalists are not always free to do their job. Through our own eyes is about three African journalists, each contributing to journalism in their own way. Investigative journalist Selay Kouassi works in Ivory Coast, a land that was torn apart by civil war at the beginning of the millennium. The government observes journalists very closely. Selay researches dubious practices around soccer schools in his country. Goitsemang Nkomo from South Africa is a young, modern radio journalist working in a society divided between rich and poor. Women in the poor districts fight against AIDS and poverty. Photographer Andrew Esiebo from Nigeria wants to show the 'backside' of soccer. With his creative and natural personality, he questions the stereotype of the difficult life of an African journalist. During the 2010 World Cup all eyes were fixed on South Africa, giving these three journalists the chance to tell their story, their own way.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","'s","not","veri","often","that","you","hear","news","from","Africa","that","is","made","by","African","themselv",".","Journalist","work","under","difficult","circumst",";","there","is","a","lack","of","facil","and","journalist","are","not","alway","free","to","do","their","job",".","Through","our","own","eye","is","about","three","African","journalist",",","each","contribut","to","journal","in","their","own","way",".","Investig","journalist","Selay","Kouassi","work","in","Ivori","Coast",",","a","land","that","was","torn","apart","by","civil","war","at","the","begin","of","the","millennium",".","The","govern","observ","journalist","veri","close",".","Selay","research","dubious","practic","around","soccer","school","in","his","countri",".","Goitsemang","Nkomo","from","South","Africa","is","a","young",",","modern","radio","journalist","work","in","a","societi","divid","between","rich","and","poor",".","Women","in","the","poor","district","fight","against","AIDS","and","poverti",".","Photograph","Andrew","Esiebo","from","Nigeria","want","to","show","the","'","backsid","'","of","soccer",".","With","his","creativ","and","natur","person",",","he","question","the","stereotyp","of","the","difficult","life","of","an","African","journalist",".","Dure","the","2010","World","Cup","all","eye","were","fix","on","South","Africa",",","give","these","three","journalist","the","chanc","to","tell","their","stori",",","their","own","way","."],"lemmas":["it","be","not","very","often","that","you","hear","news","from","Africa","that","be","make","by","Africans","themselves",".","journalist","work","under","difficult","circumstance",";","there","be","a","lack","of","facility","and","journalist","be","not","always","free","to","do","they","job",".","through","we","own","eye","be","about","three","African","journalist",",","each","contribute","to","journalism","in","they","own","way",".","investigative","journalist","Selay","Kouassi","work","in","Ivory","Coast",",","a","land","that","be","tear","apart","by","civil","war","at","the","beginning","of","the","millennium",".","the","government","observe","journalist","very","closely",".","Selay","research","dubious","practice","around","soccer","school","in","he","country",".","Goitsemang","Nkomo","from","South","Africa","be","a","young",",","modern","radio","journalist","work","in","a","society","divide","between","rich","and","poor",".","woman","in","the","poor","district","fight","against","aids","and","poverty",".","Photographer","Andrew","Esiebo","from","Nigeria","want","to","show","the","'","backside","'","of","soccer",".","with","he","creative","and","natural","personality",",","he","question","the","stereotype","of","the","difficult","life","of","a","african","journalist",".","during","the","2010","World","Cup","all","eye","be","fix","on","South","Africa",",","give","these","three","journalist","the","chance","to","tell","they","story",",","they","own","way","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It 's not","'s not very","not very often","very often that","often that you","that you hear","you hear news","hear news from","news from Africa","from Africa that","Africa that is","that is made","is made by","made by Africans","by Africans themselves","Journalists work under","work under difficult","under difficult circumstances","difficult circumstances ;","circumstances ;

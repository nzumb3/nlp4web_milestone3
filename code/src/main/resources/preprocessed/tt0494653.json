In reality, Alex works at a jewelry store to pay the bills, is married to a diabetic cat, and averages 89.3 rejections a year as an unpublished writer. Something needs to change. Following September 11th, Alex rebuilds her image of herself, telling her story via the three things that affect her most: her written work, her friendships, and her overactive imagination.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","her","head",",","Alex","is","the","bad-ass","survivor","in","a","post-apocalypt","wasteland",".","In","her","head",",","she","is","a","period-costum","drop","dead","gorgeous","music","prodigi",".","In","realiti",",","Alex","work","at","a","jewelri","store","to","pay","the","bill",",","is","marri","to","a","diabet","cat",",","and","averag","89.3","reject","a","year","as","an","unpublish","writer",".","Someth","need","to","chang",".","Follow","Septemb","11th",",","Alex","rebuild","her","imag","of","herself",",","tell","her","stori","via","the","three","thing","that","affect","her","most",":","her","written","work",",","her","friendship",",","and","her","overact","imagin","."],"lemmas":["in","she","head",",","Alex","be","the","bad-ass","survivor","in","a","post-apocalyptic","wasteland",".","in","she","head",",","she","be","a","period-costumed","drop","dead","gorgeous","musical","prodigy",".","in","reality",",","Alex","work","at","a","jewelry","store","to","pay","the","bill",",","be","marry","to","a","diabetic","cat",",","and","average","89.3","rejection","a","year","as","a","unpublished","writer",".","something","need","to","change",".","follow","September","11th",",","Alex","rebuild","she","image","of","herself",",","tell","she","story","via","the","three","thing","that","affect","she","most",":","she","written","work",",","she","friendship",",","and","she","overactive","imagination","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In her head","her head ,","head , Alex",", Alex is","Alex is the","is the bad-ass","the bad-ass survivor","bad-ass survivor in","survivor in a","in a post-apocalyptic","a post-apocalyptic wasteland","In her head","her head ,","head , she",", she is","she is a","is a period-costumed","a period-costumed drop","period-costumed drop dead","drop dead gorgeous","dead gorgeous musical","gorgeous musical prodigy","In reality ,","reality , Alex",", Alex works","Alex works at","works at a","at a jewelry","a jewelry store","jewelry store to","store to pay","to pay the","pay the bills","the bills ,","bills , is",", is married","is married to","married to a","to a diabetic","a diabetic cat","diabetic cat ,","cat , and",", and averages","and averages 89.3","averages 89.3 rejections","89.3 rejections a","rejections a year","a year as","year as an","as an unpublished","an unpublished writer","Something needs to","needs to change","Following September 11th","September 11th ,","11th , Alex",", Alex rebuilds","Alex rebuilds her","rebuilds her image","her image of","image of herself","of herself ,","herself , telling",", telling her","telling her story","her story via","story via the","via the three","the three things","three things that","things that affect","that affect her","affect her most","her most :","most : her",": her written","her written work","written work ,","work , her",", her friendships","her friendships ,","friendships , and",", and her","and her overactive","her overactive imagination"],"2grams":["In her","her head","head ,",", Alex","Alex is","is the","the bad-ass","bad-ass survivor","survivor in","in a","a post-apocalyptic","post-apocalyptic wasteland","In her","her head","head ,",", she","she is","is a","a period-costumed","period-costumed drop","drop dead","dead gorgeous","gorgeous musical","musical prodigy","In reality","reality ,",", Alex","Alex works","works at","at a","a jewelry","jewelry store","store to","to pay","pay the","the bills","bills ,",", is","is married","married to","to a","a diabetic","diabetic cat","cat ,",", and","and averages","averages 89.3","89.3 rejections","rejections a","a year","year as","as an","an unpublished","unpublished writer","Something needs","needs to","to change","Following September","September 11th","11th ,",", Alex","Alex rebuilds","rebuilds her","her image","image of","of herself","herself ,",", telling","telling her","her story","story via","via the","the three","three things","things that","that affect","affect her","her most","most :",": her","her written","written work","work ,",", her","her friendships","friendships ,",", and","and her","her overactive","overactive imagination"]}

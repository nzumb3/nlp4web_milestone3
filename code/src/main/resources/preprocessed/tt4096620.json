{"title":"Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art","plot":"Set in the desolate desert spaces of the American southwest, the film unearths the history of land art during the tumultuous late 1960s and early 1970s. Troublemakers is ultimately a story of renegades and firebrands all willing to risk their future careers on radical change and experimentation-a marked contrast to the hyper-speculative contemporary art world of today. Featuring rare interviews with a veritable who's who of American Art of the twentieth century.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Set","in","the","desol","desert","space","of","the","American","southwest",",","the","film","unearth","the","histori","of","land","art","dure","the","tumultu","late","1960s","and","earli","1970s",".","Troublemak","is","ultim","a","stori","of","renegad","and","firebrand","all","will","to","risk","their","futur","career","on","radic","chang","and","experimentation-a","mark","contrast","to","the","hyper-specul","contemporari","art","world","of","today",".","Featur","rare","interview","with","a","verit","who","'s","who","of","American","Art","of","the","twentieth","centuri","."],"lemmas":["set","in","the","desolate","desert","space","of","the","american","southwest",",","the","film","unearth","the","history","of","land","art","during","the","tumultuous","late","1960","and","early","1970",".","troublemaker","be","ultimately","a","story","of","renegade","and","firebrand","all","willing","to","risk","they","future","career","on","radical","change","and","experimentation-a","marked","contrast","to","the","hyper-speculative","contemporary","art","world","of","today",".","feature","rare","interview","with","a","veritable","who","be","who","of","american","art","of","the","twentieth","century","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Set in the","in the desolate","the desolate desert","desolate desert spaces","desert spaces of","spaces of the","of the American","the American southwest","American southwest ,","southwest , the",", the film","the film unearths","film unearths the","unearths the history","the history of","history of land","of land art","land art during","art during the","during the tumultuous","the tumultuous late","tumultuous late 1960s","late 1960s and","1960s and early","and early 1970s","Troublemakers is ultimately","is ultimately a","ultimately a story","a story of","story of renegades","of renegades and","renegades and firebrands","and firebrands all","firebrands all willing","all willing to","willing to risk","to risk their","risk their future","their future careers","future careers on","careers on radical","on radical change","radical change and","change and experimentation-a","and experimentation-a marked","experimentation-a marked contrast","marked contrast to","contrast to the","to the hyper-speculative","the hyper-speculative contemporary","hyper-speculative contemporary art","contemporary art world","art world of","world of today","Featuring rare interviews","rare interviews with","interviews with a","with a veritable","a veritable who","veritable who 's","who 's who","'s who of","who of American","of American Art","American Art of","Art of the","of the twentieth","the twentieth century"],"2grams":["Set in","in the","the desolate","desolate desert","desert spaces","spaces of","of the","the American","American southwest","southwest ,",", the","the film","film unearths","unearths the","the history","history of","of land","land art","art during","during the","the tumultuous","tumultuous late","late 1960s","1960s and","and early","early 1970s","Troublemakers is","is ultimately","ultimately a","a story","story of","of renegades","renegades and","and firebrands","firebrands all","all willing","willing to","to risk","risk their","their future","future careers","careers on","on radical","radical change","change and","and experimentation-a","experimentation-a marked","marked contrast","contrast to","to the","the hyper-speculative","hyper-speculative contemporary","contemporary art","art world","world of","of today","Featuring rare","rare interviews","interviews with","with a","a veritable","veritable who","who 's","'s who","who of","of American","American Art","Art of","of the","the twentieth","twentieth century"]}

{"title":"Abdus Salam. The Dream of Symmetry","plot":"From a remote village in Pakistan to the prestigious colleges of Cambridge, from the vibrant atmosphere of London to Trieste. The film tells the gripping story of the life of Abdus Salam, great scientist of the twentieth century and Nobel Prize for Physics in 1979, creator of the International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP) in Trieste. Through the direct testimonies of the great protagonists of the international science, such as the Nobel Prize for Physics David Gross, Gerard 't Hooft, Steven Weinberg, the film retraces the most significant moments of one of the most creative and exciting periods in the history of physics: the dream of a unified theory of elementary particles and fundamental forces of Nature.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["From","a","remot","villag","in","Pakistan","to","the","prestigi","colleg","of","Cambridg",",","from","the","vibrant","atmospher","of","London","to","Triest",".","The","film","tell","the","grip","stori","of","the","life","of","Abdus","Salam",",","great","scientist","of","the","twentieth","centuri","and","Nobel","Prize","for","Physic","in","1979",",","creator","of","the","Internat","Centr","for","Theoret","Physic","(","ICTP",")","in","Triest",".","Through","the","direct","testimoni","of","the","great","protagonist","of","the","intern","scienc",",","such","as","the","Nobel","Prize","for","Physic","David","Gross",",","Gerard","'","t","Hooft",",","Steven","Weinberg",",","the","film","retrac","the","most","signific","moment","of","one","of","the","most","creativ","and","excit","period","in","the","histori","of","physic",":","the","dream","of","a","unifi","theori","of","elementari","particl","and","fundament","forc","of","Natur","."],"lemmas":["from","a","remote","village","in","Pakistan","to","the","prestigious","college","of","Cambridge",",","from","the","vibrant","atmosphere","of","London","to","Trieste",".","the","film","tell","the","grip","story","of","the","life","of","Abdus","Salam",",","great","scientist","of","the","twentieth","century","and","Nobel","Prize","for","physics","in","1979",",","creator","of","the","International","Centre","for","theoretical","physics","-lrb-","ictp","-rrb-","in","Trieste",".","through","the","direct","testimony","of","the","great","protagonist","of","the","international","science",",","such","as","the","Nobel","Prize","for","physics","David","Gross",",","Gerard","'","t","Hooft",",","Steven","Weinberg",",","the","film","retrace","the","most","significant","moment","of","one","of","the","most","creative","and","exciting","period","in","the","history","of","physics",":","the","dream","of","a","unified","theory","of","elementary","particle","and","fundamental","force","of","Nature","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["From

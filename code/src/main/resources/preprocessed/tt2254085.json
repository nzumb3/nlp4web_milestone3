{"title":"On Your Mark, Get Set, MOW!","plot":"The world of lawn mower racing is made up of people who will travel across the country at their own expense to compete for nothing more than a plastic trophy and bragging rights as there are no cash prizes in the sport. When revenue is generated at the gate it is often donated to a worthy cause. The United States Lawn Mower Racing Association's race in Sparta, MI is a classic example of this. The Mikula family, who have lost six members to Huntington's disease host an annual race in their hometown to raise research money and awareness of this little known disease. On Your Mark, Get Set, MOW! will explore the world of lawn mower racing and how it is being used to as a race for a cure. Through on camera interviews with medical professionals, US congressmen, and Arlo Guthrie, who lost his father Woody Guthrie to the disease, an understanding of the disease will be established. The Mikula family of Michigan, who have lost six members to Huntington's disease are host to a US Lawn Mower Racing Association (USLMRA) national points race in their hometown of Sparta, MI to raise money for the little known disease. All proceeds from admissions, memorabilia auctions, and a racing lawn mower raffle are donated to the Michigan chapter of the Huntington's Disease Society of America (HDSA). Through interviews with medical professionals the film will explore Huntington's disease and how the racing community bands together to support the race for a cure.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","world","of","lawn","mower","race","is","made","up","of","peopl","who","will","travel","across","the","countri","at","their","own","expens","to","compet","for","noth","more","than","a","plastic","trophi","and","brag","right","as","there","are","no","cash","prize","in","the","sport",".","When","revenu","is","generat","at","the","gate","it","is","often","donat","to","a","worthi","caus",".","The","Unite","State","Lawn","Mower","Race","Associat","'s","race","in","Sparta",",","MI","is","a","classic","exampl","of","this",".","The","Mikula","famili",",","who","have","lost","six","member","to","Huntington","'s","diseas","host","an","annual","race","in","their","hometown","to","rais","research","money","and","awar","of","this","littl","known","diseas",".","On","Your","Mark",",","Get","Set",",","MOW","!","will","explor","the","world","of","lawn","mower","race","and","how","it","is","be","use","to","as","a","race","for","a","cure",".","Through","on","camera","interview","with","medic","profession",",","US","congressmen",",","and","Arlo","Guthri",",","who","lost","his","father","Woodi","Guthri","to","the","diseas",",","an","understand","of","the","diseas","will","be","establish",".","The","Mikula","famili","of","Michigan",",","who","have","lost","six","member","to","Huntington","'s","diseas","are","host","to","a","US","Lawn","Mower","Race","Associat","(","USLMRA",")","nation","point","race","in","their","hometown","of","Sparta",",","MI","to","rais","money","for","the","littl","known","diseas",".","All","proceed","from","admiss",",","memorabilia","auction",",","and","a","race","lawn","mower","raffl","are","donat","to","the","Michigan","chapter","of","the","Huntington","'s","Diseas","Societi","of","America","(","HDSA",")",".","Through","interview","with","medic","profession","the","film","will","explor","Huntington","'s","diseas","and","how","the","race","communiti","band","togeth","to","support","the","race","for","a","cure","."],"lemmas":["the","world","of","lawn","mower","racing","be","make","up","of","people","who","will","travel","across","the","country","at","they","own","expense","to","compete","for","nothing","more","than","a","plastic","trophy","and","bragging","rights","as","there","be","no","cash","prize","in","the","sport",".","when","revenue","be","generate","at","the","gate","it","be","often","donate","to","a","worthy","cause",".","the","United","States","lawn","mower","race","Association","'s","race","in","Sparta",",","MI","be","a","classic","example","of","this",".","the","Mikula","family",",","who","have","lose","six","member","to","Huntington","'s","disease","host","a","annual","race","in","they","hometown","to","raise","research","money","and","awareness","of","this","little","known","disease",".","on","you","Mark",",","get","set",",","mow","!","will","explore","the","world","of","lawn","mower","racing","and","how","it","be","be","use","to","as","a","race","for","a","cure",".","through","on","camera","interview","with","medical","professional",",","US","congressman",",","and","Arlo","Guthrie",",","who","lose","he","father","Woody","Guthrie","to","the","disease",",","a","understanding","of","the","disease","will","be","establish",".","the","Mikula","family","of","Michigan",",","who","have","lose","six","member","to","Huntington","'s","disease","be","host","to","a","US","lawn","mower","race","association","-lrb-","uslmra","-rrb-","national","point","race","in","they","hometown","of","Sparta",",","MI","to","raise","money","for","the","little","known","disease",".","all","proceeds","from","admission",",","memorabilia","auction",",","and","a","racing","lawn","mower","raffle","be","donate","to","the","Michigan","chapter","of","the","Huntington","'s","Disease","Society","of","America","-lrb-","HDSA","-rrb-",".","through","interview","with","medical","professional","the","film","will","explore","Huntington","'s","disease","and","how","the","racing","community","band","together","to","support","the","race","for","a","cure","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

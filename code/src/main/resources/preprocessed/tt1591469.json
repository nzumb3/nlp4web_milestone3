{"title":"Collar","plot":"Timothy James 'TJ' Williams (David Wilson) is a streetwise detective whose checkered career, family life and long standing friendship with the would-be mayor, police chief Hamilton Markham (Tom Sizemore), spins out of control and teeters on the brink of catastrophe as a result of a bust gone bad. While his life begins to crumble, his fast fading future is bartered for political gain by his former best friend and boss, a mayor with her eye on a Senate seat (Rebecca De Mornay) and an ambitious, activist 'man-of-the-cloth,' the Rev. Alonso Sparks (Richard Roundtree). The political machinery, geared to grind up Williams as a bad cop, has a wrench tossed into the works by the detective, who with the help of his partner, Angel Santangelo (Jaime Santana), gets back on the job to reclaim his reputation and his dignity in spite of their worst efforts.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Timothi","Jame","'","TJ","'","William","(","David","Wilson",")","is","a","streetwis","detect","whose","checker","career",",","famili","life","and","long","stand","friendship","with","the","would-b","mayor",",","polic","chief","Hamilton","Markham","(","Tom","Sizemor",")",",","spin","out","of","control","and","teeter","on","the","brink","of","catastroph","as","a","result","of","a","bust","gone","bad",".","While","his","life","begin","to","crumbl",",","his","fast","fade","futur","is","barter","for","polit","gain","by","his","former","best","friend","and","boss",",","a","mayor","with","her","eye","on","a","Senat","seat","(","Rebecca","De","Mornay",")","and","an","ambiti",",","activist","'","man-of-the-cloth",",","'","the","Rev.","Alonso","Spark","(","Richard","Roundtre",")",".","The","polit","machineri",",","gear","to","grind","up","William","as","a","bad","cop",",","has","a","wrench","toss","into","the","work","by","the","detect",",","who","with","the","help","of","his","partner",",","Angel","Santangelo","(","Jaim","Santana",")",",","get","back","on","the","job","to","reclaim","his","reput","and","his","digniti","in","spite","of","their","worst","effort","."],"lemmas":["Timothy","James","'","tj","'","Williams","-lrb-","David","Wilson","-rrb-","be","a","streetwise","detective","whose","checkered","career",",","family","life","and","long","standing","friendship","with","the","would-be","mayor",",","police","chief","Hamilton","Markham","-lrb-","Tom","Sizemore","-rrb-",",","spin","out","of","control","and","teeter","on","the","brink","of","catastrophe","as","a","result","of","a","bust","go","bad",".","while","he","life","begin","to","crumble",",","he","fast","fading","future","be","barter","for","political","gain","by","he","former","best","friend","and","boss",",","a","mayor","with","she","eye","on","a","Senate","seat","-lrb-","Rebecca","De","Mornay","-rrb-","and","a","ambitious",",","activist","'","man-of-the-cloth",",","'","the","Rev.","Alonso","spark","-lrb-","Richard","Roundtree","-rrb-",".","the","political","machinery",",","gear","to","grind","up","Williams","as","a","bad","cop",",","have","a","wrench","toss","into","the","work","by","the","detective",",","who","with","the","help","of","he","partner",",","Angel","Santangelo","-lrb-","Jaime","Santana","-rrb-",",","get","back","on","the","job","to","reclaim","he","reputation","and","he","dignity","in","spite","of","they","worst","effort","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Timothy James '","James ' TJ","' TJ '","TJ ' Williams","' Williams (","Williams ( David","( David Wilson","David Wilson )","Wilson ) is",") is a","is a streetwise","a streetwise detective","streetwise detective whose","detective whose checkered","whose checkered career","checkered career ,","career , family",", family life","family life and","life and long","and long standing","long standing friendship","standing friendship with","friendship with the","with the would-be","the would-be mayor","would-be mayor ,","mayor , police",", police chief","police chief Hamilton","chief Hamilton Markham","Hamilton Markham (","Markham ( Tom","( Tom Sizemore","Tom Sizemore )","Sizemore ) ,",") , spins",", spins out","spins out of","out of control","of control and","control and teeters","and teeters on","teeters on the","on the brink","the brink of","brink of catastrophe","of catastrophe as","catastrophe as a","as a result","a result of","result of a","of a bust","a bust gone","bust gone bad","While his life","his life begins","life begins to","begins to crumble","to crumble ,","crumble , his",", his fast","his fast fading","fast fading future","fading future is","future is bartered","is bartered for","bartered for political","for political gain","political gain by","gain by his","by his former","his former best","former best friend","best friend and","friend and boss","and boss ,","boss , a",", a mayor","a mayor with","mayor with her","with her eye","her eye on","eye on a","on a Senate","a Senate seat","Senate seat (","seat ( Rebecca","( Rebecca De","Rebecca De Mornay","De Mornay )","Mornay ) and",") and an","and an ambitious","an ambitious ,","ambitious , activist",", activist '","activist ' man-of-the-cloth","' man-of-the-cloth ,","man-of-the-cloth , '",", ' the","' the Rev.","the Rev.

{"title":"The Absence","plot":"Adama Diop is a successful scientist, living in Paris. After 15 years away, he travels to his hometown in Senegal to visit his aged grandmother and his semi-deaf mute sister Aicha. Aicha is still traumatized about their mother's death, who died as she was giving birth to her. But the true extent of Aicha's mental state only becomes apparent when Adama discovers she is working as a prostitute, amidst a seedy underworld of gangsters, drugs and crime. Adama's discovery leads to a gripping thriller as he struggles to free Aicha from the sinister world into which she has descended.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Adama","Diop","is","a","success","scientist",",","live","in","Pari",".","After","15","year","away",",","he","travel","to","his","hometown","in","Seneg","to","visit","his","age","grandmoth","and","his","semi-deaf","mute","sister","Aicha",".","Aicha","is","still","traumat","about","their","mother","'s","death",",","who","die","as","she","was","give","birth","to","her",".","But","the","true","extent","of","Aicha","'s","mental","state","onli","becom","appar","when","Adama","discov","she","is","work","as","a","prostitut",",","amidst","a","seedi","underworld","of","gangster",",","drug","and","crime",".","Adama","'s","discoveri","lead","to","a","grip","thriller","as","he","struggl","to","free","Aicha","from","the","sinist","world","into","which","she","has","descend","."],"lemmas":["Adama","Diop","be","a","successful","scientist",",","live","in","Paris",".","after","15","year","away",",","he","travel","to","he","hometown","in","Senegal","to","visit","he","aged","grandmother","and","he","semi-deaf","mute","sister","Aicha",".","Aicha","be","still","traumatize","about","they","mother","'s","death",",","who","die","as","she","be","give","birth","to","she",".","but","the","true","extent","of","Aicha","'s","mental","state","only","become","apparent","when","Adama","discover","she","be","work","as","a","prostitute",",","amidst","a","seedy","underworld","of","gangster",",","drug","and","crime",".","Adama","'s","discovery","lead","to","a","gripping","thriller","as","he","struggle","to","free","Aicha","from","the","sinister","world","into","which","she","have","descend","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Adama Diop is","Diop is a","is a successful","a successful scientist","successful scientist ,","scientist , living",", living in","living in Paris","After 15 years","15 years away","years away ,","away , he",", he travels","he travels to","travels to his","to his hometown","his hometown in","hometown in Senegal","in Senegal to","Senegal to visit","to visit his","visit his aged","his aged grandmother","aged grandmother and","grandmother and his","and his semi-deaf","his semi-deaf mute","semi-deaf mute sister","mute sister Aicha","Aicha is still","is still traumatized","still traumatized about","traumatized about their","about their mother","their mother 's","mother 's death","'s death ,","death , who",", who died","who died as","died as she","as she was","she was giving","was giving birth","giving birth to","birth to her","But the true","the true extent","true extent of","extent of Aicha","of Aicha 's","Aicha 's mental","'s mental state","mental state only","state only becomes","only becomes apparent","becomes apparent when","apparent when Adama","when Adama discovers","Adama discovers she","discovers she is","she is working","is working as","working as a","as a prostitute","a prostitute ,","prostitute , amidst",", amidst a","amidst a seedy","a seedy underworld","seedy underworld of","underworld of gangsters","of gangsters ,","gangsters , drugs",", drugs and","drugs and crime","Adama 's discovery","'s discovery leads","discovery leads to","leads to a","to a gripping","a gripping thriller","gripping thriller as","thriller as he","as he struggles","he struggles to","struggles to free","to free Aicha","free Aicha from","Aicha from the","from the sinister","the sinister world","sinister world into","world into which","into which she","which she has","she has descended"],"2grams":["Adama Diop","Diop is","is a","a successful","successful scientist","scientist ,",", living","living in","in Paris","After 15","15 years","years away","away ,",", he","he travels","travels to","to his","his hometown","hometown in","in Senegal","Senegal to","to visit","visit his","his aged","aged grandmother","grandmother and","and his","his semi-deaf","semi-deaf mute","mute sister","sister Aicha","Aicha is","is still","still traumatized","traumatized about","about their","their mother","mother 's","'s death","death ,",", who","who died","died as","as she","she was","was giving","giving birth","birth to","to her","But the","the true","true extent","extent of","of Aicha","Aicha 's","'s mental","mental state","state only","only becomes","becomes apparent","apparent when","when Adama","Adama discovers","discovers she","she is","is working","working as","as a","a prostitute","prostitute ,",", amidst","amidst a","a seedy","seedy underworld","underworld of","of gangsters","gangsters ,",", drugs","drugs and","and crime","Adama 's","'s discovery","discovery leads","leads to","to a","a gripping","gripping thriller","thriller as","as he","he struggles","struggles to","to free","free Aicha","Aicha from","from the","the sinister","sinister world","world into","into which","which she","she has","has descended"]}

{"title":"Limpwings","plot":"We've all been there. You meet a cute girl and hit it off. Dinner turns to drinks turns to her place. You wake up in the morning feeling good until you realize you now have gaping holes in your hands and feet. You're bleeding everywhere, but it is okay because it doesn't hurt and it smells like roses. Wikipedia tells you that you have stigmata, and a mysterious angel backs up the diagnosis. Now all you have to do is lead God's people and keep the girl you love from moving away. Not the woman you slept with; no, that would be too easy. You're in love with your roommate, but she loves women. College, right? Limpwings is the first feature from Two Jackets Productions, a filmmaking triumvirate founded by Eric Carlson, Marcus Mann, and Andrew Neill.

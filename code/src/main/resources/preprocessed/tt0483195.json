{"title":"Every Other Week","plot":"Every Other Week is a comedy drama about two brothers whose lives become very complicated. Jens's wife Tessan refuses to believe that her husband's friendship with stunning Johanna is purely platonic and throws him out. Jens confides in his brother Pontus who is very surprised to learn that Jens has been seeing one of his old girlfriends. When Jens again tries to convince his wife of his innocence, he discovers that it is Tessan who has cheated on him. In a blind rage, Jens moves to Pontus's place. But life with Pontus is far from straightforward. And it is not getting any easier when Pontus realizes that he is again having feelings for his old girlfriend Johanna, at the same time as his former wife wants him to father another child. Now the brothers live together, and every other week they have all four children come to stay. In between there is the small matter of wives, ex-wives and girlfriends to unscramble, not to mention a career going rapidly down the toilet.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

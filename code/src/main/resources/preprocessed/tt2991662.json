{"title":"Bringing It Home","plot":"Hemp - it's not just for hippies anymore. Today they're making everything from salad dressings to buildings with it. Despite the inevitable jokes when hemp is mentioned, industrial hemp is actually a non-psychoactive plant, grown in 31 other countries, but prohibited in the United States. 'Bringing It Home' explores the question of why a crop with so many widespread benefits cannot be grown in America through animation, archival images and interviews with hemp business leaders and entrepreneurs in England, Spain, Washington, D.C., California and North Carolina. The documentary weaves a touching narrative extolling the many benefits of industrial hemp for the environment and human health, while illuminating the obstacles to what could be a thriving industry for U.S. farmers to tap into.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Hemp","-","it","'s","not","just","for","hippi","anymor",".","Today","they","re","make","everyth","from","salad","dress","to","build","with","it",".","Despit","the","inevit","joke","when","hemp","is","mention",",","industri","hemp","is","actual","a","non-psychoact","plant",",","grown","in","31","other","countri",",","but","prohibit","in","the","Unite","State",".","'","Bring","It","Home","'","explor","the","question","of","whi","a","crop","with","so","mani","widespread","benefit","can","not","be","grown","in","America","through","anim",",","archiv","imag","and","interview","with","hemp","busi","leader","and","entrepreneur","in","England",",","Spain",",","Washington",",","D.C.",",","California","and","North","Carolina",".","The","documentari","weav","a","touch","narrat","extol","the","mani","benefit","of","industri","hemp","for","the","environ","and","human","health",",","while","illumin","the","obstacl","to","what","could","be","a","thrive","industri","for","U.S.","farmer","to","tap","into","."],"lemmas":["Hemp","-","it","be","not","just","for","hippie","anymore",".","today","they","be","make","everything","from","salad","dressing","to","building","with","it",".","despite","the","inevitable","joke","when","hemp","be","mention",",","industrial","hemp","be","actually","a","non-psychoactive","plant",",","grow","in","31","other","country",",","but","prohibit","in","the","United","States",".","'","bring","it","Home","'","explore","the","question","of","why","a","crop","with","so","many","widespread","benefit","can","not","be","grow","in","America","through","animation",",","archival","image","and","interview","with","hemp","business","leader","and","entrepreneur","in","England",",","Spain",",","Washington",",","D.C.",",","California","and","North","Carolina",".","the","documentary","weave","a","touch","narrative","extol","the","many","benefit","of","industrial","hemp","for","the","environment","and","human","health",",","while","illuminate","the","obstacle","to","what","could","be","a","thriving","industry","for","U.S.","farmer","to","tap","into","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Hemp - it","- it 's","it 's not","'s not just","not just for","just for hippies","for hippies anymore","Today they 're","they 're making","'re making everything","making everything from","everything from salad","from salad dressings","salad dressings to","dressings to buildings","to buildings with","buildings with it","Despite the inevitable","the inevitable jokes","inevitable jokes when","jokes when hemp","when hemp is","hemp is mentioned","is mentioned ,","mentioned , industrial",", industrial hemp","industrial hemp is","hemp is actually","is actually a","actually a non-psychoactive","a non-psychoactive plant","non-psychoactive plant ,","plant , grown",", grown in","grown in 31","in 31 other","31 other countries","other countries ,","countries , but",", but prohibited","but prohibited in","prohibited in the","in the United","the United States","United States .","States .

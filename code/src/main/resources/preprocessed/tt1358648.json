{"title":"Steypa","plot":"Emerging artists working in their hometown Reykjavík and abroad share with the viewers the diverse processes that spark a work of art. Threading a line between realism and performance, the film explores inspiration and creativity through an intimate two-year collaboration, providing an insight into a booming scene. Pouring Coke into empty Fanta bottles, Ásmundur asks himself \"What is art?\" suggesting that it is embedded in what an artist does. Accordingly, rather that focusing on the end product, the film deals with what the artist is up to before it comes to that. Gabríela kneads dough and smears on her face, Margrét is enchanted by gaskets in a rubber store, Huginn has his hair cut off and turned into a wig, Unnar rummages for plant cuttings in a home for the elderly, The Icelandic Love Corporation recreates Van Gogh's Starry Night in liquorice and Kartín builds a small model of a house only to throw it off a bigger one. What is behind this commotion? Has Iceland anything to do with it? Does it concern the rest of us?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Emerg","artist","work","in","their","hometown","Reykjavík","and","abroad","share","with","the","viewer","the","divers","process","that","spark","a","work","of","art",".","Thread","a","line","between","realism","and","perform",",","the","film","explor","inspir","and","creativ","through","an","intim","two-year","collabor",",","provid","an","insight","into","a","boom","scene",".","Pour","Coke","into","empti","Fanta","bottl",",","Ásmundur","ask","himself","\"","What","is","art","?","\"","suggest","that","it","is","embed","in","what","an","artist","doe",".","Accord",",","rather","that","focus","on","the","end","product",",","the","film","deal","with","what","the","artist","is","up","to","befor","it","come","to","that",".","Gabríela","knead","dough","and","smear","on","her","face",",","Margrét","is","enchant","by","gasket","in","a","rubber","store",",","Huginn","has","his","hair","cut","off","and","turn","into","a","wig",",","Unnar","rummag","for","plant","cut","in","a","home","for","the","elder",",","The","Iceland","Love","Corpor","recreat","Van","Gogh","'s","Starri","Night","in","liquoric","and","Kartín","build","a","small","model","of","a","hous","onli","to","throw","it","off","a","bigger","one",".","What","is","behind","this","commot","?","Has","Iceland","anyth","to","do","with","it","?","Doe","it","concern","the","rest","of","us","?"],"lemmas":["emerge","artist","work","in","they","hometown","Reykjavík","and","abroad","share","with","the","viewer","the","diverse","process","that","spark","a","work","of","art",".","thread","a","line","between","realism","and","performance",",","the","film","explore","inspiration","and","creativity","through","a","intimate","two-year","collaboration",",","provide","a","insight","into","a","booming","scene",".","pour","Coke","into","empty","Fanta","bottle",",","Ásmundur","ask","himself","``","what","be","art","?","''","suggest","that","it","be","embed","in","what","a","artist","do",".","accordingly",",","rather","that","focus","on","the","end","product",",","the","film","deal","with","what","the","artist","be","up","to","before","it","come","to","that",".","gabríela","kneads","dough","and","smear","on","she","face",",","Margrét","be","enchant","by","gasket","in","a","rubber","store",",","Huginn","have","he","hair","cut","off","and","turn","into","a","wig",",","Unnar","rummage","for","plant","cutting","in","a","home","for","the","elderly",",","the","Icelandic","Love","Corporation","recreate","Van","Gogh","'s","Starry","Night","in","liquorice","and","Kartín","build","a","small","model","of","a","house","only","to","throw","it","off","a","bigger","one",".","what","be","behind","this","commotion","?","have","Iceland","anything","to","do","with","it","?","do","it","concern","the","rest","of","we","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Emerging artists working","artists working in","working in their","in their hometown","their hometown Reykjavík","hometown Reykjavík and","Reykjavík and abroad","and abroad share","abroad share with","share with the","with the viewers","the viewers the","viewers the diverse","the diverse processes","diverse processes that","processes that spark","that spark a","spark a work","a work of","work of art","Threading a line","a line between","line between realism","between realism and","realism and performance","and performance ,","performance , the",", the film","the film explores","film explores inspiration","explores inspiration and","inspiration and creativity","and creativity through","creativity through an","through an intimate","an intimate two-year","intimate two-year collaboration","two-year collaboration ,","collaboration , providing",", providing an","providing an insight","an insight into","insight into a","into a booming","a booming scene","Pouring Coke into","Coke into empty","into empty Fanta","empty Fanta bottles","Fanta bottles ,","bottles , Ásmundur",", Ásmundur asks","Ásmundur asks himself","asks himself \"","himself \" What","\" What is","What is art","is art ?","art ?

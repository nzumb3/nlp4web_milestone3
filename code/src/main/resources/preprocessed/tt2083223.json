{"title":"In the Night","plot":"Jane Fisher is a playwright with one night left to write a new script. It is already past midnight when she finally gets an idea - a cast of actors, abandoned by their director. Driven by fear of unemployment and misery, the actors decide to create a show of their own. Slowly, they grow empowered as they realize the potential their show has to tell the stories they've always longed to reveal. But everyone, as it turns out, has their price. As the clock ticks for Jane and her characters, she realizes that her characters aren't the only ones who have some tough decisions to face.","genres":["Comedy"," Musical"," Music"],"stems":["Jane","Fisher","is","a","playwright","with","one","night","left","to","write","a","new","script",".","It","is","alreadi","past","midnight","when","she","final","get","an","idea","-","a","cast","of","actor",",","abandon","by","their","director",".","Driven","by","fear","of","unemploy","and","miseri",",","the","actor","decid","to","creat","a","show","of","their","own",".","Slowli",",","they","grow","empow","as","they","realiz","the","potenti","their","show","has","to","tell","the","stori","they","ve","alway","long","to","reveal",".","But","everyon",",","as","it","turn","out",",","has","their","price",".","As","the","clock","tick","for","Jane","and","her","charact",",","she","realiz","that","her","charact","are","n't","the","onli","one","who","have","some","tough","decis","to","face","."],"lemmas":["Jane","Fisher","be","a","playwright","with","one","night","leave","to","write","a","new","script",".","it","be","already","past","midnight","when","she","finally","get","a","idea","-","a","cast","of","actor",",","abandon","by","they","director",".","drive","by","fear","of","unemployment","and","misery",",","the","actor","decide","to","create","a","show","of","they","own",".","slowly",",","they","grow","empower","as","they","realize","the","potential","they","show","have","to","tell","the","story","they","have","always","long","to","reveal",".","but","everyone",",","as","it","turn","out",",","have","they","price",".","as","the","clock","tick","for","Jane","and","she","character",",","she","realize","that","she","character","be","not","the","only","one","who","have","some","tough","decision","to","face","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jane Fisher is","Fisher is a","is a playwright","a playwright with","playwright with one","with one night","one night left","night left to","left to write","to write a","write a new","a new script","It is already","is already past","already past midnight","past midnight when","midnight when she","when she finally","she finally gets","finally gets an","gets an idea","an idea -","idea - a","- a cast","a cast of","cast of actors","of actors ,","actors , abandoned",", abandoned by","abandoned by their","by their director","Driven by fear","by fear of","fear of unemployment","of unemployment and","unemployment and misery","and misery ,","misery , the",", the actors","the actors decide","actors decide to","decide to create","to create a","create a show","a show of","show of their","of their own","Slowly , they",", they grow","they grow empowered","grow empowered as","empowered as they","as they realize","they realize the","realize the potential","the potential their","potential their show","their show has","show has to","has to tell","to tell the","tell the stories","the stories they","stories they 've","they 've always","'ve always longed","always longed to","longed to reveal","But everyone ,","everyone , as",", as it","as it turns","it turns out","turns out ,","out , has",", has their","has their price","As the clock","the clock ticks","clock ticks for","ticks for Jane","for Jane and","Jane and her","and her characters","her characters ,","characters , she",", she realizes","she realizes that","realizes that her","that her characters","her characters are","characters are n't","are n't the","n't the only","the only ones","only ones who","ones who have","who have some","have some tough","some tough decisions","tough decisions to","decisions to face"],"2grams":["Jane Fisher","Fisher is","is a","a playwright","playwright with","with one","one night","night left","left to","to write","write a","a new","new script","It is","is already","already past","past midnight","midnight when","when she","she finally","finally gets","gets an","an idea","idea -","- a","a cast","cast of","of actors","actors ,",", abandoned","abandoned by","by their","their director","Driven by","by fear","fear of","of unemployment","unemployment and","and misery","misery ,",", the","the actors","actors decide","decide to","to create","create a","a show","show of","of their","their own","Slowly ,",", they","they grow","grow empowered","empowered as","as they","they realize","realize the","the potential","potential their","their show","show has","has to","to tell","tell the","the stories","stories they","they 've","'ve always","always longed","longed to","to reveal","But everyone","everyone ,",", as","as it","it turns","turns out","out ,",", has","has their","their price","As the","the clock","clock ticks","ticks for","for Jane","Jane and","and her","her characters","characters ,",", she","she realizes","realizes that","that her","her characters","characters are","are n't","n't the","the only","only ones","ones who","who have","have some","some tough","tough decisions","decisions to","to face"]}

{"title":"Revelation Trail","plot":"A frontier preacher's life is destroyed when a gruesome power consumes the land; he now must make the choice to give in to ruin, or find his purpose in the fight against the mysterious undead. Joined by the town lawman (who has entirely different personal demons to confront), the two men learn the extremes they're willing to go to in order to make it to the next day, as well as the depths people will go to when they truly believe in something.","genres":["Drama"," Western"," Horror"],"stems":["A","frontier","preacher","'s","life","is","destroy","when","a","gruesom","power","consum","the","land",";","he","now","must","make","the","choic","to","give","in","to","ruin",",","or","find","his","purpos","in","the","fight","against","the","mysteri","undead",".","Join","by","the","town","lawman","(","who","has","entir","differ","person","demon","to","confront",")",",","the","two","men","learn","the","extrem","they","re","will","to","go","to","in","order","to","make","it","to","the","next","day",",","as","well","as","the","depth","peopl","will","go","to","when","they","truli","believ","in","someth","."],"lemmas":["a","frontier","preacher","'s","life","be","destroy","when","a","gruesome","power","consume","the","land",";","he","now","must","make","the","choice","to","give","in","to","ruin",",","or","find","he","purpose","in","the","fight","against","the","mysterious","undead",".","join","by","the","town","lawman","-lrb-","who","have","entirely","different","personal","demon","to","confront","-rrb-",",","the","two","man","learn","the","extreme","they","be","willing","to","go","to","in","order","to","make","it","to","the","next","day",",","as","well","as","the","depths","people","will","go","to","when","they","truly","believe","in","something","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A frontier preacher","frontier preacher 's","preacher 's life","'s life is","life is destroyed","is destroyed when","destroyed when a","when a gruesome","a gruesome power","gruesome power consumes","power consumes the","consumes the land","the land ;","land ; he","; he now","he now must","now must make","must make the","make the choice","the choice to","choice to give","to give in","give in to","in to ruin","to ruin ,","ruin , or",", or find","or find his","find his purpose","his purpose in","purpose in the","in the fight","the fight against","fight against the","against the mysterious","the mysterious undead","Joined by the","by the town","the town lawman","town lawman (","lawman ( who","( who has","who has entirely","has entirely different","entirely different personal","different personal demons","personal demons to","demons to confront","to confront )","confront ) ,",") , the",", the two","the two men","two men learn","men learn the","learn the extremes","the extremes they","extremes they 're","they 're willing","'re willing to","willing to go","to go to","go to in","to in order","in order to","order to make","to make it","make it to","it to the","to the next","the next day","next day ,","day , as",", as well","as well as","well as the","as the depths","the depths people","depths people will","people will go","will go to","go to when","to when they","when they truly","they truly believe","truly believe in","believe in something"],"2grams":["A frontier","frontier preacher","preacher 's","'s life","life is","is destroyed","destroyed when","when a","a gruesome","gruesome power","power consumes","consumes the","the land","land ;","; he","he now","now must","must make","make the","the choice","choice to","to give","give in","in to","to ruin","ruin ,",", or","or find","find his","his purpose","purpose in","in the","the fight","fight against","against the","the mysterious","mysterious undead","Joined by","by the","the town","town lawman","lawman (","( who","who has","has entirely","entirely different","different personal","personal demons","demons to","to confront","confront )",") ,",", the","the two","two men","men learn","learn the","the extremes","extremes they","they 're","'re willing","willing to","to go","go to","to in","in order","order to","to make","make it","it to","to the","the next","next day","day ,",", as","as well","well as","as the","the depths","depths people","people will","will go","go to","to when","when they","they truly","truly believe","believe in","in something"]}

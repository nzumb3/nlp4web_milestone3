{"title":"No One Killed Jessica","plot":"Devastated when she is told that that her sister, Jessica Lall, is shot dead by Manish Bhardwaj, the son of Pramod, a Congress party Member of Parliament in Haryana, Delhi-based Sabrina Lall, in the company of her parents, attends the Court to view a charade that will lead to the acquittal of the accused and his accomplices seven years after the incident. Disillusioned by rampart police corruption and inefficiency; a stagnant British introduced legal system; the passing of her mother & the hospitalization of her father, she retreats unto herself. Then foul-mouthed NDTV employee, Meera Gaity, known for being more of an activist than a Journalist, takes an interest in this incident, and uncovers conspiracy & corruption that led to the accused' acquittals - leading to a near India-wide protest. While preparing herself to participate in a candle-lit procession at Delhi's India Gate, Meera will confront Sabrina and will come to know the reasons why the latter refuses to be involved in this situation any more.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Devast","when","she","is","told","that","that","her","sister",",","Jessica","Lall",",","is","shot","dead","by","Manish","Bhardwaj",",","the","son","of","Pramod",",","a","Congress","parti","Member","of","Parliament","in","Haryana",",","Delhi-bas","Sabrina","Lall",",","in","the","compani","of","her","parent",",","attend","the","Court","to","view","a","charad","that","will","lead","to","the","acquitt","of","the","accus","and","his","accomplic","seven","year","after","the","incid",".","Disillus","by","rampart","polic","corrupt","and","ineffici",";","a","stagnant","British","introduc","legal","system",";","the","pass","of","her","mother","&","the","hospit","of","her","father",",","she","retreat","unto","herself",".","Then","foul-mouth","NDTV","employe",",","Meera","Gaiti",",","known","for","be","more","of","an","activist","than","a","Journalist",",","take","an","interest","in","this","incid",",","and","uncov","conspiraci","&","corrupt","that","led","to","the","accus","'","acquitt","-","lead","to","a","near","India-wid","protest",".","While","prepar","herself","to","particip","in","a","candle-lit","process","at","Delhi","'s","India","Gate",",","Meera","will","confront","Sabrina","and","will","come","to","know","the","reason","whi","the","latter","refus","to","be","involv","in","this","situat","ani","more","."],"lemmas":["devastate","when","she","be","tell","that","that","she","sister",",","Jessica","Lall",",","be","shoot","dead","by","Manish","Bhardwaj",",","the","son","of","Pramod",",","a","Congress","party","Member","of","Parliament","in","Haryana",",","delhi-based","Sabrina","Lall",",","in","the","company","of","she","parent",",","attend","the","Court","to","view","a","charade","that","will","lead","to","the","acquittal","of","the","accuse","and","he","accomplice","seven","year","after","the","incident",".","disillusion","by","rampart","police","corruption","and","inefficiency",";","a","stagnant","British","introduce","legal","system",";","the","passing","of","she","mother","&","the","hospitalization","of","she","father",",","she","retreat","unto","herself",".","then","foul-mouthed","NDTV","employee",",","Meera","Gaity",",","know","for","be","more","of","a","activist","than","a","journalist",",","take","a","interest","in","this","incident",",","and","uncover","conspiracy","&","corruption","that","lead","to","the","accuse","'","acquittal","-","lead","to","a","near","india-wide","protest",".","while","prepare","herself","to","participate","in","a","candle-lit","procession","at","Delhi","'s","India","Gate",",","Meera","will","confront","Sabrina","and","will","come","to","know","the","reason","why","the","latter","refuse","to","be","involve","in","this","situation","any","more","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Devastated when she","when she is","she is told","is told that","told that that","that that her","that her sister","her sister ,","sister , Jessica",", Jessica Lall","Jessica Lall ,","Lall , is",", is shot","is shot dead","shot dead by","dead by Manish","by Manish Bhardwaj","Manish Bhardwaj ,","Bhardwaj , the",", the son","the son of","son of Pramod","of Pramod ,","Pramod , a",", a Congress","a Congress party","Congress party Member","party Member of","Member of Parliament","of Parliament in","Parliament in Haryana","in Haryana ,","Haryana , Delhi-based",", Delhi-based Sabrina","Delhi-based Sabrina Lall","Sabrina Lall ,","Lall , in",", in the","in the company","the company of","company of her","of her parents","her parents ,","parents , attends",", attends the","attends the Court","the Court to","Court to view","to view a","view a charade","a charade that","charade that will","that will lead","will lead to","lead to the","to the acquittal","the acquittal of","acquittal of the","of the accused","the accused and","accused and his","and his accomplices","his accomplices seven","accomplices seven years","seven years after","years after the","after the incident","Disillusioned by rampart","by rampart police","rampart police corruption","police corruption and","corruption and inefficiency","and inefficiency ;","inefficiency ;

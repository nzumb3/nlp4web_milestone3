{"title":"Disintegration","plot":"Charles Wilcox III tries to stabilize his deteriorating life after the death of his Grand Dad, who funded his graduate work in religious studies. His major professor, Dr. Robert Lee Nelson, tries to secure a grant from the little-known Scholars Foundation. Incredibly, Wilcox's research on the Nephilim turns out be deadly accurate. They exist, and have lived quietly among countless generations of mortals since before the Great Flood. The Nephilim have a mission and a mysterious connection with the Scholars Foundation - and Charles unknowingly has a double dose of trouble. He has the blood of the Nephilim in his veins and he threatens a soul they are bound to protect. The Scholars Foundation has more than a passing interest in Charles, an interest that proves dangerous for Charles and Dr. Nelson alike.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Charl","Wilcox","III","tri","to","stabil","his","deterior","life","after","the","death","of","his","Grand","Dad",",","who","fund","his","graduat","work","in","religi","studi",".","His","major","professor",",","Dr.","Robert","Lee","Nelson",",","tri","to","secur","a","grant","from","the","little-known","Scholar","Foundat",".","Incredibl",",","Wilcox","'s","research","on","the","Nephilim","turn","out","be","dead","accur",".","They","exist",",","and","have","live","quiet","among","countless","generat","of","mortal","sinc","befor","the","Great","Flood",".","The","Nephilim","have","a","mission","and","a","mysteri","connect","with","the","Scholar","Foundat","-","and","Charl","unknow","has","a","doubl","dose","of","troubl",".","He","has","the","blood","of","the","Nephilim","in","his","vein","and","he","threaten","a","soul","they","are","bound","to","protect",".","The","Scholar","Foundat","has","more","than","a","pass","interest","in","Charl",",","an","interest","that","prove","danger","for","Charl","and","Dr.","Nelson","alik","."],"lemmas":["Charles","Wilcox","III","try","to","stabilize","he","deteriorate","life","after","the","death","of","he","Grand","Dad",",","who","fund","he","graduate","work","in","religious","study",".","he","major","professor",",","Dr.","Robert","Lee","Nelson",",","try","to","secure","a","grant","from","the","little-known","Scholars","Foundation",".","incredibly",",","Wilcox","'s","research","on","the","Nephilim","turn","out","be","deadly","accurate",".","they","exist",",","and","have","live","quietly","among","countless","generation","of","mortal","since","before","the","Great","Flood",".","the","Nephilim","have","a","mission","and","a","mysterious","connection","with","the","Scholars","Foundation","-","and","Charles","unknowingly","have","a","double","dose","of","trouble",".","he","have","the","blood","of","the","Nephilim","in","he","vein","and","he","threaten","a","soul","they","be","bind","to","protect",".","the","Scholars","Foundation","have","more","than","a","passing","interest","in","Charles",",","a","interest","that","prove","dangerous","for","Charles","and","Dr.","Nelson","alike","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Charles Wilcox III","Wilcox III tries","III tries to","tries to stabilize","to stabilize his","stabilize his deteriorating","his deteriorating life","deteriorating life after","life after the","after the death","the death of","death of his","of his Grand","his Grand Dad","Grand Dad ,","Dad , who",", who funded","who funded his","funded his graduate","his graduate work","graduate work in","work in religious","in religious studies","His major professor","major professor ,","professor , Dr.",", Dr. Robert","Dr. Robert Lee","Robert Lee Nelson","Lee Nelson ,","Nelson , tries",", tries to","tries to secure","to secure a","secure a grant","a grant from","grant from the","from the little-known","the little-known Scholars","little-known Scholars Foundation","Incredibly , Wilcox",", Wilcox 's","Wilcox 's research","'s research on","research on the","on the Nephilim","the Nephilim turns","Nephilim turns out","turns out be","out be deadly","be deadly accurate","They exist ,","exist , and",", and have","and have lived","have lived quietly","lived quietly among","quietly among countless","among countless generations","countless generations of","generations of mortals","of mortals since","mortals since before","since before the","before the Great","the Great Flood","The Nephilim have","Nephilim have a","have a mission","a mission and","mission and a","and a mysterious","a mysterious connection","mysterious connection with","connection with the","with the Scholars","the Scholars Foundation","Scholars Foundation -","Foundation -

{"title":"One Year's Crop","plot":"Back on the farm upon the death of his father, Robert Biggs, prodigal son of the soil, faces the demons that drove him away, while blessing the angels calling him home. Long an actor, musician, composer and writer, Robert struggles to reconcile the story of where he came from, with the stories he now writes for the stage. Haunting, big-sky visuals of the windswept Illinois prairie support a narrative story unfolding in four patient seasons. Shadows play with light in this homespun American tale of a wandering spirit and the land that he loves.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Back","on","the","farm","upon","the","death","of","his","father",",","Robert","Bigg",",","prodig","son","of","the","soil",",","face","the","demon","that","drove","him","away",",","while","bless","the","angel","call","him","home",".","Long","an","actor",",","musician",",","compos","and","writer",",","Robert","struggl","to","reconcil","the","stori","of","where","he","came","from",",","with","the","stori","he","now","write","for","the","stage",".","Haunt",",","big-ski","visual","of","the","windswept","Illinoi","prairi","support","a","narrat","stori","unfold","in","four","patient","season",".","Shadow","play","with","light","in","this","homespun","American","tale","of","a","wander","spirit","and","the","land","that","he","love","."],"lemmas":["back","on","the","farm","upon","the","death","of","he","father",",","Robert","Biggs",",","prodigal","son","of","the","soil",",","face","the","demon","that","drive","he","away",",","while","blessing","the","angel","call","he","home",".","long","a","actor",",","musician",",","composer","and","writer",",","Robert","struggle","to","reconcile","the","story","of","where","he","come","from",",","with","the","story","he","now","write","for","the","stage",".","haunting",",","big-sky","visual","of","the","windswept","Illinois","prairie","support","a","narrative","story","unfold","in","four","patient","season",".","shadow","play","with","light","in","this","homespun","american","tale","of","a","wander","spirit","and","the","land","that","he","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Back on the","on the farm","the farm upon","farm upon the","upon the death","the death of","death of his","of his father","his father ,","father , Robert",", Robert Biggs","Robert Biggs ,","Biggs , prodigal",", prodigal son","prodigal son of","son of the","of the soil","the soil ,","soil , faces",", faces the","faces the demons","the demons that","demons that drove","that drove him","drove him away","him away ,","away , while",", while blessing","while blessing the","blessing the angels","the angels calling","angels calling him","calling him home","Long an actor","an actor ,","actor , musician",", musician ,","musician , composer",", composer and","composer and writer","and writer ,","writer , Robert",", Robert struggles","Robert struggles to","struggles to reconcile","to reconcile the","reconcile the story","the story of","story of where","of where he","where he came","he came from","came from ,","from , with",", with the","with the stories","the stories he","stories he now","he now writes","now writes for","writes for the","for the stage","Haunting , big-sky",", big-sky visuals","big-sky visuals of","visuals of the","of the windswept","the windswept Illinois","windswept Illinois prairie","Illinois prairie support","prairie support a","support a narrative","a narrative story","narrative story unfolding","story unfolding in","unfolding in four","in four patient","four patient seasons","Shadows play with","play with light","with light in","light in this","in this homespun","this homespun American","homespun American tale","American tale of","tale of a","of a wandering","a wandering spirit","wandering spirit and","spirit and the","and the land","the land that","land that he","that he loves"],"2grams":["Back on","on the","the farm","farm upon","upon the","the death","death of","of his","his father","father ,",", Robert","Robert Biggs","Biggs ,",", prodigal","prodigal son","son of","of the","the soil","soil ,",", faces","faces the","the demons","demons that","that drove","drove him","him away","away ,",", while","while blessing","blessing the","the angels","angels calling","calling him","him home","Long an","an actor","actor ,",", musician","musician ,",", composer","composer and","and writer","writer ,",", Robert","Robert struggles","struggles to","to reconcile","reconcile the","the story","story of","of where","where he","he came","came from","from ,",", with","with the","the stories","stories he","he now","now writes","writes for","for the","the stage","Haunting ,",", big-sky","big-sky visuals","visuals of","of the","the windswept","windswept Illinois","Illinois prairie","prairie support","support a","a narrative","narrative story","story unfolding","unfolding in","in four","four patient","patient seasons","Shadows play","play with","with light","light in","in this","this homespun","homespun American","American tale","tale of","of a","a wandering","wandering spirit","spirit and","and the","the land","land that","that he","he loves"]}

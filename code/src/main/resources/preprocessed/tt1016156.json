{"title":"Bulgaria of All Places","plot":"The intimate tale of a family can encapsulate the evolution and state of the society in which it lives. A privileged insight into the family album may enable the audience to relive important chapters in history and sense the mood of the times. The family in this story is that of writer Angelika Schrobsdorff. It is almost as if major characters from her work had developed a life of their own to reveal the invisible pages we could not find in her books.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","intim","tale","of","a","famili","can","encapsul","the","evolut","and","state","of","the","societi","in","which","it","live",".","A","privileg","insight","into","the","famili","album","may","enabl","the","audienc","to","reliv","import","chapter","in","histori","and","sens","the","mood","of","the","time",".","The","famili","in","this","stori","is","that","of","writer","Angelika","Schrobsdorff",".","It","is","almost","as","if","major","charact","from","her","work","had","develop","a","life","of","their","own","to","reveal","the","invis","page","we","could","not","find","in","her","book","."],"lemmas":["the","intimate","tale","of","a","family","can","encapsulate","the","evolution","and","state","of","the","society","in","which","it","live",".","a","privileged","insight","into","the","family","album","may","enable","the","audience","to","relive","important","chapter","in","history","and","sense","the","mood","of","the","time",".","the","family","in","this","story","be","that","of","writer","Angelika","Schrobsdorff",".","it","be","almost","as","if","major","character","from","she","work","have","develop","a","life","of","they","own","to","reveal","the","invisible","page","we","could","not","find","in","she","book","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The intimate tale","intimate tale of","tale of a","of a family","a family can","family can encapsulate","can encapsulate the","encapsulate the evolution","the evolution and","evolution and state","and state of","state of the","of the society","the society in","society in which","in which it","which it lives","A privileged insight","privileged insight into","insight into the","into the family","the family album","family album may","album may enable","may enable the","enable the audience","the audience to","audience to relive","to relive important","relive important chapters","important chapters in","chapters in history","in history and","history and sense","and sense the","sense the mood","the mood of","mood of the","of the times","The family in","family in this","in this story","this story is","story is that","is that of","that of writer","of writer Angelika","writer Angelika Schrobsdorff","It is almost","is almost as","almost as if","as if major","if major characters","major characters from","characters from her","from her work","her work had","work had developed","had developed a","developed a life","a life of","life of their","of their own","their own to","own to reveal","to reveal the","reveal the invisible","the invisible pages","invisible pages we","pages we could","we could not","could not find","not find in","find in her","in her books"],"2grams":["The intimate","intimate tale","tale of","of a","a family","family can","can encapsulate","encapsulate the","the evolution","evolution and","and state","state of","of the","the society","society in","in which","which it","it lives","A privileged","privileged insight","insight into","into the","the family","family album","album may","may enable","enable the","the audience","audience to","to relive","relive important","important chapters","chapters in","in history","history and","and sense","sense the","the mood","mood of","of the","the times","The family","family in","in this","this story","story is","is that","that of","of writer","writer Angelika","Angelika Schrobsdorff","It is","is almost","almost as","as if","if major","major characters","characters from","from her","her work","work had","had developed","developed a","a life","life of","of their","their own","own to","to reveal","reveal the","the invisible","invisible pages","pages we","we could","could not","not find","find in","in her","her books"]}

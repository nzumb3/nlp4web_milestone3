{"title":"Black Knight","plot":"This is the story an amusement park employee named Jamal Walker who is magically transported back to medieval times in 14th-century England. There, Jamal meets Sir Knolte, a dissolute knight, before he stumbles into the court of the usurper King Leo. Jamal is impressed by what he thinks is the realism of the theme park; only after witnessing a gory beheading does he realize, with horror, where he really is. Jamal encounters the beautiful Victoria who is scheming to return the queen to the throne, and falls afoul of the evil Sir Percival. Joining forces with Sir Knolte and Victoria, Jamal teaches the rebels some helpful football, golfing, and boxing moves, before he dons the armor of the awesome \"Black Knight\"!","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Comedy"],"stems":["This","is","the","stori","an","amus","park","employe","name","Jamal","Walker","who","is","magic","transport","back","to","mediev","time","in","14th-centuri","England",".","There",",","Jamal","meet","Sir","Knolt",",","a","dissolut","knight",",","befor","he","stumbl","into","the","court","of","the","usurp","King","Leo",".","Jamal","is","impress","by","what","he","think","is","the","realism","of","the","theme","park",";","onli","after","wit","a","gori","behead","doe","he","realiz",",","with","horror",",","where","he","realli","is",".","Jamal","encount","the","beauti","Victoria","who","is","scheme","to","return","the","queen","to","the","throne",",","and","fall","afoul","of","the","evil","Sir","Perciv",".","Join","forc","with","Sir","Knolt","and","Victoria",",","Jamal","teach","the","rebel","some","help","footbal",",","golf",",","and","box","move",",","befor","he","don","the","armor","of","the","awesom","\"","Black","Knight","\"","!"],"lemmas":["this","be","the","story","a","amusement","park","employee","name","Jamal","Walker","who","be","magically","transport","back","to","medieval","time","in","14th-century","England",".","there",",","Jamal","meet","Sir","Knolte",",","a","dissolute","knight",",","before","he","stumble","into","the","court","of","the","usurper","King","Leo",".","Jamal","be","impress","by","what","he","think","be","the","realism","of","the","theme","park",";","only","after","witness","a","gory","beheading","do","he","realize",",","with","horror",",","where","he","really","be",".","Jamal","encounter","the","beautiful","Victoria","who","be","scheming","to","return","the","queen","to","the","throne",",","and","fall","afoul","of","the","evil","Sir","Percival",".","join","force","with","Sir","Knolte","and","Victoria",",","Jamal","teach","the","rebel","some","helpful","football",",","golfing",",","and","boxing","move",",","before","he","don","the","armor","of","the","awesome","``","Black","Knight","''","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This is the","is the story","the story an","story an amusement","an amusement park","amusement park employee","park employee named","employee named Jamal","named Jamal Walker","Jamal Walker who","Walker who is","who is magically","is magically transported","magically transported back","transported back to","back to medieval","to medieval times","medieval times in","times in 14th-century","in 14th-century England","There , Jamal",", Jamal meets","Jamal meets Sir","meets Sir Knolte","Sir Knolte ,","Knolte , a",", a dissolute","a dissolute knight","dissolute knight ,","knight , before",", before he","before he stumbles","he stumbles into","stumbles into the","into the court","the court of","court of the","of the usurper","the usurper King","usurper King Leo","Jamal is impressed","is impressed by","impressed by what","by what he","what he thinks","he thinks is","thinks is the","is the realism","the realism of","realism of the","of the theme","the theme park","theme park ;","park ;

{"title":"Apartment 202","plot":"John is a struggling San Francisco musician who can't find a girlfriend. Zack, his roommate and best friend, is a wannabe comedian who likes to play the field. When the two fall for a pair of beautiful and strong-willed foreigners, John convinces Zack that they have to do whatever it takes to help the girls stay in the country -- even if it means getting married and living together. A comedic clash of cultures transforms the apartment, and John and Zack find out that they have a lot to learn about love and life.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["John","is","a","struggl","San","Francisco","musician","who","ca","n't","find","a","girlfriend",".","Zack",",","his","roommat","and","best","friend",",","is","a","wannab","comedian","who","like","to","play","the","field",".","When","the","two","fall","for","a","pair","of","beauti","and","strong-wil","foreign",",","John","convinc","Zack","that","they","have","to","do","whatev","it","take","to","help","the","girl","stay","in","the","countri","--","even","if","it","mean","get","marri","and","live","togeth",".","A","comed","clash","of","cultur","transform","the","apart",",","and","John","and","Zack","find","out","that","they","have","a","lot","to","learn","about","love","and","life","."],"lemmas":["John","be","a","struggle","San","Francisco","musician","who","can","not","find","a","girlfriend",".","Zack",",","he","roommate","and","best","friend",",","be","a","wannabe","comedian","who","like","to","play","the","field",".","when","the","two","fall","for","a","pair","of","beautiful","and","strong-willed","foreigner",",","John","convince","Zack","that","they","have","to","do","whatever","it","take","to","help","the","girl","stay","in","the","country","--","even","if","it","mean","get","marry","and","live","together",".","a","comedic","clash","of","culture","transform","the","apartment",",","and","John","and","Zack","find","out","that","they","have","a","lot","to","learn","about","love","and","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["John is a","is a struggling","a struggling San","struggling San Francisco","San Francisco musician","Francisco musician who","musician who ca","who ca n't","ca n't find","n't find a","find a girlfriend","Zack , his",", his roommate","his roommate and","roommate and best","and best friend","best friend ,","friend , is",", is a","is a wannabe","a wannabe comedian","wannabe comedian who","comedian who likes","who likes to","likes to play","to play the","play the field","When the two","the two fall","two fall for","fall for a","for a pair","a pair of","pair of beautiful","of beautiful and","beautiful and strong-willed","and strong-willed foreigners","strong-willed foreigners ,","foreigners , John",", John convinces","John convinces Zack","convinces Zack that","Zack that they","that they have","they have to","have to do","to do whatever","do whatever it","whatever it takes","it takes to","takes to help","to help the","help the girls","the girls stay","girls stay in","stay in the","in the country","the country --","country -- even","-- even if","even if it","if it means","it means getting","means getting married","getting married and","married and living","and living together","A comedic clash","comedic clash of","clash of cultures","of cultures transforms","cultures transforms the","transforms the apartment","the apartment ,","apartment , and",", and John","and John and","John and Zack","and Zack find","Zack find out","find out that","out that they","that they have","they have a","have a lot","a lot to","lot to learn","to learn about","learn about love","about love and","love and life"],"2grams":["John is","is a","a struggling","struggling San","San Francisco","Francisco musician","musician who","who ca","ca n't","n't find","find a","a girlfriend","Zack ,",", his","his roommate","roommate and","and best","best friend","friend ,",", is","is a","a wannabe","wannabe comedian","comedian who","who likes","likes to","to play","play the","the field","When the","the two","two fall","fall for","for a","a pair","pair of","of beautiful","beautiful and","and strong-willed","strong-willed foreigners","foreigners ,",", John","John convinces","convinces Zack","Zack that","that they","they have","have to","to do","do whatever","whatever it","it takes","takes to","to help","help the","the girls","girls stay","stay in","in the","the country","country --","-- even","even if","if it","it means","means getting","getting married","married and","and living","living together","A comedic","comedic clash","clash of","of cultures","cultures transforms","transforms the","the apartment","apartment ,",", and","and John","John and","and Zack","Zack find","find out","out that","that they","they have","have a","a lot","lot to","to learn","learn about","about love","love and","and life"]}

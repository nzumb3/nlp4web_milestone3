Loosely based on Viking legends and the epic poems they left as record, combined with a creative interpretation \"Vikingdom\" is a fantasy, action adventure about a forgotten king, Eirick, who was tasked with the impossible odds to defeat Thor, the God of Thunder. Thor is on a mission to gather the key ancient relics - \"Mjolnir\" - his hammer from Valhalla, \"Necklace of Mary Magdalene\" from Mitgard and the \"Horn\" from Helheim. This needs to be accomplished before the Blood Eclipse, which happens once every 800 years, failing which, the pagan Viking Gods will never be able to rule and conquer mankind ever again.

Eirick, the undead.","genres":["Action"," Fantasy"," Adventure"],"stems":["In","the","midst","of","time","come","the","clang","of","steel","against","steel",",","a","collis","of","myth",",","histori","and","fiction","....","\"","Vikingdom","\"",".","Loos","base","on","Vike","legend","and","the","epic","poem","they","left","as","record",",","combin","with","a","creativ","interpret","\"","Vikingdom","\"","is","a","fantasi",",","action","adventur","about","a","forgotten","king",",","Eirick",",","who","was","task","with","the","imposs","odd","to","defeat","Thor",",","the","God","of","Thunder",".","Thor","is","on","a","mission","to","gather","the","key","ancient","relic","-","\"","Mjolnir","\"","-","his","hammer","from","Valhalla",",","\"","Necklac","of","Mari","Magdalen","\"","from","Mitgard","and","the","\"","Horn","\"","from","Helheim",".","This","need","to","be","accomplish","befor","the","Blood","Eclips",",","which","happen","onc","everi","800","year",",","fail","which",",","the","pagan","Vike","God","will","never","be","abl","to","rule","and","conquer","mankind","ever","again",".","Onli","one","man","can","stop","him","...","Eirick",",","the","undead","."],"lemmas":["in","the","midst","of","time","come","the","clanging","of","steel","against","steel",",","a","collision","of","myth",",","history","and","fiction","....","``","Vikingdom","''",".","loosely","base","on","viking","legend","and","the","epic","poem","they","leave","as","record",",","combine","with","a","creative","interpretation","``","Vikingdom","''","be","a","fantasy",",","action","adventure","about","a","forget","king",",","Eirick",",","who","be","task","with","the","impossible","odds","to","defeat","Thor",",","the","God","of","Thunder",".","Thor","be","on","a","mission","to","gather","the","key","ancient","relic","-","``","Mjolnir","''","-","he","hammer","from","Valhalla",",","``","necklace","of","Mary","Magdalene","''","from","Mitgard","and","the","``","Horn","''","from","Helheim",".","this","need","to","be","accomplish","before","the","Blood","Eclipse",",","which","happen","once","every","800","year",",","fail","which",",","the","pagan","viking","god","will","never","be","able","to","rule","and","conquer","mankind","ever","again",".","only","one","man","can","stop","he","...","Eirick",",","the","undead","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the midst","the midst of","midst of time","of time comes","time comes the","comes the clanging","the clanging of","clanging of steel","of steel against","steel against steel","against steel ,","steel , a",", a collision","a collision of","collision of myth","of myth ,","myth , history",", history and","history and fiction","and fiction ....","fiction .... \"",".... \" Vikingdom","\" Vikingdom \"","Loosely based on","based on Viking","on Viking legends","Viking legends and","legends and the","and the epic","the epic poems","epic poems they","poems they left","they left as","left as record","as record ,","record , combined",", combined with","combined with a","with a creative","a creative interpretation","creative interpretation \"","interpretation \" Vikingdom","\" Vikingdom \"","Vikingdom \" is","\" is a","is a fantasy","a fantasy ,","fantasy , action",", action adventure","action adventure about","adventure about a","about a forgotten","a forgotten king","forgotten king ,","king , Eirick",", Eirick ,","Eirick , who",", who was","who was tasked","was tasked with","tasked with the","with the impossible","the impossible odds","impossible odds to","odds to defeat","to defeat Thor","defeat Thor ,","Thor , the",", the God","the God of","God of Thunder","Thor is on","is on a","on a mission","a mission to","mission to gather","to gather the","gather the key","the key ancient","key ancient relics","ancient relics -","relics - \"","- \" Mjolnir","\" Mjolnir \"","Mjolnir \" -","\" - his","- his hammer","his hammer from","hammer from Valhalla","from Valhalla ,","Valhalla , \"",", \" Necklace","\" Necklace of","Necklace of Mary","of Mary Magdalene","Mary Magdalene \"","Magdalene \" from","\" from Mitgard","from Mitgard and","Mitgard and the","and the \"","the \" Horn","\" Horn \"","Horn \" from","\" from Helheim","This needs to","needs to be","to be accomplished","be accomplished before","accomplished before the","before the Blood","the Blood Eclipse","Blood Eclipse ,","Eclipse , which",", which happens","which happens once","happens once every","once every 800","every 800 years","800 years ,","years , failing",", failing which","failing which ,","which , the",", the pagan","the pagan Viking","pagan Viking Gods","Viking Gods will","Gods will never","will never be","never be able","be able to","able to rule","to rule and","rule and conquer","and conquer mankind","conquer mankind ever","mankind ever again","Only one man","one man can","man can stop","can stop him","stop him ...","him ...

{"title":"Crossing the Line","plot":"The story of the activist Hanna Ziadeh and his struggle for human rights in the Middle East - as it unfolds in the streets of Cairo, Beirut and Aleppo, - while the Arab spring turns to fall. The story of Hanna Ziadeh Hanna was born in Beirut; he is a PhD fellow at the Danish Institute for Human Rights and specialized in the modern history of the Arab world. He is half Lebanese, half Palestinian, atheist, but of Christian descent, and homosexual. He knows everything about belonging to a minority, about being an outsider even among outsiders. His inconformity shines through when you meet him, as his engagement, caring and loving appearance overwhelms you. Since his escape from Lebanon in 1986 he has been waiting for a democratic alternative to the Arab dictatorships.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","stori","of","the","activist","Hanna","Ziadeh","and","his","struggl","for","human","right","in","the","Middl","East","-","as","it","unfold","in","the","street","of","Cairo",",","Beirut","and","Aleppo",",","-","while","the","Arab","spring","turn","to","fall",".","The","stori","of","Hanna","Ziadeh","Hanna","was","born","in","Beirut",";","he","is","a","PhD","fellow","at","the","Danish","Institut","for","Human","Right","and","special","in","the","modern","histori","of","the","Arab","world",".","He","is","half","Lebanes",",","half","Palestinian",",","atheist",",","but","of","Christian","descent",",","and","homosexu",".","He","know","everyth","about","belong","to","a","minor",",","about","be","an","outsid","even","among","outsid",".","His","inconform","shine","through","when","you","meet","him",",","as","his","engag",",","care","and","love","appear","overwhelm","you",".","Sinc","his","escap","from","Lebanon","in","1986","he","has","been","wait","for","a","democrat","altern","to","the","Arab","dictatorship","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","the","activist","Hanna","Ziadeh","and","he","struggle","for","human","rights","in","the","Middle","East","-","as","it","unfold","in","the","street","of","Cairo",",","Beirut","and","Aleppo",",","-","while","the","Arab","spring","turn","to","fall",".","the","story","of","Hanna","Ziadeh","Hanna","be","bear","in","Beirut",";","he","be","a","phd","fellow","at","the","danish","Institute","for","Human","Rights","and","specialize","in","the","modern","history","of","the","Arab","world",".","he","be","half","lebanese",",","half","palestinian",",","atheist",",","but","of","christian","descent",",","and","homosexual",".","he","know","everything","about","belong","to","a","minority",",","about","be","a","outsider","even","among","outsider",".","he","inconformity","shine","through","when","you","meet","he",",","as","he","engagement",",","caring","and","loving","appearance","overwhelm","you",".","since","he","escape","from","Lebanon","in","1986","he","have","be","wait","for","a","democratic","alternative","to","the","Arab","dictatorship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The story of","story of the","of the activist","the activist Hanna","activist Hanna Ziadeh","Hanna Ziadeh and","Ziadeh and his","and his struggle","his struggle for","struggle for human","for human rights","human rights in","rights in the","in the Middle","the Middle East","Middle East -","East - as","- as it","as it unfolds","it unfolds in","unfolds in the","in the streets","the streets of","streets of Cairo","of Cairo ,","Cairo , Beirut",", Beirut and","Beirut and Aleppo","and Aleppo ,","Aleppo , -",", - while","- while the","while the Arab","the Arab spring","Arab spring turns","spring turns to","turns to fall","The story of","story of Hanna","of Hanna Ziadeh","Hanna Ziadeh Hanna","Ziadeh Hanna was","Hanna was born","was born in","born in Beirut","in Beirut ;","Beirut ;

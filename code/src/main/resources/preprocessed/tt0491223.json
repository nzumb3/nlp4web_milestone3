{"title":"A Very Serious Person","plot":"Jan, an itinerant male nurse from Denmark, takes a new job with Mrs. A, a terminally ill Manhattan woman raising her parentless thirteen-year-old grandson, Gil. Spending the summer by the shore, the emotionally reserved Jan finds himself oddly cast as a mentor to Gil in having to prepare the sensitive boy for life with his cousins in Florida after his grandmother's death. A deep friendship grows between these two solitary people. By the end of the summer, Gil has developed a new maturity and independence, while the enigmatic Jan has revealed his own vulnerability.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Jan",",","an","itiner","male","nurs","from","Denmark",",","take","a","new","job","with","Mrs.","A",",","a","termin","ill","Manhattan","woman","rais","her","parentless","thirteen-year-old","grandson",",","Gil",".","Spend","the","summer","by","the","shore",",","the","emot","reserv","Jan","find","himself","odd","cast","as","a","mentor","to","Gil","in","have","to","prepar","the","sensit","boy","for","life","with","his","cousin","in","Florida","after","his","grandmoth","'s","death",".","A","deep","friendship","grow","between","these","two","solitari","peopl",".","By","the","end","of","the","summer",",","Gil","has","develop","a","new","matur","and","independ",",","while","the","enigmat","Jan","has","reveal","his","own","vulner","."],"lemmas":["Jan",",","a","itinerant","male","nurse","from","Denmark",",","take","a","new","job","with","Mrs.","A",",","a","terminally","ill","Manhattan","woman","raise","she","parentless","thirteen-year-old","grandson",",","Gil",".","spend","the","summer","by","the","shore",",","the","emotionally","reserve","Jan","find","himself","oddly","cast","as","a","mentor","to","Gil","in","have","to","prepare","the","sensitive","boy","for","life","with","he","cousin","in","Florida","after","he","grandmother","'s","death",".","a","deep","friendship","grow","between","these","two","solitary","people",".","by","the","end","of","the","summer",",","Gil","have","develop","a","new","maturity","and","independence",",","while","the","enigmatic","Jan","have","reveal","he","own","vulnerability","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jan , an",", an itinerant","an itinerant male","itinerant male nurse","male nurse from","nurse from Denmark","from Denmark ,","Denmark , takes",", takes a","takes a new","a new job","new job with","job with Mrs.","with Mrs. A","Mrs. A ,","A , a",", a terminally","a terminally ill","terminally ill Manhattan","ill Manhattan woman","Manhattan woman raising","woman raising her","raising her parentless","her parentless thirteen-year-old","parentless thirteen-year-old grandson","thirteen-year-old grandson ,","grandson , Gil","Spending the summer","the summer by","summer by the","by the shore","the shore ,","shore , the",", the emotionally","the emotionally reserved","emotionally reserved Jan","reserved Jan finds","Jan finds himself","finds himself oddly","himself oddly cast","oddly cast as","cast as a","as a mentor","a mentor to","mentor to Gil","to Gil in","Gil in having","in having to","having to prepare","to prepare the","prepare the sensitive","the sensitive boy","sensitive boy for","boy for life","for life with","life with his","with his cousins","his cousins in","cousins in Florida","in Florida after","Florida after his","after his grandmother","his grandmother 's","grandmother 's death","A deep friendship","deep friendship grows","friendship grows between","grows between these","between these two","these two solitary","two solitary people","By the end","the end of","end of the","of the summer","the summer ,","summer , Gil",", Gil has","Gil has developed","has developed a","developed a new","a new maturity","new maturity and","maturity and independence","and independence ,","independence , while",", while the","while the enigmatic","the enigmatic Jan","enigmatic Jan has","Jan has revealed","has revealed his","revealed his own","his own vulnerability"],"2grams":["Jan ,",", an","an itinerant","itinerant male","male nurse","nurse from","from Denmark","Denmark ,",", takes","takes a","a new","new job","job with","with Mrs.","Mrs. A","A ,",", a","a terminally","terminally ill","ill Manhattan","Manhattan woman","woman raising","raising her","her parentless","parentless thirteen-year-old","thirteen-year-old grandson","grandson ,",", Gil","Spending the","the summer","summer by","by the","the shore","shore ,",", the","the emotionally","emotionally reserved","reserved Jan","Jan finds","finds himself","himself oddly","oddly cast","cast as","as a","a mentor","mentor to","to Gil","Gil in","in having","having to","to prepare","prepare the","the sensitive","sensitive boy","boy for","for life","life with","with his","his cousins","cousins in","in Florida","Florida after","after his","his grandmother","grandmother 's","'s death","A deep","deep friendship","friendship grows","grows between","between these","these two","two solitary","solitary people","By the","the end","end of","of the","the summer","summer ,",", Gil","Gil has","has developed","developed a","a new","new maturity","maturity and","and independence","independence ,",", while","while the","the enigmatic","enigmatic Jan","Jan has","has revealed","revealed his","his own","own vulnerability"]}

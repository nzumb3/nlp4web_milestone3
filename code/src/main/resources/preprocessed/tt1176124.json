{"title":"NY's Dirty Laundry","plot":"In the weeks after 9/11, racial paradigms are shifted and hidden prejudices are revealed in this heated and often hilarious exchange between the members of two immigrant families (one Afro-Caribbean and the other Arab-Muslim) who clash in a crowded Brooklyn Laundromat and in an airless NYC taxicab. With mistrust already heightened, quarters are exchanged for political conversation as these \"new\" New Yorkers debate what it now means to be an American.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","the","week","after","9/11",",","racial","paradigm","are","shift","and","hidden","prejudic","are","reveal","in","this","heat","and","often","hilari","exchang","between","the","member","of","two","immigr","famili","(","one","Afro-Caribbean","and","the","other","Arab-Muslim",")","who","clash","in","a","crowd","Brooklyn","Laundromat","and","in","an","airless","NYC","taxicab",".","With","mistrust","alreadi","heighten",",","quarter","are","exchang","for","polit","convers","as","these","\"","new","\"","New","Yorker","debat","what","it","now","mean","to","be","an","American","."],"lemmas":["in","the","week","after","9/11",",","racial","paradigm","be","shift","and","hide","prejudice","be","reveal","in","this","heated","and","often","hilarious","exchange","between","the","member","of","two","immigrant","family","-lrb-","one","afro-caribbean","and","the","other","Arab-Muslim","-rrb-","who","clash","in","a","crowded","Brooklyn","Laundromat","and","in","a","airless","NYC","taxicab",".","with","mistrust","already","heighten",",","quarter","be","exchange","for","political","conversation","as","these","``","new","''","New","Yorkers","debate","what","it","now","mean","to","be","a","American","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the weeks","the weeks after","weeks after 9/11","after 9/11 ,","9/11 , racial",", racial paradigms","racial paradigms are","paradigms are shifted","are shifted and","shifted and hidden","and hidden prejudices","hidden prejudices are","prejudices are revealed","are revealed in","revealed in this","in this heated","this heated and","heated and often","and often hilarious","often hilarious exchange","hilarious exchange between","exchange between the","between the members","the members of","members of two","of two immigrant","two immigrant families","immigrant families (","families ( one","( one Afro-Caribbean","one Afro-Caribbean and","Afro-Caribbean and the","and the other","the other Arab-Muslim","other Arab-Muslim )","Arab-Muslim ) who",") who clash","who clash in","clash in a","in a crowded","a crowded Brooklyn","crowded Brooklyn Laundromat","Brooklyn Laundromat and","Laundromat and in","and in an","in an airless","an airless NYC","airless NYC taxicab","With mistrust already","mistrust already heightened","already heightened ,","heightened , quarters",", quarters are","quarters are exchanged","are exchanged for","exchanged for political","for political conversation","political conversation as","conversation as these","as these \"","these \" new","\" new \"","new \" New","\" New Yorkers","New Yorkers debate","Yorkers debate what","debate what it","what it now","it now means","now means to","means to be","to be an","be an American"],"2grams":["In the","the weeks","weeks after","after 9/11","9/11 ,",", racial","racial paradigms","paradigms are","are shifted","shifted and","and hidden","hidden prejudices","prejudices are","are revealed","revealed in","in this","this heated","heated and","and often","often hilarious","hilarious exchange","exchange between","between the","the members","members of","of two","two immigrant","immigrant families","families (","( one","one Afro-Caribbean","Afro-Caribbean and","and the","the other","other Arab-Muslim","Arab-Muslim )",") who","who clash","clash in","in a","a crowded","crowded Brooklyn","Brooklyn Laundromat","Laundromat and","and in","in an","an airless","airless NYC","NYC taxicab","With mistrust","mistrust already","already heightened","heightened ,",", quarters","quarters are","are exchanged","exchanged for","for political","political conversation","conversation as","as these","these \"","\" new","new \"","\" New","New Yorkers","Yorkers debate","debate what","what it","it now","now means","means to","to be","be an","an American"]}

{"title":"Gogol. Nachalo","plot":"The year 1829. Nikolay Gogol, a young Third Section clerk, is desperate: his own books seem shallow and mediocre, so he keeps buying entire print runs just to burn them all. He is suffering from violent epileptic seizures and struggles to keep on working. Investigator Yakov Guro accidentally witnesses one such fit and realizes that Gogol's visions contain clues that could help solve actual crimes. Together, Gogol and Guro take on a particularly weird and baffling case that brings them to a small village of Dikanka, where everyone has a huge secret to hide.","genres":["Adventure"," Horror"," Crime"],"stems":["The","year","1829",".","Nikolay","Gogol",",","a","young","Third","Section","clerk",",","is","desper",":","his","own","book","seem","shallow","and","mediocr",",","so","he","keep","buy","entir","print","run","just","to","burn","them","all",".","He","is","suffer","from","violent","epilept","seizur","and","struggl","to","keep","on","work",".","Investig","Yakov","Guro","accident","wit","one","such","fit","and","realiz","that","Gogol","'s","vision","contain","clue","that","could","help","solv","actual","crime",".","Togeth",",","Gogol","and","Guro","take","on","a","particular","weird","and","baffl","case","that","bring","them","to","a","small","villag","of","Dikanka",",","where","everyon","has","a","huge","secret","to","hide","."],"lemmas":["the","year","1829",".","Nikolay","Gogol",",","a","young","Third","Section","clerk",",","be","desperate",":","he","own","book","seem","shallow","and","mediocre",",","so","he","keep","buy","entire","print","run","just","to","burn","they","all",".","he","be","suffer","from","violent","epileptic","seizure","and","struggle","to","keep","on","working",".","Investigator","Yakov","Guro","accidentally","witness","one","such","fit","and","realize","that","Gogol","'s","vision","contain","clue","that","could","help","solve","actual","crime",".","together",",","Gogol","and","Guro","take","on","a","particularly","weird","and","baffling","case","that","bring","they","to","a","small","village","of","Dikanka",",","where","everyone","have","a","huge","secret","to","hide","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The year 1829","Nikolay Gogol ,","Gogol , a",", a young","a young Third","young Third Section","Third Section clerk","Section clerk ,","clerk , is",", is desperate","is desperate :","desperate : his",": his own","his own books","own books seem","books seem shallow","seem shallow and","shallow and mediocre","and mediocre ,","mediocre , so",", so he","so he keeps","he keeps buying","keeps buying entire","buying entire print","entire print runs","print runs just","runs just to","just to burn","to burn them","burn them all","He is suffering","is suffering from","suffering from violent","from violent epileptic","violent epileptic seizures","epileptic seizures and","seizures and struggles","and struggles to","struggles to keep","to keep on","keep on working","Investigator Yakov Guro","Yakov Guro accidentally","Guro accidentally witnesses","accidentally witnesses one","witnesses one such","one such fit","such fit and","fit and realizes","and realizes that","realizes that Gogol","that Gogol 's","Gogol 's visions","'s visions contain","visions contain clues","contain clues that","clues that could","that could help","could help solve","help solve actual","solve actual crimes","Together , Gogol",", Gogol and","Gogol and Guro","and Guro take","Guro take on","take on a","on a particularly","a particularly weird","particularly weird and","weird and baffling","and baffling case","baffling case that","case that brings","that brings them","brings them to","them to a","to a small","a small village","small village of","village of Dikanka","of Dikanka ,","Dikanka , where",", where everyone","where everyone has","everyone has a","has a huge","a huge secret","huge secret to","secret to hide"],"2grams":["The year","year 1829","Nikolay Gogol","Gogol ,",", a","a young","young Third","Third Section","Section clerk","clerk ,",", is","is desperate","desperate :",": his","his own","own books","books seem","seem shallow","shallow and","and mediocre","mediocre ,",", so","so he","he keeps","keeps buying","buying entire","entire print","print runs","runs just","just to","to burn","burn them","them all","He is","is suffering","suffering from","from violent","violent epileptic","epileptic seizures","seizures and","and struggles","struggles to","to keep","keep on","on working","Investigator Yakov","Yakov Guro","Guro accidentally","accidentally witnesses","witnesses one","one such","such fit","fit and","and realizes","realizes that","that Gogol","Gogol 's","'s visions","visions contain","contain clues","clues that","that could","could help","help solve","solve actual","actual crimes","Together ,",", Gogol","Gogol and","and Guro","Guro take","take on","on a","a particularly","particularly weird","weird and","and baffling","baffling case","case that","that brings","brings them","them to","to a","a small","small village","village of","of Dikanka","Dikanka ,",", where","where everyone","everyone has","has a","a huge","huge secret","secret to","to hide"]}

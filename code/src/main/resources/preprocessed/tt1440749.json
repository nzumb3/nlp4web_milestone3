{"title":"Laughology","plot":"Laughter. Plato hated it, the Bible discouraged it, scientists avoided it, psychologists once thought if it didn't kill you, it would drive you insane. With his trademark blend of humor and serious investigation, Albert Nerenberg drops in on cutting edge neuroscientists and cardiologists to Christian holy laughter groups in search of its origin and meaning. Ultimately he finds the man with the most contagious laugh in the world. Laughology wittily weaves research, archival stills, television clips, and a hilarious send-up of the use of re-enactments in docs. Nerenberg's quest to rediscover his own laugh has produced a film that will undoubtedly play a major role in a 'global laughter trend at a crucial time when the world needs a good laugh.'","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Laughter",".","Plato","hate","it",",","the","Bibl","discourag","it",",","scientist","avoid","it",",","psychologist","onc","thought","if","it","did","n't","kill","you",",","it","would","drive","you","insan",".","With","his","trademark","blend","of","humor","and","serious","investig",",","Albert","Nerenberg","drop","in","on","cut","edg","neuroscientist","and","cardiologist","to","Christian","holi","laughter","group","in","search","of","it","origin","and","mean",".","Ultimat","he","find","the","man","with","the","most","contagi","laugh","in","the","world",".","Laugholog","wittili","weav","research",",","archiv","still",",","televis","clip",",","and","a","hilari","send-up","of","the","use","of","re-enact","in","doc",".","Nerenberg","'s","quest","to","rediscov","his","own","laugh","has","produc","a","film","that","will","undoubt","play","a","major","role","in","a","'","global","laughter","trend","at","a","crucial","time","when","the","world","need","a","good","laugh",".","'"],"lemmas":["laughter",".","Plato","hate","it",",","the","Bible","discourage","it",",","scientist","avoid","it",",","psychologist","once","think","if","it","do","not","kill","you",",","it","would","drive","you","insane",".","with","he","trademark","blend","of","humor","and","serious","investigation",",","Albert","Nerenberg","drop","in","on","cut","edge","neuroscientist","and","cardiologist","to","Christian","holy","laughter","group","in","search","of","its","origin","and","meaning",".","ultimately","he","find","the","man","with","the","most","contagious","laugh","in","the","world",".","Laughology","wittily","weave","research",",","archival","still",",","television","clip",",","and","a","hilarious","send-up","of","the","use","of","re-enactment","in","doc",".","Nerenberg","'s","quest","to","rediscover","he","own","laugh","have","produce","a","film","that","will","undoubtedly","play","a","major","role","in","a","'","global","laughter","trend","at","a","crucial","time","when","the","world","need","a","good","laugh",".","'"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Plato hated it","hated it ,","it , the",", the Bible","the Bible discouraged","Bible discouraged it","discouraged it ,","it , scientists",", scientists avoided","scientists avoided it","avoided it ,","it , psychologists",", psychologists once","psychologists once thought","once thought if","thought if it","if it did","it did n't","did n't kill","n't kill you","kill you ,","you , it",", it would","it would drive","would drive you","drive you insane","With his trademark","his trademark blend","trademark blend of","blend of humor","of humor and","humor and serious","and serious investigation","serious investigation ,","investigation , Albert",", Albert Nerenberg","Albert Nerenberg drops","Nerenberg drops in","drops in on","in on cutting","on cutting edge","cutting edge neuroscientists","edge neuroscientists and","neuroscientists and cardiologists","and cardiologists to","cardiologists to Christian","to Christian holy","Christian holy laughter","holy laughter groups","laughter groups in","groups in search","in search of","search of its","of its origin","its origin and","origin and meaning","Ultimately he finds","he finds the","finds the man","the man with","man with the","with the most","the most contagious","most contagious laugh","contagious laugh in","laugh in the","in the world","Laughology wittily weaves","wittily weaves research","weaves research ,","research , archival",", archival stills","archival stills ,","stills , television",", television clips","television clips ,","clips , and",", and a","and a hilarious","a hilarious send-up","hilarious send-up of","send-up of the","of the use","the use of","use of re-enactments","of re-enactments in","re-enactments in docs","Nerenberg 's quest","'s quest to","quest to rediscover","to rediscover his","rediscover his own","his own laugh","own laugh has","laugh has produced","has produced a","produced a film","a film that","film that will","that will undoubtedly","will undoubtedly play","undoubtedly play a","play a major","a major role","major role in","role in a","in a '","a ' global","' global laughter","global laughter trend","laughter trend at","trend at a","at a crucial","a crucial time","crucial time when","time when the","when the world","the world needs","world needs a","needs a good","a good laugh","good laugh .","laugh .

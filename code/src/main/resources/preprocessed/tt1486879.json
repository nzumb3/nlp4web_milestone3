{"title":"Yindabad","plot":"Sardar Sarovar, an impressive cement wall of 121 meters in height, stops river Narmada's flow. It is part of the faraonic \"Narmada Valley Development Project\", that plans the construction of more than 3000 dams, some of them of huge dimensions. Over two and a half million people are affected, most of them adivasis (indigenous) who are losing their houses and ways of life. For twenty years they have been struggling against the interests of the government and the big corporations. Women have gained consciousness of the dimensions of the problem and have become the main role in this unequal fight. Is this the single way of development? The situation in the Narmada Valley is an example of the 21th century's biggest war: water control, natural resources control.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sardar","Sarovar",",","an","impress","cement","wall","of","121","meter","in","height",",","stop","river","Narmada","'s","flow",".","It","is","part","of","the","faraon","\"","Narmada","Valley","Develop","Project","\"",",","that","plan","the","construct","of","more","than","3000","dam",",","some","of","them","of","huge","dimens",".","Over","two","and","a","half","million","peopl","are","affect",",","most","of","them","adivasi","(","indigen",")","who","are","lose","their","hous","and","way","of","life",".","For","twenti","year","they","have","been","struggl","against","the","interest","of","the","govern","and","the","big","corpor",".","Women","have","gain","conscious","of","the","dimens","of","the","problem","and","have","becom","the","main","role","in","this","unequ","fight",".","Is","this","the","singl","way","of","develop","?","The","situat","in","the","Narmada","Valley","is","an","exampl","of","the","21th","centuri","'s","biggest","war",":","water","control",",","natur","resourc","control","."],"lemmas":["Sardar","Sarovar",",","a","impressive","cement","wall","of","121","meter","in","height",",","stop","river","Narmada","'s","flow",".","it","be","part","of","the","faraonic","``","Narmada","Valley","Development","Project","''",",","that","plan","the","construction","of","more","than","3000","dam",",","some","of","they","of","huge","dimension",".","over","two","and","a","half","million","people","be","affect",",","most","of","they","adivasis","-lrb-","indigenous","-rrb-","who","be","lose","they","house","and","way","of","life",".","for","twenty","year","they","have","be","struggle","against","the","interest","of","the","government","and","the","big","corporation",".","woman","have","gain","consciousness","of","the","dimension","of","the","problem","and","have","become","the","main","role","in","this","unequal","fight",".","be","this","the","single","way","of","development","?","the","situation","in","the","Narmada","Valley","be","a","example","of","the","21th","century","'s","biggest","war",":","water","control",",","natural","resource","control","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Sardar

{"title":"In Love with Alma Cogan","plot":"In addition to being a mainstay of the local lifeboat crew Norman has been the manager of the little pier theatre in his home seaside town for forty years ever since he was a youngster. In those days the venue played host to popular singers like the flamboyant Alma Cogan, meeting with whom Norman still fondly remembers. Now however the council, who own the pier, want to oust Norman in favour of younger hipper management and Norman plans to fight. Norman has long been supported by his loyal assistant Sandra, a would-be singer, but she persuades him that perhaps it is time for him to go - and so he does, this time supporting Sandra as she begins a career as a singer herself.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["In","addit","to","be","a","mainstay","of","the","local","lifeboat","crew","Norman","has","been","the","manag","of","the","littl","pier","theatr","in","his","home","seasid","town","for","forti","year","ever","sinc","he","was","a","youngster",".","In","those","day","the","venu","play","host","to","popular","singer","like","the","flamboy","Alma","Cogan",",","meet","with","whom","Norman","still","fond","rememb",".","Now","howev","the","council",",","who","own","the","pier",",","want","to","oust","Norman","in","favour","of","younger","hipper","manag","and","Norman","plan","to","fight",".","Norman","has","long","been","support","by","his","loyal","assist","Sandra",",","a","would-b","singer",",","but","she","persuad","him","that","perhap","it","is","time","for","him","to","go","-","and","so","he","doe",",","this","time","support","Sandra","as","she","begin","a","career","as","a","singer","herself","."],"lemmas":["in","addition","to","be","a","mainstay","of","the","local","lifeboat","crew","Norman","have","be","the","manager","of","the","little","pier","theatre","in","he","home","seaside","town","for","forty","year","ever","since","he","be","a","youngster",".","in","those","day","the","venue","play","host","to","popular","singer","like","the","flamboyant","Alma","Cogan",",","meet","with","whom","Norman","still","fondly","remember",".","now","however","the","council",",","who","own","the","pier",",","want","to","oust","Norman","in","favour","of","younger","hipper","management","and","Norman","plan","to","fight",".","Norman","have","long","be","support","by","he","loyal","assistant","Sandra",",","a","would-be","singer",",","but","she","persuade","he","that","perhaps","it","be","time","for","he","to","go","-","and","so","he","do",",","this","time","support","Sandra","as","she","begin","a","career","as","a","singer","herself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In addition to","addition to being","to being a","being a mainstay","a mainstay of","mainstay of the","of the local","the local lifeboat","local lifeboat crew","lifeboat crew Norman","crew Norman has","Norman has been","has been the","been the manager","the manager of","manager of the","of the little","the little pier","little pier theatre","pier theatre in","theatre in his","in his home","his home seaside","home seaside town","seaside town for","town for forty","for forty years","forty years ever","years ever since","ever since he","since he was","he was a","was a youngster","In those days","those days the","days the venue","the venue played","venue played host","played host to","host to popular","to popular singers","popular singers like","singers like the","like the flamboyant","the flamboyant Alma","flamboyant Alma Cogan","Alma Cogan ,","Cogan , meeting",", meeting with","meeting with whom","with whom Norman","whom Norman still","Norman still fondly","still fondly remembers","Now however the","however the council","the council ,","council , who",", who own","who own the","own the pier","the pier ,","pier , want",", want to","want to oust","to oust Norman","oust Norman in","Norman in favour","in favour of","favour of younger","of younger hipper","younger hipper management","hipper management and","management and Norman","and Norman plans","Norman plans to","plans to fight","Norman has long","has long been","long been supported","been supported by","supported by his","by his loyal","his loyal assistant","loyal assistant Sandra","assistant Sandra ,","Sandra , a",", a would-be","a would-be singer","would-be singer ,","singer , but",", but she","but she persuades","she persuades him","persuades him that","him that perhaps","that perhaps it","perhaps it is","it is time","is time for","time for him","for him to","him to go","to go -","go -

{"title":"Once Upon a Time in the West Bank","plot":"Inspired by his Grandmother's work as a Christian peace activist in Occupied Palestine, Director Nick Gibb travels to Hebron, in The West Bank, to film her work and meet the extended network of peace activists - Muslims, Jews, and Christians - that she works alongside. 'Once Upon A Time In The West Bank' is an evocative, dramatic look at inter-faith co-operation in the quest for a lasting peace in the Land of Abraham, and at the people who see peacemakers as anarchists and traitors, and are willing to risk everything to prevent that peace.","genres":["Documentary"," War"],"stems":["Inspire","by","his","Grandmoth","'s","work","as","a","Christian","peac","activist","in","Occupi","Palestin",",","Director","Nick","Gibb","travel","to","Hebron",",","in","The","West","Bank",",","to","film","her","work","and","meet","the","extend","network","of","peac","activist","-","Muslim",",","Jew",",","and","Christian","-","that","she","work","alongsid",".","'","Once","Upon","A","Time","In","The","West","Bank","'","is","an","evoc",",","dramat","look","at","inter-faith","co-oper","in","the","quest","for","a","last","peac","in","the","Land","of","Abraham",",","and","at","the","peopl","who","see","peacemak","as","anarchist","and","traitor",",","and","are","will","to","risk","everyth","to","prevent","that","peac","."],"lemmas":["inspire","by","he","Grandmother","'s","work","as","a","christian","peace","activist","in","Occupied","Palestine",",","Director","Nick","Gibb","travel","to","Hebron",",","in","the","West","Bank",",","to","film","she","work","and","meet","the","extended","network","of","peace","activist","-","Muslims",",","Jews",",","and","christian","-","that","she","work","alongside",".","'","once","upon","a","time","in","the","West","Bank","'","be","a","evocative",",","dramatic","look","at","inter-faith","co-operation","in","the","quest","for","a","lasting","peace","in","the","Land","of","Abraham",",","and","at","the","people","who","see","peacemaker","as","anarchist","and","traitor",",","and","be","willing","to","risk","everything","to","prevent","that","peace","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Inspired by his","by his Grandmother","his Grandmother 's","Grandmother 's work","'s work as","work as a","as a Christian","a Christian peace","Christian peace activist","peace activist in","activist in Occupied","in Occupied Palestine","Occupied Palestine ,","Palestine , Director",", Director Nick","Director Nick Gibb","Nick Gibb travels","Gibb travels to","travels to Hebron","to Hebron ,","Hebron , in",", in The","in The West","The West Bank","West Bank ,","Bank , to",", to film","to film her","film her work","her work and","work and meet","and meet the","meet the extended","the extended network","extended network of","network of peace","of peace activists","peace activists -","activists - Muslims","- Muslims ,","Muslims , Jews",", Jews ,","Jews , and",", and Christians","and Christians -","Christians - that","- that she","that she works","she works alongside","works alongside .","alongside .

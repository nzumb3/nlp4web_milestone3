{"title":"Kate Can't Swim","plot":"Kate is almost thirty, almost engaged, almost settled in her career as a writer-but is deeply dissatisfied. When her best friend Em returns from a year in Paris, with a surprising new lover in tow, everything in Kate's world begins to slowly unravel. As Kate and her boyfriend Pete leave the bustle of Brooklyn to join Em and her new lover Nick upstate, it promises to be a peaceful weekend for all of them. It's Kate's chance to reconnect with Em, the only one who truly understands her, and to take a step back from life as she knows it. But as the weekend progresses, it becomes clear that Em doesn't need her anymore, and Kate has to face her dissatisfaction alone, which leads her down an experimental - and destructive - path.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Kate","is","almost","thirti",",","almost","engag",",","almost","settl","in","her","career","as","a","writer-but","is","deepli","dissatisfi",".","When","her","best","friend","Em","return","from","a","year","in","Pari",",","with","a","surpris","new","lover","in","tow",",","everyth","in","Kate","'s","world","begin","to","slowli","unravel",".","As","Kate","and","her","boyfriend","Pete","leav","the","bustl","of","Brooklyn","to","join","Em","and","her","new","lover","Nick","upstat",",","it","promis","to","be","a","peac","weekend","for","all","of","them",".","It","'s","Kate","'s","chanc","to","reconnect","with","Em",",","the","onli","one","who","truli","understand","her",",","and","to","take","a","step","back","from","life","as","she","know","it",".","But","as","the","weekend","progress",",","it","becom","clear","that","Em","doe","n't","need","her","anymor",",","and","Kate","has","to","face","her","dissatisfact","alon",",","which","lead","her","down","an","experiment","-","and","destruct","-","path","."],"lemmas":["Kate","be","almost","thirty",",","almost","engage",",","almost","settle","in","she","career","as","a","writer-but","be","deeply","dissatisfied",".","when","she","best","friend","em","return","from","a","year","in","Paris",",","with","a","surprising","new","lover","in","tow",",","everything","in","Kate","'s","world","begin","to","slowly","unravel",".","as","Kate","and","she","boyfriend","Pete","leave","the","bustle","of","Brooklyn","to","join","em","and","she","new","lover","Nick","upstate",",","it","promise","to","be","a","peaceful","weekend","for","all","of","they",".","it","be","Kate","'s","chance","to","reconnect","with","em",",","the","only","one","who","truly","understand","she",",","and","to","take","a","step","back","from","life","as","she","know","it",".","but","as","the","weekend","progress",",","it","become","clear","that","em","do","not","need","she","anymore",",","and","Kate","have","to","face","she","dissatisfaction","alone",",","which","lead","she","down","a","experimental","-","and","destructive","-","path","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Kate is almost","is almost thirty","almost thirty ,","thirty , almost",", almost engaged","almost engaged ,","engaged , almost",", almost settled","almost settled in","settled in her","in her career","her career as","career as a","as a writer-but","a writer-but is","writer-but is deeply","is deeply dissatisfied","When her best","her best friend","best friend Em","friend Em returns","Em returns from","returns from a","from a year","a year in","year in Paris","in Paris ,","Paris , with",", with a","with a surprising","a surprising new","surprising new lover","new lover in","lover in tow","in tow ,","tow , everything",", everything in","everything in Kate","in Kate 's","Kate 's world","'s world begins","world begins to","begins to slowly","to slowly unravel","As Kate and","Kate and her","and her boyfriend","her boyfriend Pete","boyfriend Pete leave","Pete leave the","leave the bustle","the bustle of","bustle of Brooklyn","of Brooklyn to","Brooklyn to join","to join Em","join Em and","Em and her","and her new","her new lover","new lover Nick","lover Nick upstate","Nick upstate ,","upstate , it",", it promises","it promises to","promises to be","to be a","be a peaceful","a peaceful weekend","peaceful weekend for","weekend for all","for all of","all of them","It 's Kate","'s Kate 's","Kate 's chance","'s chance to","chance to reconnect","to reconnect with","reconnect with Em","with Em ,","Em , the",", the only","the only one","only one who","one who truly","who truly understands","truly understands her","understands her ,","her , and",", and to","and to take","to take a","take a step","a step back","step back from","back from life","from life as","life as she","as she knows","she knows it","But as the","as the weekend","the weekend progresses","weekend progresses ,","progresses , it",", it becomes","it becomes clear","becomes clear that","clear that Em","that Em does","Em does n't","does n't need","n't need her","need her anymore","her anymore ,","anymore , and",", and Kate","and Kate has","Kate has to","has to face","to face her","face her dissatisfaction","her dissatisfaction alone","dissatisfaction alone ,","alone , which",", which leads","which leads her","leads her down","her down an","down an experimental","an experimental -","experimental -

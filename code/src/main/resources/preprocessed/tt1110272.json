{"title":"The King of Ping Pong","plot":"Rille is coming of age in a Swedish town; he's chubby, stoic, and deliberate. His younger brother Erik is small, impulsive. They're yin and yang. Their parents are separated, their father a well-meaning alcoholic whom they see on occasion. Rille takes pride in being the keeper of the ping-pong equipment at a youth center, where he's the best player; Erik hangs out with guys who tease Rille, spreading rumors about who his biological father might really be. Their mom, overweight and dependent on Rille, has a frequent visitor, Gunnar, a balding small businessman. Things come to a head when Rille overhears his mother and Gunnar talking and insists on knowing the truth.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Rill","is","come","of","age","in","a","Swedish","town",";","he","'s","chubbi",",","stoic",",","and","deliber",".","His","younger","brother","Erik","is","small",",","impuls",".","They","re","yin","and","yang",".","Their","parent","are","separ",",","their","father","a","well-mean","alcohol","whom","they","see","on","occas",".","Rill","take","pride","in","be","the","keeper","of","the","ping-pong","equip","at","a","youth","center",",","where","he","'s","the","best","player",";","Erik","hang","out","with","guy","who","teas","Rill",",","spread","rumor","about","who","his","biolog","father","might","realli","be",".","Their","mom",",","overweight","and","depend","on","Rill",",","has","a","frequent","visitor",",","Gunnar",",","a","bald","small","businessman",".","Thing","come","to","a","head","when","Rill","overhear","his","mother","and","Gunnar","talk","and","insist","on","know","the","truth","."],"lemmas":["Rille","be","come","of","age","in","a","swedish","town",";","he","be","chubby",",","stoic",",","and","deliberate",".","he","younger","brother","Erik","be","small",",","impulsive",".","they","be","yin","and","yang",".","they","parent","be","separate",",","they","father","a","well-meaning","alcoholic","whom","they","see","on","occasion",".","Rille","take","pride","in","be","the","keeper","of","the","ping-pong","equipment","at","a","youth","center",",","where","he","be","the","best","player",";","Erik","hang","out","with","guy","who","tease","Rille",",","spread","rumor","about","who","he","biological","father","might","really","be",".","they","mom",",","overweight","and","dependent","on","Rille",",","have","a","frequent","visitor",",","Gunnar",",","a","balding","small","businessman",".","thing","come","to","a","head","when","Rille","overhear","he","mother","and","gunnar","talking","and","insist","on","know","the","truth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Rille is coming","is coming of","coming of age","of age in","age in a","in a Swedish","a Swedish town","Swedish town ;","town ;

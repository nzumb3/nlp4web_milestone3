{"title":"Columbus: Oil Rigs & American Dreams","plot":"The quirky tale of a sleepy little town high up on the North Dakota prairie. With a rapidly shrinking, elderly population in the low 100's, Columbus was once a booming community. But these days the tiny town's liveliest parties are funeral processions. Columbus' youth and small hold farmers have fled to the bright city lights. This has resulted in a quiet disappearance, a withering away of the landscape until all that is left are vast swaths of lonely countryside peppered with abandoned farms and ghosts of the past. But all this is about to change. Columbus' oddball, senior citizens are sitting on one of the largest oil discoveries on U.S. soil.","genres":["Biography","

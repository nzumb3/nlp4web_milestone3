{"title":"So It Was with Us","plot":"James, a young, curious man desperately searches for direction in his life by looking at the lives of his three closest friends. When flaming rocks start falling from the sky and an unfamiliar bone appears outside his apartment, James grasps the opportunity to give form to his life of uncertainty and falls deep into a psychologically contrived mystery. Battling their own problematic lives, his friends see that this mystery is actually James' way of coping with a fire he unintentionally started at the home they previously shared. James, coming to the realization that his friends lack direction as well, invites them to reap joy and find at least temporary happiness in the utter and complete destruction of all of his possessions. What goes up... must come down.","genres":["Drama","

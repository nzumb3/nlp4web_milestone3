{"title":"Campaign 2","plot":"In response to the Fukushima disaster, Yama-san is running an election campaign with an anti-nuclear message. But unlike last time, he has no money, no machine, no nothing. Does he even stand a chance? On March 11, 2011, Japan experienced one of the most calamitous nuclear disasters in history. But in two national elections following the accident, the pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) achieved landslide victories, gaining control of the two parliaments. Why? 'Campaign 2' by Kazuhiro Soda observes a small local election right after the disaster and gives insight into this difficult question, presenting a microcosm of Japan's political-psychological landscape.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","respons","to","the","Fukushima","disast",",","Yama-san","is","run","an","elect","campaign","with","an","anti-nuclear","messag",".","But","unlik","last","time",",","he","has","no","money",",","no","machin",",","no","noth",".","Doe","he","even","stand","a","chanc","?","On","March","11",",","2011",",","Japan","experienc","one","of","the","most","calamit","nuclear","disast","in","histori",".","But","in","two","nation","elect","follow","the","accid",",","the","pro-nuclear","Liber","Democrat","Parti","(","LDP",")","achiev","landslid","victori",",","gain","control","of","the","two","parliament",".","Whi","?","'","Campaign","2","'","by","Kazuhiro","Soda","observ","a","small","local","elect","right","after","the","disast","and","give","insight","into","this","difficult","question",",","present","a","microcosm","of","Japan","'s","political-psycholog","landscap","."],"lemmas":["in","response","to","the","Fukushima","disaster",",","yama-san","be","run","a","election","campaign","with","a","anti-nuclear","message",".","but","unlike","last","time",",","he","have","no","money",",","no","machine",",","no","nothing",".","do","he","even","stand","a","chance","?","on","March","11",",","2011",",","Japan","experience","one","of","the","most","calamitous","nuclear","disaster","in","history",".","but","in","two","national","election","follow","the","accident",",","the","pro-nuclear","Liberal","Democratic","Party","-lrb-","LDP","-rrb-","achieve","landslide","victory",",","gain","control","of","the","two","parliament",".","why","?","'","campaign","2","'","by","Kazuhiro","Soda","observe","a","small","local","election","right","after","the","disaster","and","give","insight","into","this","difficult","question",",","present","a","microcosm","of","Japan","'s","political-psychological","landscape","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In response to","response to the","to the Fukushima","the Fukushima disaster","Fukushima disaster ,","disaster , Yama-san",", Yama-san is","Yama-san is running","is running an","running an election","an election campaign","election campaign with","campaign with an","with an anti-nuclear","an anti-nuclear message","But unlike last","unlike last time","last time ,","time , he",", he has","he has no","has no money","no money ,","money , no",", no machine","no machine ,","machine , no",", no nothing","Does he even","he even stand","even stand a","stand a chance","On March 11","March 11 ,","11 , 2011",", 2011 ,","2011 , Japan",", Japan experienced","Japan experienced one","experienced one of","one of the","of the most","the most calamitous","most calamitous nuclear","calamitous nuclear disasters","nuclear disasters in","disasters in history","But in two","in two national","two national elections","national elections following","elections following the","following the accident","the accident ,","accident , the",", the pro-nuclear","the pro-nuclear Liberal","pro-nuclear Liberal Democratic","Liberal Democratic Party","Democratic Party (","Party ( LDP","( LDP )","LDP ) achieved",") achieved landslide","achieved landslide victories","landslide victories ,","victories , gaining",", gaining control","gaining control of","control of the","of the two","the two parliaments","Why ?

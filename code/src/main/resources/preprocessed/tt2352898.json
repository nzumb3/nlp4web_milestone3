{"title":"Souvenirs of Bucovina: A Romanian Survival Guide","plot":"The region of Bucovina is located on the northern slopes of the central Eastern Carpathians and adjoining plains. The name came into official use in 1775 when the region was annexed from the Principality of Moldavia by the Habsburg Monarchy and then controlled by the Austrian Empire and later Austria-Hungary. But over the centuries, the region has also been subjugated by the Romans, Goths, Turks, Nazis, Russians, and others, and now is split between Northern Romania and Southern Ukraine. &#039;Souvenirs of Bucovina&#039; is divided into two 80-minute acts which explore the history of the region, its enduring culture, the oppression of gypsies, the slaughtering of Jews in World War II, decades of Communist rule, and life since the democratic revolution of 1989.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," History"],"stems":["The","region","of","Bucovina","is","locat","on","the","northern","slope","of","the","central","Eastern","Carpathian","and","adjoin","plain",".","The","name","came","into","offici","use","in","1775","when","the","region","was","annex","from","the","Princip","of","Moldavia","by","the","Habsburg","Monarchi","and","then","control","by","the","Austrian","Empire","and","later","Austria-Hungari",".","But","over","the","centuri",",","the","region","has","also","been","subjug","by","the","Roman",",","Goth",",","Turk",",","Nazi",",","Russian",",","and","other",",","and","now","is","split","between","Northern","Romania","and","Southern","Ukrain",".","&#039;","Souvenir","of","Bucovina","&#039;","is","divid","into","two","80-minut","act","which","explor","the","histori","of","the","region",",","it","endur","cultur",",","the","oppress","of","gypsi",",","the","slaughter","of","Jew","in","World","War","II",",","decad","of","Communist","rule",",","and","life","sinc","the","democrat","revolut","of","1989","."],"lemmas":["the","region","of","Bucovina","be","located","on","the","northern","slope","of","the","central","Eastern","Carpathians","and","adjoining","plain",".","the","name","come","into","official","use","in","1775","when","the","region","be","annex","from","the","Principality","of","Moldavia","by","the","Habsburg","Monarchy","and","then","control","by","the","austrian","empire","and","later","Austria-Hungary",".","but","over","the","century",",","the","region","have","also","be","subjugate","by","the","Romans",",","Goths",",","Turks",",","Nazis",",","Russians",",","and","other",",","and","now","be","split","between","Northern","Romania","and","Southern","Ukraine",".","&#039;","souvenir","of","bucovina","&#039;","be","divide","into","two","80-minute","act","which","explore","the","history","of","the","region",",","its","enduring","culture",",","the","oppression","of","gypsy",",","the","slaughtering","of","Jews","in","World","War","II",",","decade","of","communist","rule",",","and","life","since","the","democratic","revolution","of","1989","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The region of","region of Bucovina","of Bucovina is","Bucovina is located","is located on","located on the","on the northern","the northern slopes","northern slopes of","slopes of the","of the central","the central Eastern","central Eastern Carpathians","Eastern Carpathians and","Carpathians and adjoining","and adjoining plains","The name came","name came into","came into official","into official use","official use in","use in 1775","in 1775 when","1775 when the","when the region","the region was","region was annexed","was annexed from","annexed from the","from the Principality","the Principality of","Principality of Moldavia","of Moldavia by","Moldavia by the","by the Habsburg","the Habsburg Monarchy","Habsburg Monarchy and","Monarchy and then","and then controlled","then controlled by","controlled by the","by the Austrian","the Austrian Empire","Austrian Empire and","Empire and later","and later Austria-Hungary","But over the","over the centuries","the centuries ,","centuries , the",", the region","the region has","region has also","has also been","also been subjugated","been subjugated by","subjugated by the","by the Romans","the Romans ,","Romans , Goths",", Goths ,","Goths , Turks",", Turks ,","Turks , Nazis",", Nazis ,","Nazis , Russians",", Russians ,","Russians , and",", and others","and others ,","others , and",", and now","and now is","now is split","is split between","split between Northern","between Northern Romania","Northern Romania and","Romania and Southern","and Southern Ukraine","&#039;

{"title":"What She Said: The Art of Pauline Kael","plot":"Pauline Kael was likely the most powerful, and divisive, movie critic of the 20th century. Her love of movies was revealed in her ruthless pursuit of what made a movie or an actor's performance work, or not, and why -- which made her both admired and despised amongst her readers. The latter golden age of movies of the 1960s and 1970s are the focus of this film that pursues the question of what made Pauline Kael's work so individual, so influential -- and so damned good.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Paulin","Kael","was","like","the","most","power",",","and","divis",",","movi","critic","of","the","20th","centuri",".","Her","love","of","movi","was","reveal","in","her","ruthless","pursuit","of","what","made","a","movi","or","an","actor","'s","perform","work",",","or","not",",","and","whi","--","which","made","her","both","admir","and","despis","amongst","her","reader",".","The","latter","golden","age","of","movi","of","the","1960s","and","1970s","are","the","focus","of","this","film","that","pursu","the","question","of","what","made","Paulin","Kael","'s","work","so","individu",",","so","influenti","--","and","so","damn","good","."],"lemmas":["Pauline","Kael","be","likely","the","most","powerful",",","and","divisive",",","movie","critic","of","the","20th","century",".","she","love","of","movie","be","reveal","in","she","ruthless","pursuit","of","what","make","a","movie","or","a","actor","'s","performance","work",",","or","not",",","and","why","--","which","make","she","both","admire","and","despise","amongst","she","reader",".","the","latter","golden","age","of","movie","of","the","1960","and","1970","be","the","focus","of","this","film","that","pursue","the","question","of","what","make","Pauline","Kael","'s","work","so","individual",",","so","influential","--","and","so","damned","good","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Pauline Kael was","Kael was likely","was likely the","likely the most","the most powerful","most powerful ,","powerful , and",", and divisive","and divisive ,","divisive , movie",", movie critic","movie critic of","critic of the","of the 20th","the 20th century","Her love of","love of movies","of movies was","movies was revealed","was revealed in","revealed in her","in her ruthless","her ruthless pursuit","ruthless pursuit of","pursuit of what","of what made","what made a","made a movie","a movie or","movie or an","or an actor","an actor 's","actor 's performance","'s performance work","performance work ,","work , or",", or not","or not ,","not , and",", and why","and why --","why -- which","-- which made","which made her","made her both","her both admired","both admired and","admired and despised","and despised amongst","despised amongst her","amongst her readers","The latter golden","latter golden age","golden age of","age of movies","of movies of","movies of the","of the 1960s","the 1960s and","1960s and 1970s","and 1970s are","1970s are the","are the focus","the focus of","focus of this","of this film","this film that","film that pursues","that pursues the","pursues the question","the question of","question of what","of what made","what made Pauline","made Pauline Kael","Pauline Kael 's","Kael 's work","'s work so","work so individual","so individual ,","individual , so",", so influential","so influential --","influential -- and","-- and so","and so damned","so damned good"],"2grams":["Pauline Kael","Kael was","was likely","likely the","the most","most powerful","powerful ,",", and","and divisive","divisive ,",", movie","movie critic","critic of","of the","the 20th","20th century","Her love","love of","of movies","movies was","was revealed","revealed in","in her","her ruthless","ruthless pursuit","pursuit of","of what","what made","made a","a movie","movie or","or an","an actor","actor 's","'s performance","performance work","work ,",", or","or not","not ,",", and","and why","why --","-- which","which made","made her","her both","both admired","admired and","and despised","despised amongst","amongst her","her readers","The latter","latter golden","golden age","age of","of movies","movies of","of the","the 1960s","1960s and","and 1970s","1970s are","are the","the focus","focus of","of this","this film","film that","that pursues","pursues the","the question","question of","of what","what made","made Pauline","Pauline Kael","Kael 's","'s work","work so","so individual","individual ,",", so","so influential","influential --","-- and","and so","so damned","damned good"]}

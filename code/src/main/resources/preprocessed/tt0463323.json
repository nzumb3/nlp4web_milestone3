{"title":"About a Farm","plot":"In the Autumn of 2002 the cows of the Junkkonen farm are taken to the slaughterhouse. The wheels of progress roll onwards, but two middle-aged people get left behind, Maija and Pentti Junkkonen. The small municipality of Oulunsalo is planning factories, business parks, and a new 4-lane road which would cut through the farmers' fields. The old ways of making a living are dying. The oldest daughter, director Mervi Junkkonen, realizes that she herself is part of the reason why her parents decided to give up their livelihood-there is no one to take over the farm. Through her father's 8mm films, she catches glimpses of the farm's history and a time when it was full of life. Now, Pentti (60), spends his time with his collection of tractors and some small-scale farming, but Maija (55) doesn't know what to do. Yet, life keeps taking tragic turns and old worries do not seem so important any more. About a Farm is the director's personal inquiry into a vanishing life-style and a history of which she is the last link. It is a story about the period of mourning people who give up their livelihoods go through and about the things that really matter in the end.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","Autumn","of","2002","the","cow","of","the","Junkkonen","farm","are","taken","to","the","slaughterhous",".","The","wheel","of","progress","roll","onward",",","but","two","middle-ag","peopl","get","left","behind",",","Maija","and","Pentti","Junkkonen",".","The","small","municip","of","Oulunsalo","is","plan","factori",",","busi","park",",","and","a","new","4-lane","road","which","would","cut","through","the","farmer","'","field",".","The","old","way","of","make","a","live","are","die",".","The","oldest","daughter",",","director","Mervi","Junkkonen",",","realiz","that","she","herself","is","part","of","the","reason","whi","her","parent","decid","to","give","up","their","livelihood-ther","is","no","one","to","take","over","the","farm",".","Through","her","father","'s","8mm","film",",","she","catch","glimps","of","the","farm","'s","histori","and","a","time","when","it","was","full","of","life",".","Now",",","Pentti","(","60",")",",","spend","his","time","with","his","collect","of","tractor","and","some","small-scal","farm",",","but","Maija","(","55",")","doe","n't","know","what","to","do",".","Yet",",","life","keep","take","tragic","turn","and","old","worri","do","not","seem","so","import","ani","more",".","About","a","Farm","is","the","director","'s","person","inquiri","into","a","vanish","life-styl","and","a","histori","of","which","she","is","the","last","link",".","It","is","a","stori","about","the","period","of","mourn","peopl","who","give","up","their","livelihood","go","through","and","about","the","thing","that","realli","matter","in","the","end","."],"lemmas":["in","the","autumn","of","2002","the","cow","of","the","junkkonen","farm","be","take","to","the","slaughterhouse",".","the","wheel","of","progress","roll","onward",",","but","two","middle-aged","people","get","leave","behind",",","Maija","and","Pentti","Junkkonen",".","the","small","municipality","of","Oulunsalo","be","plan","factory",",","business","park",",","and","a","new","4-lane","road","which","would","cut","through","the","farmer","'","field",".","the","old","way","of","make","a","living","be","die",".","the","oldest","daughter",",","director","Mervi","Junkkonen",",","realize","that","she","herself","be","part","of","the","reason","why","she","parent","decide","to","give","up","they","livelihood-there","be","no","one","to","take","over","the","farm",".","through","she","father","'s","8mm","film",",","she","catch","glimpse","of","the","farm","'s","history","and","a","time","when","it","be","full","of","life",".","now",",","Pentti","-lrb-","60","-rrb-",",","spend","he","time","with","he","collection","of","tractor","and","some","small-scale","farming",",","but","Maija","-lrb-","55","-rrb-","do","not","know","what","to","do",".","yet",",","life","keep","take","tragic","turn","and","old","worry","do","not","seem","so","important","any","more",".","about","a","Farm","be","the","director","'s","personal","inquiry","into","a","vanish","life-style","and","a","history","of","which","she","be","the","last","link",".","it","be","a","story","about","the","period","of","mourn","people","who","give","up","they","livelihood","go","through","and","about","the","thing","that","really","matter","in","the","end","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

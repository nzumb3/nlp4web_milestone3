{"title":"Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy","plot":"\"Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy\" is about Gehry's work of the 1990s: his breakthroughs in architecture and the extraordinary flowering of his work during this decade. It reveals Gehry's approach to his architecture through visits with him to some of his key works: The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the primary example of his use of the Dassault computer program; the Frederick R. Weisman Museum in Minneapolis, which he designed before Bilbao and without the help of computers; the Vitra Museum at Weil am Rhein, his first European commission; the Energy Center at Bad Oeynhausen, a technical and cultural center; and finally, the DG Bank Conference Center at Berlin's historic Pariser Platz, a controversial building which Gehry himself thinks may be one of his best works, and whose construction we follow throughout the film.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Frank","Gehri",":","An","Architectur","of","Joy","\"","is","about","Gehri","'s","work","of","the","1990s",":","his","breakthrough","in","architectur","and","the","extraordinari","flower","of","his","work","dure","this","decad",".","It","reveal","Gehri","'s","approach","to","his","architectur","through","visit","with","him","to","some","of","his","key","work",":","The","Guggenheim","Museum","in","Bilbao",",","the","primari","exampl","of","his","use","of","the","Dassault","comput","program",";","the","Frederick","R.","Weisman","Museum","in","Minneapoli",",","which","he","design","befor","Bilbao","and","without","the","help","of","comput",";","the","Vitra","Museum","at","Weil","am","Rhein",",","his","first","European","commiss",";","the","Energi","Center","at","Bad","Oeynhausen",",","a","technic","and","cultur","center",";","and","final",",","the","DG","Bank","Confer","Center","at","Berlin","'s","histor","Paris","Platz",",","a","controversi","build","which","Gehri","himself","think","may","be","one","of","his","best","work",",","and","whose","construct","we","follow","throughout","the","film","."],"lemmas":["``","Frank","Gehry",":","An","Architecture","of","Joy","''","be","about","Gehry","'s","work","of","the","1990",":","he","breakthrough","in","architecture","and","the","extraordinary","flowering","of","he","work","during","this","decade",".","it","reveal","Gehry","'s","approach","to","he","architecture","through","visit","with","he","to","some","of","he","key","work",":","the","Guggenheim","Museum","in","Bilbao",",","the","primary","example","of","he","use","of","the","Dassault","computer","program",";","the","Frederick","R.","Weisman","Museum","in","Minneapolis",",","which","he","design","before","Bilbao","and","without","the","help","of","computer",";","the","Vitra","Museum","at","Weil","am","Rhein",",","he","first","european","commission",";","the","Energy","Center","at","Bad","Oeynhausen",",","a","technical","and","cultural","center",";","and","finally",",","the","dg","Bank","Conference","Center","at","Berlin","'s","historic","Pariser","Platz",",","a","controversial","building","which","Gehry","himself","think","may","be","one","of","he","best","work",",","and","whose","construction","we","follow","throughout","the","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" Frank Gehry","Frank Gehry :","Gehry : An",": An Architecture","An Architecture of","Architecture of Joy","of Joy \"","Joy \" is","\" is about","is about Gehry","about Gehry 's","Gehry 's work","'s work of","work of the","of the 1990s","the 1990s :","1990s : his",": his breakthroughs","his breakthroughs in","breakthroughs in architecture","in architecture and","architecture and the","and the extraordinary","the extraordinary flowering","extraordinary flowering of","flowering of his","of his work","his work during","work during this","during this decade","It reveals Gehry","reveals Gehry 's","Gehry 's approach","'s approach to","approach to his","to his architecture","his architecture through","architecture through visits","through visits with","visits with him","with him to","him to some","to some of","some of his","of his key","his key works","key works :","works : The",": The Guggenheim","The Guggenheim Museum","Guggenheim Museum in","Museum in Bilbao","in Bilbao ,","Bilbao , the",", the primary","the primary example","primary example of","example of his","of his use","his use of","use of the","of the Dassault","the Dassault computer","Dassault computer program","computer program ;","program ; the","; the Frederick","the Frederick R.","Frederick R.

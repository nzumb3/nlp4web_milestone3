{"title":"Italian for Beginners","plot":"A young minister, a widower, is temporarily assigned to a church whose suspended pastor drove parishioners away; he stays at a hotel where he meets Jørgen, who's alone approaching middle age. Jørgen's friend Finn, a temperamental restaurant manager, may be about to be fired. Finn's assistant is Giulia, a lovely young Italian who prays for a husband. Olympia, a clumsy bakery clerk, has an ornery father; Karen, a hairdresser, has a mother who is very ill. The paths of these six characters cross at church, in the restaurant, at the hotel, and at an Italian class at the local adult school. Loneliness, grief, solace, romance, and love may meet 'nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita.'","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["A","young","minist",",","a","widow",",","is","temporarili","assign","to","a","church","whose","suspend","pastor","drove","parishion","away",";","he","stay","at","a","hotel","where","he","meet","Jørgen",",","who","'s","alon","approach","middl","age",".","Jørgen","'s","friend","Finn",",","a","temperament","restaur","manag",",","may","be","about","to","be","fire",".","Finn","'s","assist","is","Giulia",",","a","love","young","Italian","who","pray","for","a","husband",".","Olympia",",","a","clumsi","bakeri","clerk",",","has","an","orneri","father",";","Karen",",","a","hairdress",",","has","a","mother","who","is","veri","ill",".","The","path","of","these","six","charact","cross","at","church",",","in","the","restaur",",","at","the","hotel",",","and","at","an","Italian","class","at","the","local","adult","school",".","Loneli",",","grief",",","solac",",","romanc",",","and","love","may","meet","'","nel","mezzo","del","cammin","di","nostra","vita",".","'"],"lemmas":["a","young","minister",",","a","widower",",","be","temporarily","assign","to","a","church","whose","suspended","pastor","drive","parishioner","away",";","he","stay","at","a","hotel","where","he","meet","Jørgen",",","who","be","alone","approach","middle","age",".","Jørgen","'s","friend","Finn",",","a","temperamental","restaurant","manager",",","may","be","about","to","be","fire",".","Finn","'s","assistant","be","Giulia",",","a","lovely","young","Italian","who","pray","for","a","husband",".","Olympia",",","a","clumsy","bakery","clerk",",","have","a","ornery","father",";","Karen",",","a","hairdresser",",","have","a","mother","who","be","very","ill",".","the","path","of","these","six","character","cross","at","church",",","in","the","restaurant",",","at","the","hotel",",","and","at","a","italian","class","at","the","local","adult","school",".","loneliness",",","grief",",","solace",",","romance",",","and","love","may","meet","'","nel","mezzo","del","cammin","di","nostra","vita",".","'"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A young minister","young minister ,","minister , a",", a widower","a widower ,","widower , is",", is temporarily","is temporarily assigned","temporarily assigned to","assigned to a","to a church","a church whose","church whose suspended","whose suspended pastor","suspended pastor drove","pastor drove parishioners","drove parishioners away","parishioners away ;","away ; he","; he stays","he stays at","stays at a","at a hotel","a hotel where","hotel where he","where he meets","he meets Jørgen","meets Jørgen ,","Jørgen , who",", who 's","who 's alone","'s alone approaching","alone approaching middle","approaching middle age","Jørgen 's friend","'s friend Finn","friend Finn ,","Finn , a",", a temperamental","a temperamental restaurant","temperamental restaurant manager","restaurant manager ,","manager , may",", may be","may be about","be about to","about to be","to be fired","Finn 's assistant","'s assistant is","assistant is Giulia","is Giulia ,","Giulia , a",", a lovely","a lovely young","lovely young Italian","young Italian who","Italian who prays","who prays for","prays for a","for a husband","Olympia , a",", a clumsy","a clumsy bakery","clumsy bakery clerk","bakery clerk ,","clerk , has",", has an","has an ornery","an ornery father","ornery father ;","father ; Karen","; Karen ,","Karen , a",", a hairdresser","a hairdresser ,","hairdresser , has",", has a","has a mother","a mother who","mother who is","who is very","is very ill","The paths of","paths of these","of these six","these six characters","six characters cross","characters cross at","cross at church","at church ,","church , in",", in the","in the restaurant","the restaurant ,","restaurant , at",", at the","at the hotel","the hotel ,","hotel , and",", and at","and at an","at an Italian","an Italian class","Italian class at","class at the","at the local","the local adult","local adult school","Loneliness , grief",", grief ,","grief , solace",", solace ,","solace , romance",", romance ,","romance , and",", and love","and love may","love may meet","may meet '","meet ' nel","' nel mezzo","nel mezzo del","mezzo del cammin","del cammin di","cammin di nostra","di nostra vita","nostra vita .","vita .

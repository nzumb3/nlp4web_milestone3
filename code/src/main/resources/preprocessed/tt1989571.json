{"title":"The Guest","plot":"A love story between leaving and staying... \"The Guest\" Oktay, in his first night in his hometown Kutahya, coming from many years in Paris, faces the reasons that kept him away from home for so many years. As he is about to leave town again, he finds himself in a distant relative's house, and there, he meets Ayse. Ayse is a countryside woman who cannot fit in her small world of four walls she lives in. There are two things that make her life tolerable: his son Ahmet and her affair with her neighbor, Makbule... Until she sees Oktay again, after so many years... Oktay and Ayse, with their affair kept hidden, find the happiness they have been craving after so long. And they can only keep their happiness if Ayse goes to Paris with Oktay. Ayse, with the prospect of being happy for the first time, and amongst all the things she knew as life, now has to make a choice. And Ayse's decision will also determine the disposition of Oktay, not feeling at home anywhere in the world, as a \"guest\" in his own life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","love","stori","between","leav","and","stay","...","\"","The","Guest","\"","Oktay",",","in","his","first","night","in","his","hometown","Kutahya",",","come","from","mani","year","in","Pari",",","face","the","reason","that","kept","him","away","from","home","for","so","mani","year",".","As","he","is","about","to","leav","town","again",",","he","find","himself","in","a","distant","relat","'s","hous",",","and","there",",","he","meet","Ayse",".","Ayse","is","a","countrysid","woman","who","can","not","fit","in","her","small","world","of","four","wall","she","live","in",".","There","are","two","thing","that","make","her","life","toler",":","his","son","Ahmet","and","her","affair","with","her","neighbor",",","Makbul","...","Until","she","see","Oktay","again",",","after","so","mani","year","...","Oktay","and","Ayse",",","with","their","affair","kept","hidden",",","find","the","happi","they","have","been","crave","after","so","long",".","And","they","can","onli","keep","their","happi","if","Ayse","goe","to","Pari","with","Oktay",".","Ayse",",","with","the","prospect","of","be","happi","for","the","first","time",",","and","amongst","all","the","thing","she","knew","as","life",",","now","has","to","make","a","choic",".","And","Ayse","'s","decis","will","also","determin","the","disposit","of","Oktay",",","not","feel","at","home","anywher","in","the","world",",","as","a","\"","guest","\"","in","his","own","life","."],"lemmas":["a","love","story","between","leave","and","stay","...","``","the","Guest","''","Oktay",",","in","he","first","night","in","he","hometown","Kutahya",",","come","from","many","year","in","Paris",",","face","the","reason","that","keep","he","away","from","home","for","so","many","year",".","as","he","be","about","to","leave","town","again",",","he","find","himself","in","a","distant","relative","'s","house",",","and","there",",","he","meet","Ayse",".","Ayse","be","a","countryside","woman","who","can","not","fit","in","she","small","world","of","four","wall","she","live","in",".","there","be","two","thing","that","make","she","life","tolerable",":","he","son","Ahmet","and","she","affair","with","she","neighbor",",","Makbule","...","until","she","see","Oktay","again",",","after","so","many","year","...","Oktay","and","Ayse",",","with","they","affair","keep","hidden",",","find","the","happiness","they","have","be","craving","after","so","long",".","and","they","can","only","keep","they","happiness","if","Ayse","go","to","Paris","with","Oktay",".","Ayse",",","with","the","prospect","of","be","happy","for","the","first","time",",","and","amongst","all","the","thing","she","know","as","life",",","now","have","to","make","a","choice",".","and","Ayse","'s","decision","will","also","determine","the","disposition","of","Oktay",",","not","feeling","at","home","anywhere","in","the","world",",","as","a","``","guest","''","in","he","own","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A love story","love story between","story between leaving","between leaving and","leaving and staying","and staying ...","staying ... \"","... \" The","\" The Guest","The Guest \"","Guest \" Oktay","\" Oktay ,","Oktay , in",", in his","in his first","his first night","first night in","night in his","in his hometown","his hometown Kutahya","hometown Kutahya ,","Kutahya , coming",", coming from","coming from many","from many years","many years in","years in Paris","in Paris ,","Paris , faces",", faces the","faces the reasons","the reasons that","reasons that kept","that kept him","kept him away","him away from","away from home","from home for","home for so","for so many","so many years","As he is","he is about","is about to","about to leave","to leave town","leave town again","town again ,","again , he",", he finds","he finds himself","finds himself in","himself in a","in a distant","a distant relative","distant relative 's","relative 's house","'s house ,","house , and",", and there","and there ,","there , he",", he meets","he meets Ayse","Ayse is a","is a countryside","a countryside woman","countryside woman who","woman who can","who can not","can not fit","not fit in","fit in her","in her small","her small world","small world of","world of four","of four walls","four walls she","walls she lives","she lives in","There are two","are two things","two things that","things that make","that make her","make her life","her life tolerable","life tolerable :","tolerable : his",": his son","his son Ahmet","son Ahmet and","Ahmet and her","and her affair","her affair with","affair with her","with her neighbor","her neighbor ,","neighbor , Makbule",", Makbule ...","Makbule ...

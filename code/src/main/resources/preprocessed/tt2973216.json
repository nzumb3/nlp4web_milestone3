{"title":"922: From Academic Watch to Academic WOW!","plot":"No one expected that a back-woods, rural school district in Northeastern Ohio's Appalachia region would achieve the academic success that it has. After all, these are the '922ers,' the kids from Claymont. Many people call it 'Dirtmont,' or 'Scaggville.' 'Dial 911 if you're in trouble. Dial 922 if you're looking for trouble.' The stigma continues, even now. Of the student population, 60% come from single-parent homes, 63% receive free and reduced meals, and the Special Needs population of the District exceeds 30%. Five years ago inspiration arrived, new Superintendent, Ryan Delaney. He replaced 27% of the staff, helped alter beliefs, practices, patterns and created a new culture. The district has numerous Schools of Excellence, Blue Ribbon Schools, and Schools of Promise. 922 - From Academic Watch to Academic WOW!","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["No","one","expect","that","a","back-wood",",","rural","school","district","in","Northeastern","Ohio","'s","Appalachia","region","would","achiev","the","academ","success","that","it","has",".","After","all",",","these","are","the","'","922er",",","'","the","kid","from","Claymont",".","Mani","peopl","call","it","'","Dirtmont",",","'","or","'","Scaggvill",".","'","'","Dial","911","if","you","re","in","troubl",".","Dial","922","if","you","re","look","for","troubl",".","'","The","stigma","continu",",","even","now",".","Of","the","student","popul",",","60","%","come","from","single-par","home",",","63","%","receiv","free","and","reduc","meal",",","and","the","Special","Need","popul","of","the","District","exceed","30","%",".","Five","year","ago","inspir","arriv",",","new","Superintend",",","Ryan","Delaney",".","He","replac","27","%","of","the","staff",",","help","alter","belief",",","practic",",","pattern","and","creat","a","new","cultur",".","The","district","has","numer","School","of","Excellenc",",","Blue","Ribbon","School",",","and","School","of","Promis",".","922","-","From","Academ","Watch","to","Academ","WOW","!"],"lemmas":["no","one","expect","that","a","back-wood",",","rural","school","district","in","Northeastern","Ohio","'s","Appalachia","region","would","achieve","the","academic","success","that","it","have",".","after","all",",","these","be","the","'","922er",",","'","the","kid","from","Claymont",".","many","people","call","it","'","Dirtmont",",","'","or","'","Scaggville",".","'","'","dial","911","if","you","be","in","trouble",".","dial","922","if","you","be","look","for","trouble",".","'","the","stigma","continue",",","even","now",".","of","the","student","population",",","60","%","come","from","single-parent","home",",","63","%","receive","free","and","reduced","meal",",","and","the","special","need","population","of","the","District","exceed","30","%",".","five","year","ago","inspiration","arrive",",","new","Superintendent",",","Ryan","Delaney",".","he","replace","27","%","of","the","staff",",","help","alter","belief",",","practice",",","pattern","and","create","a","new","culture",".","the","district","have","numerous","Schools","of","Excellence",",","Blue","Ribbon","Schools",",","and","Schools","of","Promise",".","922","-","from","Academic","Watch","to","Academic","WOW","!"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["No one expected","one expected that","expected that a","that a back-woods","a back-woods ,","back-woods , rural",", rural school","rural school district","school district in","district in Northeastern","in Northeastern Ohio","Northeastern Ohio 's","Ohio 's Appalachia","'s Appalachia region","Appalachia region would","region would achieve","would achieve the","achieve the academic","the academic success","academic success that","success that it","that it has","After all ,","all , these",", these are","these are the","are the '","the ' 922ers","' 922ers ,","922ers , '",", ' the","' the kids","the kids from","kids from Claymont","Many people call","people call it","call it '","it ' Dirtmont","' Dirtmont ,","Dirtmont , '",", ' or","' or '","or ' Scaggville","' Scaggville .","Scaggville .

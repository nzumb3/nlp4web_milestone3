{"title":"The Invisible Life of Thomas Lynch","plot":"The Invisible Life of Thomas Lynch' is a dark comedy about a lonely small time hit man. Shot documentary style, the film reveals a pathetically empty and misguided man and the callousness of the film makers who just want to get the shots, unmoved by torture and murder. The contradiction between personal life and job, and the apathy of the people making the documentary reflects satirically the dispassion of the media","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["The","Invisibl","Life","of","Thoma","Lynch","'","is","a","dark","comedi","about","a","lone","small","time","hit","man",".","Shot","documentari","style",",","the","film","reveal","a","pathet","empti","and","misguid","man","and","the","callous","of","the","film","maker","who","just","want","to","get","the","shot",",","unmov","by","tortur","and","murder",".","The","contradict","between","person","life","and","job",",","and","the","apathi","of","the","peopl","make","the","documentari","reflect","satir","the","dispass","of","the","media"],"lemmas":["the","Invisible","Life","of","Thomas","Lynch","'","be","a","dark","comedy","about","a","lonely","small","time","hit","man",".","shot","documentary","style",",","the","film","reveal","a","pathetically","empty","and","misguided","man","and","the","callousness","of","the","film","maker","who","just","want","to","get","the","shot",",","unmoved","by","torture","and","murder",".","the","contradiction","between","personal","life","and","job",",","and","the","apathy","of","the","people","make","the","documentary","reflect","satirically","the","dispassion","of","the","media"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The Invisible Life","Invisible Life of","Life of Thomas","of Thomas Lynch","Thomas Lynch '","Lynch ' is","' is a","is a dark","a dark comedy","dark comedy about","comedy about a","about a lonely","a lonely small","lonely small time","small time hit","time hit man","Shot documentary style","documentary style ,","style , the",", the film","the film reveals","film reveals a","reveals a pathetically","a pathetically empty","pathetically empty and","empty and misguided","and misguided man","misguided man and","man and the","and the callousness","the callousness of","callousness of the","of the film","the film makers","film makers who","makers who just","who just want","just want to","want to get","to get the","get the shots","the shots ,","shots , unmoved",", unmoved by","unmoved by torture","by torture and","torture and murder","The contradiction between","contradiction between personal","between personal life","personal life and","life and job","and job ,","job , and",", and the","and the apathy","the apathy of","apathy of the","of the people","the people making","people making the","making the documentary","the documentary reflects","documentary reflects satirically","reflects satirically the","satirically the dispassion","the dispassion of","dispassion of the","of the media"],"2grams":["The Invisible","Invisible Life","Life of","of Thomas","Thomas Lynch","Lynch '","' is","is a","a dark","dark comedy","comedy about","about a","a lonely","lonely small","small time","time hit","hit man","Shot documentary","documentary style","style ,",", the","the film","film reveals","reveals a","a pathetically","pathetically empty","empty and","and misguided","misguided man","man and","and the","the callousness","callousness of","of the","the film","film makers","makers who","who just","just want","want to","to get","get the","the shots","shots ,",", unmoved","unmoved by","by torture","torture and","and murder","The contradiction","contradiction between","between personal","personal life","life and","and job","job ,",", and","and the","the apathy","apathy of","of the","the people","people making","making the","the documentary","documentary reflects","reflects satirically","satirically the","the dispassion","dispassion of","of the","the media"]}

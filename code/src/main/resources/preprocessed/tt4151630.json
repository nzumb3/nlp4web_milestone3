{"title":"We Will Be Remembered for This","plot":"It is a film for everyone. It is a clear, rational and non-politicised look at the human issues of Australia's mandatory immigration detention policy. This film poses the essential questions surrounding Australia's refugee policy. Who are the people behind the fences? How did they come to be there? What are the psychological and legal battles they now face? How much do average Australians know about this policy, and if they knew the truth, would they want it to change? To create this film, the film-makers drew together a diverse group of people. A teacher, a nurse, a handful of uni students, travelers and an academic. Some who had never visited detention, others who had done so for years, and one who had experienced it for himself. Those opposed to the policy, those in support, and those as yet undecided. Some who had never really thought about it, another who thought about it for a living, and others in between. The film-makers' objective was almost experimental: to rise above social, cultural and political differences, to draw out common threads upon which all could agree. In other words, this film strips back politics and encourages viewers to see the issue for what it really is: profoundly human.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","is","a","film","for","everyon",".","It","is","a","clear",",","ration","and","non-politicis","look","at","the","human","issu","of","Australia","'s","mandatori","immigr","detent","polici",".","This","film","pose","the","essenti","question","surround","Australia","'s","refuge","polici",".","Who","are","the","peopl","behind","the","fenc","?","How","did","they","come","to","be","there","?","What","are","the","psycholog","and","legal","battl","they","now","face","?","How","much","do","averag","Australian","know","about","this","polici",",","and","if","they","knew","the","truth",",","would","they","want","it","to","chang","?","To","creat","this","film",",","the","film-mak","drew","togeth","a","divers","group","of","peopl",".","A","teacher",",","a","nurs",",","a","hand","of","uni","student",",","travel","and","an","academ",".","Some","who","had","never","visit","detent",",","other","who","had","done","so","for","year",",","and","one","who","had","experienc","it","for","himself",".","Those","oppos","to","the","polici",",","those","in","support",",","and","those","as","yet","undecid",".","Some","who","had","never","realli","thought","about","it",",","anoth","who","thought","about","it","for","a","live",",","and","other","in","between",".","The","film-mak","'","object","was","almost","experiment",":","to","rise","abov","social",",","cultur","and","polit","differ",",","to","draw","out","common","thread","upon","which","all","could","agre",".","In","other","word",",","this","film","strip","back","polit","and","encourag","viewer","to","see","the","issu","for","what","it","realli","is",":","profound","human","."],"lemmas":["it","be","a","film","for","everyone",".","it","be","a","clear",",","rational","and","non-politicised","look","at","the","human","issue","of","Australia","'s","mandatory","immigration","detention","policy",".","this","film","pose","the","essential","question","surround","Australia","'s","refugee","policy",".","who","be","the","people","behind","the","fence","?","how","do","they","come","to","be","there","?","what","be","the","psychological","and","legal","battle","they","now","face","?","how","much","do","average","Australians","know","about","this","policy",",","and","if","they","know","the","truth",",","would","they","want","it","to","change","?","to","create","this","film",",","the","film-maker","draw","together","a","diverse","group","of","people",".","a","teacher",",","a","nurse",",","a","handful","of","uni","student",",","traveler","and","a","academic",".","some","who","have","never","visit","detention",",","other","who","have","do","so","for","year",",","and","one","who","have","experience","it","for","himself",".","those","oppose","to","the","policy",",","those","in","support",",","and","those","as","yet","undecided",".","some","who","have","never","really","think","about","it",",","another","who","think","about","it","for","a","living",",","and","other","in","between",".","the","film-maker","'","objective","be","almost","experimental",":","to","rise","above","social",",","cultural","and","political","difference",",","to","draw","out","common","thread","upon","which","all","could","agree",".","in","other","word",",","this","film","strip","back","politics","and","encourage","viewer","to","see","the","issue","for","what","it","really","be",":","profoundly","human","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It

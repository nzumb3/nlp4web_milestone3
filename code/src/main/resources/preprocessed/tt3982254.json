{"title":"Mad_e in Bangladesh","plot":"An apparently passive young man, Khorshed (Zahid Hasan), comes to Dhaka from a rural area looking for a job and a better life. He gets to stay with an uncle (Ahsanul Haq Minu) who literally robs him off every penny he has. A beautiful, flirtatious married woman next door (Rosey Siddiqui) is like a breath of fresh air in this hellhole. Khorshed is soon seen walking into a government bungalow, threatening an unsuspecting DC (Tariq Anam Khan) of Ratanpur and his PA (Shahiduzzaman Selim) that he is armed with a bomb (in a briefcase) and is not afraid to detonate it. Holding the government officials at gunpoint, he asks them to call up influential individuals of the region, including the SP (Masud Ali Khan) and ASP (Hasan Masood), leader of a youth organisation (Marjuk Russel), a leading cultural activist (Fazlur Rahman Babu), political leaders belonging to rival parties (Jayanto Chattopadhyay and Saleh Ahmed) and educationists (Amirul Haque Chowdhury and Tania Ahmed). After they all arrive, thinking they have been called upon to attend an urgent meeting with the DC, Khorshed makes his intentions clear. He reads out an eight-point demand and wants the parliament to pass new legislation to put an end to corruption.","genres":["Comedy","

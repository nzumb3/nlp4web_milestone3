{"title":"Over Land","plot":"Over Land is an intimate and personal portrait of a family facing a crisis in agriculture. Between 1996 and 2006, despite warnings of an impending food shortage, prices for farm goods dropped to their lowest point in Canadian history, driving many farmers off the land. With a family history of farming spanning generations, the Sudermans now face a challenge that threatens to pull the family apart. As Steve Suderman films his family, the fight for economic survival becomes a poignant story of hope, determination, and the search for purpose.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Over","Land","is","an","intim","and","person","portrait","of","a","famili","face","a","crisi","in","agricultur",".","Between","1996","and","2006",",","despit","warn","of","an","impend","food","shortag",",","price","for","farm","good","drop","to","their","lowest","point","in","Canadian","histori",",","drive","mani","farmer","off","the","land",".","With","a","famili","histori","of","farm","span","generat",",","the","Suderman","now","face","a","challeng","that","threaten","to","pull","the","famili","apart",".","As","Steve","Suderman","film","his","famili",",","the","fight","for","econom","surviv","becom","a","poignant","stori","of","hope",",","determin",",","and","the","search","for","purpos","."],"lemmas":["Over","Land","be","a","intimate","and","personal","portrait","of","a","family","face","a","crisis","in","agriculture",".","between","1996","and","2006",",","despite","warning","of","a","impending","food","shortage",",","price","for","farm","goods","drop","to","they","lowest","point","in","canadian","history",",","drive","many","farmer","off","the","land",".","with","a","family","history","of","farm","spanning","generation",",","the","Sudermans","now","face","a","challenge","that","threaten","to","pull","the","family","apart",".","as","Steve","Suderman","film","he","family",",","the","fight","for","economic","survival","become","a","poignant","story","of","hope",",","determination",",","and","the","search","for","purpose","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Over Land is","Land is an","is an intimate","an intimate and","intimate and personal","and personal portrait","personal portrait of","portrait of a","of a family","a family facing","family facing a","facing a crisis","a crisis in","crisis in agriculture","Between 1996 and","1996 and 2006","and 2006 ,","2006 , despite",", despite warnings","despite warnings of","warnings of an","of an impending","an impending food","impending food shortage","food shortage ,","shortage , prices",", prices for","prices for farm","for farm goods","farm goods dropped","goods dropped to","dropped to their","to their lowest","their lowest point","lowest point in","point in Canadian","in Canadian history","Canadian history ,","history , driving",", driving many","driving many farmers","many farmers off","farmers off the","off the land","With a family","a family history","family history of","history of farming","of farming spanning","farming spanning generations","spanning generations ,","generations , the",", the Sudermans","the Sudermans now","Sudermans now face","now face a","face a challenge","a challenge that","challenge that threatens","that threatens to","threatens to pull","to pull the","pull the family","the family apart","As Steve Suderman","Steve Suderman films","Suderman films his","films his family","his family ,","family , the",", the fight","the fight for","fight for economic","for economic survival","economic survival becomes","survival becomes a","becomes a poignant","a poignant story","poignant story of","story of hope","of hope ,","hope , determination",", determination ,","determination , and",", and the","and the search","the search for","search for purpose"],"2grams":["Over Land","Land is","is an","an intimate","intimate and","and personal","personal portrait","portrait of","of a","a family","family facing","facing a","a crisis","crisis in","in agriculture","Between 1996","1996 and","and 2006","2006 ,",", despite","despite warnings","warnings of","of an","an impending","impending food","food shortage","shortage ,",", prices","prices for","for farm","farm goods","goods dropped","dropped to","to their","their lowest","lowest point","point in","in Canadian","Canadian history","history ,",", driving","driving many","many farmers","farmers off","off the","the land","With a","a family","family history","history of","of farming","farming spanning","spanning generations","generations ,",", the","the Sudermans","Sudermans now","now face","face a","a challenge","challenge that","that threatens","threatens to","to pull","pull the","the family","family apart","As Steve","Steve Suderman","Suderman films","films his","his family","family ,",", the","the fight","fight for","for economic","economic survival","survival becomes","becomes a","a poignant","poignant story","story of","of hope","hope ,",", determination","determination ,",", and","and the","the search","search for","for purpose"]}

{"title":"The Fairies Christmas Ballet","plot":"Recorded live in High Definition at Sydney's magnificent State Theatre during The Fairies recent national tour and transformed into a one-hour family-friendly film, The Fairies Christmas Ballet features new songs, old fairy favourites (including 'Jump Jump Star' and 'The Silly Song') and gorgeous Christmas Carols; a lively script and beautifully choreographed dancing, set against a magical backdrop of thousands of fairy lights sparkling from a giant Christmas tree. Best fairy friends Harmony and Rhapsody, and Fairy Princess Minuet, will delight their fairy fans as they dance on their tippie toes (\"en pointe\"). Add some serious Christmas rocking by Barnaby, twisting by Elf, magic by Wizzy and an appearance by Santa carrying a sackful of goodies and this film will have children singing, dancing and smiling in cinema locations all around Australia. See The Fairies Christmas Ballet exclusively at Event, Greater Union, Birch Carroll & Coyle and Village Cinemas Victoria from December 1. All tickets just $8*. This film is exempt from classification.","genres":["Family"],"stems":["Record","live","in","High","Definit","at","Sydney","'s","magnific","State","Theatr","dure","The","Fairi","recent","nation","tour","and","transform","into","a","one-hour","family-friend","film",",","The","Fairi","Christma","Ballet","featur","new","song",",","old","fairi","favourit","(","includ","'","Jump","Jump","Star","'","and","'","The","Silli","Song","'",")","and","gorgeous","Christma","Carol",";","a","live","script","and","beauti","choreograph","danc",",","set","against","a","magic","backdrop","of","thousand","of","fairi","light","sparkl","from","a","giant","Christma","tree",".","Best","fairi","friend","Harmoni","and","Rhapsodi",",","and","Fairi","Princess","Minuet",",","will","delight","their","fairi","fan","as","they","danc","on","their","tippi","toe","(","\"","en","point","\"",")",".","Add","some","serious","Christma","rock","by","Barnabi",",","twist","by","Elf",",","magic","by","Wizzi","and","an","appear","by","Santa","carri","a","sack","of","goodi","and","this","film","will","have","children","sing",",","danc","and","smile","in","cinema","locat","all","around","Australia",".","See","The","Fairi","Christma","Ballet","exclus","at","Event",",","Greater","Union",",","Birch","Carrol","&","Coyl","and","Villag","Cinema","Victoria","from","Decemb","1",".","All","ticket","just","$","8","*",".","This","film","is","exempt","from","classif","."],"lemmas":["record","live","in","high","definition","at","Sydney","'s","magnificent","State","Theatre","during","the","Fairies","recent","national","tour","and","transform","into","a","one-hour","family-friendly","film",",","the","Fairies","Christmas","Ballet","feature","new","song",",","old","fairy","favourite","-lrb-","include","'","Jump","Jump","Star","'","and","'","the","silly","song","'","-rrb-","and","gorgeous","Christmas","Carols",";","a","lively","script","and","beautifully","choreograph","dancing",",","set","against","a","magical","backdrop","of","thousand","of","fairy","light","sparkling","from","a","giant","Christmas","tree",".","best","fairy","friend","Harmony","and","Rhapsody",",","and","Fairy","Princess","Minuet",",","will","delight","they","fairy","fan","as","they","dance","on","they","tippie","toe","-lrb-","``","en","pointe","''","-rrb-",".","add","some","serious","Christmas","rock","by","Barnaby",",","twist","by","Elf",",","magic","by","Wizzy","and","a","appearance","by","Santa","carry","a","sackful","of","goody","and","this","film","will","have","child","singing",",","dancing","and","smile","in","cinema","location","all","around","Australia",".","See","The","Fairies","Christmas","Ballet","exclusively","at","Event",",","Greater","Union",",","Birch","Carroll","&","Coyle","and","Village","Cinemas","Victoria","from","December","1",".","all","ticket","just","$","8","*",".","this","film","be","exempt","from","classification","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Recorded live in","live in High","in High Definition","High Definition at","Definition at Sydney","at Sydney 's","Sydney 's magnificent","'s magnificent State","magnificent State Theatre","State Theatre during","Theatre during The","during The Fairies","The Fairies recent","Fairies recent national","recent national tour","national tour and","tour and transformed","and transformed into","transformed into a","into a one-hour","a one-hour family-friendly","one-hour family-friendly film","family-friendly film ,","film , The",", The Fairies","The Fairies Christmas","Fairies Christmas Ballet","Christmas Ballet features","Ballet features new","features new songs","new songs ,","songs , old",", old fairy","old fairy favourites","fairy favourites (","favourites ( including","( including '","including ' Jump","' Jump Jump","Jump Jump Star","Jump Star '","Star ' and","' and '","and ' The","' The Silly","The Silly Song","Silly Song '","Song ' )","' ) and",") and gorgeous","and gorgeous Christmas","gorgeous Christmas Carols","Christmas Carols ;","Carols ;

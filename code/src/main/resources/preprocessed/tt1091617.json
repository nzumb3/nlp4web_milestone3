{"title":"Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed","plot":"Academic freedom is being suppressed, says Ben Stein. He contends that professors from around the United States are being fired from their jobs for promoting, or even exploring the possibility of, intelligent design as an alternative to Darwinism. Stein interviews the expelled academics and other supporters of intelligent design. He also interviews the scientists in the mainstream, who support Darwinism. Stein links Darwinism to Nazism, Communism, eugenics and abortion. Vintage clips of educational films and Hollywood movies are used to illustrate points in a satirical way.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Academ","freedom","is","be","suppress",",","say","Ben","Stein",".","He","contend","that","professor","from","around","the","Unite","State","are","be","fire","from","their","job","for","promot",",","or","even","explor","the","possibl","of",",","intellig","design","as","an","altern","to","Darwin",".","Stein","interview","the","expel","academ","and","other","support","of","intellig","design",".","He","also","interview","the","scientist","in","the","mainstream",",","who","support","Darwin",".","Stein","link","Darwin","to","Nazism",",","Commun",",","eugen","and","abort",".","Vintag","clip","of","educ","film","and","Hollywood","movi","are","use","to","illustr","point","in","a","satir","way","."],"lemmas":["Academic","freedom","be","be","suppress",",","say","Ben","Stein",".","he","contend","that","professor","from","around","the","United","States","be","be","fire","from","they","job","for","promote",",","or","even","explore","the","possibility","of",",","intelligent","design","as","a","alternative","to","Darwinism",".","Stein","interview","the","expel","academic","and","other","supporter","of","intelligent","design",".","he","also","interview","the","scientist","in","the","mainstream",",","who","support","Darwinism",".","Stein","link","Darwinism","to","Nazism",",","Communism",",","eugenics","and","abortion",".","vintage","clip","of","educational","film","and","Hollywood","movie","be","use","to","illustrate","point","in","a","satirical","way","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Academic freedom is","freedom is being","is being suppressed","being suppressed ,","suppressed , says",", says Ben","says Ben Stein","He contends that","contends that professors","that professors from","professors from around","from around the","around the United","the United States","United States are","States are being","are being fired","being fired from","fired from their","from their jobs","their jobs for","jobs for promoting","for promoting ,","promoting , or",", or even","or even exploring","even exploring the","exploring the possibility","the possibility of","possibility of ,","of , intelligent",", intelligent design","intelligent design as","design as an","as an alternative","an alternative to","alternative to Darwinism","Stein interviews the","interviews the expelled","the expelled academics","expelled academics and","academics and other","and other supporters","other supporters of","supporters of intelligent","of intelligent design","He also interviews","also interviews the","interviews the scientists","the scientists in","scientists in the","in the mainstream","the mainstream ,","mainstream , who",", who support","who support Darwinism","Stein links Darwinism","links Darwinism to","Darwinism to Nazism","to Nazism ,","Nazism , Communism",", Communism ,","Communism , eugenics",", eugenics and","eugenics and abortion","Vintage clips of","clips of educational","of educational films","educational films and","films and Hollywood","and Hollywood movies","Hollywood movies are","movies are used","are used to","used to illustrate","to illustrate points","illustrate points in","points in a","in a satirical","a satirical way"],"2grams":["Academic freedom","freedom is","is being","being suppressed","suppressed ,",", says","says Ben","Ben Stein","He contends","contends that","that professors","professors from","from around","around the","the United","United States","States are","are being","being fired","fired from","from their","their jobs","jobs for","for promoting","promoting ,",", or","or even","even exploring","exploring the","the possibility","possibility of","of ,",", intelligent","intelligent design","design as","as an","an alternative","alternative to","to Darwinism","Stein interviews","interviews the","the expelled","expelled academics","academics and","and other","other supporters","supporters of","of intelligent","intelligent design","He also","also interviews","interviews the","the scientists","scientists in","in the","the mainstream","mainstream ,",", who","who support","support Darwinism","Stein links","links Darwinism","Darwinism to","to Nazism","Nazism ,",", Communism","Communism ,",", eugenics","eugenics and","and abortion","Vintage clips","clips of","of educational","educational films","films and","and Hollywood","Hollywood movies","movies are","are used","used to","to illustrate","illustrate points","points in","in a","a satirical","satirical way"]}

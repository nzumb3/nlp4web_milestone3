{"title":"Dva nula","plot":"One evening, one stadium, one match. Two football clubs, two tribes engaged in a 'war'. As the match starts, the players run onto the bright green pitch and in the stands, fans seem to have a free reign over the whole arena. Each hotly contested match up between the Prague-based rivals provides a unique setting that features people of various backgrounds. In all the noise, hollering and loud debates, each fan becomes absorbed in the match in their own special way. Against the backdrop of a big match, countless minor, yet equally interesting, struggles are about to unfold.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["One","even",",","one","stadium",",","one","match",".","Two","footbal","club",",","two","tribe","engag","in","a","'","war","'",".","As","the","match","start",",","the","player","run","onto","the","bright","green","pitch","and","in","the","stand",",","fan","seem","to","have","a","free","reign","over","the","whole","arena",".","Each","hot","contest","match","up","between","the","Prague-bas","rival","provid","a","uniqu","set","that","featur","peopl","of","various","background",".","In","all","the","nois",",","holler","and","loud","debat",",","each","fan","becom","absorb","in","the","match","in","their","own","special","way",".","Against","the","backdrop","of","a","big","match",",","countless","minor",",","yet","equal","interest",",","struggl","are","about","to","unfold","."],"lemmas":["one","evening",",","one","stadium",",","one","match",".","two","football","club",",","two","tribe","engage","in","a","'","war","'",".","as","the","match","start",",","the","player","run","onto","the","bright","green","pitch","and","in","the","stand",",","fan","seem","to","have","a","free","reign","over","the","whole","arena",".","each","hotly","contest","match","up","between","the","prague-based","rival","provide","a","unique","setting","that","feature","people","of","various","background",".","in","all","the","noise",",","hollering","and","loud","debate",",","each","fan","become","absorb","in","the","match","in","they","own","special","way",".","against","the","backdrop","of","a","big","match",",","countless","minor",",","yet","equally","interesting",",","struggle","be","about","to","unfold","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["One evening ,","evening , one",", one stadium","one stadium ,","stadium , one",", one match","Two football clubs","football clubs ,","clubs , two",", two tribes","two tribes engaged","tribes engaged in","engaged in a","in a '","a ' war","' war '","As the match","the match starts","match starts ,","starts , the",", the players","the players run","players run onto","run onto the","onto the bright","the bright green","bright green pitch","green pitch and","pitch and in","and in the","in the stands","the stands ,","stands , fans",", fans seem","fans seem to","seem to have","to have a","have a free","a free reign","free reign over","reign over the","over the whole","the whole arena","Each hotly contested","hotly contested match","contested match up","match up between","up between the","between the Prague-based","the Prague-based rivals","Prague-based rivals provides","rivals provides a","provides a unique","a unique setting","unique setting that","setting that features","that features people","features people of","people of various","of various backgrounds","In all the","all the noise","the noise ,","noise , hollering",", hollering and","hollering and loud","and loud debates","loud debates ,","debates , each",", each fan","each fan becomes","fan becomes absorbed","becomes absorbed in","absorbed in the","in the match","the match in","match in their","in their own","their own special","own special way","Against the backdrop","the backdrop of","backdrop of a","of a big","a big match","big match ,","match , countless",", countless minor","countless minor ,","minor , yet",", yet equally","yet equally interesting","equally interesting ,","interesting , struggles",", struggles are","struggles are about","are about to","about to unfold"],"2grams":["One evening","evening ,",", one","one stadium","stadium ,",", one","one match","Two football","football clubs","clubs ,",", two","two tribes","tribes engaged","engaged in","in a","a '","' war","war '","As the","the match","match starts","starts ,",", the","the players","players run","run onto","onto the","the bright","bright green","green pitch","pitch and","and in","in the","the stands","stands ,",", fans","fans seem","seem to","to have","have a","a free","free reign","reign over","over the","the whole","whole arena","Each hotly","hotly contested","contested match","match up","up between","between the","the Prague-based","Prague-based rivals","rivals provides","provides a","a unique","unique setting","setting that","that features","features people","people of","of various","various backgrounds","In all","all the","the noise","noise ,",", hollering","hollering and","and loud","loud debates","debates ,",", each","each fan","fan becomes","becomes absorbed","absorbed in","in the","the match","match in","in their","their own","own special","special way","Against the","the backdrop","backdrop of","of a","a big","big match","match ,",", countless","countless minor","minor ,",", yet","yet equally","equally interesting","interesting ,",", struggles","struggles are","are about","about to","to unfold"]}

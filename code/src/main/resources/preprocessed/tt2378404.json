{"title":"Unforgettable Fire: The Story of a U2 Tribute Band","plot":"This film explores the personal lives and challenges of the members of one of the longest running U2 tribute bands in the world. The audience sees the members morph from their daily routine into rock star doppelgangers by getting a glimpse of the band at home, jobs, and on stage mimicking one of the most established and popular bands in the world; U2. My objective is for the audience to relate their own desires to that of Unforgettable Fire's. We all have dreams but what is the true motivation behind these dreams? If it is simply to be a rock star and stand in front of an audience who loves your music then what is the difference in the destination between band and cover band?","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["This","film","explor","the","person","live","and","challeng","of","the","member","of","one","of","the","longest","run","U2","tribut","band","in","the","world",".","The","audienc","see","the","member","morph","from","their","daili","routin","into","rock","star","doppelgang","by","get","a","glimps","of","the","band","at","home",",","job",",","and","on","stage","mimick","one","of","the","most","establish","and","popular","band","in","the","world",";","U2",".","My","object","is","for","the","audienc","to","relat","their","own","desir","to","that","of","Unforgett","Fire","'s",".","We","all","have","dream","but","what","is","the","true","motiv","behind","these","dream","?","If","it","is","simpli","to","be","a","rock","star","and","stand","in","front","of","an","audienc","who","love","your","music","then","what","is","the","differ","in","the","destin","between","band","and","cover","band","?"],"lemmas":["this","film","explore","the","personal","life","and","challenge","of","the","member","of","one","of","the","longest","run","u2","tribute","band","in","the","world",".","the","audience","see","the","member","morph","from","they","daily","routine","into","rock","star","doppelganger","by","get","a","glimpse","of","the","band","at","home",",","job",",","and","on","stage","mimic","one","of","the","most","established","and","popular","band","in","the","world",";","u2",".","my","objective","be","for","the","audience","to","relate","they","own","desire","to","that","of","Unforgettable","Fire","'s",".","we","all","have","dream","but","what","be","the","true","motivation","behind","these","dream","?","if","it","be","simply","to","be","a","rock","star","and","stand","in","front","of","a","audience","who","love","you","music","then","what","be","the","difference","in","the","destination","between","band","and","cover","band","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["This film explores","film explores the","explores the personal","the personal lives","personal lives and","lives and challenges","and challenges of","challenges of the","of the members","the members of","members of one","of one of","one of the","of the longest","the longest running","longest running U2","running U2 tribute","U2 tribute bands","tribute bands in","bands in the","in the world","The audience sees","audience sees the","sees the members","the members morph","members morph from","morph from their","from their daily","their daily routine","daily routine into","routine into rock","into rock star","rock star doppelgangers","star doppelgangers by","doppelgangers by getting","by getting a","getting a glimpse","a glimpse of","glimpse of the","of the band","the band at","band at home","at home ,","home , jobs",", jobs ,","jobs , and",", and on","and on stage","on stage mimicking","stage mimicking one","mimicking one of","one of the","of the most","the most established","most established and","established and popular","and popular bands","popular bands in","bands in the","in the world","the world ;","world ;

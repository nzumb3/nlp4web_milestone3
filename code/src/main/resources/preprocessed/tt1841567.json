{"title":"Dinastia Vivanco: Devolver al vino lo que el vino nos a dado","plot":"Pedro Vivanco started off delivering his family's wine door-to-door on a bicycle, and rose to become the major provider of wine to Rioja wineries and an essential, although anonymous, figure in its transformation. When others were destroying their old machinery to make way for the new, he (and later his sons) started collecting them and other pieces over a period of forty years in order to set up what is perhaps the world's best wine museum, as part of his philosophy of 'giving back to wine what wine has given us.' The documentary uses interviews with Pedro, family members and others to chart a unique and fascinating narrative of the 100 year, four generation history of the winery that parallels the evolution of Spanish wine.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Pedro","Vivanco","start","off","deliv","his","famili","'s","wine","door-to-door","on","a","bicycl",",","and","rose","to","becom","the","major","provid","of","wine","to","Rioja","wineri","and","an","essenti",",","although","anonym",",","figur","in","it","transform",".","When","other","were","destroy","their","old","machineri","to","make","way","for","the","new",",","he","(","and","later","his","son",")","start","collect","them","and","other","piec","over","a","period","of","forti","year","in","order","to","set","up","what","is","perhap","the","world","'s","best","wine","museum",",","as","part","of","his","philosophi","of","'","give","back","to","wine","what","wine","has","given","us",".","'","The","documentari","use","interview","with","Pedro",",","famili","member","and","other","to","chart","a","uniqu","and","fascin","narrat","of","the","100","year",",","four","generat","histori","of","the","wineri","that","parallel","the","evolut","of","Spanish","wine","."],"lemmas":["Pedro","Vivanco","start","off","deliver","he","family","'s","wine","door-to-door","on","a","bicycle",",","and","rise","to","become","the","major","provider","of","wine","to","Rioja","winery","and","a","essential",",","although","anonymous",",","figure","in","its","transformation",".","when","other","be","destroy","they","old","machinery","to","make","way","for","the","new",",","he","-lrb-","and","later","he","son","-rrb-","start","collect","they","and","other","piece","over","a","period","of","forty","year","in","order","to","set","up","what","be","perhaps","the","world","'s","best","wine","museum",",","as","part","of","he","philosophy","of","'","give","back","to","wine","what","wine","have","give","we",".","'","the","documentary","use","interview","with","Pedro",",","family","member","and","other","to","chart","a","unique","and","fascinating","narrative","of","the","100","year",",","four","generation","history","of","the","winery","that","parallel","the","evolution","of","spanish","wine","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Pedro Vivanco started","Vivanco started off","started off delivering","off delivering his","delivering his family","his family 's","family 's wine","'s wine door-to-door","wine door-to-door on","door-to-door on a","on a bicycle","a bicycle ,","bicycle , and",", and rose","and rose to","rose to become","to become the","become the major","the major provider","major provider of","provider of wine","of wine to","wine to Rioja","to Rioja wineries","Rioja wineries and","wineries and an","and an essential","an essential ,","essential , although",", although anonymous","although anonymous ,","anonymous , figure",", figure in","figure in its","in its transformation","When others were","others were destroying","were destroying their","destroying their old","their old machinery","old machinery to","machinery to make","to make way","make way for","way for the","for the new","the new ,","new , he",", he (","he ( and","( and later","and later his","later his sons","his sons )","sons ) started",") started collecting","started collecting them","collecting them and","them and other","and other pieces","other pieces over","pieces over a","over a period","a period of","period of forty","of forty years","forty years in","years in order","in order to","order to set","to set up","set up what","up what is","what is perhaps","is perhaps the","perhaps the world","the world 's","world 's best","'s best wine","best wine museum","wine museum ,","museum , as",", as part","as part of","part of his","of his philosophy","his philosophy of","philosophy of '","of ' giving","' giving back","giving back to","back to wine","to wine what","wine what wine","what wine has","wine has given","has given us","given us .","us .

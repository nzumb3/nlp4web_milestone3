{"title":"Music and Lyrics","plot":"Cheery Alex Fletcher lives comfortably in Manhattan off the residuals from his 80's pop success and reprising his hits at school reunions, theme parks, and state fairs. But those gigs are declining, so he jumps at the chance to write a song and record it with reigning teen idol Cora Corman. Trouble is, he's good at melodies but needs a lyricist and has less than a week to finish. Enter Sophie Fisher, subbing for a friend who waters Alex's plants; she's a pretty good poet, quick witted, and could do it, if she'd agree. But there's some sort of shadow over her head that Alex may not be able to charm his way past. And what if they do get a song written, what then?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["Cheeri","Alex","Fletcher","live","comfort","in","Manhattan","off","the","residu","from","his","80","'s","pop","success","and","repris","his","hit","at","school","reunion",",","theme","park",",","and","state","fair",".","But","those","gig","are","declin",",","so","he","jump","at","the","chanc","to","write","a","song","and","record","it","with","reign","teen","idol","Cora","Corman",".","Troubl","is",",","he","'s","good","at","melodi","but","need","a","lyricist","and","has","less","than","a","week","to","finish",".","Enter","Sophi","Fisher",",","sub","for","a","friend","who","water","Alex","'s","plant",";","she","'s","a","pretti","good","poet",",","quick","wit",",","and","could","do","it",",","if","she","'d","agre",".","But","there","'s","some","sort","of","shadow","over","her","head","that","Alex","may","not","be","abl","to","charm","his","way","past",".","And","what","if","they","do","get","a","song","written",",","what","then","?"],"lemmas":["Cheery","Alex","Fletcher","live","comfortably","in","Manhattan","off","the","residual","from","he","80","'s","pop","success","and","reprise","he","hit","at","school","reunion",",","theme","park",",","and","state","fair",".","but","those","gig","be","decline",",","so","he","jump","at","the","chance","to","write","a","song","and","record","it","with","reign","teen","idol","Cora","Corman",".","trouble","be",",","he","be","good","at","melody","but","need","a","lyricist","and","have","less","than","a","week","to","finish",".","enter","Sophie","Fisher",",","sub","for","a","friend","who","water","Alex","'s","plant",";","she","be","a","pretty","good","poet",",","quick","wit",",","and","could","do","it",",","if","she","would","agree",".","but","there","be","some","sort","of","shadow","over","she","head","that","Alex","may","not","be","able","to","charm","he","way","past",".","and","what","if","they","do","get","a","song","write",",","what","then","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cheery Alex Fletcher","Alex Fletcher lives","Fletcher lives comfortably","lives comfortably in","comfortably in Manhattan","in Manhattan off","Manhattan off the","off the residuals","the residuals from","residuals from his","from his 80","his 80 's","80 's pop","'s pop success","pop success and","success and reprising","and reprising his","reprising his hits","his hits at","hits at school","at school reunions","school reunions ,","reunions , theme",", theme parks","theme parks ,","parks , and",", and state","and state fairs","But those gigs","those gigs are","gigs are declining","are declining ,","declining , so",", so he","so he jumps","he jumps at","jumps at the","at the chance","the chance to","chance to write","to write a","write a song","a song and","song and record","and record it","record it with","it with reigning","with reigning teen","reigning teen idol","teen idol Cora","idol Cora Corman","Trouble is ,","is , he",", he 's","he 's good","'s good at","good at melodies","at melodies but","melodies but needs","but needs a","needs a lyricist","a lyricist and","lyricist and has","and has less","has less than","less than a","than a week","a week to","week to finish","Enter Sophie Fisher","Sophie Fisher ,","Fisher , subbing",", subbing for","subbing for a","for a friend","a friend who","friend who waters","who waters Alex","waters Alex 's","Alex 's plants","'s plants ;","plants ;

{"title":"Lagunemine","plot":"An atypical documentary about three people who live and work in a remote area of the venetian lagoon. A place frozen in time, away from civilization. Three different stories, three different ways of living, in a rarefied and motionless environment of a land that lives in symbiosis with the water. The latest anthropological evidence of an endangered amphibian species. Where the poetry of the landscape becomes a tale.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["An","atyp","documentari","about","three","peopl","who","live","and","work","in","a","remot","area","of","the","venetian","lagoon",".","A","place","frozen","in","time",",","away","from","civil",".","Three","differ","stori",",","three","differ","way","of","live",",","in","a","rarefi","and","motionless","environ","of","a","land","that","live","in","symbiosi","with","the","water",".","The","latest","anthropolog","evid","of","an","endang","amphibian","speci",".","Where","the","poetri","of","the","landscap","becom","a","tale","."],"lemmas":["a","atypical","documentary","about","three","people","who","live","and","work","in","a","remote","area","of","the","venetian","lagoon",".","a","place","freeze","in","time",",","away","from","civilization",".","three","different","story",",","three","different","way","of","living",",","in","a","rarefy","and","motionless","environment","of","a","land","that","live","in","symbiosis","with","the","water",".","the","latest","anthropological","evidence","of","a","endangered","amphibian","species",".","where","the","poetry","of","the","landscape","become","a","tale","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["An atypical documentary","atypical documentary about","documentary about three","about three people","three people who","people who live","who live and","live and work","and work in","work in a","in a remote","a remote area","remote area of","area of the","of the venetian","the venetian lagoon","A place frozen","place frozen in","frozen in time","in time ,","time , away",", away from","away from civilization","Three different stories","different stories ,","stories , three",", three different","three different ways","different ways of","ways of living","of living ,","living , in",", in a","in a rarefied","a rarefied and","rarefied and motionless","and motionless environment","motionless environment of","environment of a","of a land","a land that","land that lives","that lives in","lives in symbiosis","in symbiosis with","symbiosis with the","with the water","The latest anthropological","latest anthropological evidence","anthropological evidence of","evidence of an","of an endangered","an endangered amphibian","endangered amphibian species","Where the poetry","the poetry of","poetry of the","of the landscape","the landscape becomes","landscape becomes a","becomes a tale"],"2grams":["An atypical","atypical documentary","documentary about","about three","three people","people who","who live","live and","and work","work in","in a","a remote","remote area","area of","of the","the venetian","venetian lagoon","A place","place frozen","frozen in","in time","time ,",", away","away from","from civilization","Three different","different stories","stories ,",", three","three different","different ways","ways of","of living","living ,",", in","in a","a rarefied","rarefied and","and motionless","motionless environment","environment of","of a","a land","land that","that lives","lives in","in symbiosis","symbiosis with","with the","the water","The latest","latest anthropological","anthropological evidence","evidence of","of an","an endangered","endangered amphibian","amphibian species","Where the","the poetry","poetry of","of the","the landscape","landscape becomes","becomes a","a tale"]}

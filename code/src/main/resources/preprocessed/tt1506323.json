{"title":"Waiting for Change","plot":"Bradley finds out that our government is not doing much in the way of helping Homless. He sees that most homeless people are lazy and wont doing any thing to get a job and change. However he does meet people that have no choice and are stuck being homeless. Many people with jobs and house have mixed feelings about it and don't know how they can help. It seems the only answer is in small organized groups that change will be done to the homeless people.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Bradley","find","out","that","our","govern","is","not","do","much","in","the","way","of","help","Homless",".","He","see","that","most","homeless","peopl","are","lazi","and","wont","do","ani","thing","to","get","a","job","and","chang",".","Howev","he","doe","meet","peopl","that","have","no","choic","and","are","stuck","be","homeless",".","Mani","peopl","with","job","and","hous","have","mix","feel","about","it","and","do","n't","know","how","they","can","help",".","It","seem","the","onli","answer","is","in","small","organ","group","that","chang","will","be","done","to","the","homeless","peopl","."],"lemmas":["Bradley","find","out","that","we","government","be","not","do","much","in","the","way","of","help","Homless",".","he","see","that","most","homeless","people","be","lazy","and","wont","do","any","thing","to","get","a","job","and","change",".","however","he","do","meet","people","that","have","no","choice","and","be","stick","be","homeless",".","many","people","with","job","and","house","have","mix","feeling","about","it","and","do","not","know","how","they","can","help",".","it","seem","the","only","answer","be","in","small","organized","group","that","change","will","be","do","to","the","homeless","people","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Bradley finds out","finds out that","out that our","that our government","our government is","government is not","is not doing","not doing much","doing much in","much in the","in the way","the way of","way of helping","of helping Homless","He sees that","sees that most","that most homeless","most homeless people","homeless people are","people are lazy","are lazy and","lazy and wont","and wont doing","wont doing any","doing any thing","any thing to","thing to get","to get a","get a job","a job and","job and change","However he does","he does meet","does meet people","meet people that","people that have","that have no","have no choice","no choice and","choice and are","and are stuck","are stuck being","stuck being homeless","Many people with","people with jobs","with jobs and","jobs and house","and house have","house have mixed","have mixed feelings","mixed feelings about","feelings about it","about it and","it and do","and do n't","do n't know","n't know how","know how they","how they can","they can help","It seems the","seems the only","the only answer","only answer is","answer is in","is in small","in small organized","small organized groups","organized groups that","groups that change","that change will","change will be","will be done","be done to","done to the","to the homeless","the homeless people"],"2grams":["Bradley finds","finds out","out that","that our","our government","government is","is not","not doing","doing much","much in","in the","the way","way of","of helping","helping Homless","He sees","sees that","that most","most homeless","homeless people","people are","are lazy","lazy and","and wont","wont doing","doing any","any thing","thing to","to get","get a","a job","job and","and change","However he","he does","does meet","meet people","people that","that have","have no","no choice","choice and","and are","are stuck","stuck being","being homeless","Many people","people with","with jobs","jobs and","and house","house have","have mixed","mixed feelings","feelings about","about it","it and","and do","do n't","n't know","know how","how they","they can","can help","It seems","seems the","the only","only answer","answer is","is in","in small","small organized","organized groups","groups that","that change","change will","will be","be done","done to","to the","the homeless","homeless people"]}

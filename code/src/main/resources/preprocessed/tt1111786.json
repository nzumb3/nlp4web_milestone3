{"title":"Dribbles","plot":"In this \"surprisingly moving piece about teen life\" (HBO Screenplay Coverage), talented high school artist David McNeil is desperate to prove himself to his runaway father by winning a state championship basketball jacket. Grueling tryouts, family conflict, and strained friendships are merely the underpainting for David's greatest challenge as he suddenly finds himself in the role of friend and protector of Dribbles - a mentally challenged old janitor and the basketball team's unofficial mascot. With self-confident new girl at school, Mary, as his guiding spirit and artistic muse, David may just find there are more important measures of a man's worth than trophies. This \"beautifully written, heart warming, and quite charming\" (Republic Pictures Screenplay Coverage) story is one to experience again and again.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","this","\"","surpris","move","piec","about","teen","life","\"","(","HBO","Screenplay","Coverag",")",",","talent","high","school","artist","David","McNeil","is","desper","to","prove","himself","to","his","runaway","father","by","win","a","state","championship","basketbal","jacket",".","Gruel","tryout",",","famili","conflict",",","and","strain","friendship","are","mere","the","underpaint","for","David","'s","greatest","challeng","as","he","sudden","find","himself","in","the","role","of","friend","and","protector","of","Dribbl","-","a","mental","challeng","old","janitor","and","the","basketbal","team","'s","unoffici","mascot",".","With","self-confid","new","girl","at","school",",","Mari",",","as","his","guid","spirit","and","artist","muse",",","David","may","just","find","there","are","more","import","measur","of","a","man","'s","worth","than","trophi",".","This","\"","beauti","written",",","heart","warm",",","and","quit","charm","\"","(","Republ","Pictur","Screenplay","Coverag",")","stori","is","one","to","experi","again","and","again","."],"lemmas":["in","this","``","surprisingly","move","piece","about","teen","life","''","-lrb-","HBO","Screenplay","Coverage","-rrb-",",","talented","high","school","artist","David","McNeil","be","desperate","to","prove","himself","to","he","runaway","father","by","win","a","state","championship","basketball","jacket",".","grueling","tryout",",","family","conflict",",","and","strained","friendship","be","merely","the","underpainting","for","David","'s","greatest","challenge","as","he","suddenly","find","himself","in","the","role","of","friend","and","protector","of","Dribbles","-","a","mentally","challenge","old","janitor","and","the","basketball","team","'s","unofficial","mascot",".","with","self-confident","new","girl","at","school",",","Mary",",","as","he","guide","spirit","and","artistic","muse",",","David","may","just","find","there","be","more","important","measure","of","a","man","'s","worth","than","trophy",".","this","``","beautifully","write",",","heart","warming",",","and","quite","charming","''","-lrb-","Republic","Pictures","Screenplay","Coverage","-rrb-","story","be","one","to","experience","again","and","again","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In this \"","this \" surprisingly","\" surprisingly moving","surprisingly moving piece","moving piece about","piece about teen","about teen life","teen life \"","life \" (","\" ( HBO","( HBO Screenplay","HBO Screenplay Coverage","Screenplay Coverage )","Coverage ) ,",") , talented",", talented high","talented high school","high school artist","school artist David","artist David McNeil","David McNeil is","McNeil is desperate","is desperate to","desperate to prove","to prove himself","prove himself to","himself to his","to his runaway","his runaway father","runaway father by","father by winning","by winning a","winning a state","a state championship","state championship basketball","championship basketball jacket","Grueling tryouts ,","tryouts , family",", family conflict","family conflict ,","conflict , and",", and strained","and strained friendships","strained friendships are","friendships are merely","are merely the","merely the underpainting","the underpainting for","underpainting for David","for David 's","David 's greatest","'s greatest challenge","greatest challenge as","challenge as he","as he suddenly","he suddenly finds","suddenly finds himself","finds himself in","himself in the","in the role","the role of","role of friend","of friend and","friend and protector","and protector of","protector of Dribbles","of Dribbles -","Dribbles -

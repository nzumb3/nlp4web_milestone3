{"title":"Sixteen Legs","plot":"Giant prehistoric spiders the size of dinner plates try to find love in the dark. As the world rapidly descends into the next period of global mass extinction, a message of hope comes from an unlikely hero: a creature, often reviled, that has survived previous mass extinctions and climatic change in a magical ecosystem hidden beneath one of the world's last great wildernesses. With spectacular imagery and a dark-fantasy twist, this is a real-world \"Charlotte's Web\", capitalizing on master story-teller Neil Gaiman's global popularity to bring a story of stability and solitude into our world of rapid change.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Giant","prehistor","spider","the","size","of","dinner","plate","tri","to","find","love","in","the","dark",".","As","the","world","rapid","descend","into","the","next","period","of","global","mass","extinct",",","a","messag","of","hope","come","from","an","unlik","hero",":","a","creatur",",","often","revil",",","that","has","surviv","previous","mass","extinct","and","climat","chang","in","a","magic","ecosystem","hidden","beneath","one","of","the","world","'s","last","great","wilder",".","With","spectacular","imageri","and","a","dark-fantasi","twist",",","this","is","a","real-world","\"","Charlott","'s","Web","\"",",","capit","on","master","story-tel","Neil","Gaiman","'s","global","popular","to","bring","a","stori","of","stabil","and","solitud","into","our","world","of","rapid","chang","."],"lemmas":["giant","prehistoric","spider","the","size","of","dinner","plate","try","to","find","love","in","the","dark",".","as","the","world","rapidly","descend","into","the","next","period","of","global","mass","extinction",",","a","message","of","hope","come","from","a","unlikely","hero",":","a","creature",",","often","revile",",","that","have","survive","previous","mass","extinction","and","climatic","change","in","a","magical","ecosystem","hide","beneath","one","of","the","world","'s","last","great","wilderness",".","with","spectacular","imagery","and","a","dark-fantasy","twist",",","this","be","a","real-world","``","Charlotte","'s","web","''",",","capitalize","on","master","story-teller","Neil","Gaiman","'s","global","popularity","to","bring","a","story","of","stability","and","solitude","into","we","world","of","rapid","change","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Giant

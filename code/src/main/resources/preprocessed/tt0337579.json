{"title":"Barbershop 2: Back in Business","plot":"The continuing adventures of the barbers at Calvin's Barbershop. Gina, a stylist at the beauty shop next door, is now trying to cut in on his buisness. Calvin is again struggling to keep his father's shop and traditions alive--this time against urban developers looking to replace mom & pop establishments with name-brand chains. The world changes, but some things never go out of style--from current events and politics to relationships and love, you can still say anything you want at the barbershop.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["The","continu","adventur","of","the","barber","at","Calvin","'s","Barbershop",".","Gina",",","a","stylist","at","the","beauti","shop","next","door",",","is","now","tri","to","cut","in","on","his","buis",".","Calvin","is","again","struggl","to","keep","his","father","'s","shop","and","tradit","aliv","--","this","time","against","urban","develop","look","to","replac","mom","&","pop","establish","with","name-brand","chain",".","The","world","chang",",","but","some","thing","never","go","out","of","style","--","from","current","event","and","polit","to","relationship","and","love",",","you","can","still","say","anyth","you","want","at","the","barbershop","."],"lemmas":["the","continue","adventure","of","the","barber","at","Calvin","'s","Barbershop",".","Gina",",","a","stylist","at","the","beauty","shop","next","door",",","be","now","try","to","cut","in","on","he","buisness",".","Calvin","be","again","struggle","to","keep","he","father","'s","shop","and","tradition","alive","--","this","time","against","urban","developer","look","to","replace","mom","&","pop","establishment","with","name-brand","chain",".","the","world","change",",","but","some","thing","never","go","out","of","style","--","from","current","event","and","politics","to","relationship","and","love",",","you","can","still","say","anything","you","want","at","the","barbershop","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The continuing adventures","continuing adventures of","adventures of the","of the barbers","the barbers at","barbers at Calvin","at Calvin 's","Calvin 's Barbershop","Gina , a",", a stylist","a stylist at","stylist at the","at the beauty","the beauty shop","beauty shop next","shop next door","next door ,","door , is",", is now","is now trying","now trying to","trying to cut","to cut in","cut in on","in on his","on his buisness","Calvin is again","is again struggling","again struggling to","struggling to keep","to keep his","keep his father","his father 's","father 's shop","'s shop and","shop and traditions","and traditions alive","traditions alive --","alive -- this","-- this time","this time against","time against urban","against urban developers","urban developers looking","developers looking to","looking to replace","to replace mom","replace mom &","mom & pop","& pop establishments","pop establishments with","establishments with name-brand","with name-brand chains","The world changes","world changes ,","changes , but",", but some","but some things","some things never","things never go","never go out","go out of","out of style","of style --","style -- from","-- from current","from current events","current events and","events and politics","and politics to","politics to relationships","to relationships and","relationships and love","and love ,","love , you",", you can","you can still","can still say","still say anything","say anything you","anything you want","you want at","want at the","at the barbershop"],"2grams":["The continuing","continuing adventures","adventures of","of the","the barbers","barbers at","at Calvin","Calvin 's","'s Barbershop","Gina ,",", a","a stylist","stylist at","at the","the beauty","beauty shop","shop next","next door","door ,",", is","is now","now trying","trying to","to cut","cut in","in on","on his","his buisness","Calvin is","is again","again struggling","struggling to","to keep","keep his","his father","father 's","'s shop","shop and","and traditions","traditions alive","alive --","-- this","this time","time against","against urban","urban developers","developers looking","looking to","to replace","replace mom","mom &","& pop","pop establishments","establishments with","with name-brand","name-brand chains","The world","world changes","changes ,",", but","but some","some things","things never","never go","go out","out of","of style","style --","-- from","from current","current events","events and","and politics","politics to","to relationships","relationships and","and love","love ,",", you","you can","can still","still say","say anything","anything you","you want","want at","at the","the barbershop"]}

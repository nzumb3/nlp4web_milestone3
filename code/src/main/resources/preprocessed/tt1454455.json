{"title":"The Whispering of the Trees","plot":"In the Andes of Southern Chile a native people refers to a tree in its name. Mapuche Pehuenche - People of the Araucaria The fruit of the tree assured their survival in this rough area for centuries. Unnoticed by civilization, they lived a life which was threatened at any time. Today, civilization also has reached their area, and therefore the Mapuche are living in times of change. The film tells the story of a family, which leaves its home like every year and moves to the forest, in order to gather the fruits. Therefor the men climb the trees, which can be as high as 30 meters (100 feet). The fruit is still the basis for their living, but nowadays the Mapuche sell great amounts of it, which provides them with a certain financial gain. In spite of all the changes they still try to stick to their culture. This becomes very obvious when looking at the interpersonal relationships in this family, which mean everything to them. From their ancestors they learned to appreciate values like love and cohesion, and they want to defend them against the new influences that they are facing today.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","Andes","of","Southern","Chile","a","nativ","peopl","refer","to","a","tree","in","it","name",".","Mapuch","Pehuench","-","Peopl","of","the","Araucaria","The","fruit","of","the","tree","assur","their","surviv","in","this","rough","area","for","centuri",".","Unnotic","by","civil",",","they","live","a","life","which","was","threaten","at","ani","time",".","Today",",","civil","also","has","reach","their","area",",","and","therefor","the","Mapuch","are","live","in","time","of","chang",".","The","film","tell","the","stori","of","a","famili",",","which","leav","it","home","like","everi","year","and","move","to","the","forest",",","in","order","to","gather","the","fruit",".","Therefor","the","men","climb","the","tree",",","which","can","be","as","high","as","30","meter","(","100","feet",")",".","The","fruit","is","still","the","basi","for","their","live",",","but","nowaday","the","Mapuch","sell","great","amount","of","it",",","which","provid","them","with","a","certain","financi","gain",".","In","spite","of","all","the","chang","they","still","tri","to","stick","to","their","cultur",".","This","becom","veri","obvious","when","look","at","the","interperson","relationship","in","this","famili",",","which","mean","everyth","to","them",".","From","their","ancestor","they","learn","to","appreci","valu","like","love","and","cohes",",","and","they","want","to","defend","them","against","the","new","influenc","that","they","are","face","today","."],"lemmas":["in","the","Andes","of","Southern","Chile","a","native","people","refer","to","a","tree","in","its","name",".","Mapuche","Pehuenche","-","people","of","the","Araucaria","the","fruit","of","the","tree","assure","they","survival","in","this","rough","area","for","century",".","unnoticed","by","civilization",",","they","live","a","life","which","be","threaten","at","any","time",".","today",",","civilization","also","have","reach","they","area",",","and","therefore","the","Mapuche","be","live","in","time","of","change",".","the","film","tell","the","story","of","a","family",",","which","leave","its","home","like","every","year","and","move","to","the","forest",",","in","order","to","gather","the","fruit",".","therefor","the","man","climb","the","tree",",","which","can","be","as","high","as","30","meter","-lrb-","100","foot","-rrb-",".","the","fruit","be","still","the","basis","for","they","living",",","but","nowadays","the","Mapuche","sell","great","amount","of","it",",","which","provide","they","with","a","certain","financial","gain",".","in","spite","of","all","the","change","they","still","try","to","stick","to","they","culture",".","this","become","very","obvious","when","look","at","the","interpersonal","relationship","in","this","family",",","which","mean","everything","to","they",".","from","they","ancestor","they","learn","to","appreciate","value","like","love","and","cohesion",",","and","they","want","to","defend","they","against","the","new","influence","that","they","be","face","today","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

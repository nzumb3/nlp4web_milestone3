{"title":"The Man from Elysian Fields","plot":"Byron Tiller, happily married with a young child, is a writer whose last novel has ended up in the remainder bins. Down on his luck and struggling to make ends meet, he keeps bashing away, refusing to admit that perhaps he is not that good. One day, at wit's end and feeling sorry for himself, he meets someone who has actually read his book: a rather elegant looking Englishman who introduces himself as Luther Fox. Luther runs an escort agency Elysian Fields, which provides extremely wealthy women with attractive, intelligent dates. Desperate for any job- and Luther guarantees good pay and convinces him that it can be only temporary -Byron reluctantly agrees, keeping the whole thing hidden from his wife. He soon finds himself face-to-face with an extremely attractive woman, whose aging husband is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist grappling with a novel that may be his last. Before long, Byron finds himself immersed in a world that he finds almost impossible to believe and even harder to explain.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Byron","Tiller",",","happili","marri","with","a","young","child",",","is","a","writer","whose","last","novel","has","end","up","in","the","remaind","bin",".","Down","on","his","luck","and","struggl","to","make","end","meet",",","he","keep","bash","away",",","refus","to","admit","that","perhap","he","is","not","that","good",".","One","day",",","at","wit","'s","end","and","feel","sorri","for","himself",",","he","meet","someon","who","has","actual","read","his","book",":","a","rather","eleg","look","Englishman","who","introduc","himself","as","Luther","Fox",".","Luther","run","an","escort","agenc","Elysian","Field",",","which","provid","extrem","wealthi","women","with","attract",",","intellig","date",".","Desper","for","ani","job","-","and","Luther","guarante","good","pay","and","convinc","him","that","it","can","be","onli","temporari","-","Byron","reluct","agre",",","keep","the","whole","thing","hidden","from","his","wife",".","He","soon","find","himself","face-to-fac","with","an","extrem","attract","woman",",","whose","age","husband","is","a","Pulitz","Prize-win","novelist","grappl","with","a","novel","that","may","be","his","last",".","Befor","long",",","Byron","find","himself","immers","in","a","world","that","he","find","almost","imposs","to","believ","and","even","harder","to","explain","."],"lemmas":["Byron","Tiller",",","happily","marry","with","a","young","child",",","be","a","writer","whose","last","novel","have","end","up","in","the","remainder","bin",".","down","on","he","luck","and","struggle","to","make","end","meet",",","he","keep","bash","away",",","refuse","to","admit","that","perhaps","he","be","not","that","good",".","one","day",",","at","wit","'s","end","and","feeling","sorry","for","himself",",","he","meet","someone","who","have","actually","read","he","book",":","a","rather","elegant","look","Englishman","who","introduce","himself","as","Luther","Fox",".","Luther","run","a","escort","agency","Elysian","Fields",",","which","provide","extremely","wealthy","woman","with","attractive",",","intelligent","date",".","desperate","for","any","job","-","and","Luther","guarantee","good","pay","and","convince","he","that","it","can","be","only","temporary","-","Byron","reluctantly","agree",",","keep","the","whole","thing","hide","from","he","wife",".","he","soon","find","himself","face-to-face","with","a","extremely","attractive","woman",",","whose","aging","husband","be","a","Pulitzer","prize-winning","novelist","grapple","with","a","novel","that","may","be","he","last",".","before","long",",","Byron","find","himself","immerse","in","a","world","that","he","find","almost","impossible","to","believe","and","even","harder","to","explain","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Byron Tiller ,","Tiller , happily",", happily married","happily married with","married with a","with a young","a young child","young child ,","child , is",", is a","is a writer","a writer whose","writer whose last","whose last novel","last novel has","novel has ended","has ended up","ended up in","up in the","in the remainder","the remainder bins","Down on his","on his luck","his luck and","luck and struggling","and struggling to","struggling to make","to make ends","make ends meet","ends meet ,","meet , he",", he keeps","he keeps bashing","keeps bashing away","bashing away ,","away , refusing",", refusing to","refusing to admit","to admit that","admit that perhaps","that perhaps he","perhaps he is","he is not","is not that","not that good","One day ,","day , at",", at wit","at wit 's","wit 's end","'s end and","end and feeling","and feeling sorry","feeling sorry for","sorry for himself","for himself ,","himself , he",", he meets","he meets someone","meets someone who","someone who has","who has actually","has actually read","actually read his","read his book","his book :","book : a",": a rather","a rather elegant","rather elegant looking","elegant looking Englishman","looking Englishman who","Englishman who introduces","who introduces himself","introduces himself as","himself as Luther","as Luther Fox","Luther runs an","runs an escort","an escort agency","escort agency Elysian","agency Elysian Fields","Elysian Fields ,","Fields , which",", which provides","which provides extremely","provides extremely wealthy","extremely wealthy women","wealthy women with","women with attractive","with attractive ,","attractive , intelligent",", intelligent dates","Desperate for any","for any job","any job -","job -

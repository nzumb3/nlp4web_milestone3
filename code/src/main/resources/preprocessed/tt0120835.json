{"title":"A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries","plot":"This fictionalized story, based on the family life of writer James Jones, is an emotionless slice-of-life story. Jones here is portrayed as Bill Willis, a former war hero and now successful author who obviously drinks too much and is starting to experience health problems. Living in France with his wife, daughter, and an adopted son, the family travels an unconventional road that leaves all of them as outsiders to others. Preaching a sexual freedom, his daughter's sexual acceptance begins at an early age and betrays her when the family moves to Hanover in America. Her sexuality is definitely not the normal for American teens and gives her a bad reputation and outcasts her. Meanwhile her brooding brother struggles with his own inner turmoils about his early desertion in life. Only within the tight knit confines of his family is he comfortable to even speak.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","fiction","stori",",","base","on","the","famili","life","of","writer","Jame","Jone",",","is","an","emotionless","slice-of-lif","stori",".","Jone","here","is","portray","as","Bill","Willi",",","a","former","war","hero","and","now","success","author","who","obvious","drink","too","much","and","is","start","to","experi","health","problem",".","Live","in","Franc","with","his","wife",",","daughter",",","and","an","adopt","son",",","the","famili","travel","an","unconvent","road","that","leav","all","of","them","as","outsid","to","other",".","Preach","a","sexual","freedom",",","his","daughter","'s","sexual","accept","begin","at","an","earli","age","and","betray","her","when","the","famili","move","to","Hanov","in","America",".","Her","sexual","is","definit","not","the","normal","for","American","teen","and","give","her","a","bad","reput","and","outcast","her",".","Meanwhil","her","brood","brother","struggl","with","his","own","inner","turmoil","about","his","earli","desert","in","life",".","Onli","within","the","tight","knit","confin","of","his","famili","is","he","comfort","to","even","speak","."],"lemmas":["this","fictionalized","story",",","base","on","the","family","life","of","writer","James","Jones",",","be","a","emotionless","slice-of-life","story",".","Jones","here","be","portray","as","Bill","Willis",",","a","former","war","hero","and","now","successful","author","who","obviously","drink","too","much","and","be","start","to","experience","health","problem",".","live","in","France","with","he","wife",",","daughter",",","and","a","adopted","son",",","the","family","travel","a","unconventional","road","that","leave","all","of","they","as","outsider","to","other",".","preach","a","sexual","freedom",",","he","daughter","'s","sexual","acceptance","begin","at","a","early","age","and","betray","she","when","the","family","move","to","Hanover","in","America",".","she","sexuality","be","definitely","not","the","normal","for","american","teens","and","give","she","a","bad","reputation","and","outcast","she",".","meanwhile","she","brooding","brother","struggle","with","he","own","inner","turmoil","about","he","early","desertion","in","life",".","only","within","the","tight","knit","confines","of","he","family","be","he","comfortable","to","even","speak","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

{"title":"What Goes Up","plot":"What makes a hero? January, 1986. Campbell Babbitt is a reporter for the New York World, writing a series on a woman who turned the grief of losing a son into civic acts. He falls in love with her, and when she commits suicide, he continues to write made-up stories about her. His editor sends him to New Hampshire to cover the Challenger flight from the town of teacher Christa McAuliffe. The launch is postponed for a few days, giving Campbell time to get to know a group of misfit students whose own teacher killed himself the day Campbell arrives in town. He pieces the story together that led to the suicide, finds himself attracted to a student, and has to sort out his own loss.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["What","make","a","hero","?","Januari",",","1986",".","Campbel","Babbitt","is","a","report","for","the","New","York","World",",","write","a","seri","on","a","woman","who","turn","the","grief","of","lose","a","son","into","civic","act",".","He","fall","in","love","with","her",",","and","when","she","commit","suicid",",","he","continu","to","write","made-up","stori","about","her",".","His","editor","send","him","to","New","Hampshir","to","cover","the","Challeng","flight","from","the","town","of","teacher","Christa","McAuliff",".","The","launch","is","postpon","for","a","few","day",",","give","Campbel","time","to","get","to","know","a","group","of","misfit","student","whose","own","teacher","kill","himself","the","day","Campbel","arriv","in","town",".","He","piec","the","stori","togeth","that","led","to","the","suicid",",","find","himself","attract","to","a","student",",","and","has","to","sort","out","his","own","loss","."],"lemmas":["what","make","a","hero","?","January",",","1986",".","Campbell","Babbitt","be","a","reporter","for","the","New","York","World",",","write","a","series","on","a","woman","who","turn","the","grief","of","lose","a","son","into","civic","act",".","he","fall","in","love","with","she",",","and","when","she","commit","suicide",",","he","continue","to","write","made-up","story","about","she",".","he","editor","send","he","to","New","Hampshire","to","cover","the","Challenger","flight","from","the","town","of","teacher","Christa","McAuliffe",".","the","launch","be","postpone","for","a","few","day",",","give","Campbell","time","to","get","to","know","a","group","of","misfit","student","whose","own","teacher","kill","himself","the","day","Campbell","arrive","in","town",".","he","piece","the","story","together","that","lead","to","the","suicide",",","find","himself","attract","to","a","student",",","and","have","to","sort","out","he","own","loss","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["What

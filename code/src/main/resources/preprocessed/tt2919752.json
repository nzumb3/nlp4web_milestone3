Ndoto is an orphan facing one of the biggest decisions in her life: whom she should marry. Torn between a grandmother who wants to please the spirits of the ancestors and friends who encourage her to decide for herself, Ndoto becomes more and more wrapped up in fear. Will she choose the modern world and lose her heritage? Will she marry the rich old man in the village - an arrangement that will please the ancestors and make Grandma rich? Or will she risk losing everything to follow a spirit her friends say is more powerful?","genres":["Musical"],"stems":["Nipe","Jibu","is","a","Swahili","music","which","tell","the","stori","of","a","young","woman","live","in","a","dream","world",".","Ndoto","is","an","orphan","face","one","of","the","biggest","decis","in","her","life",":","whom","she","should","marri",".","Torn","between","a","grandmoth","who","want","to","pleas","the","spirit","of","the","ancestor","and","friend","who","encourag","her","to","decid","for","herself",",","Ndoto","becom","more","and","more","wrap","up","in","fear",".","Will","she","choos","the","modern","world","and","lose","her","heritag","?","Will","she","marri","the","rich","old","man","in","the","villag","-","an","arrang","that","will","pleas","the","ancestor","and","make","Grandma","rich","?","Or","will","she","risk","lose","everyth","to","follow","a","spirit","her","friend","say","is","more","power","?"],"lemmas":["Nipe","Jibu","be","a","Swahili","musical","which","tell","the","story","of","a","young","woman","live","in","a","dream","world",".","Ndoto","be","a","orphan","face","one","of","the","biggest","decision","in","she","life",":","whom","she","should","marry",".","tear","between","a","grandmother","who","want","to","please","the","spirit","of","the","ancestor","and","friend","who","encourage","she","to","decide","for","herself",",","Ndoto","become","more","and","more","wrap","up","in","fear",".","will","she","choose","the","modern","world","and","lose","she","heritage","?","will","she","marry","the","rich","old","man","in","the","village","-","a","arrangement","that","will","please","the","ancestor","and","make","Grandma","rich","?","or","will","she","risk","lose","everything","to","follow","a","spirit","she","friend","say","be","more","powerful","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Nipe Jibu is","Jibu is a","is a Swahili","a Swahili musical","Swahili musical which","musical which tells","which tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of a","of a young","a young woman","young woman living","woman living in","living in a","in a dream","a dream world","Ndoto is an","is an orphan","an orphan facing","orphan facing one","facing one of","one of the","of the biggest","the biggest decisions","biggest decisions in","decisions in her","in her life","her life :","life : whom",": whom she","whom she should","she should marry","Torn between a","between a grandmother","a grandmother who","grandmother who wants","who wants to","wants to please","to please the","please the spirits","the spirits of","spirits of the","of the ancestors","the ancestors and","ancestors and friends","and friends who","friends who encourage","who encourage her","encourage her to","her to decide","to decide for","decide for herself","for herself ,","herself , Ndoto",", Ndoto becomes","Ndoto becomes more","becomes more and","more and more","and more wrapped","more wrapped up","wrapped up in","up in fear","Will she choose","she choose the","choose the modern","the modern world","modern world and","world and lose","and lose her","lose her heritage","Will she marry","she marry the","marry the rich","the rich old","rich old man","old man in","man in the","in the village","the village -","village -

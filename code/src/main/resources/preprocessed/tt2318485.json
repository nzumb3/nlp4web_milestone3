Accompany the intimacy of a group of artists who have found with his work a hole through the wall thanks to music, word or image. Already belong to the XXI century but have managed to incorporate the rich heritage of oral tradition of their black ancestors that arrived on the island brought from Africa as slaves. Praise yourself is a tribute to these brave women who are proud of their color and their gender.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Be","femal","and","be","black","in","Cuba","not","onli","make","you","invis",",","it","is","also","a","wall","where","your","dream","are","shatter",".","Accompani","the","intimaci","of","a","group","of","artist","who","have","found","with","his","work","a","hole","through","the","wall","thank","to","music",",","word","or","imag",".","Alreadi","belong","to","the","XXI","centuri","but","have","manag","to","incorpor","the","rich","heritag","of","oral","tradit","of","their","black","ancestor","that","arriv","on","the","island","brought","from","Africa","as","slave",".","Prais","yourself","is","a","tribut","to","these","brave","women","who","are","proud","of","their","color","and","their","gender","."],"lemmas":["be","female","and","be","black","in","Cuba","not","only","make","you","invisible",",","it","be","also","a","wall","where","you","dream","be","shatter",".","accompany","the","intimacy","of","a","group","of","artist","who","have","find","with","he","work","a","hole","through","the","wall","thanks","to","music",",","word","or","image",".","already","belong","to","the","xxi","century","but","have","manage","to","incorporate","the","rich","heritage","of","oral","tradition","of","they","black","ancestor","that","arrive","on","the","island","bring","from","Africa","as","slave",".","praise","yourself","be","a","tribute","to","these","brave","woman","who","be","proud","of","they","color","and","they","gender","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Being female and","female and being","and being black","being black in","black in Cuba","in Cuba not","Cuba not only","not only makes","only makes you","makes you invisible","you invisible ,","invisible , it",", it is","it is also","is also a","also a wall","a wall where","wall where your","where your dreams","your dreams are","dreams are shattered","Accompany the intimacy","the intimacy of","intimacy of a","of a group","a group of","group of artists","of artists who","artists who have","who have found","have found with","found with his","with his work","his work a","work a hole","a hole through","hole through the","through the wall","the wall thanks","wall thanks to","thanks to music","to music ,","music , word",", word or","word or image","Already belong to","belong to the","to the XXI","the XXI century","XXI century but","century but have","but have managed","have managed to","managed to incorporate","to incorporate the","incorporate the rich","the rich heritage","rich heritage of","heritage of oral","of oral tradition","oral tradition of","tradition of their","of their black","their black ancestors","black ancestors that","ancestors that arrived","that arrived on","arrived on the","on the island","the island brought","island brought from","brought from Africa","from Africa as","Africa as slaves","Praise yourself is","yourself is a","is a tribute","a tribute to","tribute to these","to these brave","these brave women","brave women who","women who are","who are proud","are proud of","proud of their","of their color","their color and","color and their","and their gender"],"2grams":["Being female","female and","and being","being black","black in","in Cuba","Cuba not","not only","only makes","makes you","you invisible","invisible ,",", it","it is","is also","also a","a wall","wall where","where your","your dreams","dreams are","are shattered","Accompany the","the intimacy","intimacy of","of a","a group","group of","of artists","artists who","who have","have found","found with","with his","his work","work a","a hole","hole through","through the","the wall","wall thanks","thanks to","to music","music ,",", word","word or","or image","Already belong","belong to","to the","the XXI","XXI century","century but","but have","have managed","managed to","to incorporate","incorporate the","the rich","rich heritage","heritage of","of oral","oral tradition","tradition of","of their","their black","black ancestors","ancestors that","that arrived","arrived on","on the","the island","island brought","brought from","from Africa","Africa as","as slaves","Praise yourself","yourself is","is a","a tribute","tribute to","to these","these brave","brave women","women who","who are","are proud","proud of","of their","their color","color and","and their","their gender"]}

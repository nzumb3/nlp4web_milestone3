{"title":"Mais Uma Canção","plot":"Journey for Another Song is the portrait of a pursuit. As a photograph, it captures an artist's moments. As a movie, it spreads these images along time. Sounds, dreams, ideas, reflections from a restless musician, prepared to break up boundaries, both artistic and geographical. Bebeto Alves sets off from his roots and his cultural influences on the border between Brazil and Argentina. His search for the origins of his music takes him on an unexpected journey of discovery through Morocco, Spain and Portugal.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Journey","for","Another","Song","is","the","portrait","of","a","pursuit",".","As","a","photograph",",","it","captur","an","artist","'s","moment",".","As","a","movi",",","it","spread","these","imag","along","time",".","Sound",",","dream",",","idea",",","reflect","from","a","restless","musician",",","prepar","to","break","up","boundari",",","both","artist","and","geograph",".","Bebeto","Alves","set","off","from","his","root","and","his","cultur","influenc","on","the","border","between","Brazil","and","Argentina",".","His","search","for","the","origin","of","his","music","take","him","on","an","unexpect","journey","of","discoveri","through","Morocco",",","Spain","and","Portug","."],"lemmas":["journey","for","another","song","be","the","portrait","of","a","pursuit",".","as","a","photograph",",","it","capture","a","artist","'s","moment",".","as","a","movie",",","it","spread","these","image","along","time",".","sound",",","dream",",","idea",",","reflection","from","a","restless","musician",",","prepare","to","break","up","boundary",",","both","artistic","and","geographical",".","Bebeto","Alves","set","off","from","he","root","and","he","cultural","influence","on","the","border","between","Brazil","and","Argentina",".","he","search","for","the","origin","of","he","music","take","he","on","a","unexpected","journey","of","discovery","through","Morocco",",","Spain","and","Portugal","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Journey for Another","for Another Song","Another Song is","Song is the","is the portrait","the portrait of","portrait of a","of a pursuit","As a photograph","a photograph ,","photograph , it",", it captures","it captures an","captures an artist","an artist 's","artist 's moments","As a movie","a movie ,","movie , it",", it spreads","it spreads these","spreads these images","these images along","images along time","Sounds , dreams",", dreams ,","dreams , ideas",", ideas ,","ideas , reflections",", reflections from","reflections from a","from a restless","a restless musician","restless musician ,","musician , prepared",", prepared to","prepared to break","to break up","break up boundaries","up boundaries ,","boundaries , both",", both artistic","both artistic and","artistic and geographical","Bebeto Alves sets","Alves sets off","sets off from","off from his","from his roots","his roots and","roots and his","and his cultural","his cultural influences","cultural influences on","influences on the","on the border","the border between","border between Brazil","between Brazil and","Brazil and Argentina","His search for","search for the","for the origins","the origins of","origins of his","of his music","his music takes","music takes him","takes him on","him on an","on an unexpected","an unexpected journey","unexpected journey of","journey of discovery","of discovery through","discovery through Morocco","through Morocco ,","Morocco , Spain",", Spain and","Spain and Portugal"],"2grams":["Journey for","for Another","Another Song","Song is","is the","the portrait","portrait of","of a","a pursuit","As a","a photograph","photograph ,",", it","it captures","captures an","an artist","artist 's","'s moments","As a","a movie","movie ,",", it","it spreads","spreads these","these images","images along","along time","Sounds ,",", dreams","dreams ,",", ideas","ideas ,",", reflections","reflections from","from a","a restless","restless musician","musician ,",", prepared","prepared to","to break","break up","up boundaries","boundaries ,",", both","both artistic","artistic and","and geographical","Bebeto Alves","Alves sets","sets off","off from","from his","his roots","roots and","and his","his cultural","cultural influences","influences on","on the","the border","border between","between Brazil","Brazil and","and Argentina","His search","search for","for the","the origins","origins of","of his","his music","music takes","takes him","him on","on an","an unexpected","unexpected journey","journey of","of discovery","discovery through","through Morocco","Morocco ,",", Spain","Spain and","and Portugal"]}

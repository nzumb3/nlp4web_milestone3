{"title":"Saints and Soldiers: Airborne Creed","plot":"On August 15, 1944 the 517th Parachute Regimental Combat Team (PRCT) jumped over the south of France. Their mission was to support and protect the Allied Troops marching to Berlin. Landing in enemy territory, they fell under immediate attack. In their effort to complete the mission and rendez-vous with their unit, three isolated paratroopers come across a group of French resistants in desperate need. They decide to help liberate some of the captive Partisans. Doing so they will risk their lives.","genres":["Action"," War"," Drama"],"stems":["On","August","15",",","1944","the","517th","Parachut","Regiment","Combat","Team","(","PRCT",")","jump","over","the","south","of","Franc",".","Their","mission","was","to","support","and","protect","the","Alli","Troop","march","to","Berlin",".","Land","in","enemi","territori",",","they","fell","under","immedi","attack",".","In","their","effort","to","complet","the","mission","and","rendez-v","with","their","unit",",","three","isol","paratroop","come","across","a","group","of","French","resist","in","desper","need",".","They","decid","to","help","liber","some","of","the","captiv","Partisan",".","Do","so","they","will","risk","their","live","."],"lemmas":["on","August","15",",","1944","the","517th","Parachute","Regimental","Combat","Team","-lrb-","PRCT","-rrb-","jump","over","the","south","of","France",".","they","mission","be","to","support","and","protect","the","Allied","Troops","march","to","Berlin",".","landing","in","enemy","territory",",","they","fall","under","immediate","attack",".","in","they","effort","to","complete","the","mission","and","rendez-vous","with","they","unit",",","three","isolate","paratrooper","come","across","a","group","of","french","resistant","in","desperate","need",".","they","decide","to","help","liberate","some","of","the","captive","partisan",".","do","so","they","will","risk","they","life","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["On August 15","August 15 ,","15 , 1944",", 1944 the","1944 the 517th","the 517th Parachute","517th Parachute Regimental","Parachute Regimental Combat","Regimental Combat Team","Combat Team (","Team ( PRCT","( PRCT )","PRCT ) jumped",") jumped over","jumped over the","over the south","the south of","south of France","Their mission was","mission was to","was to support","to support and","support and protect","and protect the","protect the Allied","the Allied Troops","Allied Troops marching","Troops marching to","marching to Berlin","Landing in enemy","in enemy territory","enemy territory ,","territory , they",", they fell","they fell under","fell under immediate","under immediate attack","In their effort","their effort to","effort to complete","to complete the","complete the mission","the mission and","mission and rendez-vous","and rendez-vous with","rendez-vous with their","with their unit","their unit ,","unit , three",", three isolated","three isolated paratroopers","isolated paratroopers come","paratroopers come across","come across a","across a group","a group of","group of French","of French resistants","French resistants in","resistants in desperate","in desperate need","They decide to","decide to help","to help liberate","help liberate some","liberate some of","some of the","of the captive","the captive Partisans","Doing so they","so they will","they will risk","will risk their","risk their lives"],"2grams":["On August","August 15","15 ,",", 1944","1944 the","the 517th","517th Parachute","Parachute Regimental","Regimental Combat","Combat Team","Team (","( PRCT","PRCT )",") jumped","jumped over","over the","the south","south of","of France","Their mission","mission was","was to","to support","support and","and protect","protect the","the Allied","Allied Troops","Troops marching","marching to","to Berlin","Landing in","in enemy","enemy territory","territory ,",", they","they fell","fell under","under immediate","immediate attack","In their","their effort","effort to","to complete","complete the","the mission","mission and","and rendez-vous","rendez-vous with","with their","their unit","unit ,",", three","three isolated","isolated paratroopers","paratroopers come","come across","across a","a group","group of","of French","French resistants","resistants in","in desperate","desperate need","They decide","decide to","to help","help liberate","liberate some","some of","of the","the captive","captive Partisans","Doing so","so they","they will","will risk","risk their","their lives"]}

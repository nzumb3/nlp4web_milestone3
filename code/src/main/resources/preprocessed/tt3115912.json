{"title":"The Road Ahead of U.S.","plot":"Never really having gone far from home before, a senior in college realizes the uncertainty of the life ahead of him and builds up the courage to embark on a cross-country road trip to find answers to his questions of life and 'The American Dream.' Recruiting five of his closest friends, they set out on a road trip of epic proportions: New York to California, following the southern route. Hitting New York, Washington D.C., North Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada & California, it is a snapshot of America as a whole, and a glimpse into the lives of people all across the country who you would never ordinarily get to meet. A learning experience, and an experience of a lifetime, that will show how much you can really change your life in 16 days... by just getting in your car and driving.","genres":["Adventure"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Never","realli","have","gone","far","from","home","befor",",","a","senior","in","colleg","realiz","the","uncertainti","of","the","life","ahead","of","him","and","build","up","the","courag","to","embark","on","a","cross-countri","road","trip","to","find","answer","to","his","question","of","life","and","'","The","American","Dream",".","'","Recruit","five","of","his","closest","friend",",","they","set","out","on","a","road","trip","of","epic","proport",":","New","York","to","California",",","follow","the","southern","rout",".","Hit","New","York",",","Washington","D.C.",",","North","Carolina",",","Georgia",",","Alabama",",","Louisiana",",","Texa",",","New","Mexico",",","Arizona",",","Nevada","&","California",",","it","is","a","snapshot","of","America","as","a","whole",",","and","a","glimps","into","the","live","of","peopl","all","across","the","countri","who","you","would","never","ordinarili","get","to","meet",".","A","learn","experi",",","and","an","experi","of","a","lifetim",",","that","will","show","how","much","you","can","realli","chang","your","life","in","16","day","...","by","just","get","in","your","car","and","drive","."],"lemmas":["never","really","have","go","far","from","home","before",",","a","senior","in","college","realize","the","uncertainty","of","the","life","ahead","of","he","and","build","up","the","courage","to","embark","on","a","cross-country","road","trip","to","find","answer","to","he","question","of","life","and","'","the","american","dream",".","'","recruit","five","of","he","closest","friend",",","they","set","out","on","a","road","trip","of","epic","proportion",":","New","York","to","California",",","follow","the","southern","route",".","hit","New","York",",","Washington","D.C.",",","North","Carolina",",","Georgia",",","Alabama",",","Louisiana",",","Texas",",","New","Mexico",",","Arizona",",","Nevada","&","California",",","it","be","a","snapshot","of","America","as","a","whole",",","and","a","glimpse","into","the","life","of","people","all","across","the","country","who","you","would","never","ordinarily","get","to","meet",".","a","learning","experience",",","and","a","experience","of","a","lifetime",",","that","will","show","how","much","you","can","really","change","you","life","in","16","day","...","by","just","get","in","you","car","and","driving","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Never really having","really having gone","having gone far","gone far from","far from home","from home before","home before ,","before , a",", a senior","a senior in","senior in college","in college realizes","college realizes the","realizes the uncertainty","the uncertainty of","uncertainty of the","of the life","the life ahead","life ahead of","ahead of him","of him and","him and builds","and builds up","builds up the","up the courage","the courage to","courage to embark","to embark on","embark on a","on a cross-country","a cross-country road","cross-country road trip","road trip to","trip to find","to find answers","find answers to","answers to his","to his questions","his questions of","questions of life","of life and","life and '","and ' The","' The American","The American Dream","American Dream .","Dream .

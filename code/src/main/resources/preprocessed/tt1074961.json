{"title":"FreeLance","plot":"Elliot Guillespsie dreams of being the worlds greatest investigative reporter, ala his idol, Rod Reel. A daunting task considering he is both camera man and reporter, can't drive, and still lives in his mother's basement. Further complicating matters is Roy Henry who, as Elliot's childhood bully tortured the boy, and is now a born again Christian/recovering alcoholic seeking forgiveness. He is also seeing Elliot's mother. Elliot escapes an unacceptable home life in the guise of Lance Windchaser, his journalistic alter-ego. He enlists Toby, a suburban taxi driver, to be his cameraman, which Toby accepts in an attempt to escape his own hellacious home life. The two become unlikely friends, and patrol the streets of their suburban home in search of the big scoop. Problem is, news in the little city is just hard to come by. This does not dissuade Elliot's enthusiasm, and he finds great joy in reporting the most mundane of stories. His home life continues to deteriorate as his commitment to the news supersedes all of his other responsibilities. When he receives a letter from his idol ridiculing his efforts, Elliot snaps, and begins a psychotic vandalism/reporting spree whose consequences may very well allow Elliot to truly MAKE the news.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Elliot","Guillespsi","dream","of","be","the","world","greatest","investig","report",",","ala","his","idol",",","Rod","Reel",".","A","daunt","task","consid","he","is","both","camera","man","and","report",",","ca","n't","drive",",","and","still","live","in","his","mother","'s","basement",".","Further","complic","matter","is","Roy","Henri","who",",","as","Elliot","'s","childhood","bulli","tortur","the","boy",",","and","is","now","a","born","again","Christian/recov","alcohol","seek","forgiv",".","He","is","also","see","Elliot","'s","mother",".","Elliot","escap","an","unaccept","home","life","in","the","guis","of","Lanc","Windchas",",","his","journalist","alter-ego",".","He","enlist","Tobi",",","a","suburban","taxi","driver",",","to","be","his","cameraman",",","which","Tobi","accept","in","an","attempt","to","escap","his","own","hellaci","home","life",".","The","two","becom","unlik","friend",",","and","patrol","the","street","of","their","suburban","home","in","search","of","the","big","scoop",".","Problem","is",",","news","in","the","littl","citi","is","just","hard","to","come","by",".","This","doe","not","dissuad","Elliot","'s","enthusiasm",",","and","he","find","great","joy","in","report","the","most","mundan","of","stori",".","His","home","life","continu","to","deterior","as","his","commit","to","the","news","supersed","all","of","his","other","respons",".","When","he","receiv","a","letter","from","his","idol","ridicul","his","effort",",","Elliot","snap",",","and","begin","a","psychot","vandalism/report","spree","whose","consequ","may","veri","well","allow","Elliot","to","truli","MAKE","the","news","."],"lemmas":["Elliot","Guillespsie","dream","of","be","the","world","greatest","investigative","reporter",",","ala","he","idol",",","Rod","Reel",".","a","daunting","task","consider","he","be","both","camera","man","and","reporter",",","can","not","drive",",","and","still","live","in","he","mother","'s","basement",".","further","complicate","matter","be","Roy","Henry","who",",","as","Elliot","'s","childhood","bully","tortured","the","boy",",","and","be","now","a","bear","again","christian/recovering","alcoholic","seek","forgiveness",".","he","be","also","see","Elliot","'s","mother",".","Elliot","escape","a","unacceptable","home","life","in","the","guise","of","Lance","Windchaser",",","he","journalistic","alter-ego",".","he","enlist","Toby",",","a","suburban","taxi","driver",",","to","be","he","cameraman",",","which","Toby","accept","in","a","attempt","to","escape","he","own","hellacious","home","life",".","the","two","become","unlikely","friend",",","and","patrol","the","street","of","they","suburban","home","in","search","of","the","big","scoop",".","Problem","be",",","news","in","the","little","city","be","just","hard","to","come","by",".","this","do","not","dissuade","Elliot","'s","enthusiasm",",","and","he","find","great","joy","in","report","the","most","mundane","of","story",".","he","home","life","continue","to","deteriorate","as","he","commitment","to","the","news","supersede","all","of","he","other","responsibility",".","when","he","receive","a","letter","from","he","idol","ridicule","he","effort",",","Elliot","snap",",","and","begin","a","psychotic","vandalism/reporting","spree","whose","consequence","may","very","well","allow","Elliot","to","truly","make","the","news","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Elliot

Shortly thereafter he also agrees to teach music at the request of Nutritionist, Anjali Mathur. With the school facing shortage of funds, pressure is being brought by Manager Lallan Sharma to try to get students' parents to pay more for a variety of activities. When the Principal, Aditya Sahay, supports Lallan, the students and staff are forced to raise funds. Despite of their best efforts, however, a stage will be set for a much-publicized confrontation that may well result in the closure of this institution.","genres":["Drama","

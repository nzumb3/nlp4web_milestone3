{"title":"Lumpinee","plot":"The story takes place at a boxing camp in a small community in southern Thailand. Destiny leads kids of varied backgrounds and purposes to travel to the boxing camp. Some join the camp because they love boxing. Some are homeless drifters; impoverished, drug addicted, or charged with filching. Some simply need a shelter, kids who view Thai boxing as life's last resort. They live together in this boxing camp that turns into a small society filled with both friendship and conflict - all centering and leaning on Thai boxing and Uncle Sak, the camp's owner. The boxing camp thus resembles a juvenile rehab home or a mental rehab center. Its strict rules of behavior and rigid boxing training serve as potent medicines in rectifying the kids' mind and body, and Uncle Sak's loving kindness towards the kids inspires them to look up to him as an adopted father. Uncle Sak, in turn, aims to breed the supreme Thai boxing from the South, so that one day his boxers could make their way up the rank and have the chance to fight against Bangkok giant camps' boxers. His ultimate dream: Lumpinee Stadium Thai Boxing Championship Belts. A budding boxing life not only gives the kids a new life but also grants them the vision of hope. They open up their mind, revealing their dream, on a journey that the only thing available for them to hold on to is determination and faith. They journey ahead in a quest for victory and social acceptance, perhaps attainable in the short moment when the winner's hand is help up high on the ring, the only life's greatest merit they want to seize.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport","

{"title":"The Last Days of Emma Blank","plot":"Mr. Haneveld runs the household like a devoted butler in Emma Blank's Dutch seaside villa. It's a crazy mix of disgruntled staff, unstable lovers and incestuous offspring, constantly harassed by Emma's absurdly inconsistent orders. Her brother Theo even literally plays the family dog. Only Gonnie, Hanevlet and Emma's daughter, finds an external lover, Martin, who later shares in their pointless misery. When Emma discloses the inheritance everyone waited for without pay is lost in stock crises, only the house is left, a grim finale ensues.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Mr.","Haneveld","run","the","household","like","a","devot","butler","in","Emma","Blank","'s","Dutch","seasid","villa",".","It","'s","a","crazi","mix","of","disgruntl","staff",",","unstabl","lover","and","incestu","offspr",",","constant","harass","by","Emma","'s","absurd","inconsist","order",".","Her","brother","Theo","even","liter","play","the","famili","dog",".","Onli","Gonni",",","Hanevlet","and","Emma","'s","daughter",",","find","an","extern","lover",",","Martin",",","who","later","share","in","their","pointless","miseri",".","When","Emma","disclos","the","inherit","everyon","wait","for","without","pay","is","lost","in","stock","crise",",","onli","the","hous","is","left",",","a","grim","final","ensu","."],"lemmas":["Mr.","Haneveld","run","the","household","like","a","devoted","butler","in","Emma","Blank","'s","dutch","seaside","villa",".","it","be","a","crazy","mix","of","disgruntled","staff",",","unstable","lover","and","incestuous","offspring",",","constantly","harass","by","Emma","'s","absurdly","inconsistent","order",".","she","brother","Theo","even","literally","play","the","family","dog",".","only","Gonnie",",","Hanevlet","and","Emma","'s","daughter",",","find","a","external","lover",",","Martin",",","who","later","share","in","they","pointless","misery",".","when","Emma","disclose","the","inheritance","everyone","wait","for","without","pay","be","lose","in","stock","crisis",",","only","the","house","be","leave",",","a","grim","finale","ensue","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mr. Haneveld runs","Haneveld runs the","runs the household","the household like","household like a","like a devoted","a devoted butler","devoted butler in","butler in Emma","in Emma Blank","Emma Blank 's","Blank 's Dutch","'s Dutch seaside","Dutch seaside villa","It 's a","'s a crazy","a crazy mix","crazy mix of","mix of disgruntled","of disgruntled staff","disgruntled staff ,","staff , unstable",", unstable lovers","unstable lovers and","lovers and incestuous","and incestuous offspring","incestuous offspring ,","offspring , constantly",", constantly harassed","constantly harassed by","harassed by Emma","by Emma 's","Emma 's absurdly","'s absurdly inconsistent","absurdly inconsistent orders","Her brother Theo","brother Theo even","Theo even literally","even literally plays","literally plays the","plays the family","the family dog","Only Gonnie ,","Gonnie , Hanevlet",", Hanevlet and","Hanevlet and Emma","and Emma 's","Emma 's daughter","'s daughter ,","daughter , finds",", finds an","finds an external","an external lover","external lover ,","lover , Martin",", Martin ,","Martin , who",", who later","who later shares","later shares in","shares in their","in their pointless","their pointless misery","When Emma discloses","Emma discloses the","discloses the inheritance","the inheritance everyone","inheritance everyone waited","everyone waited for","waited for without","for without pay","without pay is","pay is lost","is lost in","lost in stock","in stock crises","stock crises ,","crises , only",", only the","only the house","the house is","house is left","is left ,","left , a",", a grim","a grim finale","grim finale ensues"],"2grams":["Mr. Haneveld","Haneveld runs","runs the","the household","household like","like a","a devoted","devoted butler","butler in","in Emma","Emma Blank","Blank 's","'s Dutch","Dutch seaside","seaside villa","It 's","'s a","a crazy","crazy mix","mix of","of disgruntled","disgruntled staff","staff ,",", unstable","unstable lovers","lovers and","and incestuous","incestuous offspring","offspring ,",", constantly","constantly harassed","harassed by","by Emma","Emma 's","'s absurdly","absurdly inconsistent","inconsistent orders","Her brother","brother Theo","Theo even","even literally","literally plays","plays the","the family","family dog","Only Gonnie","Gonnie ,",", Hanevlet","Hanevlet and","and Emma","Emma 's","'s daughter","daughter ,",", finds","finds an","an external","external lover","lover ,",", Martin","Martin ,",", who","who later","later shares","shares in","in their","their pointless","pointless misery","When Emma","Emma discloses","discloses the","the inheritance","inheritance everyone","everyone waited","waited for","for without","without pay","pay is","is lost","lost in","in stock","stock crises","crises ,",", only","only the","the house","house is","is left","left ,",", a","a grim","grim finale","finale ensues"]}

{"title":"The Girl in the Park","plot":"Enduringly traumatized by the disappearance of her 3-year-old daughter 15 years ago, Julia Sandburg has cut herself off from anyone once near and dear to her, including her husband Doug and her son Chris, who tried for years to penetrate her wall of isolation and despair, without success. But when Julia meets Louise, a troubled young woman with a checkered past, all Julia's old psychic wounds painfully resurface, as does her illogical and increasingly irrational hope that Louise may be the daughter she lost so long ago.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Endure","traumat","by","the","disappear","of","her","3-year-old","daughter","15","year","ago",",","Julia","Sandburg","has","cut","herself","off","from","anyon","onc","near","and","dear","to","her",",","includ","her","husband","Doug","and","her","son","Chris",",","who","tri","for","year","to","penetr","her","wall","of","isol","and","despair",",","without","success",".","But","when","Julia","meet","Louis",",","a","troubl","young","woman","with","a","checker","past",",","all","Julia","'s","old","psychic","wound","pain","resurfac",",","as","doe","her","illog","and","increas","irrat","hope","that","Louis","may","be","the","daughter","she","lost","so","long","ago","."],"lemmas":["enduringly","traumatize","by","the","disappearance","of","she","3-year-old","daughter","15","year","ago",",","Julia","Sandburg","have","cut","herself","off","from","anyone","once","near","and","dear","to","she",",","include","she","husband","Doug","and","she","son","Chris",",","who","try","for","year","to","penetrate","she","wall","of","isolation","and","despair",",","without","success",".","but","when","Julia","meet","Louise",",","a","troubled","young","woman","with","a","checkered","past",",","all","Julia","'s","old","psychic","wound","painfully","resurface",",","as","do","she","illogical","and","increasingly","irrational","hope","that","Louise","may","be","the","daughter","she","lose","so","long","ago","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Enduringly traumatized by","traumatized by the","by the disappearance","the disappearance of","disappearance of her","of her 3-year-old","her 3-year-old daughter","3-year-old daughter 15","daughter 15 years","15 years ago","years ago ,","ago , Julia",", Julia Sandburg","Julia Sandburg has","Sandburg has cut","has cut herself","cut herself off","herself off from","off from anyone","from anyone once","anyone once near","once near and","near and dear","and dear to","dear to her","to her ,","her , including",", including her","including her husband","her husband Doug","husband Doug and","Doug and her","and her son","her son Chris","son Chris ,","Chris , who",", who tried","who tried for","tried for years","for years to","years to penetrate","to penetrate her","penetrate her wall","her wall of","wall of isolation","of isolation and","isolation and despair","and despair ,","despair , without",", without success","But when Julia","when Julia meets","Julia meets Louise","meets Louise ,","Louise , a",", a troubled","a troubled young","troubled young woman","young woman with","woman with a","with a checkered","a checkered past","checkered past ,","past , all",", all Julia","all Julia 's","Julia 's old","'s old psychic","old psychic wounds","psychic wounds painfully","wounds painfully resurface","painfully resurface ,","resurface , as",", as does","as does her","does her illogical","her illogical and","illogical and increasingly","and increasingly irrational","increasingly irrational hope","irrational hope that","hope that Louise","that Louise may","Louise may be","may be the","be the daughter","the daughter she","daughter she lost","she lost so","lost so long","so long ago"],"2grams":["Enduringly traumatized","traumatized by","by the","the disappearance","disappearance of","of her","her 3-year-old","3-year-old daughter","daughter 15","15 years","years ago","ago ,",", Julia","Julia Sandburg","Sandburg has","has cut","cut herself","herself off","off from","from anyone","anyone once","once near","near and","and dear","dear to","to her","her ,",", including","including her","her husband","husband Doug","Doug and","and her","her son","son Chris","Chris ,",", who","who tried","tried for","for years","years to","to penetrate","penetrate her","her wall","wall of","of isolation","isolation and","and despair","despair ,",", without","without success","But when","when Julia","Julia meets","meets Louise","Louise ,",", a","a troubled","troubled young","young woman","woman with","with a","a checkered","checkered past","past ,",", all","all Julia","Julia 's","'s old","old psychic","psychic wounds","wounds painfully","painfully resurface","resurface ,",", as","as does","does her","her illogical","illogical and","and increasingly","increasingly irrational","irrational hope","hope that","that Louise","Louise may","may be","be the","the daughter","daughter she","she lost","lost so","so long","long ago"]}

{"title":"Insulo de la Rozoj - La liberta fa paura","plot":"It's the summer of 1968. In the open sea, out of the coasts of Rimini, an Italian engineer proclaims the independence of a nation risen on a platform built by himself during ten years of works and experiments. It's birth certificate of the 'Libera teritorio de la Insulo de la Rozoj', esperanto translation of 'Free territory of Rose Island'. This structure in the middle of the Adriatic sea becomes an international case stirring up both fears and hopes. A disputed event which crosses the social and political climate of sixty-eight's Italy, whose epilogue is enclosed in a sentence by engineer Giorgio Rosa, the father of the island: freedom is frightening. The movie brings to light the history of an utopia, following the life of a man who was brave enough to dream.","genres":["Documentary","

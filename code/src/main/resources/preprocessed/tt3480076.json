{"title":"All Points North","plot":"\"It certainly will be a different Europe, not like here in Greece\", states Laurent in an assuring voice. The dream of heading North is the driving motivation for Laurent and Ibrahim, two young men leaving their country of Senegal in search of a better life.As undocumented migrants, they find themselves trapped in Greece, bound to the Greek borders by the lack of immigration papers. Before leaving their homeland their impressions of Europe were very different from the harsh realities they faced once arriving. For migrants such as Laurent and Ibrahim, there is no stability in a better, safer land; their journeys to find such are continually ongoing.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["\"","It","certain","will","be","a","differ","Europ",",","not","like","here","in","Greec","\"",",","state","Laurent","in","an","assur","voic",".","The","dream","of","head","North","is","the","drive","motiv","for","Laurent","and","Ibrahim",",","two","young","men","leav","their","countri","of","Seneg","in","search","of","a","better","life.A","undocu","migrant",",","they","find","themselv","trap","in","Greec",",","bound","to","the","Greek","border","by","the","lack","of","immigr","paper",".","Befor","leav","their","homeland","their","impress","of","Europ","were","veri","differ","from","the","harsh","realiti","they","face","onc","arriv",".","For","migrant","such","as","Laurent","and","Ibrahim",",","there","is","no","stabil","in","a","better",",","safer","land",";","their","journey","to","find","such","are","continu","ongo","."],"lemmas":["``","it","certainly","will","be","a","different","Europe",",","not","like","here","in","Greece","''",",","state","Laurent","in","a","assure","voice",".","the","dream","of","head","North","be","the","drive","motivation","for","Laurent","and","Ibrahim",",","two","young","man","leave","they","country","of","Senegal","in","search","of","a","better","life.as","undocumented","migrant",",","they","find","themselves","trapped","in","Greece",",","bind","to","the","greek","border","by","the","lack","of","immigration","papers",".","before","leave","they","homeland","they","impression","of","Europe","be","very","different","from","the","harsh","reality","they","face","once","arrive",".","for","migrant","such","as","Laurent","and","Ibrahim",",","there","be","no","stability","in","a","better",",","safer","land",";","they","journey","to","find","such","be","continually","ongoing","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" It certainly","It certainly will","certainly will be","will be a","be a different","a different Europe","different Europe ,","Europe , not",", not like","not like here","like here in","here in Greece","in Greece \"","Greece \" ,","\" , states",", states Laurent","states Laurent in","Laurent in an","in an assuring","an assuring voice","The dream of","dream of heading","of heading North","heading North is","North is the","is the driving","the driving motivation","driving motivation for","motivation for Laurent","for Laurent and","Laurent and Ibrahim","and Ibrahim ,","Ibrahim , two",", two young","two young men","young men leaving","men leaving their","leaving their country","their country of","country of Senegal","of Senegal in","Senegal in search","in search of","search of a","of a better","a better life.As","better life.As undocumented","life.As undocumented migrants","undocumented migrants ,","migrants , they",", they find","they find themselves","find themselves trapped","themselves trapped in","trapped in Greece","in Greece ,","Greece , bound",", bound to","bound to the","to the Greek","the Greek borders","Greek borders by","borders by the","by the lack","the lack of","lack of immigration","of immigration papers","Before leaving their","leaving their homeland","their homeland their","homeland their impressions","their impressions of","impressions of Europe","of Europe were","Europe were very","were very different","very different from","different from the","from the harsh","the harsh realities","harsh realities they","realities they faced","they faced once","faced once arriving","For migrants such","migrants such as","such as Laurent","as Laurent and","Laurent and Ibrahim","and Ibrahim ,","Ibrahim , there",", there is","there is no","is no stability","no stability in","stability in a","in a better","a better ,","better , safer",", safer land","safer land ;","land ;

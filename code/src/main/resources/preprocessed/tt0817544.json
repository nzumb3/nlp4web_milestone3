{"title":"Never Forever","plot":"Sophie Lee has been trying unsuccessfully to get pregnant. Her husband's family, devout Korean Catholics, prays for the couple. His failure to have a child is deeply shameful to him, so when he attempts suicide, Sophie tries something extreme: she follows an undocumented immigrant - a Korean who resembles her husband - from a fertility clinic to his apartment in New York City where she proposes to hire him to sire her child. She offers $300 per session and $30,000 if she gets pregnant. After several sessions, neither is able to keep emotion out of the arrangement. Where can this relationship go, and what about her husband? Will her actions save him and their marriage?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Sophi","Lee","has","been","tri","unsuccess","to","get","pregnant",".","Her","husband","'s","famili",",","devout","Korean","Cathol",",","pray","for","the","coupl",".","His","failur","to","have","a","child","is","deepli","shame","to","him",",","so","when","he","attempt","suicid",",","Sophi","tri","someth","extrem",":","she","follow","an","undocu","immigr","-","a","Korean","who","resembl","her","husband","-","from","a","fertil","clinic","to","his","apart","in","New","York","Citi","where","she","propos","to","hire","him","to","sire","her","child",".","She","offer","$","300","per","session","and","$","30,000","if","she","get","pregnant",".","After","sever","session",",","neither","is","abl","to","keep","emot","out","of","the","arrang",".","Where","can","this","relationship","go",",","and","what","about","her","husband","?","Will","her","action","save","him","and","their","marriag","?"],"lemmas":["Sophie","Lee","have","be","try","unsuccessfully","to","get","pregnant",".","she","husband","'s","family",",","devout","Korean","Catholics",",","pray","for","the","couple",".","he","failure","to","have","a","child","be","deeply","shameful","to","he",",","so","when","he","attempt","suicide",",","Sophie","try","something","extreme",":","she","follow","a","undocumented","immigrant","-","a","Korean","who","resemble","she","husband","-","from","a","fertility","clinic","to","he","apartment","in","New","York","City","where","she","propose","to","hire","he","to","sire","she","child",".","she","offer","$","300","per","session","and","$","30,000","if","she","get","pregnant",".","after","several","session",",","neither","be","able","to","keep","emotion","out","of","the","arrangement",".","where","can","this","relationship","go",",","and","what","about","she","husband","?","will","she","action","save","he","and","they","marriage","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Sophie Lee has","Lee has been","has been trying","been trying unsuccessfully","trying unsuccessfully to","unsuccessfully to get","to get pregnant","Her husband 's","husband 's family","'s family ,","family , devout",", devout Korean","devout Korean Catholics","Korean Catholics ,","Catholics , prays",", prays for","prays for the","for the couple","His failure to","failure to have","to have a","have a child","a child is","child is deeply","is deeply shameful","deeply shameful to","shameful to him","to him ,","him , so",", so when","so when he","when he attempts","he attempts suicide","attempts suicide ,","suicide , Sophie",", Sophie tries","Sophie tries something","tries something extreme","something extreme :","extreme : she",": she follows","she follows an","follows an undocumented","an undocumented immigrant","undocumented immigrant -","immigrant -

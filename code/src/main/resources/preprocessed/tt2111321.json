{"title":"Hawk(e): The Movie","plot":"Movie-maker-come-idiot Mike Hawk sets about making his latest movie, a Rom-Com called \"Get Becky Laid\", and is followed in his pursuits by documentary maker and film fanatic Philip K Longfellow. Mike Hawk also plays the lead character and has named him Mike Hawke - after himself only adding an additional 'e' to his name to distinguish the two. Mike's bitten off more than he can chew, and is followed as he gets through the making of the film, achieving it only through sheer determination and ignorance.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Movie-maker-come-idiot","Mike","Hawk","set","about","make","his","latest","movi",",","a","Rom-Com","call","\"","Get","Becki","Laid","\"",",","and","is","follow","in","his","pursuit","by","documentari","maker","and","film","fanat","Philip","K","Longfellow",".","Mike","Hawk","also","play","the","lead","charact","and","has","name","him","Mike","Hawk","-","after","himself","onli","ad","an","addit","'","e","'","to","his","name","to","distinguish","the","two",".","Mike","'s","bitten","off","more","than","he","can","chew",",","and","is","follow","as","he","get","through","the","make","of","the","film",",","achiev","it","onli","through","sheer","determin","and","ignor","."],"lemmas":["movie-maker-come-idiot","Mike","Hawk","set","about","make","he","latest","movie",",","a","Rom-Com","call","``","get","Becky","Laid","''",",","and","be","follow","in","he","pursuit","by","documentary","maker","and","film","fanatic","Philip","K","Longfellow",".","Mike","Hawk","also","play","the","lead","character","and","have","name","he","Mike","Hawke","-","after","himself","only","add","a","additional","'","e","'","to","he","name","to","distinguish","the","two",".","Mike","'s","bite","off","more","than","he","can","chew",",","and","be","follow","as","he","get","through","the","making","of","the","film",",","achieve","it","only","through","sheer","determination","and","ignorance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Movie-maker-come-idiot Mike Hawk","Mike Hawk sets","Hawk sets about","sets about making","about making his","making his latest","his latest movie","latest movie ,","movie , a",", a Rom-Com","a Rom-Com called","Rom-Com called \"","called \" Get","\" Get Becky","Get Becky Laid","Becky Laid \"","Laid \" ,","\" , and",", and is","and is followed","is followed in","followed in his","in his pursuits","his pursuits by","pursuits by documentary","by documentary maker","documentary maker and","maker and film","and film fanatic","film fanatic Philip","fanatic Philip K","Philip K Longfellow","Mike Hawk also","Hawk also plays","also plays the","plays the lead","the lead character","lead character and","character and has","and has named","has named him","named him Mike","him Mike Hawke","Mike Hawke -","Hawke - after","- after himself","after himself only","himself only adding","only adding an","adding an additional","an additional '","additional ' e","' e '","e ' to","' to his","to his name","his name to","name to distinguish","to distinguish the","distinguish the two","Mike 's bitten","'s bitten off","bitten off more","off more than","more than he","than he can","he can chew","can chew ,","chew , and",", and is","and is followed","is followed as","followed as he","as he gets","he gets through","gets through the","through the making","the making of","making of the","of the film","the film ,","film , achieving",", achieving it","achieving it only","it only through","only through sheer","through sheer determination","sheer determination and","determination and ignorance"],"2grams":["Movie-maker-come-idiot Mike","Mike Hawk","Hawk sets","sets about","about making","making his","his latest","latest movie","movie ,",", a","a Rom-Com","Rom-Com called","called \"","\" Get","Get Becky","Becky Laid","Laid \"","\" ,",", and","and is","is followed","followed in","in his","his pursuits","pursuits by","by documentary","documentary maker","maker and","and film","film fanatic","fanatic Philip","Philip K","K Longfellow","Mike Hawk","Hawk also","also plays","plays the","the lead","lead character","character and","and has","has named","named him","him Mike","Mike Hawke","Hawke -","- after","after himself","himself only","only adding","adding an","an additional","additional '","' e","e '","' to","to his","his name","name to","to distinguish","distinguish the","the two","Mike 's","'s bitten","bitten off","off more","more than","than he","he can","can chew","chew ,",", and","and is","is followed","followed as","as he","he gets","gets through","through the","the making","making of","of the","the film","film ,",", achieving","achieving it","it only","only through","through sheer","sheer determination","determination and","and ignorance"]}

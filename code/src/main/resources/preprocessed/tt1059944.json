{"title":"Minushi","plot":"Minushi is an epic story of the human spirit thrust into an unforgiving world of wicked villains, harsh landscapes and fiery conflicts. From within a city under martial law Trixi, an orphan, sets off on a journey to find the only family she's ever known; her older brother, Griffin. Joining her on the adventure is her faint-hearted best-friend, Khal, who turns out to have a secret that brings with it a world of trouble for the pair. Ahead of them lies a war zone fraught with menacing bandits, lumbering giants and an army bent on capturing them dead or alive. At their heals stalks the nefarious, black-cloaked Mr. Tinker and his band of robot goons. During their odyssey, Trixi and Khal not only evade loathsome foes and overcome hardships but they come to realize important values such as friendship, courage and hope.","genres":["Action"," Animation"," Adventure"],"stems":["Minushi","is","an","epic","stori","of","the","human","spirit","thrust","into","an","unforgiv","world","of","wick","villain",",","harsh","landscap","and","fieri","conflict",".","From","within","a","citi","under","martial","law","Trixi",",","an","orphan",",","set","off","on","a","journey","to","find","the","onli","famili","she","'s","ever","known",";","her","older","brother",",","Griffin",".","Join","her","on","the","adventur","is","her","faint-heart","best-friend",",","Khal",",","who","turn","out","to","have","a","secret","that","bring","with","it","a","world","of","troubl","for","the","pair",".","Ahead","of","them","lie","a","war","zone","fraught","with","menac","bandit",",","lumber","giant","and","an","armi","bent","on","captur","them","dead","or","aliv",".","At","their","heal","stalk","the","nefari",",","black-cloak","Mr.","Tinker","and","his","band","of","robot","goon",".","Dure","their","odyssey",",","Trixi","and","Khal","not","onli","evad","loathsom","foe","and","overcom","hardship","but","they","come","to","realiz","import","valu","such","as","friendship",",","courag","and","hope","."],"lemmas":["Minushi","be","a","epic","story","of","the","human","spirit","thrust","into","a","unforgiving","world","of","wicked","villain",",","harsh","landscape","and","fiery","conflict",".","from","within","a","city","under","martial","law","Trixi",",","a","orphan",",","set","off","on","a","journey","to","find","the","only","family","she","be","ever","know",";","she","older","brother",",","Griffin",".","join","she","on","the","adventure","be","she","faint-hearted","best-friend",",","Khal",",","who","turn","out","to","have","a","secret","that","bring","with","it","a","world","of","trouble","for","the","pair",".","ahead","of","they","lie","a","war","zone","fraught","with","menacing","bandit",",","lumber","giant","and","a","army","bent","on","capture","they","dead","or","alive",".","at","they","heal","stalk","the","nefarious",",","black-cloaked","Mr.","Tinker","and","he","band","of","robot","goon",".","during","they","odyssey",",","Trixi","and","Khal","not","only","evade","loathsome","foe","and","overcome","hardship","but","they","come","to","realize","important","value","such","as","friendship",",","courage","and","hope","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Minushi is an","is an epic","an epic story","epic story of","story of the","of the human","the human spirit","human spirit thrust","spirit thrust into","thrust into an","into an unforgiving","an unforgiving world","unforgiving world of","world of wicked","of wicked villains","wicked villains ,","villains , harsh",", harsh landscapes","harsh landscapes and","landscapes and fiery","and fiery conflicts","From within a","within a city","a city under","city under martial","under martial law","martial law Trixi","law Trixi ,","Trixi , an",", an orphan","an orphan ,","orphan , sets",", sets off","sets off on","off on a","on a journey","a journey to","journey to find","to find the","find the only","the only family","only family she","family she 's","she 's ever","'s ever known","ever known ;","known ;

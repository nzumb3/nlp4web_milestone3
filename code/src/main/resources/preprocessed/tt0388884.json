{"title":"Destiny Has No Favorites","plot":"Ana is a rich, repressed housewife. Much to her annoyance, her husband rents out their garden to a soap-opera production, and goes away on a business trip. In her dull solitude, Ana follows the shooting from her window, and soon becomes just as engrossed in the soap-opera as her two maids. When accidentally mistaken for an actress, she ends up being cast for a role -to the great dismay of the other actresses and her maids. The set soon becomes dominated by gossiping, intrigues and blackmail, while the boundary between her real world and the make believe world of soap-operas begins to blur. Ana finds herself entangled in a real life soap-opera all of her own when she tries to get everything back to normal before her husbands comes home.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Ana","is","a","rich",",","repress","housewif",".","Much","to","her","annoy",",","her","husband","rent","out","their","garden","to","a","soap-opera","product",",","and","goe","away","on","a","busi","trip",".","In","her","dull","solitud",",","Ana","follow","the","shoot","from","her","window",",","and","soon","becom","just","as","engross","in","the","soap-opera","as","her","two","maid",".","When","accident","mistaken","for","an","actress",",","she","end","up","be","cast","for","a","role","-","to","the","great","dismay","of","the","other","actress","and","her","maid",".","The","set","soon","becom","domin","by","gossip",",","intrigu","and","blackmail",",","while","the","boundari","between","her","real","world","and","the","make","believ","world","of","soap-opera","begin","to","blur",".","Ana","find","herself","entangl","in","a","real","life","soap-opera","all","of","her","own","when","she","tri","to","get","everyth","back","to","normal","befor","her","husband","come","home","."],"lemmas":["Ana","be","a","rich",",","repress","housewife",".","much","to","she","annoyance",",","she","husband","rent","out","they","garden","to","a","soap-opera","production",",","and","go","away","on","a","business","trip",".","in","she","dull","solitude",",","Ana","follow","the","shooting","from","she","window",",","and","soon","become","just","as","engross","in","the","soap-opera","as","she","two","maid",".","when","accidentally","mistaken","for","a","actress",",","she","end","up","be","cast","for","a","role","-","to","the","great","dismay","of","the","other","actress","and","she","maid",".","the","set","soon","become","dominate","by","gossip",",","intrigue","and","blackmail",",","while","the","boundary","between","she","real","world","and","the","make","believe","world","of","soap-operas","begin","to","blur",".","Ana","find","herself","entangled","in","a","real","life","soap-opera","all","of","she","own","when","she","try","to","get","everything","back","to","normal","before","she","husband","come","home","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ana is a","is a rich","a rich ,","rich , repressed",", repressed housewife","Much to her","to her annoyance","her annoyance ,","annoyance , her",", her husband","her husband rents","husband rents out","rents out their","out their garden","their garden to","garden to a","to a soap-opera","a soap-opera production","soap-opera production ,","production , and",", and goes","and goes away","goes away on","away on a","on a business","a business trip","In her dull","her dull solitude","dull solitude ,","solitude , Ana",", Ana follows","Ana follows the","follows the shooting","the shooting from","shooting from her","from her window","her window ,","window , and",", and soon","and soon becomes","soon becomes just","becomes just as","just as engrossed","as engrossed in","engrossed in the","in the soap-opera","the soap-opera as","soap-opera as her","as her two","her two maids","When accidentally mistaken","accidentally mistaken for","mistaken for an","for an actress","an actress ,","actress , she",", she ends","she ends up","ends up being","up being cast","being cast for","cast for a","for a role","a role -","role -

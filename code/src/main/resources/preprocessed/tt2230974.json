{"title":"Sammy's Suicidal Tendencies","plot":"Sammy is a struggling musician who lives in his mom's basement. He calls a suicide hotline supposedly because he wants to kill himself. In reality he is just a lonely guy who wants an audience to listen to the final three songs of his unfinished album. Gloria, the suicide hotline operator, humors Sammy and we see the songs dramatized as a series of short films. In each, Sammy is the broken hearted guy who just wants to win the girl. But will death win out instead? Find out in 'Sammy's Suicidal Tendencies'.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Sammi","is","a","struggl","musician","who","live","in","his","mom","'s","basement",".","He","call","a","suicid","hotlin","suppos","becaus","he","want","to","kill","himself",".","In","realiti","he","is","just","a","lone","guy","who","want","an","audienc","to","listen","to","the","final","three","song","of","his","unfinish","album",".","Gloria",",","the","suicid","hotlin","oper",",","humor","Sammi","and","we","see","the","song","dramat","as","a","seri","of","short","film",".","In","each",",","Sammi","is","the","broken","heart","guy","who","just","want","to","win","the","girl",".","But","will","death","win","out","instead","?","Find","out","in","'","Sammi","'s","Suicid","Tendenc","'","."],"lemmas":["Sammy","be","a","struggle","musician","who","live","in","he","mom","'s","basement",".","he","call","a","suicide","hotline","supposedly","because","he","want","to","kill","himself",".","in","reality","he","be","just","a","lonely","guy","who","want","a","audience","to","listen","to","the","final","three","song","of","he","unfinished","album",".","Gloria",",","the","suicide","hotline","operator",",","humor","Sammy","and","we","see","the","song","dramatize","as","a","series","of","short","film",".","in","each",",","Sammy","be","the","broken","hearted","guy","who","just","want","to","win","the","girl",".","but","will","death","win","out","instead","?","find","out","in","'","Sammy","'s","suicidal","tendency","'","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sammy is a","is a struggling","a struggling musician","struggling musician who","musician who lives","who lives in","lives in his","in his mom","his mom 's","mom 's basement","He calls a","calls a suicide","a suicide hotline","suicide hotline supposedly","hotline supposedly because","supposedly because he","because he wants","he wants to","wants to kill","to kill himself","In reality he","reality he is","he is just","is just a","just a lonely","a lonely guy","lonely guy who","guy who wants","who wants an","wants an audience","an audience to","audience to listen","to listen to","listen to the","to the final","the final three","final three songs","three songs of","songs of his","of his unfinished","his unfinished album","Gloria , the",", the suicide","the suicide hotline","suicide hotline operator","hotline operator ,","operator , humors",", humors Sammy","humors Sammy and","Sammy and we","and we see","we see the","see the songs","the songs dramatized","songs dramatized as","dramatized as a","as a series","a series of","series of short","of short films","In each ,","each , Sammy",", Sammy is","Sammy is the","is the broken","the broken hearted","broken hearted guy","hearted guy who","guy who just","who just wants","just wants to","wants to win","to win the","win the girl","But will death","will death win","death win out","win out instead","Find out in","out in '","in ' Sammy","' Sammy 's","Sammy 's Suicidal","'s Suicidal Tendencies","Suicidal Tendencies '"],"2grams":["Sammy is","is a","a struggling","struggling musician","musician who","who lives","lives in","in his","his mom","mom 's","'s basement","He calls","calls a","a suicide","suicide hotline","hotline supposedly","supposedly because","because he","he wants","wants to","to kill","kill himself","In reality","reality he","he is","is just","just a","a lonely","lonely guy","guy who","who wants","wants an","an audience","audience to","to listen","listen to","to the","the final","final three","three songs","songs of","of his","his unfinished","unfinished album","Gloria ,",", the","the suicide","suicide hotline","hotline operator","operator ,",", humors","humors Sammy","Sammy and","and we","we see","see the","the songs","songs dramatized","dramatized as","as a","a series","series of","of short","short films","In each","each ,",", Sammy","Sammy is","is the","the broken","broken hearted","hearted guy","guy who","who just","just wants","wants to","to win","win the","the girl","But will","will death","death win","win out","out instead","Find out","out in","in '","' Sammy","Sammy 's","'s Suicidal","Suicidal Tendencies","Tendencies '"]}

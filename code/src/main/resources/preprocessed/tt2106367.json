{"title":"Children of Enlightenment","plot":"CHILDREN OF ENLIGHTENMENT is a revolutionary documentary that aims to become the chronicle of a generation - namely, young Japanese people, who are in the process of leading their country into a creative Renaissance. Rejecting - and rejected by - the secure corporate jobs of the past, Japan's youth are asserting their individuality by diving into creative pursuits like art, fashion, and music. CHILDREN OF ENLIGHTENMENT guides its audience into this creative scene, following the youth to the places where they work, play, live, and create. The film explores the new lifestyles and new philosophies with which these young people experiment. Through interviews with older, established artists, CHILDREN OF ENLIGHTENMENT reveals the history of this remarkable movement, and how the Japanese scene has changed over the years. It also explores the issues and difficulties facing the youth movement, and the challenge that the movement poses to society.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["CHILDREN","OF","ENLIGHTENMENT","is","a","revolutionari","documentari","that","aim","to","becom","the","chronicl","of","a","generat","-","name",",","young","Japanes","peopl",",","who","are","in","the","process","of","lead","their","countri","into","a","creativ","Renaiss",".","Reject","-","and","reject","by","-","the","secur","corpor","job","of","the","past",",","Japan","'s","youth","are","assert","their","individu","by","dive","into","creativ","pursuit","like","art",",","fashion",",","and","music",".","CHILDREN","OF","ENLIGHTENMENT","guid","it","audienc","into","this","creativ","scene",",","follow","the","youth","to","the","place","where","they","work",",","play",",","live",",","and","creat",".","The","film","explor","the","new","lifestyl","and","new","philosophi","with","which","these","young","peopl","experi",".","Through","interview","with","older",",","establish","artist",",","CHILDREN","OF","ENLIGHTENMENT","reveal","the","histori","of","this","remark","movement",",","and","how","the","Japanes","scene","has","chang","over","the","year",".","It","also","explor","the","issu","and","difficulti","face","the","youth","movement",",","and","the","challeng","that","the","movement","pose","to","societi","."],"lemmas":["child","of","enlightenment","be","a","revolutionary","documentary","that","aim","to","become","the","chronicle","of","a","generation","-","namely",",","young","japanese","people",",","who","be","in","the","process","of","lead","they","country","into","a","creative","Renaissance",".","reject","-","and","reject","by","-","the","secure","corporate","job","of","the","past",",","Japan","'s","youth","be","assert","they","individuality","by","diving","into","creative","pursuit","like","art",",","fashion",",","and","music",".","child","of","enlightenment","guide","its","audience","into","this","creative","scene",",","follow","the","youth","to","the","place","where","they","work",",","play",",","live",",","and","create",".","the","film","explore","the","new","lifestyle","and","new","philosophy","with","which","these","young","people","experiment",".","through","interview","with","older",",","established","artist",",","child","of","enlightenment","reveal","the","history","of","this","remarkable","movement",",","and","how","the","japanese","scene","have","change","over","the","year",".","it","also","explore","the","issue","and","difficulty","face","the","youth","movement",",","and","the","challenge","that","the","movement","pose","to","society","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["CHILDREN OF ENLIGHTENMENT","OF ENLIGHTENMENT is","ENLIGHTENMENT is a","is a revolutionary","a revolutionary documentary","revolutionary documentary that","documentary that aims","that aims to","aims to become","to become the","become the chronicle","the chronicle of","chronicle of a","of a generation","a generation -","generation -

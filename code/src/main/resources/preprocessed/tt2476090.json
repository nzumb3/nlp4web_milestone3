{"title":"Cosmic Psychos: Blokes You Can Trust","plot":"For 30 years, the Cosmic Psychos have blazed a trail of empty beer cans and busted ear drums around the globe with their quintessential Australian drawl and pounding punk rock songs. With the founding member Ross Knight finding inspiration from the Bulldozer he drove on the family farm in country Victoria, the band forged a unique sound and image that resonated with punk rock fans everywhere. Iconic label Sup Pop! released their second album when the band fell into the 'Seattle' scene of the late 80's amidst the likes of Pearl Jam, Mudhoney and The Melvins. Never quite finding the mainstream success of their grunge counterparts, the band managed to tour heavily in the USA and Europe thanks to a large and devoted fan base. The Cosmic Psychos were notorious for their ability to drink pubs dry, earning them a reputation that resonated around as a warning - \"Never drink with the 'Psychos\". But it wasn't all shits and giggles. A heavy falling out with drummer and founding member Bill Walsh resulted in a line-up change and a bitter dedication on their new album with the song 'Kill Bill'. They've been ripped off by several record labels, and dealt with the tragedy of the passing of guitarist Robbie Watts in 2006. But the band continues through all its adversity to remain strong to this day with Dean Muller on drums and John 'Mad Macca' McKeering from the Onya's taking care of the guitar duties. COSMIC PSYCHOS : BLOKES YOU CAN TRUST follows the bands colorful history, as well as the enigmatic and entertaining founding member Ross Knight, to get behind the man who rides the bulldozer. Farmer, Father, Weightlifter, and frontman. His story alone, and told from his perspective is a unique portrait of an unlikely and revered rock and roll bloke.","genres":["Music"],"stems":["For","30","year",",","the","Cosmic","Psycho","have","blaze","a","trail","of","empti","beer","can","and","bust","ear","drum","around","the","globe","with","their","quintessenti","Australian","drawl","and","pound","punk","rock","song",".","With","the","found","member","Ross","Knight","find","inspir","from","the","Bulldoz","he","drove","on","the","famili","farm","in","countri","Victoria",",","the","band","forg","a","uniqu","sound","and","imag","that","reson","with","punk","rock","fan","everywher",".","Iconic","label","Sup","Pop","!","releas","their","second","album","when","the","band","fell","into","the","'","Seattl","'","scene","of","the","late","80","'s","amidst","the","like","of","Pearl","Jam",",","Mudhoney","and","The","Melvin",".","Never","quit","find","the","mainstream","success","of","their","grung","counterpart",",","the","band","manag","to","tour","heavili","in","the","USA","and","Europ","thank","to","a","larg","and","devot","fan","base",".","The","Cosmic","Psycho","were","notori","for","their","abil","to","drink","pub","dri",",","earn","them","a","reput","that","reson","around","as","a","warn","-","\"","Never","drink","with","the","'","Psycho","\"",".","But","it","was","n't","all","shit","and","giggl",".","A","heavi","fall","out","with","drummer","and","found","member","Bill","Walsh","result","in","a","line-up","chang","and","a","bitter","dedic","on","their","new","album","with","the","song","'","Kill","Bill","'",".","They","ve","been","rip","off","by","sever","record","label",",","and","dealt","with","the","tragedi","of","the","pass","of","guitarist","Robbi","Watt","in","2006",".","But","the","band","continu","through","all","it","advers","to","remain","strong","to","this","day","with","Dean","Muller","on","drum","and","John","'","Mad","Macca","'","McKeer","from","the","Onya","'s","take","care","of","the","guitar","duti",".","COSMIC","PSYCHOS",":","BLOKES","YOU","CAN","TRUST","follow","the","band","color","histori",",","as","well","as","the","enigmat","and","entertain","found","member","Ross","Knight",",","to","get","behind","the","man","who","ride","the","bulldoz",".","Farmer",",","Father",",","Weightlift",",","and","frontman",".","His","stori","alon",",","and","told","from","his","perspect","is","a","uniqu","portrait","of","an","unlik","and","rever","rock","and","roll","bloke","."],"lemmas":["for","30","year",",","the","Cosmic","Psychos","have","blaze","a","trail","of","empty","beer","can","and","bust","ear","drum","around","the","globe","with","they","quintessential","australian","drawl","and","pound","punk","rock","song",".","with","the","founding","member","Ross","Knight","find","inspiration","from","the","Bulldozer","he","drive","on","the","family","farm","in","country","Victoria",",","the","band","forge","a","unique","sound","and","image","that","resonate","with","punk","rock","fan","everywhere",".","iconic","label","sup","pop","!","release","they","second","album","when","the","band","fall","into","the","'","Seattle","'","scene","of","the","late","80","'s","amidst","the","likes","of","Pearl","Jam",",","Mudhoney","and","The","Melvins",".","never","quite","find","the","mainstream","success","of","they","grunge","counterpart",",","the","band","manage","to","tour","heavily","in","the","USA","and","Europe","thanks","to","a","large","and","devoted","fan","base",".","the","Cosmic","Psychos","be","notorious","for","they","ability","to","drink","pub","dry",",","earn","they","a","reputation","that","resonate","around","as","a","warning","-","``","never","drink","with","the","'","Psychos","''",".","but","it","be","not","all","shit","and","giggle",".","a","heavy","fall","out","with","drummer","and","founding","member","Bill","Walsh","result","in","a","line-up","change","and","a","bitter","dedication","on","they","new","album","with","the","song","'","kill","Bill","'",".","they","have","be","rip","off","by","several","record","label",",","and","deal","with","the","tragedy","of","the","passing","of","guitarist","Robbie","Watts","in","2006",".","but","the","band","continue","through","all","its","adversity","to","remain","strong","to","this","day","with","Dean","Muller","on","drum","and","John","'","Mad","Macca","'","mckeering","from","the","Onya","'s","take","care","of","the","guitar","duty",".","cosmic","psycho",":","bloke","you","can","trust","follow","the","band","colorful","history",",","as","well","as","the","enigmatic","and","entertaining","founding","member","Ross","Knight",",","to","get","behind","the","man","who","ride","the","bulldozer",".","Farmer",",","Father",",","Weightlifter",",","and","frontman",".","he","story","alone",",","and","tell","from","he","perspective","be","a","unique","portrait","of","a","unlikely","and","revered","rock","and","roll","bloke","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["For

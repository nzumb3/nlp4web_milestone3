{"title":"Look at Me","plot":"Lolita, plump, in her 20s, desperately wants her father's attention. He's egotistical, a famous writer and publisher with an attractive wife little older than Lolita. She's in a choir, rehearsing for a concert; she's given her father a tape, which he's yet to listen to. Sylvia, a voice coach, is willing to help the group, knowing she'll have a chance to get her husband's new novel in front of Lolita's father. For Lolita, this is a pattern: people pay attention to her to gain access to him, something she fears is the intent of Sébastien, a struggling journalist who may become her boyfriend. The night of the concert, the music may bring out everyone's feelings.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["Lolita",",","plump",",","in","her","20s",",","desper","want","her","father","'s","attent",".","He","'s","egotist",",","a","famous","writer","and","publish","with","an","attract","wife","littl","older","than","Lolita",".","She","'s","in","a","choir",",","rehears","for","a","concert",";","she","'s","given","her","father","a","tape",",","which","he","'s","yet","to","listen","to",".","Sylvia",",","a","voic","coach",",","is","will","to","help","the","group",",","know","she","ll","have","a","chanc","to","get","her","husband","'s","new","novel","in","front","of","Lolita","'s","father",".","For","Lolita",",","this","is","a","pattern",":","peopl","pay","attent","to","her","to","gain","access","to","him",",","someth","she","fear","is","the","intent","of","Sébastien",",","a","struggl","journalist","who","may","becom","her","boyfriend",".","The","night","of","the","concert",",","the","music","may","bring","out","everyon","'s","feel","."],"lemmas":["Lolita",",","plump",",","in","she","20",",","desperately","want","she","father","'s","attention",".","he","be","egotistical",",","a","famous","writer","and","publisher","with","a","attractive","wife","little","older","than","Lolita",".","she","be","in","a","choir",",","rehearse","for","a","concert",";","she","be","give","she","father","a","tape",",","which","he","be","yet","to","listen","to",".","Sylvia",",","a","voice","coach",",","be","willing","to","help","the","group",",","know","she","will","have","a","chance","to","get","she","husband","'s","new","novel","in","front","of","Lolita","'s","father",".","for","Lolita",",","this","be","a","pattern",":","people","pay","attention","to","she","to","gain","access","to","he",",","something","she","fear","be","the","intent","of","Sébastien",",","a","struggle","journalist","who","may","become","she","boyfriend",".","the","night","of","the","concert",",","the","music","may","bring","out","everyone","'s","feeling","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Lolita , plump",", plump ,","plump , in",", in her","in her 20s","her 20s ,","20s , desperately",", desperately wants","desperately wants her","wants her father","her father 's","father 's attention","He 's egotistical","'s egotistical ,","egotistical , a",", a famous","a famous writer","famous writer and","writer and publisher","and publisher with","publisher with an","with an attractive","an attractive wife","attractive wife little","wife little older","little older than","older than Lolita","She 's in","'s in a","in a choir","a choir ,","choir , rehearsing",", rehearsing for","rehearsing for a","for a concert","a concert ;","concert ;

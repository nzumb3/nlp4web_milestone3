{"title":"Four Corners","plot":"Fatherless and raised by his grandmother, thirteen year old Ricardo Galam lives in South Africa's Cape Flats, a unique and volatile sub culture dominated by two Number gangs, the 26 and 28. Ricardo's future as a chess prodigy is threatened by his growing interest in the 26 whose local leader is grooming him as a potential member. Unknown to Ricardo, the father he's never known has been released from prison. Farakhan, a reformed general in the 28, is back in his old neighbourhood, an intruder in 26 territory. In a story that is at times raw and violent at other times touching and true. FOUR CORNERS is a gripping drama set against the backdrop of a gang war in Cape Town which has been raging for a 100 years; a little known fact.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"],"stems":["Fatherless","and","rais","by","his","grandmoth",",","thirteen","year","old","Ricardo","Galam","live","in","South","Africa","'s","Cape","Flat",",","a","uniqu","and","volatil","sub","cultur","domin","by","two","Number","gang",",","the","26","and","28",".","Ricardo","'s","futur","as","a","chess","prodigi","is","threaten","by","his","grow","interest","in","the","26","whose","local","leader","is","groom","him","as","a","potenti","member",".","Unknown","to","Ricardo",",","the","father","he","'s","never","known","has","been","releas","from","prison",".","Farakhan",",","a","reform","general","in","the","28",",","is","back","in","his","old","neighbourhood",",","an","intrud","in","26","territori",".","In","a","stori","that","is","at","time","raw","and","violent","at","other","time","touch","and","true",".","FOUR","CORNERS","is","a","grip","drama","set","against","the","backdrop","of","a","gang","war","in","Cape","Town","which","has","been","rage","for","a","100","year",";","a","littl","known","fact","."],"lemmas":["Fatherless","and","raise","by","he","grandmother",",","thirteen","year","old","Ricardo","Galam","live","in","South","Africa","'s","Cape","Flats",",","a","unique","and","volatile","sub","culture","dominate","by","two","Number","gang",",","the","26","and","28",".","Ricardo","'s","future","as","a","chess","prodigy","be","threaten","by","he","grow","interest","in","the","26","whose","local","leader","be","groom","he","as","a","potential","member",".","unknown","to","Ricardo",",","the","father","he","be","never","know","have","be","release","from","prison",".","Farakhan",",","a","reform","general","in","the","28",",","be","back","in","he","old","neighbourhood",",","a","intruder","in","26","territory",".","in","a","story","that","be","at","time","raw","and","violent","at","other","time","touch","and","true",".","four","corner","be","a","gripping","drama","set","against","the","backdrop","of","a","gang","war","in","Cape","Town","which","have","be","rage","for","a","100","year",";","a","little","known","fact","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fatherless and raised","and raised by","raised by his","by his grandmother","his grandmother ,","grandmother , thirteen",", thirteen year","thirteen year old","year old Ricardo","old Ricardo Galam","Ricardo Galam lives","Galam lives in","lives in South","in South Africa","South Africa 's","Africa 's Cape","'s Cape Flats","Cape Flats ,","Flats , a",", a unique","a unique and","unique and volatile","and volatile sub","volatile sub culture","sub culture dominated","culture dominated by","dominated by two","by two Number","two Number gangs","Number gangs ,","gangs , the",", the 26","the 26 and","26 and 28","Ricardo 's future","'s future as","future as a","as a chess","a chess prodigy","chess prodigy is","prodigy is threatened","is threatened by","threatened by his","by his growing","his growing interest","growing interest in","interest in the","in the 26","the 26 whose","26 whose local","whose local leader","local leader is","leader is grooming","is grooming him","grooming him as","him as a","as a potential","a potential member","Unknown to Ricardo","to Ricardo ,","Ricardo , the",", the father","the father he","father he 's","he 's never","'s never known","never known has","known has been","has been released","been released from","released from prison","Farakhan , a",", a reformed","a reformed general","reformed general in","general in the","in the 28","the 28 ,","28 , is",", is back","is back in","back in his","in his old","his old neighbourhood","old neighbourhood ,","neighbourhood , an",", an intruder","an intruder in","intruder in 26","in 26 territory","In a story","a story that","story that is","that is at","is at times","at times raw","times raw and","raw and violent","and violent at","violent at other","at other times","other times touching","times touching and","touching and true","FOUR CORNERS is","CORNERS is a","is a gripping","a gripping drama","gripping drama set","drama set against","set against the","against the backdrop","the backdrop of","backdrop of a","of a gang","a gang war","gang war in","war in Cape","in Cape Town","Cape Town which","Town which has","which has been","has been raging","been raging for","raging for a","for a 100","a 100 years","100 years ;","years ;

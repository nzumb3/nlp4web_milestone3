{"title":"Apatía, una película de carretera","plot":"On a palm Sunday, two friends meet and part to follow each his own road. One is looking, across the country, for a girl that left him after having his abortion. The other one is looking, through reflexion and violence, for a way out of his own tragic existence. A holy week, a third world country, a chance to experience gain and loss, to walk a path previously unknown. A chance to learn and understand that life's about the journey, not the destination.","genres":["Adventure"],"stems":["On","a","palm","Sunday",",","two","friend","meet","and","part","to","follow","each","his","own","road",".","One","is","look",",","across","the","countri",",","for","a","girl","that","left","him","after","have","his","abort",".","The","other","one","is","look",",","through","reflexion","and","violenc",",","for","a","way","out","of","his","own","tragic","exist",".","A","holi","week",",","a","third","world","countri",",","a","chanc","to","experi","gain","and","loss",",","to","walk","a","path","previous","unknown",".","A","chanc","to","learn","and","understand","that","life","'s","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destin","."],"lemmas":["on","a","palm","Sunday",",","two","friend","meet","and","part","to","follow","each","he","own","road",".","one","be","look",",","across","the","country",",","for","a","girl","that","leave","he","after","have","he","abortion",".","the","other","one","be","look",",","through","reflexion","and","violence",",","for","a","way","out","of","he","own","tragic","existence",".","a","holy","week",",","a","third","world","country",",","a","chance","to","experience","gain","and","loss",",","to","walk","a","path","previously","unknown",".","a","chance","to","learn","and","understand","that","life","'s","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destination","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["On a palm","a palm Sunday","palm Sunday ,","Sunday , two",", two friends","two friends meet","friends meet and","meet and part","and part to","part to follow","to follow each","follow each his","each his own","his own road","One is looking","is looking ,","looking , across",", across the","across the country","the country ,","country , for",", for a","for a girl","a girl that","girl that left","that left him","left him after","him after having","after having his","having his abortion","The other one","other one is","one is looking","is looking ,","looking , through",", through reflexion","through reflexion and","reflexion and violence","and violence ,","violence , for",", for a","for a way","a way out","way out of","out of his","of his own","his own tragic","own tragic existence","A holy week","holy week ,","week , a",", a third","a third world","third world country","world country ,","country , a",", a chance","a chance to","chance to experience","to experience gain","experience gain and","gain and loss","and loss ,","loss , to",", to walk","to walk a","walk a path","a path previously","path previously unknown","A chance to","chance to learn","to learn and","learn and understand","and understand that","understand that life","that life 's","life 's about","'s about the","about the journey","the journey ,","journey , not",", not the","not the destination"],"2grams":["On a","a palm","palm Sunday","Sunday ,",", two","two friends","friends meet","meet and","and part","part to","to follow","follow each","each his","his own","own road","One is","is looking","looking ,",", across","across the","the country","country ,",", for","for a","a girl","girl that","that left","left him","him after","after having","having his","his abortion","The other","other one","one is","is looking","looking ,",", through","through reflexion","reflexion and","and violence","violence ,",", for","for a","a way","way out","out of","of his","his own","own tragic","tragic existence","A holy","holy week","week ,",", a","a third","third world","world country","country ,",", a","a chance","chance to","to experience","experience gain","gain and","and loss","loss ,",", to","to walk","walk a","a path","path previously","previously unknown","A chance","chance to","to learn","learn and","and understand","understand that","that life","life 's","'s about","about the","the journey","journey ,",", not","not the","the destination"]}

{"title":"Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence","plot":"Batô is a living cyborg. His whole body, even his arms and legs, are entirely man-made. What only remains are traces of his brain and the memories of a woman. In an era when the boundary between humans and machines has become infinitely vague, Humans have forgotten that they are humans. This is the debauchery of the lonesome ghost of a man, who nevertheless seeks to retain humanity. Innocence... Is what life is.","genres":["Animation"," Sci-Fi"," Drama"],"stems":["Batô","is","a","live","cyborg",".","His","whole","bodi",",","even","his","arm","and","leg",",","are","entir","man-mad",".","What","onli","remain","are","trace","of","his","brain","and","the","memori","of","a","woman",".","In","an","era","when","the","boundari","between","human","and","machin","has","becom","infinit","vagu",",","Human","have","forgotten","that","they","are","human",".","This","is","the","debaucheri","of","the","lonesom","ghost","of","a","man",",","who","nevertheless","seek","to","retain","human",".","Innocenc","...","Is","what","life","is","."],"lemmas":["Batô","be","a","live","cyborg",".","he","whole","body",",","even","he","arm","and","leg",",","be","entirely","man-made",".","what","only","remains","be","trace","of","he","brain","and","the","memory","of","a","woman",".","in","a","era","when","the","boundary","between","human","and","machine","have","become","infinitely","vague",",","human","have","forget","that","they","be","human",".","this","be","the","debauchery","of","the","lonesome","ghost","of","a","man",",","who","nevertheless","seek","to","retain","humanity",".","innocence","...","be","what","life","be","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Batô is a","is a living","a living cyborg","His whole body","whole body ,","body , even",", even his","even his arms","his arms and","arms and legs","and legs ,","legs , are",", are entirely","are entirely man-made","What only remains","only remains are","remains are traces","are traces of","traces of his","of his brain","his brain and","brain and the","and the memories","the memories of","memories of a","of a woman","In an era","an era when","era when the","when the boundary","the boundary between","boundary between humans","between humans and","humans and machines","and machines has","machines has become","has become infinitely","become infinitely vague","infinitely vague ,","vague , Humans",", Humans have","Humans have forgotten","have forgotten that","forgotten that they","that they are","they are humans","This is the","is the debauchery","the debauchery of","debauchery of the","of the lonesome","the lonesome ghost","lonesome ghost of","ghost of a","of a man","a man ,","man , who",", who nevertheless","who nevertheless seeks","nevertheless seeks to","seeks to retain","to retain humanity","Innocence ...

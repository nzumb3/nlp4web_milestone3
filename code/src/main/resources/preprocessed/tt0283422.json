{"title":"I'm Going Home","plot":"The comfortable daily routines of aging Parisian actor Gilbert Valence, 76, are suddenly shaken when he learns that his wife, daughter, and son-in-law have been killed in a car crash. Having to take care of his now-orphaned grandson, he struggles to go on with his lifelong acting career like he's used to. But the roles he is offered -- a flashy TV show and a hectic last-minute replacement in an English-language film of Joyce's Ulysses -- finally convince him that it's time to retire.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["The","comfort","daili","routin","of","age","Parisian","actor","Gilbert","Valenc",",","76",",","are","sudden","shaken","when","he","learn","that","his","wife",",","daughter",",","and","son-in-law","have","been","kill","in","a","car","crash",".","Have","to","take","care","of","his","now-orphan","grandson",",","he","struggl","to","go","on","with","his","lifelong","act","career","like","he","'s","use","to",".","But","the","role","he","is","offer","--","a","flashi","TV","show","and","a","hectic","last-minut","replac","in","an","English-languag","film","of","Joyc","'s","Ulyss","--","final","convinc","him","that","it","'s","time","to","retir","."],"lemmas":["the","comfortable","daily","routine","of","age","parisian","actor","Gilbert","Valence",",","76",",","be","suddenly","shake","when","he","learn","that","he","wife",",","daughter",",","and","son-in-law","have","be","kill","in","a","car","crash",".","have","to","take","care","of","he","now-orphaned","grandson",",","he","struggle","to","go","on","with","he","lifelong","act","career","like","he","be","use","to",".","but","the","role","he","be","offer","--","a","flashy","tv","show","and","a","hectic","last-minute","replacement","in","a","english-language","film","of","Joyce","'s","Ulysses","--","finally","convince","he","that","it","be","time","to","retire","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The comfortable daily","comfortable daily routines","daily routines of","routines of aging","of aging Parisian","aging Parisian actor","Parisian actor Gilbert","actor Gilbert Valence","Gilbert Valence ,","Valence , 76",", 76 ,","76 , are",", are suddenly","are suddenly shaken","suddenly shaken when","shaken when he","when he learns","he learns that","learns that his","that his wife","his wife ,","wife , daughter",", daughter ,","daughter , and",", and son-in-law","and son-in-law have","son-in-law have been","have been killed","been killed in","killed in a","in a car","a car crash","Having to take","to take care","take care of","care of his","of his now-orphaned","his now-orphaned grandson","now-orphaned grandson ,","grandson , he",", he struggles","he struggles to","struggles to go","to go on","go on with","on with his","with his lifelong","his lifelong acting","lifelong acting career","acting career like","career like he","like he 's","he 's used","'s used to","But the roles","the roles he","roles he is","he is offered","is offered --","offered -- a","-- a flashy","a flashy TV","flashy TV show","TV show and","show and a","and a hectic","a hectic last-minute","hectic last-minute replacement","last-minute replacement in","replacement in an","in an English-language","an English-language film","English-language film of","film of Joyce","of Joyce 's","Joyce 's Ulysses","'s Ulysses --","Ulysses -- finally","-- finally convince","finally convince him","convince him that","him that it","that it 's","it 's time","'s time to","time to retire"],"2grams":["The comfortable","comfortable daily","daily routines","routines of","of aging","aging Parisian","Parisian actor","actor Gilbert","Gilbert Valence","Valence ,",", 76","76 ,",", are","are suddenly","suddenly shaken","shaken when","when he","he learns","learns that","that his","his wife","wife ,",", daughter","daughter ,",", and","and son-in-law","son-in-law have","have been","been killed","killed in","in a","a car","car crash","Having to","to take","take care","care of","of his","his now-orphaned","now-orphaned grandson","grandson ,",", he","he struggles","struggles to","to go","go on","on with","with his","his lifelong","lifelong acting","acting career","career like","like he","he 's","'s used","used to","But the","the roles","roles he","he is","is offered","offered --","-- a","a flashy","flashy TV","TV show","show and","and a","a hectic","hectic last-minute","last-minute replacement","replacement in","in an","an English-language","English-language film","film of","of Joyce","Joyce 's","'s Ulysses","Ulysses --","-- finally","finally convince","convince him","him that","that it","it 's","'s time","time to","to retire"]}

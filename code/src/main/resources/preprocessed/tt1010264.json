{"title":"Another Lost Angel","plot":"ANOTHER LOST ANGEL is a feature-length documentary about the poetic life and violent death of Kat Perkoff: writer, runaway, drug smuggler, bar owner, local icon ... and my older sister. Comprised of archival footage, interviews, and \"dreamlike recollections\", this film began as a personal journey of sibling loss and quickly grew into a full-scale investigation of a life lived on the margins. ANOTHER LOST ANGEL explores notions of fate, identity, and memory as well as the seedy world of the New Orleans lesbian mafia subculture of the 1970's.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["ANOTHER","LOST","ANGEL","is","a","feature-length","documentari","about","the","poetic","life","and","violent","death","of","Kat","Perkoff",":","writer",",","runaway",",","drug","smuggler",",","bar","owner",",","local","icon","...","and","my","older","sister",".","Compris","of","archiv","footag",",","interview",",","and","\"","dreamlik","recollect","\"",",","this","film","began","as","a","person","journey","of","sibl","loss","and","quick","grew","into","a","full-scal","investig","of","a","life","live","on","the","margin",".","ANOTHER","LOST","ANGEL","explor","notion","of","fate",",","ident",",","and","memori","as","well","as","the","seedi","world","of","the","New","Orlean","lesbian","mafia","subcultur","of","the","1970","'s","."],"lemmas":["ANOTHER","LOST","ANGEL","be","a","feature-length","documentary","about","the","poetic","life","and","violent","death","of","Kat","Perkoff",":","writer",",","runaway",",","drug","smuggler",",","bar","owner",",","local","icon","...","and","my","older","sister",".","comprise","of","archival","footage",",","interview",",","and","``","dreamlike","recollection","''",",","this","film","begin","as","a","personal","journey","of","sibling","loss","and","quickly","grow","into","a","full-scale","investigation","of","a","life","live","on","the","margin",".","ANOTHER","LOST","ANGEL","explore","notion","of","fate",",","identity",",","and","memory","as","well","as","the","seedy","world","of","the","New","Orleans","lesbian","mafia","subculture","of","the","1970","'s","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["ANOTHER LOST ANGEL","LOST ANGEL is","ANGEL is a","is a feature-length","a feature-length documentary","feature-length documentary about","documentary about the","about the poetic","the poetic life","poetic life and","life and violent","and violent death","violent death of","death of Kat","of Kat Perkoff","Kat Perkoff :","Perkoff : writer",": writer ,","writer , runaway",", runaway ,","runaway , drug",", drug smuggler","drug smuggler ,","smuggler , bar",", bar owner","bar owner ,","owner , local",", local icon","local icon ...","icon ... and","... and my","and my older","my older sister","Comprised of archival","of archival footage","archival footage ,","footage , interviews",", interviews ,","interviews , and",", and \"","and \" dreamlike","\" dreamlike recollections","dreamlike recollections \"","recollections \" ,","\" , this",", this film","this film began","film began as","began as a","as a personal","a personal journey","personal journey of","journey of sibling","of sibling loss","sibling loss and","loss and quickly","and quickly grew","quickly grew into","grew into a","into a full-scale","a full-scale investigation","full-scale investigation of","investigation of a","of a life","a life lived","life lived on","lived on the","on the margins","ANOTHER LOST ANGEL","LOST ANGEL explores","ANGEL explores notions","explores notions of","notions of fate","of fate ,","fate , identity",", identity ,","identity , and",", and memory","and memory as","memory as well","as well as","well as the","as the seedy","the seedy world","seedy world of","world of the","of the New","the New Orleans","New Orleans lesbian","Orleans lesbian mafia","lesbian mafia subculture","mafia subculture of","subculture of the","of the 1970","the 1970 's"],"2grams":["ANOTHER LOST","LOST ANGEL","ANGEL is","is a","a feature-length","feature-length documentary","documentary about","about the","the poetic","poetic life","life and","and violent","violent death","death of","of Kat","Kat Perkoff","Perkoff :",": writer","writer ,",", runaway","runaway ,",", drug","drug smuggler","smuggler ,",", bar","bar owner","owner ,",", local","local icon","icon ...","... and","and my","my older","older sister","Comprised of","of archival","archival footage","footage ,",", interviews","interviews ,",", and","and \"","\" dreamlike","dreamlike recollections","recollections \"","\" ,",", this","this film","film began","began as","as a","a personal","personal journey","journey of","of sibling","sibling loss","loss and","and quickly","quickly grew","grew into","into a","a full-scale","full-scale investigation","investigation of","of a","a life","life lived","lived on","on the","the margins","ANOTHER LOST","LOST ANGEL","ANGEL explores","explores notions","notions of","of fate","fate ,",", identity","identity ,",", and","and memory","memory as","as well","well as","as the","the seedy","seedy world","world of","of the","the New","New Orleans","Orleans lesbian","lesbian mafia","mafia subculture","subculture of","of the","the 1970","1970 's"]}

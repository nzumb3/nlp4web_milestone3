{"title":"Changing Tides","plot":"This dramatic film follows the lives of four friends who inadvertently become involved in a web of love, secrets, and sacrifice. Taking place in 1982 we watch as four young Colleges students try to find what is not only in their hearts, but worth fighting for. What would you do if your heart was telling you one thing, but your mind was telling you something else? What would you do if your best friend agreed with your mind, and your family agreed with your heart?","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["This","dramat","film","follow","the","live","of","four","friend","who","inadvert","becom","involv","in","a","web","of","love",",","secret",",","and","sacrific",".","Take","place","in","1982","we","watch","as","four","young","Colleg","student","tri","to","find","what","is","not","onli","in","their","heart",",","but","worth","fight","for",".","What","would","you","do","if","your","heart","was","tell","you","one","thing",",","but","your","mind","was","tell","you","someth","els","?","What","would","you","do","if","your","best","friend","agre","with","your","mind",",","and","your","famili","agre","with","your","heart","?"],"lemmas":["this","dramatic","film","follow","the","life","of","four","friend","who","inadvertently","become","involve","in","a","web","of","love",",","secret",",","and","sacrifice",".","take","place","in","1982","we","watch","as","four","young","college","student","try","to","find","what","be","not","only","in","they","heart",",","but","worth","fight","for",".","what","would","you","do","if","you","heart","be","tell","you","one","thing",",","but","you","mind","be","tell","you","something","else","?","what","would","you","do","if","you","best","friend","agree","with","you","mind",",","and","you","family","agree","with","you","heart","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["This dramatic film","dramatic film follows","film follows the","follows the lives","the lives of","lives of four","of four friends","four friends who","friends who inadvertently","who inadvertently become","inadvertently become involved","become involved in","involved in a","in a web","a web of","web of love","of love ,","love , secrets",", secrets ,","secrets , and",", and sacrifice","Taking place in","place in 1982","in 1982 we","1982 we watch","we watch as","watch as four","as four young","four young Colleges","young Colleges students","Colleges students try","students try to","try to find","to find what","find what is","what is not","is not only","not only in","only in their","in their hearts","their hearts ,","hearts , but",", but worth","but worth fighting","worth fighting for","What would you","would you do","you do if","do if your","if your heart","your heart was","heart was telling","was telling you","telling you one","you one thing","one thing ,","thing , but",", but your","but your mind","your mind was","mind was telling","was telling you","telling you something","you something else","What would you","would you do","you do if","do if your","if your best","your best friend","best friend agreed","friend agreed with","agreed with your","with your mind","your mind ,","mind , and",", and your","and your family","your family agreed","family agreed with","agreed with your","with your heart"],"2grams":["This dramatic","dramatic film","film follows","follows the","the lives","lives of","of four","four friends","friends who","who inadvertently","inadvertently become","become involved","involved in","in a","a web","web of","of love","love ,",", secrets","secrets ,",", and","and sacrifice","Taking place","place in","in 1982","1982 we","we watch","watch as","as four","four young","young Colleges","Colleges students","students try","try to","to find","find what","what is","is not","not only","only in","in their","their hearts","hearts ,",", but","but worth","worth fighting","fighting for","What would","would you","you do","do if","if your","your heart","heart was","was telling","telling you","you one","one thing","thing ,",", but","but your","your mind","mind was","was telling","telling you","you something","something else","What would","would you","you do","do if","if your","your best","best friend","friend agreed","agreed with","with your","your mind","mind ,",", and","and your","your family","family agreed","agreed with","with your","your heart"]}

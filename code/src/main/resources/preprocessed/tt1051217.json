{"title":"Daughters of Wisdom","plot":"DAUGHTERS OF WISDOM is an intimate portrait of the nuns of Kala Rongo, a rare and exceptional Buddhist Monastery exclusively for women situated in Nangchen, in remote and rural northeastern Tibet. These nuns are receiving religious and educational training previously unavailable to women, and playing an unprecedented role in preserving their rich cultural heritage even as they slowly reshape it. They graciously allow the camera a never-before-seen glimpse into their vibrant spiritual community and insight into their extraordinary lives. Some shy, some outspoken, all are committed to the often difficult life they have chosen, away from the yak farms and herding families of their birth. It is the story of their spiritual community, one that couldn't have existed 20 years ago but is thriving today.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["DAUGHTERS","OF","WISDOM","is","an","intim","portrait","of","the","nun","of","Kala","Rongo",",","a","rare","and","except","Buddhist","Monasteri","exclus","for","women","situat","in","Nangchen",",","in","remot","and","rural","northeastern","Tibet",".","These","nun","are","receiv","religi","and","educ","train","previous","unavail","to","women",",","and","play","an","unpreced","role","in","preserv","their","rich","cultur","heritag","even","as","they","slowli","reshap","it",".","They","gracious","allow","the","camera","a","never-before-seen","glimps","into","their","vibrant","spiritu","communiti","and","insight","into","their","extraordinari","live",".","Some","shi",",","some","outspoken",",","all","are","commit","to","the","often","difficult","life","they","have","chosen",",","away","from","the","yak","farm","and","herd","famili","of","their","birth",".","It","is","the","stori","of","their","spiritu","communiti",",","one","that","could","n't","have","exist","20","year","ago","but","is","thrive","today","."],"lemmas":["daughter","of","wisdom","be","a","intimate","portrait","of","the","nun","of","Kala","Rongo",",","a","rare","and","exceptional","Buddhist","Monastery","exclusively","for","woman","situate","in","Nangchen",",","in","remote","and","rural","northeastern","Tibet",".","these","nun","be","receive","religious","and","educational","training","previously","unavailable","to","woman",",","and","play","a","unprecedented","role","in","preserve","they","rich","cultural","heritage","even","as","they","slowly","reshape","it",".","they","graciously","allow","the","camera","a","never-before-seen","glimpse","into","they","vibrant","spiritual","community","and","insight","into","they","extraordinary","life",".","some","shy",",","some","outspoken",",","all","be","commit","to","the","often","difficult","life","they","have","choose",",","away","from","the","yak","farm","and","herd","family","of","they","birth",".","it","be","the","story","of","they","spiritual","community",",","one","that","could","not","have","exist","20","year","ago","but","be","thrive","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["DAUGHTERS

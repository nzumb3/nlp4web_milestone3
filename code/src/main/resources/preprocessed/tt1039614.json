{"title":"Iron Cross","plot":"Joseph, a retired New York police officer, played by the late Roy Scheider, travels to Nuremberg to visit his son Ronnie years after turning his back on him for rejecting a promising career in the NYPD and marrying a local artist, Anna. No sooner does Joseph attempt to heal the rift with Ronnie, when he swears that living in the apartment above, under the false name of Shrager, is the now aging SS Commander who murdered his entire family in a Polish forest during WW2. With little hope of seeing him stand trial, Joseph talks Ronnie into exacting justice - and vengeance - and together they set out to kill him. Meanwhile, a mysterious woman, Gaby, has an agenda of her own. With flashbacks to the past, revealing the teenage love of Young Joseph for a heroic Polish girl, Kashka and his narrow escape from the massacre, the story reaches a gripping and unforgettable climax.","genres":["Drama"," War"," Thriller"],"stems":["Joseph",",","a","retir","New","York","polic","offic",",","play","by","the","late","Roy","Scheider",",","travel","to","Nuremberg","to","visit","his","son","Ronni","year","after","turn","his","back","on","him","for","reject","a","promis","career","in","the","NYPD","and","marri","a","local","artist",",","Anna",".","No","sooner","doe","Joseph","attempt","to","heal","the","rift","with","Ronni",",","when","he","swear","that","live","in","the","apart","abov",",","under","the","fals","name","of","Shrager",",","is","the","now","age","SS","Command","who","murder","his","entir","famili","in","a","Polish","forest","dure","WW2",".","With","littl","hope","of","see","him","stand","trial",",","Joseph","talk","Ronni","into","exact","justic","-","and","vengeanc","-","and","togeth","they","set","out","to","kill","him",".","Meanwhil",",","a","mysteri","woman",",","Gabi",",","has","an","agenda","of","her","own",".","With","flashback","to","the","past",",","reveal","the","teenag","love","of","Young","Joseph","for","a","heroic","Polish","girl",",","Kashka","and","his","narrow","escap","from","the","massacr",",","the","stori","reach","a","grip","and","unforgett","climax","."],"lemmas":["Joseph",",","a","retired","New","York","police","officer",",","play","by","the","late","Roy","Scheider",",","travel","to","Nuremberg","to","visit","he","son","Ronnie","year","after","turn","he","back","on","he","for","reject","a","promising","career","in","the","NYPD","and","marry","a","local","artist",",","Anna",".","no","sooner","do","Joseph","attempt","to","heal","the","rift","with","Ronnie",",","when","he","swear","that","live","in","the","apartment","above",",","under","the","false","name","of","Shrager",",","be","the","now","age","SS","Commander","who","murder","he","entire","family","in","a","polish","forest","during","ww2",".","with","little","hope","of","see","he","stand","trial",",","Joseph","talk","Ronnie","into","exact","justice","-","and","vengeance","-","and","together","they","set","out","to","kill","he",".","meanwhile",",","a","mysterious","woman",",","Gaby",",","have","a","agenda","of","she","own",".","with","flashback","to","the","past",",","reveal","the","teenage","love","of","Young","Joseph","for","a","heroic","polish","girl",",","Kashka","and","he","narrow","escape","from","the","massacre",",","the","story","reach","a","gripping","and","unforgettable","climax","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Joseph , a",", a retired","a retired New","retired New York","New York police","York police officer","police officer ,","officer , played",", played by","played by the","by the late","the late Roy","late Roy Scheider","Roy Scheider ,","Scheider , travels",", travels to","travels to Nuremberg","to Nuremberg to","Nuremberg to visit","to visit his","visit his son","his son Ronnie","son Ronnie years","Ronnie years after","years after turning","after turning his","turning his back","his back on","back on him","on him for","him for rejecting","for rejecting a","rejecting a promising","a promising career","promising career in","career in the","in the NYPD","the NYPD and","NYPD and marrying","and marrying a","marrying a local","a local artist","local artist ,","artist , Anna","No sooner does","sooner does Joseph","does Joseph attempt","Joseph attempt to","attempt to heal","to heal the","heal the rift","the rift with","rift with Ronnie","with Ronnie ,","Ronnie , when",", when he","when he swears","he swears that","swears that living","that living in","living in the","in the apartment","the apartment above","apartment above ,","above , under",", under the","under the false","the false name","false name of","name of Shrager","of Shrager ,","Shrager , is",", is the","is the now","the now aging","now aging SS","aging SS Commander","SS Commander who","Commander who murdered","who murdered his","murdered his entire","his entire family","entire family in","family in a","in a Polish","a Polish forest","Polish forest during","forest during WW2","With little hope","little hope of","hope of seeing","of seeing him","seeing him stand","him stand trial","stand trial ,","trial , Joseph",", Joseph talks","Joseph talks Ronnie","talks Ronnie into","Ronnie into exacting","into exacting justice","exacting justice -","justice -

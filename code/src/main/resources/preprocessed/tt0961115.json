{"title":"Love at the Twilight Motel","plot":"Love at the Starlite Motel is a film about how Latin attitudes towards love and sex are meeting America at the intersection of 8th Street and Rte 826 in Miami. The Starlite Motel is the busiest motel in the city. It rents rooms by the hour and is one of many on 8th Street - the major east-west artery through the city and the heart of Little Havana. Motels like the Starlite are Latin American institutions that were introduced to the United States by Miami's large Cuban and Latin American population.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Love","at","the","Starlit","Motel","is","a","film","about","how","Latin","attitud","toward","love","and","sex","are","meet","America","at","the","intersect","of","8th","Street","and","Rte","826","in","Miami",".","The","Starlit","Motel","is","the","busiest","motel","in","the","citi",".","It","rent","room","by","the","hour","and","is","one","of","mani","on","8th","Street","-","the","major","east-west","arteri","through","the","citi","and","the","heart","of","Littl","Havana",".","Motel","like","the","Starlit","are","Latin","American","institut","that","were","introduc","to","the","Unite","State","by","Miami","'s","larg","Cuban","and","Latin","American","popul","."],"lemmas":["love","at","the","Starlite","Motel","be","a","film","about","how","latin","attitude","towards","love","and","sex","be","meet","America","at","the","intersection","of","8th","Street","and","Rte","826","in","Miami",".","the","Starlite","Motel","be","the","busiest","motel","in","the","city",".","it","rent","room","by","the","hour","and","be","one","of","many","on","8th","street","-","the","major","east-west","artery","through","the","city","and","the","heart","of","Little","Havana",".","motel","like","the","Starlite","be","latin","american","institution","that","be","introduce","to","the","United","States","by","Miami","'s","large","Cuban","and","Latin","American","population","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Love at the","at the Starlite","the Starlite Motel","Starlite Motel is","Motel is a","is a film","a film about","film about how","about how Latin","how Latin attitudes","Latin attitudes towards","attitudes towards love","towards love and","love and sex","and sex are","sex are meeting","are meeting America","meeting America at","America at the","at the intersection","the intersection of","intersection of 8th","of 8th Street","8th Street and","Street and Rte","and Rte 826","Rte 826 in","826 in Miami","The Starlite Motel","Starlite Motel is","Motel is the","is the busiest","the busiest motel","busiest motel in","motel in the","in the city","It rents rooms","rents rooms by","rooms by the","by the hour","the hour and","hour and is","and is one","is one of","one of many","of many on","many on 8th","on 8th Street","8th Street -","Street - the","- the major","the major east-west","major east-west artery","east-west artery through","artery through the","through the city","the city and","city and the","and the heart","the heart of","heart of Little","of Little Havana","Motels like the","like the Starlite","the Starlite are","Starlite are Latin","are Latin American","Latin American institutions","American institutions that","institutions that were","that were introduced","were introduced to","introduced to the","to the United","the United States","United States by","States by Miami","by Miami 's","Miami 's large","'s large Cuban","large Cuban and","Cuban and Latin","and Latin American","Latin American population"],"2grams":["Love at","at the","the Starlite","Starlite Motel","Motel is","is a","a film","film about","about how","how Latin","Latin attitudes","attitudes towards","towards love","love and","and sex","sex are","are meeting","meeting America","America at","at the","the intersection","intersection of","of 8th","8th Street","Street and","and Rte","Rte 826","826 in","in Miami","The Starlite","Starlite Motel","Motel is","is the","the busiest","busiest motel","motel in","in the","the city","It rents","rents rooms","rooms by","by the","the hour","hour and","and is","is one","one of","of many","many on","on 8th","8th Street","Street -","- the","the major","major east-west","east-west artery","artery through","through the","the city","city and","and the","the heart","heart of","of Little","Little Havana","Motels like","like the","the Starlite","Starlite are","are Latin","Latin American","American institutions","institutions that","that were","were introduced","introduced to","to the","the United","United States","States by","by Miami","Miami 's","'s large","large Cuban","Cuban and","and Latin","Latin American","American population"]}

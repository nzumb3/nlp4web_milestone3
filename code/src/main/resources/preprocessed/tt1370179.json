{"title":"Doctor S Battles the Sex Crazed Reefer Zombies: The Movie","plot":"In a quiet American town, life has decidedly slowed down to a crawl. A small group of scientists have unwittingly unleashed a horrible force upon the town. Mary Jane, the all American sweetheart, parks on Make Out Hill with her boyfriend Billy Everybody. He smokes some of the reefer and is suddenly transformed into a sex- crazed reefer zombie. Just as Billy lunges forward he is pulled out of the car and thrown to ground and shot. Mary Jane looks at her brutal savior, Dr. S. Dr S. battles his way back to the city, while dragging Mary Jane behind him. While Mary Jane tries to come to grip with the possible reality of her family dead and asks Dr. S to explain how this all happened. Dr. S tells her of how he and his team developed the reefer for the military to use as weapon, but it was too unstable. In a last ditch effort to create a more stable strain of the reefer, Dr. S tested some on himself. The reefer changed him, made him strong, but filled with an uncontrollable rage. Unable to stop himself Dr. S killed his whole team. Convincing Mary Jane there is a cure, Dr. S vows to set things right.","genres":["Comedy"," Sci-Fi"," Horror"],"stems":["In","a","quiet","American","town",",","life","has","decid","slow","down","to","a","crawl",".","A","small","group","of","scientist","have","unwit","unleash","a","horribl","forc","upon","the","town",".","Mari","Jane",",","the","all","American","sweetheart",",","park","on","Make","Out","Hill","with","her","boyfriend","Billi","Everybodi",".","He","smoke","some","of","the","reefer","and","is","sudden","transform","into","a","sex","-","craze","reefer","zombi",".","Just","as","Billi","lung","forward","he","is","pull","out","of","the","car","and","thrown","to","ground","and","shot",".","Mari","Jane","look","at","her","brutal","savior",",","Dr.","S.","Dr","S.","battl","his","way","back","to","the","citi",",","while","drag","Mari","Jane","behind","him",".","While","Mari","Jane","tri","to","come","to","grip","with","the","possibl","realiti","of","her","famili","dead","and","ask","Dr.","S","to","explain","how","this","all","happen",".","Dr.","S","tell","her","of","how","he","and","his","team","develop","the","reefer","for","the","militari","to","use","as","weapon",",","but","it","was","too","unstabl",".","In","a","last","ditch","effort","to","creat","a","more","stabl","strain","of","the","reefer",",","Dr.","S","test","some","on","himself",".","The","reefer","chang","him",",","made","him","strong",",","but","fill","with","an","uncontrol","rage",".","Unabl","to","stop","himself","Dr.","S","kill","his","whole","team",".","Convinc","Mari","Jane","there","is","a","cure",",","Dr.","S","vow","to","set","thing","right","."],"lemmas":["in","a","quiet","american","town",",","life","have","decidedly","slow","down","to","a","crawl",".","a","small","group","of","scientist","have","unwittingly","unleash","a","horrible","force","upon","the","town",".","Mary","Jane",",","the","all","american","sweetheart",",","park","on","Make","out","Hill","with","she","boyfriend","Billy","everybody",".","he","smoke","some","of","the","reefer","and","be","suddenly","transform","into","a","sex","-","crazed","reefer","zombie",".","just","as","Billy","lunge","forward","he","be","pull","out","of","the","car","and","throw","to","ground","and","shot",".","Mary","Jane","look","at","she","brutal","savior",",","Dr.","S.","Dr","S.","battle","he","way","back","to","the","city",",","while","drag","Mary","Jane","behind","he",".","while","Mary","Jane","try","to","come","to","grip","with","the","possible","reality","of","she","family","dead","and","ask","Dr.","S","to","explain","how","this","all","happen",".","Dr.","S","tell","she","of","how","he","and","he","team","develop","the","reefer","for","the","military","to","use","as","weapon",",","but","it","be","too","unstable",".","in","a","last","ditch","effort","to","create","a","more","stable","strain","of","the","reefer",",","Dr.","S","test","some","on","himself",".","the","reefer","change","he",",","make","he","strong",",","but","fill","with","a","uncontrollable","rage",".","unable","to","stop","himself","Dr.","S","kill","he","whole","team",".","convincing","Mary","Jane","there","be","a","cure",",","Dr.","S","vow","to","set","thing","right","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In a quiet","a quiet American","quiet American town","American town ,","town , life",", life has","life has decidedly","has decidedly slowed","decidedly slowed down","slowed down to","down to a","to a crawl","A small group","small group of","group of scientists","of scientists have","scientists have unwittingly","have unwittingly unleashed","unwittingly unleashed a","unleashed a horrible","a horrible force","horrible force upon","force upon the","upon the town","Mary Jane ,","Jane , the",", the all","the all American","all American sweetheart","American sweetheart ,","sweetheart , parks",", parks on","parks on Make","on Make Out","Make Out Hill","Out Hill with","Hill with her","with her boyfriend","her boyfriend Billy","boyfriend Billy Everybody","He smokes some","smokes some of","some of the","of the reefer","the reefer and","reefer and is","and is suddenly","is suddenly transformed","suddenly transformed into","transformed into a","into a sex","a sex -","sex - crazed","- crazed reefer","crazed reefer zombie","Just as Billy","as Billy lunges","Billy lunges forward","lunges forward he","forward he is","he is pulled","is pulled out","pulled out of","out of the","of the car","the car and","car and thrown","and thrown to","thrown to ground","to ground and","ground and shot","Mary Jane looks","Jane looks at","looks at her","at her brutal","her brutal savior","brutal savior ,","savior , Dr.",", Dr. S.","Dr. S.

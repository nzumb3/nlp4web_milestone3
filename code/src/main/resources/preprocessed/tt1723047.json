{"title":"Requiem for a Killer","plot":"Lucrèce is a contract killer in search of a new life. Specialized in the use of poisons and enamored with opera, she accepts a difficult, final hit in a castle in the heart of the Swiss Alps. Posing as a soprano, Lucrèce must perform on stage during the very prestigious Festival of Ermeux and slaughter one of her co-performers, British baritone Alexander Child, who recently bought a distillery in Scotland, and thus became the only obstacle to a strategic pipeline project with considerable financial ramifications. He just won a long legal battle against British Oil, who now has no other choice but to eliminate him. To complicate things, French counter-espionage learns of the hit and sends Rico, a reinstated former agent, to infiltrate the orchestra, unmask and terminate all who wish harm to Alexander Child. Rico has no information on the killer and has a lot of trouble identifying her amid a horde of suspicious characters: an obnoxious conductor, a particularly proud tenor and a strangely stressed festival director... Throughout rehearsals of Haendel's sublime Messiah, a breathless intrigue begins...and could end in a Requiem...for a killer!","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Lucrèc","is","a","contract","killer","in","search","of","a","new","life",".","Special","in","the","use","of","poison","and","enamor","with","opera",",","she","accept","a","difficult",",","final","hit","in","a","castl","in","the","heart","of","the","Swiss","Alps",".","Pose","as","a","soprano",",","Lucrèc","must","perform","on","stage","dure","the","veri","prestigi","Festiv","of","Ermeux","and","slaughter","one","of","her","co-perform",",","British","bariton","Alexand","Child",",","who","recent","bought","a","distilleri","in","Scotland",",","and","thus","becam","the","onli","obstacl","to","a","strateg","pipelin","project","with","consider","financi","ramif",".","He","just","won","a","long","legal","battl","against","British","Oil",",","who","now","has","no","other","choic","but","to","elimin","him",".","To","complic","thing",",","French","counter-espionag","learn","of","the","hit","and","send","Rico",",","a","reinstat","former","agent",",","to","infiltr","the","orchestra",",","unmask","and","termin","all","who","wish","harm","to","Alexand","Child",".","Rico","has","no","inform","on","the","killer","and","has","a","lot","of","troubl","identifi","her","amid","a","hord","of","suspici","charact",":","an","obnoxi","conductor",",","a","particular","proud","tenor","and","a","strang","stress","festiv","director","...","Throughout","rehears","of","Haendel","'s","sublim","Messiah",",","a","breathless","intrigu","begin","...","and","could","end","in","a","Requiem","...","for","a","killer","!"],"lemmas":["Lucrèce","be","a","contract","killer","in","search","of","a","new","life",".","Specialized","in","the","use","of","poison","and","enamor","with","opera",",","she","accept","a","difficult",",","final","hit","in","a","castle","in","the","heart","of","the","Swiss","Alps",".","pose","as","a","soprano",",","Lucrèce","must","perform","on","stage","during","the","very","prestigious","Festival","of","Ermeux","and","slaughter","one","of","she","co-performer",",","british","baritone","Alexander","Child",",","who","recently","buy","a","distillery","in","Scotland",",","and","thus","become","the","only","obstacle","to","a","strategic","pipeline","project","with","considerable","financial","ramification",".","he","just","win","a","long","legal","battle","against","British","Oil",",","who","now","have","no","other","choice","but","to","eliminate","he",".","to","complicate","thing",",","french","counter-espionage","learn","of","the","hit","and","send","Rico",",","a","reinstate","former","agent",",","to","infiltrate","the","orchestra",",","unmask","and","terminate","all","who","wish","harm","to","Alexander","Child",".","Rico","have","no","information","on","the","killer","and","have","a","lot","of","trouble","identify","she","amid","a","horde","of","suspicious","character",":","a","obnoxious","conductor",",","a","particularly","proud","tenor","and","a","strangely","stressed","festival","director","...","throughout","rehearsal","of","Haendel","'s","sublime","Messiah",",","a","breathless","intrigue","begin","...","and","could","end","in","a","Requiem","...","for","a","killer","!"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lucrèce

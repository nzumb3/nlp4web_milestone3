{"title":"Get Smart","plot":"American Maxwell Smart works for a Government spy agency in an administrative capacity. When the agency's head office is attacked, the Chief decides to assign Maxwell as a spy and partners him with sexy Agent 99, much to her chagrin. The duo nevertheless set off to combat their attackers by first parachuting off an airplane and landing in Russian territory - followed closely by an over seven feet tall, 400 pound goon, known simply as Dalip. The duo, handicapped by Maxwell's antics, will eventually have their identities compromised, and may be chalked up as casualties, while back in America their attackers have already planted a bomb that is set-up to explode in a concert.","genres":["Action"," Comedy"," Adventure"],"stems":["American","Maxwel","Smart","work","for","a","Govern","spi","agenc","in","an","administr","capac",".","When","the","agenc","'s","head","offic","is","attack",",","the","Chief","decid","to","assign","Maxwel","as","a","spi","and","partner","him","with","sexi","Agent","99",",","much","to","her","chagrin",".","The","duo","nevertheless","set","off","to","combat","their","attack","by","first","parachut","off","an","airplan","and","land","in","Russian","territori","-","follow","close","by","an","over","seven","feet","tall",",","400","pound","goon",",","known","simpli","as","Dalip",".","The","duo",",","handicap","by","Maxwel","'s","antic",",","will","eventu","have","their","ident","compromis",",","and","may","be","chalk","up","as","casualti",",","while","back","in","America","their","attack","have","alreadi","plant","a","bomb","that","is","set-up","to","explod","in","a","concert","."],"lemmas":["American","Maxwell","Smart","work","for","a","Government","spy","agency","in","a","administrative","capacity",".","when","the","agency","'s","head","office","be","attack",",","the","Chief","decide","to","assign","Maxwell","as","a","spy","and","partner","he","with","sexy","Agent","99",",","much","to","she","chagrin",".","the","duo","nevertheless","set","off","to","combat","they","attacker","by","first","parachute","off","a","airplane","and","landing","in","russian","territory","-","follow","closely","by","a","over","seven","foot","tall",",","400","pound","goon",",","know","simply","as","Dalip",".","the","duo",",","handicap","by","Maxwell","'s","antic",",","will","eventually","have","they","identity","compromise",",","and","may","be","chalk","up","as","casualty",",","while","back","in","America","they","attacker","have","already","plant","a","bomb","that","be","set-up","to","explode","in","a","concert","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["American Maxwell Smart","Maxwell Smart works","Smart works for","works for a","for a Government","a Government spy","Government spy agency","spy agency in","agency in an","in an administrative","an administrative capacity","When the agency","the agency 's","agency 's head","'s head office","head office is","office is attacked","is attacked ,","attacked , the",", the Chief","the Chief decides","Chief decides to","decides to assign","to assign Maxwell","assign Maxwell as","Maxwell as a","as a spy","a spy and","spy and partners","and partners him","partners him with","him with sexy","with sexy Agent","sexy Agent 99","Agent 99 ,","99 , much",", much to","much to her","to her chagrin","The duo nevertheless","duo nevertheless set","nevertheless set off","set off to","off to combat","to combat their","combat their attackers","their attackers by","attackers by first","by first parachuting","first parachuting off","parachuting off an","off an airplane","an airplane and","airplane and landing","and landing in","landing in Russian","in Russian territory","Russian territory -","territory -

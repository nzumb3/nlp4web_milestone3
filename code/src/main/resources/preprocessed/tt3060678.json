{"title":"Kancha Sherpa - Last of the first from the 1953 conquest of Mt Everest","plot":"The story about Kancha Sherpa from Namche in Nepal. He was one of 103 Sherpas that brought Sir Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay to the top of Mt. Everest in 1953, as the first to reach the top. This achievement would have been impossible without the strength, courage and knowledge of the Sherpas, who have a strong connection to the mountains of the Himalayas. At the age of 80, Kancha is the Last of the First from the 1953 expedition to Mt. Everest. Kancha is looking into the future, with a heartfelt hope that his tradition, will reach far into the 21st century and beyond. He is concerned to see modern traditions melting away old traditions, like the snow on the top of Mt. Everest","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"," Biography"],"stems":["The","stori","about","Kancha","Sherpa","from","Namch","in","Nepal",".","He","was","one","of","103","Sherpa","that","brought","Sir","Edmund","Hillari","and","Tenz","Norgay","to","the","top","of","Mt.","Everest","in","1953",",","as","the","first","to","reach","the","top",".","This","achiev","would","have","been","imposs","without","the","strength",",","courag","and","knowledg","of","the","Sherpa",",","who","have","a","strong","connect","to","the","mountain","of","the","Himalaya",".","At","the","age","of","80",",","Kancha","is","the","Last","of","the","First","from","the","1953","expedit","to","Mt.","Everest",".","Kancha","is","look","into","the","futur",",","with","a","heartfelt","hope","that","his","tradit",",","will","reach","far","into","the","21st","centuri","and","beyond",".","He","is","concern","to","see","modern","tradit","melt","away","old","tradit",",","like","the","snow","on","the","top","of","Mt.","Everest"],"lemmas":["the","story","about","Kancha","Sherpa","from","Namche","in","Nepal",".","he","be","one","of","103","sherpa","that","bring","Sir","Edmund","Hillary","and","Tenzing","Norgay","to","the","top","of","Mt.","Everest","in","1953",",","as","the","first","to","reach","the","top",".","this","achievement","would","have","be","impossible","without","the","strength",",","courage","and","knowledge","of","the","Sherpas",",","who","have","a","strong","connection","to","the","mountain","of","the","Himalayas",".","at","the","age","of","80",",","Kancha","be","the","last","of","the","First","from","the","1953","expedition","to","Mt.","Everest",".","Kancha","be","look","into","the","future",",","with","a","heartfelt","hope","that","he","tradition",",","will","reach","far","into","the","21st","century","and","beyond",".","he","be","concern","to","see","modern","tradition","melt","away","old","tradition",",","like","the","snow","on","the","top","of","Mt.","Everest"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The story about","story about Kancha","about Kancha Sherpa","Kancha Sherpa from","Sherpa from Namche","from Namche in","Namche in Nepal","He was one","was one of","one of 103","of 103 Sherpas","103 Sherpas that","Sherpas that brought","that brought Sir","brought Sir Edmund","Sir Edmund Hillary","Edmund Hillary and","Hillary and Tenzing","and Tenzing Norgay","Tenzing Norgay to","Norgay to the","to the top","the top of","top of Mt.","of Mt.

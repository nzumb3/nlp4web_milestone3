{"title":"A Reasonable Man","plot":"A Reasonable Man tells the story of a city lawyer who comes across the case of a herdboy from remote, rural Zululand, who has killed a one year old baby in the mistaken belief that he was killing an evil spirit, known throughout Southern Africa as the \"Tikoloshe\". Dark Secrets which lie buried deep within the lawyer connect him to the boy. He takes the case and enters a world of African witchcraft and mysticism to discover the truth about the killing - and himself.","genres":["Crime"," Mystery"," Drama"],"stems":["A","Reason","Man","tell","the","stori","of","a","citi","lawyer","who","come","across","the","case","of","a","herdboy","from","remot",",","rural","Zululand",",","who","has","kill","a","one","year","old","babi","in","the","mistaken","belief","that","he","was","kill","an","evil","spirit",",","known","throughout","Southern","Africa","as","the","\"","Tikolosh","\"",".","Dark","Secret","which","lie","buri","deep","within","the","lawyer","connect","him","to","the","boy",".","He","take","the","case","and","enter","a","world","of","African","witchcraft","and","mystic","to","discov","the","truth","about","the","kill","-","and","himself","."],"lemmas":["a","reasonable","man","tell","the","story","of","a","city","lawyer","who","come","across","the","case","of","a","herdboy","from","remote",",","rural","Zululand",",","who","have","kill","a","one","year","old","baby","in","the","mistaken","belief","that","he","be","kill","a","evil","spirit",",","know","throughout","Southern","Africa","as","the","``","Tikoloshe","''",".","dark","secret","which","lie","bury","deep","within","the","lawyer","connect","he","to","the","boy",".","he","take","the","case","and","enter","a","world","of","african","witchcraft","and","mysticism","to","discover","the","truth","about","the","killing","-","and","himself","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A Reasonable Man","Reasonable Man tells","Man tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of a","of a city","a city lawyer","city lawyer who","lawyer who comes","who comes across","comes across the","across the case","the case of","case of a","of a herdboy","a herdboy from","herdboy from remote","from remote ,","remote , rural",", rural Zululand","rural Zululand ,","Zululand , who",", who has","who has killed","has killed a","killed a one","a one year","one year old","year old baby","old baby in","baby in the","in the mistaken","the mistaken belief","mistaken belief that","belief that he","that he was","he was killing","was killing an","killing an evil","an evil spirit","evil spirit ,","spirit , known",", known throughout","known throughout Southern","throughout Southern Africa","Southern Africa as","Africa as the","as the \"","the \" Tikoloshe","\" Tikoloshe \"","Dark Secrets which","Secrets which lie","which lie buried","lie buried deep","buried deep within","deep within the","within the lawyer","the lawyer connect","lawyer connect him","connect him to","him to the","to the boy","He takes the","takes the case","the case and","case and enters","and enters a","enters a world","a world of","world of African","of African witchcraft","African witchcraft and","witchcraft and mysticism","and mysticism to","mysticism to discover","to discover the","discover the truth","the truth about","truth about the","about the killing","the killing -","killing - and","- and himself"],"2grams":["A Reasonable","Reasonable Man","Man tells","tells the","the story","story of","of a","a city","city lawyer","lawyer who","who comes","comes across","across the","the case","case of","of a","a herdboy","herdboy from","from remote","remote ,",", rural","rural Zululand","Zululand ,",", who","who has","has killed","killed a","a one","one year","year old","old baby","baby in","in the","the mistaken","mistaken belief","belief that","that he","he was","was killing","killing an","an evil","evil spirit","spirit ,",", known","known throughout","throughout Southern","Southern Africa","Africa as","as the","the \"","\" Tikoloshe","Tikoloshe \"","Dark Secrets","Secrets which","which lie","lie buried","buried deep","deep within","within the","the lawyer","lawyer connect","connect him","him to","to the","the boy","He takes","takes the","the case","case and","and enters","enters a","a world","world of","of African","African witchcraft","witchcraft and","and mysticism","mysticism to","to discover","discover the","the truth","truth about","about the","the killing","killing -","- and","and himself"]}

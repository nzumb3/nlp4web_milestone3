{"title":"Outside Ozona","plot":"A serial killer is on the prowl in the badlands of Ozona, Oklahoma, and the travelers who intersect at a roadside cafeteria somewhere between Texas and New Mexico are destined to cross his path. They include a circus clown and his stripper girlfriend, grieving sisters, a trucker, and a woman who is taking her mother to see the ocean before she dies. Tying everything together even tighter is the presence of the local radio station, whose DJ and boss don't seem to be getting along too well.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["A","serial","killer","is","on","the","prowl","in","the","badland","of","Ozona",",","Oklahoma",",","and","the","travel","who","intersect","at","a","roadsid","cafeteria","somewher","between","Texa","and","New","Mexico","are","destin","to","cross","his","path",".","They","includ","a","circus","clown","and","his","stripper","girlfriend",",","griev","sister",",","a","trucker",",","and","a","woman","who","is","take","her","mother","to","see","the","ocean","befor","she","die",".","Ty","everyth","togeth","even","tighter","is","the","presenc","of","the","local","radio","station",",","whose","DJ","and","boss","do","n't","seem","to","be","get","along","too","well","."],"lemmas":["a","serial","killer","be","on","the","prowl","in","the","badland","of","Ozona",",","Oklahoma",",","and","the","traveler","who","intersect","at","a","roadside","cafeteria","somewhere","between","Texas","and","New","Mexico","be","destine","to","cross","he","path",".","they","include","a","circus","clown","and","he","stripper","girlfriend",",","grieve","sister",",","a","trucker",",","and","a","woman","who","be","take","she","mother","to","see","the","ocean","before","she","die",".","tie","everything","together","even","tighter","be","the","presence","of","the","local","radio","station",",","whose","DJ","and","boss","do","not","seem","to","be","get","along","too","well","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A serial killer","serial killer is","killer is on","is on the","on the prowl","the prowl in","prowl in the","in the badlands","the badlands of","badlands of Ozona","of Ozona ,","Ozona , Oklahoma",", Oklahoma ,","Oklahoma , and",", and the","and the travelers","the travelers who","travelers who intersect","who intersect at","intersect at a","at a roadside","a roadside cafeteria","roadside cafeteria somewhere","cafeteria somewhere between","somewhere between Texas","between Texas and","Texas and New","and New Mexico","New Mexico are","Mexico are destined","are destined to","destined to cross","to cross his","cross his path","They include a","include a circus","a circus clown","circus clown and","clown and his","and his stripper","his stripper girlfriend","stripper girlfriend ,","girlfriend , grieving",", grieving sisters","grieving sisters ,","sisters , a",", a trucker","a trucker ,","trucker , and",", and a","and a woman","a woman who","woman who is","who is taking","is taking her","taking her mother","her mother to","mother to see","to see the","see the ocean","the ocean before","ocean before she","before she dies","Tying everything together","everything together even","together even tighter","even tighter is","tighter is the","is the presence","the presence of","presence of the","of the local","the local radio","local radio station","radio station ,","station , whose",", whose DJ","whose DJ and","DJ and boss","and boss do","boss do n't","do n't seem","n't seem to","seem to be","to be getting","be getting along","getting along too","along too well"],"2grams":["A serial","serial killer","killer is","is on","on the","the prowl","prowl in","in the","the badlands","badlands of","of Ozona","Ozona ,",", Oklahoma","Oklahoma ,",", and","and the","the travelers","travelers who","who intersect","intersect at","at a","a roadside","roadside cafeteria","cafeteria somewhere","somewhere between","between Texas","Texas and","and New","New Mexico","Mexico are","are destined","destined to","to cross","cross his","his path","They include","include a","a circus","circus clown","clown and","and his","his stripper","stripper girlfriend","girlfriend ,",", grieving","grieving sisters","sisters ,",", a","a trucker","trucker ,",", and","and a","a woman","woman who","who is","is taking","taking her","her mother","mother to","to see","see the","the ocean","ocean before","before she","she dies","Tying everything","everything together","together even","even tighter","tighter is","is the","the presence","presence of","of the","the local","local radio","radio station","station ,",", whose","whose DJ","DJ and","and boss","boss do","do n't","n't seem","seem to","to be","be getting","getting along","along too","too well"]}

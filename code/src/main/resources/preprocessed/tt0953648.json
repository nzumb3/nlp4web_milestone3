{"title":"Where the Change Is","plot":"Where The Change Is is a semi-fictional film about two young filmmakers attempting to reach the ultimate millennium party. The end result, however, is a socially relevant documentary involving a cross Canada train trip. Where The Change Is was shot on the Via Rail Trans-Canada train through the 1999-2000 new year (we were near Melville Saskatchewan when the ball dropped), and combines interviews with passengers on the train and an interesting mix of fictional and non-fictional events, similar to the 'third person' documentary feel found in much of Christopher Guest's work (namely Waiting for Guffman) and The Larry Sanders Show.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Where","The","Chang","Is","is","a","semi-fict","film","about","two","young","filmmak","attempt","to","reach","the","ultim","millennium","parti",".","The","end","result",",","howev",",","is","a","social","relev","documentari","involv","a","cross","Canada","train","trip",".","Where","The","Chang","Is","was","shot","on","the","Via","Rail","Trans-Canada","train","through","the","1999-2000","new","year","(","we","were","near","Melvill","Saskatchewan","when","the","ball","drop",")",",","and","combin","interview","with","passeng","on","the","train","and","an","interest","mix","of","fiction","and","non-fict","event",",","similar","to","the","'","third","person","'","documentari","feel","found","in","much","of","Christoph","Guest","'s","work","(","name","Wait","for","Guffman",")","and","The","Larri","Sander","Show","."],"lemmas":["where","the","Change","Is","be","a","semi-fictional","film","about","two","young","filmmaker","attempt","to","reach","the","ultimate","millennium","party",".","the","end","result",",","however",",","be","a","socially","relevant","documentary","involve","a","cross","Canada","train","trip",".","where","the","Change","Is","be","shoot","on","the","Via","Rail","Trans-Canada","train","through","the","1999-2000","new","year","-lrb-","we","be","near","Melville","Saskatchewan","when","the","ball","drop","-rrb-",",","and","combine","interview","with","passenger","on","the","train","and","a","interesting","mix","of","fictional","and","non-fictional","event",",","similar","to","the","'","third","person","'","documentary","feel","find","in","much","of","Christopher","Guest","'s","work","-lrb-","namely","Waiting","for","Guffman","-rrb-","and","the","Larry","Sanders","Show","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Where

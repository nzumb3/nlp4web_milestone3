{"title":"Deb and Sisi","plot":"Forever lonely, homely Deborah Dyer tries everything she can to \"suicide herself\" when she finds herself still single on her 40th birthday. All attempts fail as fate sends her car swerving right into Sisi Sickles, a recently evicted 40-something promiscuous waitress. Seeing an opportunity for a quick buck, Sisi hastily begins to take advantage of naive Deb and is soon at Deb's doorstep with a \"broken umbilical cord or two.\" Stricken with guilt, a clueless and lonely Deb postpones her self-destructive plans to take care of Sisi. Things run hilariously amok when the two women grow closer and develop the only real friendship either of them has ever had. Who needs a man anyways, right?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Forev","lone",",","home","Deborah","Dyer","tri","everyth","she","can","to","\"","suicid","herself","\"","when","she","find","herself","still","singl","on","her","40th","birthday",".","All","attempt","fail","as","fate","send","her","car","swerv","right","into","Sisi","Sickl",",","a","recent","evict","40-someth","promiscu","waitress",".","See","an","opportun","for","a","quick","buck",",","Sisi","hastili","begin","to","take","advantag","of","naiv","Deb","and","is","soon","at","Deb","'s","doorstep","with","a","\"","broken","umbil","cord","or","two",".","\"","Stricken","with","guilt",",","a","clueless","and","lone","Deb","postpon","her","self-destruct","plan","to","take","care","of","Sisi",".","Thing","run","hilari","amok","when","the","two","women","grow","closer","and","develop","the","onli","real","friendship","either","of","them","has","ever","had",".","Who","need","a","man","anyway",",","right","?"],"lemmas":["forever","lonely",",","homely","Deborah","Dyer","try","everything","she","can","to","``","suicide","herself","''","when","she","find","herself","still","single","on","she","40th","birthday",".","all","attempt","fail","as","fate","send","she","car","swerve","right","into","Sisi","Sickles",",","a","recently","evict","40-something","promiscuous","waitress",".","see","a","opportunity","for","a","quick","buck",",","Sisi","hastily","begin","to","take","advantage","of","naive","Deb","and","be","soon","at","Deb","'s","doorstep","with","a","``","broken","umbilical","cord","or","two",".","''","stricken","with","guilt",",","a","clueless","and","lonely","Deb","postpone","she","self-destructive","plan","to","take","care","of","Sisi",".","thing","run","hilariously","amok","when","the","two","woman","grow","closer","and","develop","the","only","real","friendship","either","of","they","have","ever","have",".","who","need","a","man","anyways",",","right","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Forever

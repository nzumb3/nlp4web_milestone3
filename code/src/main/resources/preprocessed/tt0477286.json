{"title":"D.D.R.","plot":"Disarmament, Demobilisation, Reintegration. DDR is the name of the programme set up by the United Nations in Afghanistan in 2004 after thirty years of successive conflicts in this part of the world. This film aims to relate the application of this programme, on the spot, in its different phases, at the obligatory slow pace. This measure affects 100,000 Afghan soldiers, most of whom have never known any other occupation but war. They are now laying down arms, leaving the army, returning to civilian life and learning a trade. The film observes this process with a precision that makes it a rare document.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Disarma",",","Demobilis",",","Reintegr",".","DDR","is","the","name","of","the","programm","set","up","by","the","Unite","Nation","in","Afghanistan","in","2004","after","thirti","year","of","success","conflict","in","this","part","of","the","world",".","This","film","aim","to","relat","the","applic","of","this","programm",",","on","the","spot",",","in","it","differ","phase",",","at","the","obligatori","slow","pace",".","This","measur","affect","100,000","Afghan","soldier",",","most","of","whom","have","never","known","ani","other","occup","but","war",".","They","are","now","lay","down","arm",",","leav","the","armi",",","return","to","civilian","life","and","learn","a","trade",".","The","film","observ","this","process","with","a","precis","that","make","it","a","rare","document","."],"lemmas":["disarmament",",","Demobilisation",",","Reintegration",".","DDR","be","the","name","of","the","programme","set","up","by","the","United","Nations","in","Afghanistan","in","2004","after","thirty","year","of","successive","conflict","in","this","part","of","the","world",".","this","film","aim","to","relate","the","application","of","this","programme",",","on","the","spot",",","in","its","different","phase",",","at","the","obligatory","slow","pace",".","this","measure","affect","100,000","Afghan","soldier",",","most","of","whom","have","never","know","any","other","occupation","but","war",".","they","be","now","lay","down","arm",",","leave","the","army",",","return","to","civilian","life","and","learn","a","trade",".","the","film","observe","this","process","with","a","precision","that","make","it","a","rare","document","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Disarmament , Demobilisation",", Demobilisation ,","Demobilisation , Reintegration","DDR is the","is the name","the name of","name of the","of the programme","the programme set","programme set up","set up by","up by the","by the United","the United Nations","United Nations in","Nations in Afghanistan","in Afghanistan in","Afghanistan in 2004","in 2004 after","2004 after thirty","after thirty years","thirty years of","years of successive","of successive conflicts","successive conflicts in","conflicts in this","in this part","this part of","part of the","of the world","This film aims","film aims to","aims to relate","to relate the","relate the application","the application of","application of this","of this programme","this programme ,","programme , on",", on the","on the spot","the spot ,","spot , in",", in its","in its different","its different phases","different phases ,","phases , at",", at the","at the obligatory","the obligatory slow","obligatory slow pace","This measure affects","measure affects 100,000","affects 100,000 Afghan","100,000 Afghan soldiers","Afghan soldiers ,","soldiers , most",", most of","most of whom","of whom have","whom have never","have never known","never known any","known any other","any other occupation","other occupation but","occupation but war","They are now","are now laying","now laying down","laying down arms","down arms ,","arms , leaving",", leaving the","leaving the army","the army ,","army , returning",", returning to","returning to civilian","to civilian life","civilian life and","life and learning","and learning a","learning a trade","The film observes","film observes this","observes this process","this process with","process with a","with a precision","a precision that","precision that makes","that makes it","makes it a","it a rare","a rare document"],"2grams":["Disarmament ,",", Demobilisation","Demobilisation ,",", Reintegration","DDR is","is the","the name","name of","of the","the programme","programme set","set up","up by","by the","the United","United Nations","Nations in","in Afghanistan","Afghanistan in","in 2004","2004 after","after thirty","thirty years","years of","of successive","successive conflicts","conflicts in","in this","this part","part of","of the","the world","This film","film aims","aims to","to relate","relate the","the application","application of","of this","this programme","programme ,",", on","on the","the spot","spot ,",", in","in its","its different","different phases","phases ,",", at","at the","the obligatory","obligatory slow","slow pace","This measure","measure affects","affects 100,000","100,000 Afghan","Afghan soldiers","soldiers ,",", most","most of","of whom","whom have","have never","never known","known any","any other","other occupation","occupation but","but war","They are","are now","now laying","laying down","down arms","arms ,",", leaving","leaving the","the army","army ,",", returning","returning to","to civilian","civilian life","life and","and learning","learning a","a trade","The film","film observes","observes this","this process","process with","with a","a precision","precision that","that makes","makes it","it a","a rare","rare document"]}

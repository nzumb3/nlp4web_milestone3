{"title":"Palace of Silents","plot":"The Silent Movie Theater has been screening the films of the silent era for over 65 years. It was almost lost to us completely when its previous owner, Lawrence Austin, was murdered in the theater's lobby. This is a documentary film about the passionate and somewhat eccentric individuals who strove to keep the old movies running for audiences in this unique and odd venue. This is a film about obsession for silent film and a love of the theater. The Silent Movie Theater's Quixotic occupants keep on screening films (now of all eras) despite the odds of the place surviving.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Silent","Movi","Theater","has","been","screen","the","film","of","the","silent","era","for","over","65","year",".","It","was","almost","lost","to","us","complet","when","it","previous","owner",",","Lawrenc","Austin",",","was","murder","in","the","theater","'s","lobbi",".","This","is","a","documentari","film","about","the","passion","and","somewhat","eccentr","individu","who","strove","to","keep","the","old","movi","run","for","audienc","in","this","uniqu","and","odd","venu",".","This","is","a","film","about","obsess","for","silent","film","and","a","love","of","the","theater",".","The","Silent","Movi","Theater","'s","Quixot","occup","keep","on","screen","film","(","now","of","all","era",")","despit","the","odd","of","the","place","surviv","."],"lemmas":["the","Silent","Movie","Theater","have","be","screen","the","film","of","the","silent","era","for","over","65","year",".","it","be","almost","lose","to","we","completely","when","its","previous","owner",",","Lawrence","Austin",",","be","murder","in","the","theater","'s","lobby",".","this","be","a","documentary","film","about","the","passionate","and","somewhat","eccentric","individual","who","strive","to","keep","the","old","movie","run","for","audience","in","this","unique","and","odd","venue",".","this","be","a","film","about","obsession","for","silent","film","and","a","love","of","the","theater",".","the","Silent","Movie","Theater","'s","quixotic","occupant","keep","on","screening","film","-lrb-","now","of","all","era","-rrb-","despite","the","odds","of","the","place","survive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The Silent Movie","Silent Movie Theater","Movie Theater has","Theater has been","has been screening","been screening the","screening the films","the films of","films of the","of the silent","the silent era","silent era for","era for over","for over 65","over 65 years","It was almost","was almost lost","almost lost to","lost to us","to us completely","us completely when","completely when its","when its previous","its previous owner","previous owner ,","owner , Lawrence",", Lawrence Austin","Lawrence Austin ,","Austin , was",", was murdered","was murdered in","murdered in the","in the theater","the theater 's","theater 's lobby","This is a","is a documentary","a documentary film","documentary film about","film about the","about the passionate","the passionate and","passionate and somewhat","and somewhat eccentric","somewhat eccentric individuals","eccentric individuals who","individuals who strove","who strove to","strove to keep","to keep the","keep the old","the old movies","old movies running","movies running for","running for audiences","for audiences in","audiences in this","in this unique","this unique and","unique and odd","and odd venue","This is a","is a film","a film about","film about obsession","about obsession for","obsession for silent","for silent film","silent film and","film and a","and a love","a love of","love of the","of the theater","The Silent Movie","Silent Movie Theater","Movie Theater 's","Theater 's Quixotic","'s Quixotic occupants","Quixotic occupants keep","occupants keep on","keep on screening","on screening films","screening films (","films ( now","( now of","now of all","of all eras","all eras )","eras ) despite",") despite the","despite the odds","the odds of","odds of the","of the place","the place surviving"],"2grams":["The Silent","Silent Movie","Movie Theater","Theater has","has been","been screening","screening the","the films","films of","of the","the silent","silent era","era for","for over","over 65","65 years","It was","was almost","almost lost","lost to","to us","us completely","completely when","when its","its previous","previous owner","owner ,",", Lawrence","Lawrence Austin","Austin ,",", was","was murdered","murdered in","in the","the theater","theater 's","'s lobby","This is","is a","a documentary","documentary film","film about","about the","the passionate","passionate and","and somewhat","somewhat eccentric","eccentric individuals","individuals who","who strove","strove to","to keep","keep the","the old","old movies","movies running","running for","for audiences","audiences in","in this","this unique","unique and","and odd","odd venue","This is","is a","a film","film about","about obsession","obsession for","for silent","silent film","film and","and a","a love","love of","of the","the theater","The Silent","Silent Movie","Movie Theater","Theater 's","'s Quixotic","Quixotic occupants","occupants keep","keep on","on screening","screening films","films (","( now","now of","of all","all eras","eras )",") despite","despite the","the odds","odds of","of the","the place","place surviving"]}

{"title":"Generació 3.0","plot":"Generació 3.0 depicts the creative process behind the exhibition Genius Loci, which took place in 2011 at Fundació Joan Miró in Barcelona. The project consisted of gathering ten Catalan bands and offering them a space where they could perform one of their songs as an artistic installation. The ten bands that are involved at the project are: Els Amics de les Arts, Hidrogenesse, Illa Carolina, Internet 2, Manos de Topo, Mishima, Mürfila, Standstill, The Pinker Tones, Za! At the same time, this documentary provides awareness of a new musical movement in Catalonia. These ten bands, though they may have their own unique styles, aesthetics and ways of approaching music at first sight may set them apart, by gathering them together and analyzing them in their environment, they create a singe entity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Generació","3.0","depict","the","creativ","process","behind","the","exhibit","Genius","Loci",",","which","took","place","in","2011","at","Fundació","Joan","Miró","in","Barcelona",".","The","project","consist","of","gather","ten","Catalan","band","and","offer","them","a","space","where","they","could","perform","one","of","their","song","as","an","artist","instal",".","The","ten","band","that","are","involv","at","the","project","are",":","Els","Amic","de","les","Arts",",","Hidrogeness",",","Illa","Carolina",",","Internet","2",",","Mano","de","Topo",",","Mishima",",","Mürfila",",","Standstil",",","The","Pinker","Tone",",","Za","!","At","the","same","time",",","this","documentari","provid","awar","of","a","new","music","movement","in","Catalonia",".","These","ten","band",",","though","they","may","have","their","own","uniqu","style",",","aesthet","and","way","of","approach","music","at","first","sight","may","set","them","apart",",","by","gather","them","togeth","and","analyz","them","in","their","environ",",","they","creat","a","sing","entiti","."],"lemmas":["generació","3.0","depict","the","creative","process","behind","the","exhibition","genius","loci",",","which","take","place","in","2011","at","Fundació","Joan","Miró","in","Barcelona",".","the","project","consist","of","gathering","ten","Catalan","band","and","offer","they","a","space","where","they","could","perform","one","of","they","song","as","a","artistic","installation",".","the","ten","band","that","be","involve","at","the","project","be",":","Els","Amics","de","les","Arts",",","Hidrogenesse",",","Illa","Carolina",",","Internet","2",",","Manos","de","Topo",",","Mishima",",","Mürfila",",","Standstill",",","The","Pinker","Tones",",","Za","!","at","the","same","time",",","this","documentary","provide","awareness","of","a","new","musical","movement","in","Catalonia",".","these","ten","band",",","though","they","may","have","they","own","unique","style",",","aesthetics","and","way","of","approach","music","at","first","sight","may","set","they","apart",",","by","gather","they","together","and","analyze","they","in","they","environment",",","they","create","a","singe","entity","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Generació

{"title":"Happy Darts","plot":"30-year-old office lady Minako bolts from work every day at exactly 5 o'clock to rush over to the local dart bar, simply to be near her crush Shinozuka. One night she plays darts against an expert and gets soundly thrashed and embarrassed in the match. Knowing that Shinozuka has aspirations of going pro, Minako makes the bold prediction that she's going to win the national soft-tip dart competition. However, in order to beat her rival it's going to take a lot of practice in a relatively short amount of time.","genres":["Comedy"," Sport"],"stems":["30-year-old","offic","ladi","Minako","bolt","from","work","everi","day","at","exact","5","o'clock","to","rush","over","to","the","local","dart","bar",",","simpli","to","be","near","her","crush","Shinozuka",".","One","night","she","play","dart","against","an","expert","and","get","sound","thrash","and","embarrass","in","the","match",".","Know","that","Shinozuka","has","aspir","of","go","pro",",","Minako","make","the","bold","predict","that","she","'s","go","to","win","the","nation","soft-tip","dart","competit",".","Howev",",","in","order","to","beat","her","rival","it","'s","go","to","take","a","lot","of","practic","in","a","relat","short","amount","of","time","."],"lemmas":["30-year-old","office","lady","Minako","bolt","from","work","every","day","at","exactly","5","o'clock","to","rush","over","to","the","local","dart","bar",",","simply","to","be","near","she","crush","Shinozuka",".","one","night","she","play","darts","against","a","expert","and","get","soundly","thrash","and","embarrass","in","the","match",".","know","that","Shinozuka","have","aspiration","of","go","pro",",","Minako","make","the","bold","prediction","that","she","be","go","to","win","the","national","soft-tip","dart","competition",".","however",",","in","order","to","beat","she","rival","it","be","go","to","take","a","lot","of","practice","in","a","relatively","short","amount","of","time","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["30-year-old office lady","office lady Minako","lady Minako bolts","Minako bolts from","bolts from work","from work every","work every day","every day at","day at exactly","at exactly 5","exactly 5 o'clock","5 o'clock to","o'clock to rush","to rush over","rush over to","over to the","to the local","the local dart","local dart bar","dart bar ,","bar , simply",", simply to","simply to be","to be near","be near her","near her crush","her crush Shinozuka","One night she","night she plays","she plays darts","plays darts against","darts against an","against an expert","an expert and","expert and gets","and gets soundly","gets soundly thrashed","soundly thrashed and","thrashed and embarrassed","and embarrassed in","embarrassed in the","in the match","Knowing that Shinozuka","that Shinozuka has","Shinozuka has aspirations","has aspirations of","aspirations of going","of going pro","going pro ,","pro , Minako",", Minako makes","Minako makes the","makes the bold","the bold prediction","bold prediction that","prediction that she","that she 's","she 's going","'s going to","going to win","to win the","win the national","the national soft-tip","national soft-tip dart","soft-tip dart competition","However , in",", in order","in order to","order to beat","to beat her","beat her rival","her rival it","rival it 's","it 's going","'s going to","going to take","to take a","take a lot","a lot of","lot of practice","of practice in","practice in a","in a relatively","a relatively short","relatively short amount","short amount of","amount of time"],"2grams":["30-year-old office","office lady","lady Minako","Minako bolts","bolts from","from work","work every","every day","day at","at exactly","exactly 5","5 o'clock","o'clock to","to rush","rush over","over to","to the","the local","local dart","dart bar","bar ,",", simply","simply to","to be","be near","near her","her crush","crush Shinozuka","One night","night she","she plays","plays darts","darts against","against an","an expert","expert and","and gets","gets soundly","soundly thrashed","thrashed and","and embarrassed","embarrassed in","in the","the match","Knowing that","that Shinozuka","Shinozuka has","has aspirations","aspirations of","of going","going pro","pro ,",", Minako","Minako makes","makes the","the bold","bold prediction","prediction that","that she","she 's","'s going","going to","to win","win the","the national","national soft-tip","soft-tip dart","dart competition","However ,",", in","in order","order to","to beat","beat her","her rival","rival it","it 's","'s going","going to","to take","take a","a lot","lot of","of practice","practice in","in a","a relatively","relatively short","short amount","amount of","of time"]}

{"title":"Leap of Faith","plot":"Four American families struggle with a life-altering decision to abandon their childhood Christian faith for conversion to Orthodox Judaism. A young woman from Trinidad, a family who leaves their dream home in the remote mountains of Colorado, a career Army woman and single mother, and an elderly couple. Each finally finds the faith for which they've long searched. Filmed over a three-year period, Leap of Faith is the rare documentary to chronicle not only the deeply emotional process of religious conversion, but also its effects on children and extended families.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Four","American","famili","struggl","with","a","life-alt","decis","to","abandon","their","childhood","Christian","faith","for","convers","to","Orthodox","Judaism",".","A","young","woman","from","Trinidad",",","a","famili","who","leav","their","dream","home","in","the","remot","mountain","of","Colorado",",","a","career","Armi","woman","and","singl","mother",",","and","an","elder","coupl",".","Each","final","find","the","faith","for","which","they","ve","long","search",".","Film","over","a","three-year","period",",","Leap","of","Faith","is","the","rare","documentari","to","chronicl","not","onli","the","deepli","emot","process","of","religi","convers",",","but","also","it","effect","on","children","and","extend","famili","."],"lemmas":["four","american","family","struggle","with","a","life-altering","decision","to","abandon","they","childhood","Christian","faith","for","conversion","to","Orthodox","Judaism",".","a","young","woman","from","Trinidad",",","a","family","who","leave","they","dream","home","in","the","remote","mountain","of","Colorado",",","a","career","Army","woman","and","single","mother",",","and","a","elderly","couple",".","each","finally","find","the","faith","for","which","they","have","long","search",".","film","over","a","three-year","period",",","Leap","of","Faith","be","the","rare","documentary","to","chronicle","not","only","the","deeply","emotional","process","of","religious","conversion",",","but","also","its","effect","on","child","and","extended","family","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Four American families","American families struggle","families struggle with","struggle with a","with a life-altering","a life-altering decision","life-altering decision to","decision to abandon","to abandon their","abandon their childhood","their childhood Christian","childhood Christian faith","Christian faith for","faith for conversion","for conversion to","conversion to Orthodox","to Orthodox Judaism","A young woman","young woman from","woman from Trinidad","from Trinidad ,","Trinidad , a",", a family","a family who","family who leaves","who leaves their","leaves their dream","their dream home","dream home in","home in the","in the remote","the remote mountains","remote mountains of","mountains of Colorado","of Colorado ,","Colorado , a",", a career","a career Army","career Army woman","Army woman and","woman and single","and single mother","single mother ,","mother , and",", and an","and an elderly","an elderly couple","Each finally finds","finally finds the","finds the faith","the faith for","faith for which","for which they","which they 've","they 've long","'ve long searched","Filmed over a","over a three-year","a three-year period","three-year period ,","period , Leap",", Leap of","Leap of Faith","of Faith is","Faith is the","is the rare","the rare documentary","rare documentary to","documentary to chronicle","to chronicle not","chronicle not only","not only the","only the deeply","the deeply emotional","deeply emotional process","emotional process of","process of religious","of religious conversion","religious conversion ,","conversion , but",", but also","but also its","also its effects","its effects on","effects on children","on children and","children and extended","and extended families"],"2grams":["Four American","American families","families struggle","struggle with","with a","a life-altering","life-altering decision","decision to","to abandon","abandon their","their childhood","childhood Christian","Christian faith","faith for","for conversion","conversion to","to Orthodox","Orthodox Judaism","A young","young woman","woman from","from Trinidad","Trinidad ,",", a","a family","family who","who leaves","leaves their","their dream","dream home","home in","in the","the remote","remote mountains","mountains of","of Colorado","Colorado ,",", a","a career","career Army","Army woman","woman and","and single","single mother","mother ,",", and","and an","an elderly","elderly couple","Each finally","finally finds","finds the","the faith","faith for","for which","which they","they 've","'ve long","long searched","Filmed over","over a","a three-year","three-year period","period ,",", Leap","Leap of","of Faith","Faith is","is the","the rare","rare documentary","documentary to","to chronicle","chronicle not","not only","only the","the deeply","deeply emotional","emotional process","process of","of religious","religious conversion","conversion ,",", but","but also","also its","its effects","effects on","on children","children and","and extended","extended families"]}

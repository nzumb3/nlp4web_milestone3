{"title":"Bureau 06","plot":"This is the dramatic story of Bureau 06, the team of police investigators formed for the sole purpose of investigating and preparing the grave charges brought by the Jewish people against Adolf Eichmann, during the trial that took place in Jerusalem, 1961. The Eichmann trial presented the story of the Shoah to the entire world in a way that had never been told before. This film reveals the unique personal and shared stories of the team of investigators, their hardships, their confessions and the emotional turmoil they experienced, while trying to revive the \"act of evil\" for the very first time. After the investigation was concluded and the charges brought forth, most of the investigators were emotionally drained and did not appear at the trial. Of special note is the story of Avner Less, Eichmann's personal interrogator, who spent more than 275 hours with Eichmann, left Israel after the trial, and reclaimed his German identity card.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","the","dramat","stori","of","Bureau","06",",","the","team","of","polic","investig","form","for","the","sole","purpos","of","investig","and","prepar","the","grave","charg","brought","by","the","Jewish","peopl","against","Adolf","Eichmann",",","dure","the","trial","that","took","place","in","Jerusalem",",","1961",".","The","Eichmann","trial","present","the","stori","of","the","Shoah","to","the","entir","world","in","a","way","that","had","never","been","told","befor",".","This","film","reveal","the","uniqu","person","and","share","stori","of","the","team","of","investig",",","their","hardship",",","their","confess","and","the","emot","turmoil","they","experienc",",","while","tri","to","reviv","the","\"","act","of","evil","\"","for","the","veri","first","time",".","After","the","investig","was","conclud","and","the","charg","brought","forth",",","most","of","the","investig","were","emot","drain","and","did","not","appear","at","the","trial",".","Of","special","note","is","the","stori","of","Avner","Less",",","Eichmann","'s","person","interrog",",","who","spent","more","than","275","hour","with","Eichmann",",","left","Israel","after","the","trial",",","and","reclaim","his","German","ident","card","."],"lemmas":["this","be","the","dramatic","story","of","Bureau","06",",","the","team","of","police","investigator","form","for","the","sole","purpose","of","investigate","and","prepare","the","grave","charge","bring","by","the","jewish","people","against","Adolf","Eichmann",",","during","the","trial","that","take","place","in","Jerusalem",",","1961",".","the","Eichmann","trial","present","the","story","of","the","Shoah","to","the","entire","world","in","a","way","that","have","never","be","tell","before",".","this","film","reveal","the","unique","personal","and","shared","story","of","the","team","of","investigator",",","they","hardship",",","they","confession","and","the","emotional","turmoil","they","experience",",","while","try","to","revive","the","``","act","of","evil","''","for","the","very","first","time",".","after","the","investigation","be","conclude","and","the","charge","bring","forth",",","most","of","the","investigator","be","emotionally","drain","and","do","not","appear","at","the","trial",".","of","special","note","be","the","story","of","Avner","less",",","Eichmann","'s","personal","interrogator",",","who","spend","more","than","275","hour","with","Eichmann",",","leave","Israel","after","the","trial",",","and","reclaim","he","german","identity","card","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

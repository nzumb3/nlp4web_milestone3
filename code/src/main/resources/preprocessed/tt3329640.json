{"title":"Don't Shoot the Messenger","plot":"On October 15, 2011, a group sets up an encampment, after international example, on the Beursplein in Amsterdam: Occupy Amsterdam. For two months activists from all walks of life camp on the square. A spontaneous protest without leaders or program. Occupy becomes familiar, in the Netherlands too, but two years later not much seems to be left of the willingness to take action. Does that show the activists were mistaken, or did we simply not want to listen to them?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","October","15",",","2011",",","a","group","set","up","an","encamp",",","after","intern","exampl",",","on","the","Beursplein","in","Amsterdam",":","Occupi","Amsterdam",".","For","two","month","activist","from","all","walk","of","life","camp","on","the","squar",".","A","spontan","protest","without","leader","or","program",".","Occupi","becom","familiar",",","in","the","Netherland","too",",","but","two","year","later","not","much","seem","to","be","left","of","the","willing","to","take","action",".","Doe","that","show","the","activist","were","mistaken",",","or","did","we","simpli","not","want","to","listen","to","them","?"],"lemmas":["on","October","15",",","2011",",","a","group","set","up","a","encampment",",","after","international","example",",","on","the","Beursplein","in","Amsterdam",":","Occupy","Amsterdam",".","for","two","month","activist","from","all","walk","of","life","camp","on","the","square",".","a","spontaneous","protest","without","leader","or","program",".","Occupy","become","familiar",",","in","the","Netherlands","too",",","but","two","year","later","not","much","seem","to","be","leave","of","the","willingness","to","take","action",".","do","that","show","the","activist","be","mistaken",",","or","do","we","simply","not","want","to","listen","to","they","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["On October 15","October 15 ,","15 , 2011",", 2011 ,","2011 , a",", a group","a group sets","group sets up","sets up an","up an encampment","an encampment ,","encampment , after",", after international","after international example","international example ,","example , on",", on the","on the Beursplein","the Beursplein in","Beursplein in Amsterdam","in Amsterdam :","Amsterdam : Occupy",": Occupy Amsterdam","For two months","two months activists","months activists from","activists from all","from all walks","all walks of","walks of life","of life camp","life camp on","camp on the","on the square","A spontaneous protest","spontaneous protest without","protest without leaders","without leaders or","leaders or program","Occupy becomes familiar","becomes familiar ,","familiar , in",", in the","in the Netherlands","the Netherlands too","Netherlands too ,","too , but",", but two","but two years","two years later","years later not","later not much","not much seems","much seems to","seems to be","to be left","be left of","left of the","of the willingness","the willingness to","willingness to take","to take action","Does that show","that show the","show the activists","the activists were","activists were mistaken","were mistaken ,","mistaken , or",", or did","or did we","did we simply","we simply not","simply not want","not want to","want to listen","to listen to","listen to them"],"2grams":["On October","October 15","15 ,",", 2011","2011 ,",", a","a group","group sets","sets up","up an","an encampment","encampment ,",", after","after international","international example","example ,",", on","on the","the Beursplein","Beursplein in","in Amsterdam","Amsterdam :",": Occupy","Occupy Amsterdam","For two","two months","months activists","activists from","from all","all walks","walks of","of life","life camp","camp on","on the","the square","A spontaneous","spontaneous protest","protest without","without leaders","leaders or","or program","Occupy becomes","becomes familiar","familiar ,",", in","in the","the Netherlands","Netherlands too","too ,",", but","but two","two years","years later","later not","not much","much seems","seems to","to be","be left","left of","of the","the willingness","willingness to","to take","take action","Does that","that show","show the","the activists","activists were","were mistaken","mistaken ,",", or","or did","did we","we simply","simply not","not want","want to","to listen","listen to","to them"]}

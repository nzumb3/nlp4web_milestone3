{"title":"Pau Brasil","plot":"In Pau Brasil, a small, isolated town in the heart of Brazil, the families of Joaquim and Nives live side by side. Although they live together in the same perverse structure of social oppression, the ways they deal with life are radically different. Intolerance toward others and poverty are the ingredients of this tragic drama in which each person bears their contradictions, coexisting with both classical and Afro-Brazilian myths.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","Pau","Brasil",",","a","small",",","isol","town","in","the","heart","of","Brazil",",","the","famili","of","Joaquim","and","Nive","live","side","by","side",".","Although","they","live","togeth","in","the","same","pervers","structur","of","social","oppress",",","the","way","they","deal","with","life","are","radic","differ",".","Intoler","toward","other","and","poverti","are","the","ingredi","of","this","tragic","drama","in","which","each","person","bear","their","contradict",",","coexist","with","both","classic","and","Afro-Brazilian","myth","."],"lemmas":["in","Pau","Brasil",",","a","small",",","isolate","town","in","the","heart","of","Brazil",",","the","family","of","Joaquim","and","Nives","live","side","by","side",".","although","they","live","together","in","the","same","perverse","structure","of","social","oppression",",","the","way","they","deal","with","life","be","radically","different",".","intolerance","toward","other","and","poverty","be","the","ingredient","of","this","tragic","drama","in","which","each","person","bear","they","contradiction",",","coexist","with","both","classical","and","afro-brazilian","myth","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Pau Brasil","Pau Brasil ,","Brasil , a",", a small","a small ,","small , isolated",", isolated town","isolated town in","town in the","in the heart","the heart of","heart of Brazil","of Brazil ,","Brazil , the",", the families","the families of","families of Joaquim","of Joaquim and","Joaquim and Nives","and Nives live","Nives live side","live side by","side by side","Although they live","they live together","live together in","together in the","in the same","the same perverse","same perverse structure","perverse structure of","structure of social","of social oppression","social oppression ,","oppression , the",", the ways","the ways they","ways they deal","they deal with","deal with life","with life are","life are radically","are radically different","Intolerance toward others","toward others and","others and poverty","and poverty are","poverty are the","are the ingredients","the ingredients of","ingredients of this","of this tragic","this tragic drama","tragic drama in","drama in which","in which each","which each person","each person bears","person bears their","bears their contradictions","their contradictions ,","contradictions , coexisting",", coexisting with","coexisting with both","with both classical","both classical and","classical and Afro-Brazilian","and Afro-Brazilian myths"],"2grams":["In Pau","Pau Brasil","Brasil ,",", a","a small","small ,",", isolated","isolated town","town in","in the","the heart","heart of","of Brazil","Brazil ,",", the","the families","families of","of Joaquim","Joaquim and","and Nives","Nives live","live side","side by","by side","Although they","they live","live together","together in","in the","the same","same perverse","perverse structure","structure of","of social","social oppression","oppression ,",", the","the ways","ways they","they deal","deal with","with life","life are","are radically","radically different","Intolerance toward","toward others","others and","and poverty","poverty are","are the","the ingredients","ingredients of","of this","this tragic","tragic drama","drama in","in which","which each","each person","person bears","bears their","their contradictions","contradictions ,",", coexisting","coexisting with","with both","both classical","classical and","and Afro-Brazilian","Afro-Brazilian myths"]}

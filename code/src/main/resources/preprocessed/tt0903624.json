{"title":"The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey","plot":"Bilbo Baggins is swept into a quest to reclaim the lost Dwarf Kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. Approached out of the blue by the wizard Gandalf the Grey, Bilbo finds himself joining a company of thirteen dwarves led by the legendary warrior, Thorin Oakenshield. Their journey will take them into the Wild; through treacherous lands swarming with Goblins and Orcs, deadly Wargs and Giant Spiders, Shapeshifters and Sorcerers. Although their goal lies to the East and the wastelands of the Lonely Mountain first they must escape the goblin tunnels, where Bilbo meets the creature that will change his life forever ... Gollum. Here, alone with Gollum, on the shores of an underground lake, the unassuming Bilbo Baggins not only discovers depths of guile and courage that surprise even him, he also gains possession of Gollum's \"precious\" ring that holds unexpected and useful qualities ... A simple, gold ring that is tied to the fate of all Middle-earth in ways Bilbo cannot begin to know.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Family"],"stems":["Bilbo","Baggin","is","swept","into","a","quest","to","reclaim","the","lost","Dwarf","Kingdom","of","Erebor","from","the","fearsom","dragon","Smaug",".","Approach","out","of","the","blue","by","the","wizard","Gandalf","the","Grey",",","Bilbo","find","himself","join","a","compani","of","thirteen","dwarv","led","by","the","legendari","warrior",",","Thorin","Oakenshield",".","Their","journey","will","take","them","into","the","Wild",";","through","treacher","land","swarm","with","Goblin","and","Orcs",",","dead","Warg","and","Giant","Spider",",","Shapeshift","and","Sorcer",".","Although","their","goal","lie","to","the","East","and","the","wasteland","of","the","Lone","Mountain","first","they","must","escap","the","goblin","tunnel",",","where","Bilbo","meet","the","creatur","that","will","chang","his","life","forev","...","Gollum",".","Here",",","alon","with","Gollum",",","on","the","shore","of","an","underground","lake",",","the","unassum","Bilbo","Baggin","not","onli","discov","depth","of","guil","and","courag","that","surpris","even","him",",","he","also","gain","possess","of","Gollum","'s","\"","precious","\"","ring","that","hold","unexpect","and","use","qualiti","...","A","simpl",",","gold","ring","that","is","tie","to","the","fate","of","all","Middle-earth","in","way","Bilbo","can","not","begin","to","know","."],"lemmas":["Bilbo","Baggins","be","sweep","into","a","quest","to","reclaim","the","lost","dwarf","Kingdom","of","Erebor","from","the","fearsome","dragon","Smaug",".","approach","out","of","the","blue","by","the","wizard","Gandalf","the","Grey",",","Bilbo","find","himself","join","a","company","of","thirteen","dwarf","lead","by","the","legendary","warrior",",","Thorin","Oakenshield",".","they","journey","will","take","they","into","the","Wild",";","through","treacherous","land","swarm","with","goblin","and","orc",",","deadly","Wargs","and","Giant","Spiders",",","Shapeshifters","and","Sorcerers",".","although","they","goal","lie","to","the","East","and","the","wasteland","of","the","Lonely","Mountain","first","they","must","escape","the","goblin","tunnel",",","where","Bilbo","meet","the","creature","that","will","change","he","life","forever","...","Gollum",".","here",",","alone","with","Gollum",",","on","the","shore","of","a","underground","lake",",","the","unassuming","Bilbo","Baggins","not","only","discover","depths","of","guile","and","courage","that","surprise","even","he",",","he","also","gain","possession","of","Gollum","'s","``","precious","''","ring","that","hold","unexpected","and","useful","quality","...","a","simple",",","gold","ring","that","be","tie","to","the","fate","of","all","middle-earth","in","way","Bilbo","can","not","begin","to","know","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bilbo Baggins is","Baggins is swept","is swept into","swept into a","into a quest","a quest to","quest to reclaim","to reclaim the","reclaim the lost","the lost Dwarf","lost Dwarf Kingdom","Dwarf Kingdom of","Kingdom of Erebor","of Erebor from","Erebor from the","from the fearsome","the fearsome dragon","fearsome dragon Smaug","Approached out of","out of the","of the blue","the blue by","blue by the","by the wizard","the wizard Gandalf","wizard Gandalf the","Gandalf the Grey","the Grey ,","Grey , Bilbo",", Bilbo finds","Bilbo finds himself","finds himself joining","himself joining a","joining a company","a company of","company of thirteen","of thirteen dwarves","thirteen dwarves led","dwarves led by","led by the","by the legendary","the legendary warrior","legendary warrior ,","warrior , Thorin",", Thorin Oakenshield","Their journey will","journey will take","will take them","take them into","them into the","into the Wild","the Wild ;","Wild ; through","; through treacherous","through treacherous lands","treacherous lands swarming","lands swarming with","swarming with Goblins","with Goblins and","Goblins and Orcs","and Orcs ,","Orcs , deadly",", deadly Wargs","deadly Wargs and","Wargs and Giant","and Giant Spiders","Giant Spiders ,","Spiders , Shapeshifters",", Shapeshifters and","Shapeshifters and Sorcerers","Although their goal","their goal lies","goal lies to","lies to the","to the East","the East and","East and the","and the wastelands","the wastelands of","wastelands of the","of the Lonely","the Lonely Mountain","Lonely Mountain first","Mountain first they","first they must","they must escape","must escape the","escape the goblin","the goblin tunnels","goblin tunnels ,","tunnels , where",", where Bilbo","where Bilbo meets","Bilbo meets the","meets the creature","the creature that","creature that will","that will change","will change his","change his life","his life forever","life forever ...","forever ...

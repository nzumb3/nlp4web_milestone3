{"title":"The Quiet Hour","plot":"Humans are few and far between since Earth was invaded by unseen extraterrestrial machines that harvest the planet's natural resources and relentlessly kill its inhabitants. In a remote part of the countryside, where starved humans have become as dangerous as the alien machines hovering in the sky, a feisty 19 year old girl, Sarah Connolly, sets out on a desperate attempt to fight back a group of bandits and defend her parents' farm, their remaining livestock, and the solar panels that keep them safe from extraterrestrials. If she doesn't succeed, she will lose her only source of food and shelter; but if she resists, she and her helpless blind sibling will be killed. And if the mysterious intruder dressed like a soldier who claims he can help them turns out to be a liar, then the enemy may already be in the house.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Human","are","few","and","far","between","sinc","Earth","was","invad","by","unseen","extraterrestri","machin","that","harvest","the","planet","'s","natur","resourc","and","relentless","kill","it","inhabit",".","In","a","remot","part","of","the","countrysid",",","where","starv","human","have","becom","as","danger","as","the","alien","machin","hover","in","the","sky",",","a","feisti","19","year","old","girl",",","Sarah","Connolli",",","set","out","on","a","desper","attempt","to","fight","back","a","group","of","bandit","and","defend","her","parent","'","farm",",","their","remain","livestock",",","and","the","solar","panel","that","keep","them","safe","from","extraterrestri",".","If","she","doe","n't","succeed",",","she","will","lose","her","onli","sourc","of","food","and","shelter",";","but","if","she","resist",",","she","and","her","helpless","blind","sibl","will","be","kill",".","And","if","the","mysteri","intrud","dress","like","a","soldier","who","claim","he","can","help","them","turn","out","to","be","a","liar",",","then","the","enemi","may","alreadi","be","in","the","hous","."],"lemmas":["human","be","few","and","far","between","since","Earth","be","invade","by","unseen","extraterrestrial","machine","that","harvest","the","planet","'s","natural","resource","and","relentlessly","kill","its","inhabitant",".","in","a","remote","part","of","the","countryside",",","where","starve","human","have","become","as","dangerous","as","the","alien","machine","hover","in","the","sky",",","a","feisty","19","year","old","girl",",","Sarah","Connolly",",","set","out","on","a","desperate","attempt","to","fight","back","a","group","of","bandit","and","defend","she","parent","'","farm",",","they","remain","livestock",",","and","the","solar","panel","that","keep","they","safe","from","extraterrestrial",".","if","she","do","not","succeed",",","she","will","lose","she","only","source","of","food","and","shelter",";","but","if","she","resist",",","she","and","she","helpless","blind","sibling","will","be","kill",".","and","if","the","mysterious","intruder","dress","like","a","soldier","who","claim","he","can","help","they","turn","out","to","be","a","liar",",","then","the","enemy","may","already","be","in","the","house","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Humans are few","are few and","few and far","and far between","far between since","between since Earth","since Earth was","Earth was invaded","was invaded by","invaded by unseen","by unseen extraterrestrial","unseen extraterrestrial machines","extraterrestrial machines that","machines that harvest","that harvest the","harvest the planet","the planet 's","planet 's natural","'s natural resources","natural resources and","resources and relentlessly","and relentlessly kill","relentlessly kill its","kill its inhabitants","In a remote","a remote part","remote part of","part of the","of the countryside","the countryside ,","countryside , where",", where starved","where starved humans","starved humans have","humans have become","have become as","become as dangerous","as dangerous as","dangerous as the","as the alien","the alien machines","alien machines hovering","machines hovering in","hovering in the","in the sky","the sky ,","sky , a",", a feisty","a feisty 19","feisty 19 year","19 year old","year old girl","old girl ,","girl , Sarah",", Sarah Connolly","Sarah Connolly ,","Connolly , sets",", sets out","sets out on","out on a","on a desperate","a desperate attempt","desperate attempt to","attempt to fight","to fight back","fight back a","back a group","a group of","group of bandits","of bandits and","bandits and defend","and defend her","defend her parents","her parents '","parents ' farm","' farm ,","farm , their",", their remaining","their remaining livestock","remaining livestock ,","livestock , and",", and the","and the solar","the solar panels","solar panels that","panels that keep","that keep them","keep them safe","them safe from","safe from extraterrestrials","If she does","she does n't","does n't succeed","n't succeed ,","succeed , she",", she will","she will lose","will lose her","lose her only","her only source","only source of","source of food","of food and","food and shelter","and shelter ;","shelter ;

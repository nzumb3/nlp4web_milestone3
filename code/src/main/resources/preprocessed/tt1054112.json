{"title":"Imago mortis","plot":"In the 1600s, long before the invention of photography, a scientist named Girolamo Fumagalli was obsessed with the idea of reproducing images. He discovered that by killing a victim and removing the victim's eyeballs, it was possible to reproduce on paper the last image imprinted on that person's retinas. He named this technique 'thanatography'. Today, the same kind of gruesome ritual and abominable crime recurs within the walls of an international school of cinema.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["In","the","1600s",",","long","befor","the","invent","of","photographi",",","a","scientist","name","Girolamo","Fumag","was","obsess","with","the","idea","of","reproduc","imag",".","He","discov","that","by","kill","a","victim","and","remov","the","victim","'s","eyebal",",","it","was","possibl","to","reproduc","on","paper","the","last","imag","imprint","on","that","person","'s","retina",".","He","name","this","techniqu","'","thanatographi","'",".","Today",",","the","same","kind","of","gruesom","ritual","and","abomin","crime","recur","within","the","wall","of","an","intern","school","of","cinema","."],"lemmas":["in","the","1600",",","long","before","the","invention","of","photography",",","a","scientist","name","Girolamo","Fumagalli","be","obsess","with","the","idea","of","reproduce","image",".","he","discover","that","by","kill","a","victim","and","remove","the","victim","'s","eyeball",",","it","be","possible","to","reproduce","on","paper","the","last","image","imprint","on","that","person","'s","retinas",".","he","name","this","technique","'","thanatography","'",".","today",",","the","same","kind","of","gruesome","ritual","and","abominable","crime","recur","within","the","wall","of","a","international","school","of","cinema","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["In the 1600s","the 1600s ,","1600s , long",", long before","long before the","before the invention","the invention of","invention of photography","of photography ,","photography , a",", a scientist","a scientist named","scientist named Girolamo","named Girolamo Fumagalli","Girolamo Fumagalli was","Fumagalli was obsessed","was obsessed with","obsessed with the","with the idea","the idea of","idea of reproducing","of reproducing images","He discovered that","discovered that by","that by killing","by killing a","killing a victim","a victim and","victim and removing","and removing the","removing the victim","the victim 's","victim 's eyeballs","'s eyeballs ,","eyeballs , it",", it was","it was possible","was possible to","possible to reproduce","to reproduce on","reproduce on paper","on paper the","paper the last","the last image","last image imprinted","image imprinted on","imprinted on that","on that person","that person 's","person 's retinas","He named this","named this technique","this technique '","technique ' thanatography","' thanatography '","Today , the",", the same","the same kind","same kind of","kind of gruesome","of gruesome ritual","gruesome ritual and","ritual and abominable","and abominable crime","abominable crime recurs","crime recurs within","recurs within the","within the walls","the walls of","walls of an","of an international","an international school","international school of","school of cinema"],"2grams":["In the","the 1600s","1600s ,",", long","long before","before the","the invention","invention of","of photography","photography ,",", a","a scientist","scientist named","named Girolamo","Girolamo Fumagalli","Fumagalli was","was obsessed","obsessed with","with the","the idea","idea of","of reproducing","reproducing images","He discovered","discovered that","that by","by killing","killing a","a victim","victim and","and removing","removing the","the victim","victim 's","'s eyeballs","eyeballs ,",", it","it was","was possible","possible to","to reproduce","reproduce on","on paper","paper the","the last","last image","image imprinted","imprinted on","on that","that person","person 's","'s retinas","He named","named this","this technique","technique '","' thanatography","thanatography '","Today ,",", the","the same","same kind","kind of","of gruesome","gruesome ritual","ritual and","and abominable","abominable crime","crime recurs","recurs within","within the","the walls","walls of","of an","an international","international school","school of","of cinema"]}

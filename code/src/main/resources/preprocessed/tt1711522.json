Signe finds herself becoming less of a shy girl and a thousand times stronger.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Base","on","a","best-sel","novel","by","Christina","Herrström",".","Everi","school","follow","a","social","structur","where","the","cool","and","popular","domin","and","the","nerd","and","quiet","type","remain","in","the","peripheri",".","Sign","is","a","bright","15","year","old","girl",",","but","she","'s","veri","shi","and","reserv",",","resign","to","be","an","outsid",".","Thing","are","as","they","are",",","until","a","new","girl","arriv","who","chang","everyth",".","Sign","find","herself","becom","less","of","a","shi","girl","and","a","thousand","time","stronger","."],"lemmas":["base","on","a","best-selling","novel","by","Christina","Herrströms",".","every","school","follow","a","social","structure","where","the","cool","and","popular","dominate","and","the","nerd","and","quiet","type","remain","in","the","periphery",".","Signe","be","a","bright","15","year","old","girl",",","but","she","be","very","shy","and","reserved",",","resign","to","be","a","outsider",".","thing","be","as","they","be",",","until","a","new","girl","arrive","who","change","everything",".","Signe","find","herself","become","less","of","a","shy","girl","and","a","thousand","time","stronger","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Based on a","on a best-selling","a best-selling novel","best-selling novel by","novel by Christina","by Christina Herrströms","Every school follows","school follows a","follows a social","a social structure","social structure where","structure where the","where the cool","the cool and","cool and popular","and popular dominate","popular dominate and","dominate and the","and the nerds","the nerds and","nerds and quiet","and quiet types","quiet types remain","types remain in","remain in the","in the periphery","Signe is a","is a bright","a bright 15","bright 15 year","15 year old","year old girl","old girl ,","girl , but",", but she","but she 's","she 's very","'s very shy","very shy and","shy and reserved","and reserved ,","reserved , resigned",", resigned to","resigned to being","to being an","being an outsider","Things are as","are as they","as they are","they are ,","are , until",", until a","until a new","a new girl","new girl arrives","girl arrives who","arrives who changes","who changes everything","Signe finds herself","finds herself becoming","herself becoming less","becoming less of","less of a","of a shy","a shy girl","shy girl and","girl and a","and a thousand","a thousand times","thousand times stronger"],"2grams":["Based on","on a","a best-selling","best-selling novel","novel by","by Christina","Christina Herrströms","Every school","school follows","follows a","a social","social structure","structure where","where the","the cool","cool and","and popular","popular dominate","dominate and","and the","the nerds","nerds and","and quiet","quiet types","types remain","remain in","in the","the periphery","Signe is","is a","a bright","bright 15","15 year","year old","old girl","girl ,",", but","but she","she 's","'s very","very shy","shy and","and reserved","reserved ,",", resigned","resigned to","to being","being an","an outsider","Things are","are as","as they","they are","are ,",", until","until a","a new","new girl","girl arrives","arrives who","who changes","changes everything","Signe finds","finds herself","herself becoming","becoming less","less of","of a","a shy","shy girl","girl and","and a","a thousand","thousand times","times stronger"]}

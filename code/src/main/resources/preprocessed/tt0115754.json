{"title":"Breathing Room","plot":"She's Kathy, a comix cartoonist; he's David, teaching English to new immigrants. It's New York City, with 29 shopping days left until Christmas, and they're in love. Or are they? Their romance has been on-again, off-again because David can't bring himself to say, \"I love you.\" He can say it in French, Russian, Japanese, Chinese, but not English. So, when she learns at an inopportune time that he's applied for a job in Ho Chi Minh City, she asks for breathing room until Christmas; the film chronicles the ensuing days of restless indecision.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["She","'s","Kathi",",","a","comix","cartoonist",";","he","'s","David",",","teach","English","to","new","immigr",".","It","'s","New","York","Citi",",","with","29","shop","day","left","until","Christma",",","and","they","re","in","love",".","Or","are","they","?","Their","romanc","has","been","on-again",",","off-again","becaus","David","ca","n't","bring","himself","to","say",",","\"","I","love","you",".","\"","He","can","say","it","in","French",",","Russian",",","Japanes",",","Chines",",","but","not","English",".","So",",","when","she","learn","at","an","inopportun","time","that","he","'s","appli","for","a","job","in","Ho","Chi","Minh","Citi",",","she","ask","for","breath","room","until","Christma",";","the","film","chronicl","the","ensu","day","of","restless","indecis","."],"lemmas":["she","be","Kathy",",","a","comix","cartoonist",";","he","be","David",",","teach","English","to","new","immigrant",".","it","be","New","York","City",",","with","29","shopping","day","leave","until","Christmas",",","and","they","be","in","love",".","or","be","they","?","they","romance","have","be","on-again",",","off-again","because","David","can","not","bring","himself","to","say",",","``","I","love","you",".","''","he","can","say","it","in","French",",","Russian",",","Japanese",",","Chinese",",","but","not","English",".","so",",","when","she","learn","at","a","inopportune","time","that","he","be","apply","for","a","job","in","Ho","Chi","Minh","City",",","she","ask","for","breathing","room","until","Christmas",";","the","film","chronicle","the","ensue","day","of","restless","indecision","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["She 's Kathy","'s Kathy ,","Kathy , a",", a comix","a comix cartoonist","comix cartoonist ;","cartoonist ; he","; he 's","he 's David","'s David ,","David , teaching",", teaching English","teaching English to","English to new","to new immigrants","It 's New","'s New York","New York City","York City ,","City , with",", with 29","with 29 shopping","29 shopping days","shopping days left","days left until","left until Christmas","until Christmas ,","Christmas , and",", and they","and they 're","they 're in","'re in love","Or are they","Their romance has","romance has been","has been on-again","been on-again ,","on-again , off-again",", off-again because","off-again because David","because David ca","David ca n't","ca n't bring","n't bring himself","bring himself to","himself to say","to say ,","say , \"",", \" I","\" I love","I love you","love you .","you . \"","He can say","can say it","say it in","it in French","in French ,","French , Russian",", Russian ,","Russian , Japanese",", Japanese ,","Japanese , Chinese",", Chinese ,","Chinese , but",", but not","but not English","So , when",", when she","when she learns","she learns at","learns at an","at an inopportune","an inopportune time","inopportune time that","time that he","that he 's","he 's applied","'s applied for","applied for a","for a job","a job in","job in Ho","in Ho Chi","Ho Chi Minh","Chi Minh City","Minh City ,","City , she",", she asks","she asks for","asks for breathing","for breathing room","breathing room until","room until Christmas","until Christmas ;","Christmas ; the","; the film","the film chronicles","film chronicles the","chronicles the ensuing","the ensuing days","ensuing days of","days of restless","of restless indecision"],"2grams":["She 's","'s Kathy","Kathy ,",", a","a comix","comix cartoonist","cartoonist ;","; he","he 's","'s David","David ,",", teaching","teaching English","English to","to new","new immigrants","It 's","'s New","New York","York City","City ,",", with","with 29","29 shopping","shopping days","days left","left until","until Christmas","Christmas ,",", and","and they","they 're","'re in","in love","Or are","are they","Their romance","romance has","has been","been on-again","on-again ,",", off-again","off-again because","because David","David ca","ca n't","n't bring","bring himself","himself to","to say","say ,",", \"","\" I","I love","love you","you .",". \"","He can","can say","say it","it in","in French","French ,",", Russian","Russian ,",", Japanese","Japanese ,",", Chinese","Chinese ,",", but","but not","not English","So ,",", when","when she","she learns","learns at","at an","an inopportune","inopportune time","time that","that he","he 's","'s applied","applied for","for a","a job","job in","in Ho","Ho Chi","Chi Minh","Minh City","City ,",", she","she asks","asks for","for breathing","breathing room","room until","until Christmas","Christmas ;","; the","the film","film chronicles","chronicles the","the ensuing","ensuing days","days of","of restless","restless indecision"]}

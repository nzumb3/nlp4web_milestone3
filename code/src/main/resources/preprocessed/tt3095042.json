{"title":"Light & Shadow","plot":"A year and half in the making, shot simultaneously on and after Revenge of the Great Camera Shootout 2012, Zacuto presents a Steve Weiss film, Light & Shadow. If you have only one takeaway from Light & Shadow, let it be a reminder that cinematography, like all art forms, is something that comes from within. The technical can be taught, and anyone can pick up a camera and learn how to operate it. The big question is this: can it be learned or are you born with it? With or without this born talent, its still upon you to keep learning and honing your craft.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["A","year","and","half","in","the","make",",","shot","simultan","on","and","after","Reveng","of","the","Great","Camera","Shootout","2012",",","Zacuto","present","a","Steve","Weiss","film",",","Light","&","Shadow",".","If","you","have","onli","one","takeaway","from","Light","&","Shadow",",","let","it","be","a","remind","that","cinematographi",",","like","all","art","form",",","is","someth","that","come","from","within",".","The","technic","can","be","taught",",","and","anyon","can","pick","up","a","camera","and","learn","how","to","oper","it",".","The","big","question","is","this",":","can","it","be","learn","or","are","you","born","with","it","?","With","or","without","this","born","talent",",","it","still","upon","you","to","keep","learn","and","hone","your","craft","."],"lemmas":["a","year","and","half","in","the","making",",","shoot","simultaneously","on","and","after","revenge","of","the","great","camera","shootout","2012",",","Zacuto","present","a","Steve","Weiss","film",",","Light","&","Shadow",".","if","you","have","only","one","takeaway","from","Light","&","Shadow",",","let","it","be","a","reminder","that","cinematography",",","like","all","art","form",",","be","something","that","come","from","within",".","the","technical","can","be","teach",",","and","anyone","can","pick","up","a","camera","and","learn","how","to","operate","it",".","the","big","question","be","this",":","can","it","be","learn","or","be","you","bear","with","it","?","with","or","without","this","bear","talent",",","its","still","upon","you","to","keep","learn","and","hone","you","craft","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A year and","year and half","and half in","half in the","in the making","the making ,","making , shot",", shot simultaneously","shot simultaneously on","simultaneously on and","on and after","and after Revenge","after Revenge of","Revenge of the","of the Great","the Great Camera","Great Camera Shootout","Camera Shootout 2012","Shootout 2012 ,","2012 , Zacuto",", Zacuto presents","Zacuto presents a","presents a Steve","a Steve Weiss","Steve Weiss film","Weiss film ,","film , Light",", Light &","Light & Shadow","If you have","you have only","have only one","only one takeaway","one takeaway from","takeaway from Light","from Light &","Light & Shadow","& Shadow ,","Shadow , let",", let it","let it be","it be a","be a reminder","a reminder that","reminder that cinematography","that cinematography ,","cinematography , like",", like all","like all art","all art forms","art forms ,","forms , is",", is something","is something that","something that comes","that comes from","comes from within","The technical can","technical can be","can be taught","be taught ,","taught , and",", and anyone","and anyone can","anyone can pick","can pick up","pick up a","up a camera","a camera and","camera and learn","and learn how","learn how to","how to operate","to operate it","The big question","big question is","question is this","is this :","this : can",": can it","can it be","it be learned","be learned or","learned or are","or are you","are you born","you born with","born with it","With or without","or without this","without this born","this born talent","born talent ,","talent , its",", its still","its still upon","still upon you","upon you to","you to keep","to keep learning","keep learning and","learning and honing","and honing your","honing your craft"],"2grams":["A year","year and","and half","half in","in the","the making","making ,",", shot","shot simultaneously","simultaneously on","on and","and after","after Revenge","Revenge of","of the","the Great","Great Camera","Camera Shootout","Shootout 2012","2012 ,",", Zacuto","Zacuto presents","presents a","a Steve","Steve Weiss","Weiss film","film ,",", Light","Light &","& Shadow","If you","you have","have only","only one","one takeaway","takeaway from","from Light","Light &","& Shadow","Shadow ,",", let","let it","it be","be a","a reminder","reminder that","that cinematography","cinematography ,",", like","like all","all art","art forms","forms ,",", is","is something","something that","that comes","comes from","from within","The technical","technical can","can be","be taught","taught ,",", and","and anyone","anyone can","can pick","pick up","up a","a camera","camera and","and learn","learn how","how to","to operate","operate it","The big","big question","question is","is this","this :",": can","can it","it be","be learned","learned or","or are","are you","you born","born with","with it","With or","or without","without this","this born","born talent","talent ,",", its","its still","still upon","upon you","you to","to keep","keep learning","learning and","and honing","honing your","your craft"]}

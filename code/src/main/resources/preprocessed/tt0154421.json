They take advantage of this situation to create anarchy everywhere they go and try by every possible means to make people annoyed, disturbed, miserable, ridiculous, angered, and shocked. The film starts as they recruit a new lost soul and introduce her to their megalomaniac leader.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["A","group","of","perfect","intellig","young","peopl","decid","to","react","to","societi","'s","cult","of","aimless",",","non-creat","and","non-respons","form","intellect","by","live","togeth","in","a","communiti","of","\"","idiot","\"",".","Their","main","activ","becom","go","out","into","the","world","of","\"","normal","\"","peopl","and","pretend","to","be","mental","retard",".","They","take","advantag","of","this","situat","to","creat","anarchi","everywher","they","go","and","tri","by","everi","possibl","mean","to","make","peopl","annoy",",","disturb",",","miser",",","ridicul",",","anger",",","and","shock",".","The","film","start","as","they","recruit","a","new","lost","soul","and","introduc","her","to","their","megalomaniac","leader","."],"lemmas":["a","group","of","perfectly","intelligent","young","people","decide","to","react","to","society","'s","cult","of","aimless",",","non-creative","and","non-responsible","form","intellect","by","live","together","in","a","community","of","``","idiot","''",".","they","main","activity","become","go","out","into","the","world","of","``","normal","''","people","and","pretend","to","be","mentally","retarded",".","they","take","advantage","of","this","situation","to","create","anarchy","everywhere","they","go","and","try","by","every","possible","means","to","make","people","annoyed",",","disturbed",",","miserable",",","ridiculous",",","angered",",","and","shocked",".","the","film","start","as","they","recruit","a","new","lost","soul","and","introduce","she","to","they","megalomaniac","leader","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A group of","group of perfectly","of perfectly intelligent","perfectly intelligent young","intelligent young people","young people decide","people decide to","decide to react","to react to","react to society","to society 's","society 's cult","'s cult of","cult of aimless","of aimless ,","aimless , non-creative",", non-creative and","non-creative and non-responsible","and non-responsible form","non-responsible form intellect","form intellect by","intellect by living","by living together","living together in","together in a","in a community","a community of","community of \"","of \" idiots","\" idiots \"","Their main activity","main activity becomes","activity becomes going","becomes going out","going out into","out into the","into the world","the world of","world of \"","of \" normal","\" normal \"","normal \" people","\" people and","people and pretending","and pretending to","pretending to be","to be mentally","be mentally retarded","They take advantage","take advantage of","advantage of this","of this situation","this situation to","situation to create","to create anarchy","create anarchy everywhere","anarchy everywhere they","everywhere they go","they go and","go and try","and try by","try by every","by every possible","every possible means","possible means to","means to make","to make people","make people annoyed","people annoyed ,","annoyed , disturbed",", disturbed ,","disturbed , miserable",", miserable ,","miserable , ridiculous",", ridiculous ,","ridiculous , angered",", angered ,","angered , and",", and shocked","The film starts","film starts as","starts as they","as they recruit","they recruit a","recruit a new","a new lost","new lost soul","lost soul and","soul and introduce","and introduce her","introduce her to","her to their","to their megalomaniac","their megalomaniac leader"],"2grams":["A group","group of","of perfectly","perfectly intelligent","intelligent young","young people","people decide","decide to","to react","react to","to society","society 's","'s cult","cult of","of aimless","aimless ,",", non-creative","non-creative and","and non-responsible","non-responsible form","form intellect","intellect by","by living","living together","together in","in a","a community","community of","of \"","\" idiots","idiots \"","Their main","main activity","activity becomes","becomes going","going out","out into","into the","the world","world of","of \"","\" normal","normal \"","\" people","people and","and pretending","pretending to","to be","be mentally","mentally retarded","They take","take advantage","advantage of","of this","this situation","situation to","to create","create anarchy","anarchy everywhere","everywhere they","they go","go and","and try","try by","by every","every possible","possible means","means to","to make","make people","people annoyed","annoyed ,",", disturbed","disturbed ,",", miserable","miserable ,",", ridiculous","ridiculous ,",", angered","angered ,",", and","and shocked","The film","film starts","starts as","as they","they recruit","recruit a","a new","new lost","lost soul","soul and","and introduce","introduce her","her to","to their","their megalomaniac","megalomaniac leader"]}

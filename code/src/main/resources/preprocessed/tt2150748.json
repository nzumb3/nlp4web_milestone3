{"title":"Crossing Borders","plot":"In a remarkable manner Austria's borders symbolize the history and formation of European frontiers - of the disappearing ones and those newly drawn - they are old and new at the same time. Old, because of the deep trenches that evolved alongside their lines and the scars left behind that are still palpable. Old as well, because there have been different limitations 100 years ago than thereafter and because these old transgressions have been revived. New, because they are disappearing (again) in the course of the expansion of the European Union. New as well, because they are reset at the external borders of the Schengen countries, just a few hundred kilometers from where they were before. The film accompanies the gifted writer Robert Menasse to the inner and outer borders of his country in the heart of Europe, on his quest for a European culture into a new, never known boundlessness, as well as for new borders.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","a","remark","manner","Austria","'s","border","symbol","the","histori","and","format","of","European","frontier","-","of","the","disappear","one","and","those","newli","drawn","-","they","are","old","and","new","at","the","same","time",".","Old",",","becaus","of","the","deep","trench","that","evolv","alongsid","their","line","and","the","scar","left","behind","that","are","still","palpabl",".","Old","as","well",",","becaus","there","have","been","differ","limit","100","year","ago","than","thereaft","and","becaus","these","old","transgress","have","been","reviv",".","New",",","becaus","they","are","disappear","(","again",")","in","the","cours","of","the","expans","of","the","European","Union",".","New","as","well",",","becaus","they","are","reset","at","the","extern","border","of","the","Schengen","countri",",","just","a","few","hundr","kilomet","from","where","they","were","befor",".","The","film","accompani","the","gift","writer","Robert","Menass","to","the","inner","and","outer","border","of","his","countri","in","the","heart","of","Europ",",","on","his","quest","for","a","European","cultur","into","a","new",",","never","known","boundless",",","as","well","as","for","new","border","."],"lemmas":["in","a","remarkable","manner","Austria","'s","border","symbolize","the","history","and","formation","of","european","frontier","-","of","the","disappear","one","and","those","newly","draw","-","they","be","old","and","new","at","the","same","time",".","Old",",","because","of","the","deep","trench","that","evolve","alongside","they","line","and","the","scar","leave","behind","that","be","still","palpable",".","old","as","well",",","because","there","have","be","different","limitation","100","year","ago","than","thereafter","and","because","these","old","transgression","have","be","revive",".","New",",","because","they","be","disappear","-lrb-","again","-rrb-","in","the","course","of","the","expansion","of","the","European","Union",".","New","as","well",",","because","they","be","reset","at","the","external","border","of","the","Schengen","country",",","just","a","few","hundred","kilometer","from","where","they","be","before",".","the","film","accompany","the","gifted","writer","Robert","Menasse","to","the","inner","and","outer","border","of","he","country","in","the","heart","of","Europe",",","on","he","quest","for","a","european","culture","into","a","new",",","never","know","boundlessness",",","as","well","as","for","new","border","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a remarkable","a remarkable manner","remarkable manner Austria","manner Austria 's","Austria 's borders","'s borders symbolize","borders symbolize the","symbolize the history","the history and","history and formation","and formation of","formation of European","of European frontiers","European frontiers -","frontiers -

{"title":"Spread","plot":"In Los Angeles, Nikki is homeless, car-less and closing in on 30, but he's amoral, good-looking, and adept in the sack, moving from one wealthy woman of 35 or 40 to another, a kept boy-toy. His newest gig, with Samantha, an attorney whose house overlooks L.A., is sweet, although it's unclear how long she'll put up with him. Then Nikki meets Heather, a waitress. Is the player being played, or might this be love? What will Nikki discover?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["In","Los","Angele",",","Nikki","is","homeless",",","car-less","and","close","in","on","30",",","but","he","'s","amor",",","good-look",",","and","adept","in","the","sack",",","move","from","one","wealthi","woman","of","35","or","40","to","anoth",",","a","kept","boy-toy",".","His","newest","gig",",","with","Samantha",",","an","attorney","whose","hous","overlook","L.A.",",","is","sweet",",","although","it","'s","unclear","how","long","she","ll","put","up","with","him",".","Then","Nikki","meet","Heather",",","a","waitress",".","Is","the","player","be","play",",","or","might","this","be","love","?","What","will","Nikki","discov","?"],"lemmas":["in","Los","Angeles",",","Nikki","be","homeless",",","car-less","and","close","in","on","30",",","but","he","be","amoral",",","good-looking",",","and","adept","in","the","sack",",","move","from","one","wealthy","woman","of","35","or","40","to","another",",","a","keep","boy-toy",".","he","newest","gig",",","with","Samantha",",","a","attorney","whose","house","overlook","L.A.",",","be","sweet",",","although","it","be","unclear","how","long","she","will","put","up","with","he",".","then","Nikki","meet","Heather",",","a","waitress",".","be","the","player","be","play",",","or","might","this","be","love","?","what","will","Nikki","discover","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , Nikki",", Nikki is","Nikki is homeless","is homeless ,","homeless , car-less",", car-less and","car-less and closing","and closing in","closing in on","in on 30","on 30 ,","30 , but",", but he","but he 's","he 's amoral","'s amoral ,","amoral , good-looking",", good-looking ,","good-looking , and",", and adept","and adept in","adept in the","in the sack","the sack ,","sack , moving",", moving from","moving from one","from one wealthy","one wealthy woman","wealthy woman of","woman of 35","of 35 or","35 or 40","or 40 to","40 to another","to another ,","another , a",", a kept","a kept boy-toy","His newest gig","newest gig ,","gig , with",", with Samantha","with Samantha ,","Samantha , an",", an attorney","an attorney whose","attorney whose house","whose house overlooks","house overlooks L.A.","overlooks L.A. ,","L.A. , is",", is sweet","is sweet ,","sweet , although",", although it","although it 's","it 's unclear","'s unclear how","unclear how long","how long she","long she 'll","she 'll put","'ll put up","put up with","up with him","Then Nikki meets","Nikki meets Heather","meets Heather ,","Heather , a",", a waitress","Is the player","the player being","player being played","being played ,","played , or",", or might","or might this","might this be","this be love","What will Nikki","will Nikki discover"],"2grams":["In Los","Los Angeles","Angeles ,",", Nikki","Nikki is","is homeless","homeless ,",", car-less","car-less and","and closing","closing in","in on","on 30","30 ,",", but","but he","he 's","'s amoral","amoral ,",", good-looking","good-looking ,",", and","and adept","adept in","in the","the sack","sack ,",", moving","moving from","from one","one wealthy","wealthy woman","woman of","of 35","35 or","or 40","40 to","to another","another ,",", a","a kept","kept boy-toy","His newest","newest gig","gig ,",", with","with Samantha","Samantha ,",", an","an attorney","attorney whose","whose house","house overlooks","overlooks L.A.","L.A. ,",", is","is sweet","sweet ,",", although","although it","it 's","'s unclear","unclear how","how long","long she","she 'll","'ll put","put up","up with","with him","Then Nikki","Nikki meets","meets Heather","Heather ,",", a","a waitress","Is the","the player","player being","being played","played ,",", or","or might","might this","this be","be love","What will","will Nikki","Nikki discover"]}

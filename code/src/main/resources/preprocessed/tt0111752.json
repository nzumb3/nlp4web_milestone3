{"title":"Wu Kui","plot":"Camels carry a bride to her groom's house; he is a wealthy tofu maker and the bride's father is in debt to him. Leading the caravan is Kui, a strong, courageous, and naive peasant. Bandits intercept them and carry off the bride. Kui follows: two days later, at the bandits' stronghold, he seeks her return. The gang lord tests Kui then grants his wish. The groom, meanwhile, has died in an accident preparing to give chase. His iron-willed mother orders the wedding to proceed, and she marries the bride to a wooden pole resembling her son. The bride chaffs at this prison, and after a year, brings Kiu to her bed. Kiu is cast out and she is severely punished. Does Kiu have any options?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Camel","carri","a","bride","to","her","groom","'s","hous",";","he","is","a","wealthi","tofu","maker","and","the","bride","'s","father","is","in","debt","to","him",".","Lead","the","caravan","is","Kui",",","a","strong",",","courag",",","and","naiv","peasant",".","Bandit","intercept","them","and","carri","off","the","bride",".","Kui","follow",":","two","day","later",",","at","the","bandit","'","stronghold",",","he","seek","her","return",".","The","gang","lord","test","Kui","then","grant","his","wish",".","The","groom",",","meanwhil",",","has","die","in","an","accid","prepar","to","give","chase",".","His","iron-wil","mother","order","the","wed","to","proceed",",","and","she","marri","the","bride","to","a","wooden","pole","resembl","her","son",".","The","bride","chaff","at","this","prison",",","and","after","a","year",",","bring","Kiu","to","her","bed",".","Kiu","is","cast","out","and","she","is","sever","punish",".","Doe","Kiu","have","ani","option","?"],"lemmas":["camel","carry","a","bride","to","she","groom","'s","house",";","he","be","a","wealthy","tofu","maker","and","the","bride","'s","father","be","in","debt","to","he",".","lead","the","caravan","be","Kui",",","a","strong",",","courageous",",","and","naive","peasant",".","bandit","intercept","they","and","carry","off","the","bride",".","Kui","follow",":","two","day","later",",","at","the","bandit","'","stronghold",",","he","seek","she","return",".","the","gang","lord","test","Kui","then","grant","he","wish",".","the","groom",",","meanwhile",",","have","die","in","a","accident","prepare","to","give","chase",".","he","iron-willed","mother","order","the","wedding","to","proceed",",","and","she","marry","the","bride","to","a","wooden","pole","resemble","she","son",".","the","bride","chaff","at","this","prison",",","and","after","a","year",",","bring","Kiu","to","she","bed",".","Kiu","be","cast","out","and","she","be","severely","punish",".","Does","Kiu","have","any","option","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Camels carry a","carry a bride","a bride to","bride to her","to her groom","her groom 's","groom 's house","'s house ;","house ;

{"title":"Pyaar Ka Punchnama","plot":"Outspoken and overly critical Nishant Agarwal meets gorgeous new co-worker, Charu, offers his help, assists her financially, and they become close friends. His room-mates, Rajat and Vikrant, are pleased with this outcome as they already have girlfriends in Neha and Rhea respectively. But both the relationships are not as harmonious, as Rajat feels Neha is self-centered and demanding, while Rhea appears to be withdrawn and aloof. Missing their meetings and bar-hopping, the trio decide to take a time-out and be by themselves. All three women, however, find out and decide to accompany them to the beach where they eventually mingle. The trio do not know that soon misunderstandings will crop up - and it will take a lot of effort and understanding to resolve them.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Outspoken","and","over","critic","Nishant","Agarwal","meet","gorgeous","new","co-work",",","Charu",",","offer","his","help",",","assist","her","financi",",","and","they","becom","close","friend",".","His","room-mat",",","Rajat","and","Vikrant",",","are","pleas","with","this","outcom","as","they","alreadi","have","girlfriend","in","Neha","and","Rhea","respect",".","But","both","the","relationship","are","not","as","harmoni",",","as","Rajat","feel","Neha","is","self-cent","and","demand",",","while","Rhea","appear","to","be","withdrawn","and","aloof",".","Miss","their","meet","and","bar-hop",",","the","trio","decid","to","take","a","time-out","and","be","by","themselv",".","All","three","women",",","howev",",","find","out","and","decid","to","accompani","them","to","the","beach","where","they","eventu","mingl",".","The","trio","do","not","know","that","soon","misunderstand","will","crop","up","-","and","it","will","take","a","lot","of","effort","and","understand","to","resolv","them","."],"lemmas":["outspoken","and","overly","critical","Nishant","Agarwal","meet","gorgeous","new","co-worker",",","Charu",",","offer","he","help",",","assist","she","financially",",","and","they","become","close","friend",".","he","room-mate",",","Rajat","and","Vikrant",",","be","please","with","this","outcome","as","they","already","have","girlfriend","in","Neha","and","Rhea","respectively",".","but","both","the","relationship","be","not","as","harmonious",",","as","Rajat","feel","Neha","be","self-centered","and","demand",",","while","Rhea","appear","to","be","withdraw","and","aloof",".","miss","they","meeting","and","bar-hopping",",","the","trio","decide","to","take","a","time-out","and","be","by","themselves",".","all","three","woman",",","however",",","find","out","and","decide","to","accompany","they","to","the","beach","where","they","eventually","mingle",".","the","trio","do","not","know","that","soon","misunderstanding","will","crop","up","-","and","it","will","take","a","lot","of","effort","and","understanding","to","resolve","they","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Outspoken and overly","and overly critical","overly critical Nishant","critical Nishant Agarwal","Nishant Agarwal meets","Agarwal meets gorgeous","meets gorgeous new","gorgeous new co-worker","new co-worker ,","co-worker , Charu",", Charu ,","Charu , offers",", offers his","offers his help","his help ,","help , assists",", assists her","assists her financially","her financially ,","financially , and",", and they","and they become","they become close","become close friends","His room-mates ,","room-mates , Rajat",", Rajat and","Rajat and Vikrant","and Vikrant ,","Vikrant , are",", are pleased","are pleased with","pleased with this","with this outcome","this outcome as","outcome as they","as they already","they already have","already have girlfriends","have girlfriends in","girlfriends in Neha","in Neha and","Neha and Rhea","and Rhea respectively","But both the","both the relationships","the relationships are","relationships are not","are not as","not as harmonious","as harmonious ,","harmonious , as",", as Rajat","as Rajat feels","Rajat feels Neha","feels Neha is","Neha is self-centered","is self-centered and","self-centered and demanding","and demanding ,","demanding , while",", while Rhea","while Rhea appears","Rhea appears to","appears to be","to be withdrawn","be withdrawn and","withdrawn and aloof","Missing their meetings","their meetings and","meetings and bar-hopping","and bar-hopping ,","bar-hopping , the",", the trio","the trio decide","trio decide to","decide to take","to take a","take a time-out","a time-out and","time-out and be","and be by","be by themselves","All three women","three women ,","women , however",", however ,","however , find",", find out","find out and","out and decide","and decide to","decide to accompany","to accompany them","accompany them to","them to the","to the beach","the beach where","beach where they","where they eventually","they eventually mingle","The trio do","trio do not","do not know","not know that","know that soon","that soon misunderstandings","soon misunderstandings will","misunderstandings will crop","will crop up","crop up -","up -

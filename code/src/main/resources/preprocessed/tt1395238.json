{"title":"Strike Dice! Betting on My Father","plot":"Strike Dice! Betting on my Father is the moving story of a daughter's search to find her father - an addicted gambler - when he is reported missing in Las Vegas. With little information to go on, she eventually finds him, but he bears little resemblance to the father she once knew. Homeless, gaunt, and unwashed, he lives day-to-day on the streets of Vegas, and despite her best efforts, he is unwilling to acknowledge his addiction and accept the help he needs. What is a daughter to do? How do you help your father when a simple handout will only make him worse? Does it matter if he's never really been a parent to you and the rest of your family has given up on him?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Strike","Dice","!","Bet","on","my","Father","is","the","move","stori","of","a","daughter","'s","search","to","find","her","father","-","an","addict","gambler","-","when","he","is","report","miss","in","Las","Vega",".","With","littl","inform","to","go","on",",","she","eventu","find","him",",","but","he","bear","littl","resembl","to","the","father","she","onc","knew",".","Homeless",",","gaunt",",","and","unwash",",","he","live","day-to-day","on","the","street","of","Vega",",","and","despit","her","best","effort",",","he","is","unwil","to","acknowledg","his","addict","and","accept","the","help","he","need",".","What","is","a","daughter","to","do","?","How","do","you","help","your","father","when","a","simpl","handout","will","onli","make","him","wors","?","Doe","it","matter","if","he","'s","never","realli","been","a","parent","to","you","and","the","rest","of","your","famili","has","given","up","on","him","?"],"lemmas":["strike","dice","!","Betting","on","my","Father","be","the","move","story","of","a","daughter","'s","search","to","find","she","father","-","a","addict","gambler","-","when","he","be","report","miss","in","Las","Vegas",".","with","little","information","to","go","on",",","she","eventually","find","he",",","but","he","bear","little","resemblance","to","the","father","she","once","know",".","homeless",",","gaunt",",","and","unwashed",",","he","live","day-to-day","on","the","street","of","Vegas",",","and","despite","she","best","effort",",","he","be","unwilling","to","acknowledge","he","addiction","and","accept","the","help","he","need",".","what","be","a","daughter","to","do","?","how","do","you","help","you","father","when","a","simple","handout","will","only","make","he","worse","?","do","it","matter","if","he","be","never","really","be","a","parent","to","you","and","the","rest","of","you","family","have","give","up","on","he","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Betting on my","on my Father","my Father is","Father is the","is the moving","the moving story","moving story of","story of a","of a daughter","a daughter 's","daughter 's search","'s search to","search to find","to find her","find her father","her father -","father -

{"title":"Colombian Gold: 400 Years of Music from the Soul","plot":"A musical odyssey through Colombia's Caribbean Coast, examining the region's rich musical heritage, which can be seen as an expression of the mixture of African, Native Indigenous, and European cultures. Nowhere is this more evident than in the port cities of Cartagena de Indias and Barranquilla, where for the past 80 years a unique cultural mix has produced a boom of musical creativity, fed largely by the region's fertile maritime connections and the advent of radio and recording technology.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","music","odyssey","through","Colombia","'s","Caribbean","Coast",",","examin","the","region","'s","rich","music","heritag",",","which","can","be","seen","as","an","express","of","the","mixtur","of","African",",","Nativ","Indigen",",","and","European","cultur",".","Nowher","is","this","more","evid","than","in","the","port","citi","of","Cartagena","de","India","and","Barranquilla",",","where","for","the","past","80","year","a","uniqu","cultur","mix","has","produc","a","boom","of","music","creativ",",","fed","larg","by","the","region","'s","fertil","maritim","connect","and","the","advent","of","radio","and","record","technolog","."],"lemmas":["a","musical","odyssey","through","Colombia","'s","Caribbean","Coast",",","examine","the","region","'s","rich","musical","heritage",",","which","can","be","see","as","a","expression","of","the","mixture","of","African",",","native","indigenous",",","and","european","culture",".","nowhere","be","this","more","evident","than","in","the","port","city","of","Cartagena","de","Indias","and","Barranquilla",",","where","for","the","past","80","year","a","unique","cultural","mix","have","produce","a","boom","of","musical","creativity",",","feed","largely","by","the","region","'s","fertile","maritime","connection","and","the","advent","of","radio","and","recording","technology","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A musical odyssey","musical odyssey through","odyssey through Colombia","through Colombia 's","Colombia 's Caribbean","'s Caribbean Coast","Caribbean Coast ,","Coast , examining",", examining the","examining the region","the region 's","region 's rich","'s rich musical","rich musical heritage","musical heritage ,","heritage , which",", which can","which can be","can be seen","be seen as","seen as an","as an expression","an expression of","expression of the","of the mixture","the mixture of","mixture of African","of African ,","African , Native",", Native Indigenous","Native Indigenous ,","Indigenous , and",", and European","and European cultures","Nowhere is this","is this more","this more evident","more evident than","evident than in","than in the","in the port","the port cities","port cities of","cities of Cartagena","of Cartagena de","Cartagena de Indias","de Indias and","Indias and Barranquilla","and Barranquilla ,","Barranquilla , where",", where for","where for the","for the past","the past 80","past 80 years","80 years a","years a unique","a unique cultural","unique cultural mix","cultural mix has","mix has produced","has produced a","produced a boom","a boom of","boom of musical","of musical creativity","musical creativity ,","creativity , fed",", fed largely","fed largely by","largely by the","by the region","the region 's","region 's fertile","'s fertile maritime","fertile maritime connections","maritime connections and","connections and the","and the advent","the advent of","advent of radio","of radio and","radio and recording","and recording technology"],"2grams":["A musical","musical odyssey","odyssey through","through Colombia","Colombia 's","'s Caribbean","Caribbean Coast","Coast ,",", examining","examining the","the region","region 's","'s rich","rich musical","musical heritage","heritage ,",", which","which can","can be","be seen","seen as","as an","an expression","expression of","of the","the mixture","mixture of","of African","African ,",", Native","Native Indigenous","Indigenous ,",", and","and European","European cultures","Nowhere is","is this","this more","more evident","evident than","than in","in the","the port","port cities","cities of","of Cartagena","Cartagena de","de Indias","Indias and","and Barranquilla","Barranquilla ,",", where","where for","for the","the past","past 80","80 years","years a","a unique","unique cultural","cultural mix","mix has","has produced","produced a","a boom","boom of","of musical","musical creativity","creativity ,",", fed","fed largely","largely by","by the","the region","region 's","'s fertile","fertile maritime","maritime connections","connections and","and the","the advent","advent of","of radio","radio and","and recording","recording technology"]}

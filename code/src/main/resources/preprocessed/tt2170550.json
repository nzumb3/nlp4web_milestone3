{"title":"Always Together: Chinese-Jamaicans In Reggae","plot":"From pioneer soundsystem operator Tom 'The Great Sebastian' Wong in the 1940s to contemporary dancehall masters Black Chiney, Chinese-Jamaicans have played an integral part in the music scene on the island since even before Jamaica cut its first domestic record in the 1950s. The stories of Leslie Kong, the first producer to record Bob Marley, Jimmy Cliff, and Desmond Dekker; Byron Lee, the bandleader that became Jamaica's ambassador to the world; and Patricia Chin, co-founder of VP Records are important but often overlooked pieces of reggae history. Through extensive original interviews and archival footage, Always Together: Chinese-Jamaicans in Reggae Music weaves together the history of the Chinese immigrants with the little-known stories of these unsung giants.","genres":["Documentary"," Musical"," History"],"stems":["From","pioneer","soundsystem","oper","Tom","'","The","Great","Sebastian","'","Wong","in","the","1940s","to","contemporari","dancehal","master","Black","Chiney",",","Chinese-Jamaican","have","play","an","integr","part","in","the","music","scene","on","the","island","sinc","even","befor","Jamaica","cut","it","first","domest","record","in","the","1950s",".","The","stori","of","Lesli","Kong",",","the","first","produc","to","record","Bob","Marley",",","Jimmi","Cliff",",","and","Desmond","Dekker",";","Byron","Lee",",","the","bandlead","that","becam","Jamaica","'s","ambassador","to","the","world",";","and","Patricia","Chin",",","co-found","of","VP","Record","are","import","but","often","overlook","piec","of","regga","histori",".","Through","extens","origin","interview","and","archiv","footag",",","Alway","Togeth",":","Chinese-Jamaican","in","Regga","Music","weav","togeth","the","histori","of","the","Chines","immigr","with","the","little-known","stori","of","these","unsung","giant","."],"lemmas":["from","pioneer","soundsystem","operator","Tom","'","The","Great","Sebastian","'","Wong","in","the","1940s","to","contemporary","dancehall","master","Black","Chiney",",","Chinese-Jamaicans","have","play","a","integral","part","in","the","music","scene","on","the","island","since","even","before","Jamaica","cut","its","first","domestic","record","in","the","1950s",".","the","story","of","Leslie","Kong",",","the","first","producer","to","record","Bob","Marley",",","Jimmy","Cliff",",","and","Desmond","Dekker",";","Byron","Lee",",","the","bandleader","that","become","Jamaica","'s","ambassador","to","the","world",";","and","Patricia","Chin",",","co-founder","of","VP","Records","be","important","but","often","overlook","piece","of","reggae","history",".","through","extensive","original","interview","and","archival","footage",",","always","together",":","chinese-jamaican","in","Reggae","Music","weave","together","the","history","of","the","chinese","immigrant","with","the","little-known","story","of","these","unsung","giant","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["From pioneer soundsystem","pioneer soundsystem operator","soundsystem operator Tom","operator Tom '","Tom ' The","' The Great","The Great Sebastian","Great Sebastian '","Sebastian ' Wong","' Wong in","Wong in the","in the 1940s","the 1940s to","1940s to contemporary","to contemporary dancehall","contemporary dancehall masters","dancehall masters Black","masters Black Chiney","Black Chiney ,","Chiney , Chinese-Jamaicans",", Chinese-Jamaicans have","Chinese-Jamaicans have played","have played an","played an integral","an integral part","integral part in","part in the","in the music","the music scene","music scene on","scene on the","on the island","the island since","island since even","since even before","even before Jamaica","before Jamaica cut","Jamaica cut its","cut its first","its first domestic","first domestic record","domestic record in","record in the","in the 1950s","The stories of","stories of Leslie","of Leslie Kong","Leslie Kong ,","Kong , the",", the first","the first producer","first producer to","producer to record","to record Bob","record Bob Marley","Bob Marley ,","Marley , Jimmy",", Jimmy Cliff","Jimmy Cliff ,","Cliff , and",", and Desmond","and Desmond Dekker","Desmond Dekker ;","Dekker ;

{"title":"A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Mainer","plot":"Artist, poet and painter Michael Colby returns to his home in Maine after many years for a family reunion and to visit scenes from his youth. He talks about coming out as gay in a tightly-knit fishing and farming community. He tells of abuse at the hands of his family and others; of being an outsider and how his art and spirituality were directly affected by both the land and its people.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Artist",",","poet","and","painter","Michael","Colbi","return","to","his","home","in","Main","after","mani","year","for","a","famili","reunion","and","to","visit","scene","from","his","youth",".","He","talk","about","come","out","as","gay","in","a","tightly-knit","fish","and","farm","communiti",".","He","tell","of","abus","at","the","hand","of","his","famili","and","other",";","of","be","an","outsid","and","how","his","art","and","spiritu","were","direct","affect","by","both","the","land","and","it","peopl","."],"lemmas":["Artist",",","poet","and","painter","Michael","Colby","return","to","he","home","in","Maine","after","many","year","for","a","family","reunion","and","to","visit","scene","from","he","youth",".","he","talk","about","come","out","as","gay","in","a","tightly-knit","fishing","and","farming","community",".","he","tell","of","abuse","at","the","hand","of","he","family","and","other",";","of","be","a","outsider","and","how","he","art","and","spirituality","be","directly","affect","by","both","the","land","and","its","people","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Artist , poet",", poet and","poet and painter","and painter Michael","painter Michael Colby","Michael Colby returns","Colby returns to","returns to his","to his home","his home in","home in Maine","in Maine after","Maine after many","after many years","many years for","years for a","for a family","a family reunion","family reunion and","reunion and to","and to visit","to visit scenes","visit scenes from","scenes from his","from his youth","He talks about","talks about coming","about coming out","coming out as","out as gay","as gay in","gay in a","in a tightly-knit","a tightly-knit fishing","tightly-knit fishing and","fishing and farming","and farming community","He tells of","tells of abuse","of abuse at","abuse at the","at the hands","the hands of","hands of his","of his family","his family and","family and others","and others ;","others ; of","; of being","of being an","being an outsider","an outsider and","outsider and how","and how his","how his art","his art and","art and spirituality","and spirituality were","spirituality were directly","were directly affected","directly affected by","affected by both","by both the","both the land","the land and","land and its","and its people"],"2grams":["Artist ,",", poet","poet and","and painter","painter Michael","Michael Colby","Colby returns","returns to","to his","his home","home in","in Maine","Maine after","after many","many years","years for","for a","a family","family reunion","reunion and","and to","to visit","visit scenes","scenes from","from his","his youth","He talks","talks about","about coming","coming out","out as","as gay","gay in","in a","a tightly-knit","tightly-knit fishing","fishing and","and farming","farming community","He tells","tells of","of abuse","abuse at","at the","the hands","hands of","of his","his family","family and","and others","others ;","; of","of being","being an","an outsider","outsider and","and how","how his","his art","art and","and spirituality","spirituality were","were directly","directly affected","affected by","by both","both the","the land","land and","and its","its people"]}

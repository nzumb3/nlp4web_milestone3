{"title":"Musique(s) électronique(s)","plot":"A documentary about musique concrète and electronic music, from Luigi Russolo's manifesto \"The art of noises\" (1913) to the new generation. We discover a large history of electro-acoustic music. Some composers as François Bayle, Michel Chion, Christian Zanési, Emilie Simon, Kasper T. Toeplitz, Teho Teardo talk about how (and why) they create experimental pieces. It's a discovery of a new gender of music often considered as too elitist.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["A","documentari","about","musiqu","concrèt","and","electron","music",",","from","Luigi","Russolo","'s","manifesto","\"","The","art","of","nois","\"","(","1913",")","to","the","new","generat",".","We","discov","a","larg","histori","of","electro-acoust","music",".","Some","compos","as","Françoi","Bayl",",","Michel","Chion",",","Christian","Zanési",",","Emili","Simon",",","Kasper","T.","Toeplitz",",","Teho","Teardo","talk","about","how","(","and","whi",")","they","creat","experiment","piec",".","It","'s","a","discoveri","of","a","new","gender","of","music","often","consid","as","too","elitist","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","about","musique","concrète","and","electronic","music",",","from","Luigi","Russolo","'s","manifesto","``","the","art","of","noise","''","-lrb-","1913","-rrb-","to","the","new","generation",".","we","discover","a","large","history","of","electro-acoustic","music",".","some","composer","as","François","Bayle",",","Michel","Chion",",","Christian","Zanési",",","Emilie","Simon",",","Kasper","T.","Toeplitz",",","teho","teardo","talk","about","how","-lrb-","and","why","-rrb-","they","create","experimental","piece",".","it","be","a","discovery","of","a","new","gender","of","music","often","consider","as","too","elitist","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A documentary about","documentary about musique","about musique concrète","musique concrète and","concrète and electronic","and electronic music","electronic music ,","music , from",", from Luigi","from Luigi Russolo","Luigi Russolo 's","Russolo 's manifesto","'s manifesto \"","manifesto \" The","\" The art","The art of","art of noises","of noises \"","noises \" (","\" ( 1913","( 1913 )","1913 ) to",") to the","to the new","the new generation","We discover a","discover a large","a large history","large history of","history of electro-acoustic","of electro-acoustic music","Some composers as","composers as François","as François Bayle","François Bayle ,","Bayle , Michel",", Michel Chion","Michel Chion ,","Chion , Christian",", Christian Zanési","Christian Zanési ,","Zanési , Emilie",", Emilie Simon","Emilie Simon ,","Simon , Kasper",", Kasper T.","Kasper T.

{"title":"Peculiarities of the National Hunt","plot":"A Finn preparing a work on the Russian hunting traditions and customs, comes to Russia to collect materials and is invited to take part in a hunting party. His flamboyant companions include an Army general, with more than a passing resemblance to Aleksander Lebed, a police detective, local forest ranger (a devotee of Zen Buddhism) and some big-city types from St. Petersburg. Inevitably, their good intentions soon give way to endless drinking, visits to local farm girls and much else besides.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","Finn","prepar","a","work","on","the","Russian","hunt","tradit","and","custom",",","come","to","Russia","to","collect","materi","and","is","invit","to","take","part","in","a","hunt","parti",".","His","flamboy","companion","includ","an","Armi","general",",","with","more","than","a","pass","resembl","to","Aleksand","Lebe",",","a","polic","detect",",","local","forest","ranger","(","a","devote","of","Zen","Buddhism",")","and","some","big-citi","type","from","St.","Petersburg",".","Inevit",",","their","good","intent","soon","give","way","to","endless","drink",",","visit","to","local","farm","girl","and","much","els","besid","."],"lemmas":["a","Finn","prepare","a","work","on","the","russian","hunting","tradition","and","custom",",","come","to","Russia","to","collect","material","and","be","invite","to","take","part","in","a","hunting","party",".","he","flamboyant","companion","include","a","Army","general",",","with","more","than","a","passing","resemblance","to","Aleksander","Lebed",",","a","police","detective",",","local","forest","ranger","-lrb-","a","devotee","of","Zen","Buddhism","-rrb-","and","some","big-city","type","from","St.","Petersburg",".","inevitably",",","they","good","intention","soon","give","way","to","endless","drinking",",","visit","to","local","farm","girl","and","much","else","besides","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A Finn preparing","Finn preparing a","preparing a work","a work on","work on the","on the Russian","the Russian hunting","Russian hunting traditions","hunting traditions and","traditions and customs","and customs ,","customs , comes",", comes to","comes to Russia","to Russia to","Russia to collect","to collect materials","collect materials and","materials and is","and is invited","is invited to","invited to take","to take part","take part in","part in a","in a hunting","a hunting party","His flamboyant companions","flamboyant companions include","companions include an","include an Army","an Army general","Army general ,","general , with",", with more","with more than","more than a","than a passing","a passing resemblance","passing resemblance to","resemblance to Aleksander","to Aleksander Lebed","Aleksander Lebed ,","Lebed , a",", a police","a police detective","police detective ,","detective , local",", local forest","local forest ranger","forest ranger (","ranger ( a","( a devotee","a devotee of","devotee of Zen","of Zen Buddhism","Zen Buddhism )","Buddhism ) and",") and some","and some big-city","some big-city types","big-city types from","types from St.","from St. Petersburg","Inevitably , their",", their good","their good intentions","good intentions soon","intentions soon give","soon give way","give way to","way to endless","to endless drinking","endless drinking ,","drinking , visits",", visits to","visits to local","to local farm","local farm girls","farm girls and","girls and much","and much else","much else besides"],"2grams":["A Finn","Finn preparing","preparing a","a work","work on","on the","the Russian","Russian hunting","hunting traditions","traditions and","and customs","customs ,",", comes","comes to","to Russia","Russia to","to collect","collect materials","materials and","and is","is invited","invited to","to take","take part","part in","in a","a hunting","hunting party","His flamboyant","flamboyant companions","companions include","include an","an Army","Army general","general ,",", with","with more","more than","than a","a passing","passing resemblance","resemblance to","to Aleksander","Aleksander Lebed","Lebed ,",", a","a police","police detective","detective ,",", local","local forest","forest ranger","ranger (","( a","a devotee","devotee of","of Zen","Zen Buddhism","Buddhism )",") and","and some","some big-city","big-city types","types from","from St.","St. Petersburg","Inevitably ,",", their","their good","good intentions","intentions soon","soon give","give way","way to","to endless","endless drinking","drinking ,",", visits","visits to","to local","local farm","farm girls","girls and","and much","much else","else besides"]}

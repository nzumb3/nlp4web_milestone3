{"title":"Good Luck Soup","plot":"\"I don't want to be Japanese!\" filmmaker Matthew Hashiguchi recalls yelling at his father. Growing up Japanese-American in a predominantly white Irish-Catholic neighborhood in Cleveland, Ohio, Matthew wondered what made him different, why he stood out. Years later he set out to document his family's experiences of being Japanese in America before, during, and after World War II. GOOD LUCK SOUP explores several generations assimilating into a new culture while preserving their own.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","I","do","n't","want","to","be","Japanes","!","\"","filmmak","Matthew","Hashiguchi","recal","yell","at","his","father",".","Grow","up","Japanese-American","in","a","predomin","white","Irish-Cathol","neighborhood","in","Cleveland",",","Ohio",",","Matthew","wonder","what","made","him","differ",",","whi","he","stood","out",".","Year","later","he","set","out","to","document","his","famili","'s","experi","of","be","Japanes","in","America","befor",",","dure",",","and","after","World","War","II",".","GOOD","LUCK","SOUP","explor","sever","generat","assimil","into","a","new","cultur","while","preserv","their","own","."],"lemmas":["``","I","do","not","want","to","be","japanese","!","''","filmmaker","Matthew","Hashiguchi","recall","yell","at","he","father",".","grow","up","japanese-american","in","a","predominantly","white","irish-catholic","neighborhood","in","Cleveland",",","Ohio",",","Matthew","wonder","what","make","he","different",",","why","he","stand","out",".","year","later","he","set","out","to","document","he","family","'s","experience","of","be","Japanese","in","America","before",",","during",",","and","after","World","War","II",".","good","luck","soup","explore","several","generation","assimilate","into","a","new","culture","while","preserve","they","own","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" I do","I do n't","do n't want","n't want to","want to be","to be Japanese","be Japanese !","Japanese ! \"","filmmaker Matthew Hashiguchi","Matthew Hashiguchi recalls","Hashiguchi recalls yelling","recalls yelling at","yelling at his","at his father","Growing up Japanese-American","up Japanese-American in","Japanese-American in a","in a predominantly","a predominantly white","predominantly white Irish-Catholic","white Irish-Catholic neighborhood","Irish-Catholic neighborhood in","neighborhood in Cleveland","in Cleveland ,","Cleveland , Ohio",", Ohio ,","Ohio , Matthew",", Matthew wondered","Matthew wondered what","wondered what made","what made him","made him different","him different ,","different , why",", why he","why he stood","he stood out","Years later he","later he set","he set out","set out to","out to document","to document his","document his family","his family 's","family 's experiences","'s experiences of","experiences of being","of being Japanese","being Japanese in","Japanese in America","in America before","America before ,","before , during",", during ,","during , and",", and after","and after World","after World War","World War II","GOOD LUCK SOUP","LUCK SOUP explores","SOUP explores several","explores several generations","several generations assimilating","generations assimilating into","assimilating into a","into a new","a new culture","new culture while","culture while preserving","while preserving their","preserving their own"],"2grams":["\" I","I do","do n't","n't want","want to","to be","be Japanese","Japanese !","! \"","filmmaker Matthew","Matthew Hashiguchi","Hashiguchi recalls","recalls yelling","yelling at","at his","his father","Growing up","up Japanese-American","Japanese-American in","in a","a predominantly","predominantly white","white Irish-Catholic","Irish-Catholic neighborhood","neighborhood in","in Cleveland","Cleveland ,",", Ohio","Ohio ,",", Matthew","Matthew wondered","wondered what","what made","made him","him different","different ,",", why","why he","he stood","stood out","Years later","later he","he set","set out","out to","to document","document his","his family","family 's","'s experiences","experiences of","of being","being Japanese","Japanese in","in America","America before","before ,",", during","during ,",", and","and after","after World","World War","War II","GOOD LUCK","LUCK SOUP","SOUP explores","explores several","several generations","generations assimilating","assimilating into","into a","a new","new culture","culture while","while preserving","preserving their","their own"]}

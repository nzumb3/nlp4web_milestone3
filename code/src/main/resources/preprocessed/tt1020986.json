{"title":"Praying in Her Own Voice","plot":"This powerful film documents the courageous struggle of a religious female's group called Women of the Wall movement for equality next to the wailing wall, perhaps the holiest place on earth for Jews. The story of the Women of the Wall is a test case for the deprived status of women in Israeli public life. The film is an outcry protesting religious coercion and the violent silencing of women. It's a film that raises many questions about the battle of the sexes within the religious Jewish world.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","power","film","document","the","courag","struggl","of","a","religi","femal","'s","group","call","Women","of","the","Wall","movement","for","equal","next","to","the","wail","wall",",","perhap","the","holiest","place","on","earth","for","Jew",".","The","stori","of","the","Women","of","the","Wall","is","a","test","case","for","the","depriv","status","of","women","in","Israeli","public","life",".","The","film","is","an","outcri","protest","religi","coercion","and","the","violent","silenc","of","women",".","It","'s","a","film","that","rais","mani","question","about","the","battl","of","the","sex","within","the","religi","Jewish","world","."],"lemmas":["this","powerful","film","document","the","courageous","struggle","of","a","religious","female","'s","group","call","Women","of","the","Wall","movement","for","equality","next","to","the","wail","wall",",","perhaps","the","holiest","place","on","earth","for","jew",".","the","story","of","the","Women","of","the","Wall","be","a","test","case","for","the","deprive","status","of","woman","in","israeli","public","life",".","the","film","be","a","outcry","protest","religious","coercion","and","the","violent","silencing","of","woman",".","it","be","a","film","that","raise","many","question","about","the","battle","of","the","sex","within","the","religious","jewish","world","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["This powerful film","powerful film documents","film documents the","documents the courageous","the courageous struggle","courageous struggle of","struggle of a","of a religious","a religious female","religious female 's","female 's group","'s group called","group called Women","called Women of","Women of the","of the Wall","the Wall movement","Wall movement for","movement for equality","for equality next","equality next to","next to the","to the wailing","the wailing wall","wailing wall ,","wall , perhaps",", perhaps the","perhaps the holiest","the holiest place","holiest place on","place on earth","on earth for","earth for Jews","The story of","story of the","of the Women","the Women of","Women of the","of the Wall","the Wall is","Wall is a","is a test","a test case","test case for","case for the","for the deprived","the deprived status","deprived status of","status of women","of women in","women in Israeli","in Israeli public","Israeli public life","The film is","film is an","is an outcry","an outcry protesting","outcry protesting religious","protesting religious coercion","religious coercion and","coercion and the","and the violent","the violent silencing","violent silencing of","silencing of women","It 's a","'s a film","a film that","film that raises","that raises many","raises many questions","many questions about","questions about the","about the battle","the battle of","battle of the","of the sexes","the sexes within","sexes within the","within the religious","the religious Jewish","religious Jewish world"],"2grams":["This powerful","powerful film","film documents","documents the","the courageous","courageous struggle","struggle of","of a","a religious","religious female","female 's","'s group","group called","called Women","Women of","of the","the Wall","Wall movement","movement for","for equality","equality next","next to","to the","the wailing","wailing wall","wall ,",", perhaps","perhaps the","the holiest","holiest place","place on","on earth","earth for","for Jews","The story","story of","of the","the Women","Women of","of the","the Wall","Wall is","is a","a test","test case","case for","for the","the deprived","deprived status","status of","of women","women in","in Israeli","Israeli public","public life","The film","film is","is an","an outcry","outcry protesting","protesting religious","religious coercion","coercion and","and the","the violent","violent silencing","silencing of","of women","It 's","'s a","a film","film that","that raises","raises many","many questions","questions about","about the","the battle","battle of","of the","the sexes","sexes within","within the","the religious","religious Jewish","Jewish world"]}

{"title":"Proximity","plot":"Professor William Conroy, otherwise a model citizen, serves jail time for a car accident which proved fatal for his lover and student. In prison, he hears 'too much' about the murder of fellow inmate Evan, whose assertions he ignored that the deaths in their penitentiary multiplied suspiciously. Dirty jailer, Price, accidentally messes up the warden's instructions to get Conroy murdered by ruthless killer Lawrence during a transport. Conroy has some trouble convincing even his lawyer Eric Hawthorne he's the target of a manhunt. They and investigative reporter David Dart discover the dirty part played by Jim Corcoran's rich and influential 'Justice for victim families' vigilante society.","genres":["Action"," Mystery","

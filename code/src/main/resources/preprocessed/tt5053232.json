{"title":"Transforming Loss: A Documentary","plot":"How does one cope with profound loss and find hope? The award-winning film, 'Transforming Loss' follows six families through the grief process. Incredibly, these individuals not only have survived profound loss, but through love, faith and perseverance are transforming. A grief survivor herself, Burdick began her journey in understanding grief and loss when, at age 31, with two small children, her husband of 10 years was killed in a scuba diving accident. She found herself alone, entirely overwhelmed and unprepared for what her life, and their lives, had suddenly become. This film is Judith's transformation.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["How","doe","one","cope","with","profound","loss","and","find","hope","?","The","award-win","film",",","'","Transform","Loss","'","follow","six","famili","through","the","grief","process",".","Incredibl",",","these","individu","not","onli","have","surviv","profound","loss",",","but","through","love",",","faith","and","persever","are","transform",".","A","grief","survivor","herself",",","Burdick","began","her","journey","in","understand","grief","and","loss","when",",","at","age","31",",","with","two","small","children",",","her","husband","of","10","year","was","kill","in","a","scuba","dive","accid",".","She","found","herself","alon",",","entir","overwhelm","and","unprepar","for","what","her","life",",","and","their","live",",","had","sudden","becom",".","This","film","is","Judith","'s","transform","."],"lemmas":["how","do","one","cope","with","profound","loss","and","find","hope","?","the","award-winning","film",",","'","transform","loss","'","follow","six","family","through","the","grief","process",".","incredibly",",","these","individual","not","only","have","survive","profound","loss",",","but","through","love",",","faith","and","perseverance","be","transform",".","a","grief","survivor","herself",",","Burdick","begin","she","journey","in","understanding","grief","and","loss","when",",","at","age","31",",","with","two","small","child",",","she","husband","of","10","year","be","kill","in","a","scuba","diving","accident",".","she","find","herself","alone",",","entirely","overwhelm","and","unprepared","for","what","she","life",",","and","they","life",",","have","suddenly","become",".","this","film","be","Judith","'s","transformation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["How does one","does one cope","one cope with","cope with profound","with profound loss","profound loss and","loss and find","and find hope","The award-winning film","award-winning film ,","film , '",", ' Transforming","' Transforming Loss","Transforming Loss '","Loss ' follows","' follows six","follows six families","six families through","families through the","through the grief","the grief process","Incredibly , these",", these individuals","these individuals not","individuals not only","not only have","only have survived","have survived profound","survived profound loss","profound loss ,","loss , but",", but through","but through love","through love ,","love , faith",", faith and","faith and perseverance","and perseverance are","perseverance are transforming","A grief survivor","grief survivor herself","survivor herself ,","herself , Burdick",", Burdick began","Burdick began her","began her journey","her journey in","journey in understanding","in understanding grief","understanding grief and","grief and loss","and loss when","loss when ,","when , at",", at age","at age 31","age 31 ,","31 , with",", with two","with two small","two small children","small children ,","children , her",", her husband","her husband of","husband of 10","of 10 years","10 years was","years was killed","was killed in","killed in a","in a scuba","a scuba diving","scuba diving accident","She found herself","found herself alone","herself alone ,","alone , entirely",", entirely overwhelmed","entirely overwhelmed and","overwhelmed and unprepared","and unprepared for","unprepared for what","for what her","what her life","her life ,","life , and",", and their","and their lives","their lives ,","lives , had",", had suddenly","had suddenly become","This film is","film is Judith","is Judith 's","Judith 's transformation"],"2grams":["How does","does one","one cope","cope with","with profound","profound loss","loss and","and find","find hope","The award-winning","award-winning film","film ,",", '","' Transforming","Transforming Loss","Loss '","' follows","follows six","six families","families through","through the","the grief","grief process","Incredibly ,",", these","these individuals","individuals not","not only","only have","have survived","survived profound","profound loss","loss ,",", but","but through","through love","love ,",", faith","faith and","and perseverance","perseverance are","are transforming","A grief","grief survivor","survivor herself","herself ,",", Burdick","Burdick began","began her","her journey","journey in","in understanding","understanding grief","grief and","and loss","loss when","when ,",", at","at age","age 31","31 ,",", with","with two","two small","small children","children ,",", her","her husband","husband of","of 10","10 years","years was","was killed","killed in","in a","a scuba","scuba diving","diving accident","She found","found herself","herself alone","alone ,",", entirely","entirely overwhelmed","overwhelmed and","and unprepared","unprepared for","for what","what her","her life","life ,",", and","and their","their lives","lives ,",", had","had suddenly","suddenly become","This film","film is","is Judith","Judith 's","'s transformation"]}

{"title":"Cinderella on the Go","plot":"Making opera fun is the perfect way to introduce classical music to children. The film is a humorous story of a class of 10-year-old's who with their music teacher, turn Rossini's opera 'La Cenerentola' back into a childhood story from whence it came. Coupled with the challenge of singing four-part harmony, these children act and sing their way through one of Rossini's masterpieces. The resultant romp through childhood innocence will not be forgotten easily.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Make","opera","fun","is","the","perfect","way","to","introduc","classic","music","to","children",".","The","film","is","a","humor","stori","of","a","class","of","10-year-old","'s","who","with","their","music","teacher",",","turn","Rossini","'s","opera","'","La","Cenerentola","'","back","into","a","childhood","stori","from","whenc","it","came",".","Coupl","with","the","challeng","of","sing","four-part","harmoni",",","these","children","act","and","sing","their","way","through","one","of","Rossini","'s","masterpiec",".","The","result","romp","through","childhood","innoc","will","not","be","forgotten","easili","."],"lemmas":["make","opera","fun","be","the","perfect","way","to","introduce","classical","music","to","child",".","the","film","be","a","humorous","story","of","a","class","of","10-year-old","'s","who","with","they","music","teacher",",","turn","Rossini","'s","opera","'","la","cenerentola","'","back","into","a","childhood","story","from","whence","it","come",".","couple","with","the","challenge","of","singing","four-part","harmony",",","these","child","act","and","sing","they","way","through","one","of","Rossini","'s","masterpiece",".","the","resultant","romp","through","childhood","innocence","will","not","be","forget","easily","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Making opera fun","opera fun is","fun is the","is the perfect","the perfect way","perfect way to","way to introduce","to introduce classical","introduce classical music","classical music to","music to children","The film is","film is a","is a humorous","a humorous story","humorous story of","story of a","of a class","a class of","class of 10-year-old","of 10-year-old 's","10-year-old 's who","'s who with","who with their","with their music","their music teacher","music teacher ,","teacher , turn",", turn Rossini","turn Rossini 's","Rossini 's opera","'s opera '","opera ' La","' La Cenerentola","La Cenerentola '","Cenerentola ' back","' back into","back into a","into a childhood","a childhood story","childhood story from","story from whence","from whence it","whence it came","Coupled with the","with the challenge","the challenge of","challenge of singing","of singing four-part","singing four-part harmony","four-part harmony ,","harmony , these",", these children","these children act","children act and","act and sing","and sing their","sing their way","their way through","way through one","through one of","one of Rossini","of Rossini 's","Rossini 's masterpieces","The resultant romp","resultant romp through","romp through childhood","through childhood innocence","childhood innocence will","innocence will not","will not be","not be forgotten","be forgotten easily"],"2grams":["Making opera","opera fun","fun is","is the","the perfect","perfect way","way to","to introduce","introduce classical","classical music","music to","to children","The film","film is","is a","a humorous","humorous story","story of","of a","a class","class of","of 10-year-old","10-year-old 's","'s who","who with","with their","their music","music teacher","teacher ,",", turn","turn Rossini","Rossini 's","'s opera","opera '","' La","La Cenerentola","Cenerentola '","' back","back into","into a","a childhood","childhood story","story from","from whence","whence it","it came","Coupled with","with the","the challenge","challenge of","of singing","singing four-part","four-part harmony","harmony ,",", these","these children","children act","act and","and sing","sing their","their way","way through","through one","one of","of Rossini","Rossini 's","'s masterpieces","The resultant","resultant romp","romp through","through childhood","childhood innocence","innocence will","will not","not be","be forgotten","forgotten easily"]}

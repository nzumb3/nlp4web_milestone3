{"title":"Tout s'est bien pass√©","plot":"The people of Djenne (Mali, Africa) end the dry season with a special tradition. They plaster their mosque. This fairy-like building is the largest adobe construction in the world. Due to high temperatures and the (scarce) rainfall it erodes quickly. To prevent the Grande Mosquee from 'melting down' to just a pile of clay, the Djenneke join forces at the fete de crepissage. This documentary follows the preamble to the festival and shows us a different Africa than we think we know. Throughout this storyline runs the tale of a many century old legend about the genesis of Djenne.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["The","peopl","of","Djenn","(","Mali",",","Africa",")","end","the","dri","season","with","a","special","tradit",".","They","plaster","their","mosqu",".","This","fairy-lik","build","is","the","largest","adob","construct","in","the","world",".","Due","to","high","temperatur","and","the","(","scarc",")","rainfal","it","erod","quick",".","To","prevent","the","Grand","Mosque","from","'","melt","down","'","to","just","a","pile","of","clay",",","the","Djennek","join","forc","at","the","fete","de","crepissag",".","This","documentari","follow","the","preambl","to","the","festiv","and","show","us","a","differ","Africa","than","we","think","we","know",".","Throughout","this","storylin","run","the","tale","of","a","mani","centuri","old","legend","about","the","genesi","of","Djenn","."],"lemmas":["the","people","of","Djenne","-lrb-","Mali",",","Africa","-rrb-","end","the","dry","season","with","a","special","tradition",".","they","plaster","they","mosque",".","this","fairy-like","building","be","the","largest","adobe","construction","in","the","world",".","due","to","high","temperature","and","the","-lrb-","scarce","-rrb-","rainfall","it","erode","quickly",".","to","prevent","the","Grande","Mosquee","from","'","melt","down","'","to","just","a","pile","of","clay",",","the","Djenneke","join","force","at","the","fete","de","crepissage",".","this","documentary","follow","the","preamble","to","the","festival","and","show","we","a","different","Africa","than","we","think","we","know",".","throughout","this","storyline","run","the","tale","of","a","many","century","old","legend","about","the","genesis","of","Djenne","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The people of","people of Djenne","of Djenne (","Djenne ( Mali","( Mali ,","Mali , Africa",", Africa )","Africa ) end",") end the","end the dry","the dry season","dry season with","season with a","with a special","a special tradition","They plaster their","plaster their mosque","This fairy-like building","fairy-like building is","building is the","is the largest","the largest adobe","largest adobe construction","adobe construction in","construction in the","in the world","Due to high","to high temperatures","high temperatures and","temperatures and the","and the (","the ( scarce","( scarce )","scarce ) rainfall",") rainfall it","rainfall it erodes","it erodes quickly","To prevent the","prevent the Grande","the Grande Mosquee","Grande Mosquee from","Mosquee from '","from ' melting","' melting down","melting down '","down ' to","' to just","to just a","just a pile","a pile of","pile of clay","of clay ,","clay , the",", the Djenneke","the Djenneke join","Djenneke join forces","join forces at","forces at the","at the fete","the fete de","fete de crepissage","This documentary follows","documentary follows the","follows the preamble","the preamble to","preamble to the","to the festival","the festival and","festival and shows","and shows us","shows us a","us a different","a different Africa","different Africa than","Africa than we","than we think","we think we","think we know","Throughout this storyline","this storyline runs","storyline runs the","runs the tale","the tale of","tale of a","of a many","a many century","many century old","century old legend","old legend about","legend about the","about the genesis","the genesis of","genesis of Djenne"],"2grams":["The people","people of","of Djenne","Djenne (","( Mali","Mali ,",", Africa","Africa )",") end","end the","the dry","dry season","season with","with a","a special","special tradition","They plaster","plaster their","their mosque","This fairy-like","fairy-like building","building is","is the","the largest","largest adobe","adobe construction","construction in","in the","the world","Due to","to high","high temperatures","temperatures and","and the","the (","( scarce","scarce )",") rainfall","rainfall it","it erodes","erodes quickly","To prevent","prevent the","the Grande","Grande Mosquee","Mosquee from","from '","' melting","melting down","down '","' to","to just","just a","a pile","pile of","of clay","clay ,",", the","the Djenneke","Djenneke join","join forces","forces at","at the","the fete","fete de","de crepissage","This documentary","documentary follows","follows the","the preamble","preamble to","to the","the festival","festival and","and shows","shows us","us a","a different","different Africa","Africa than","than we","we think","think we","we know","Throughout this","this storyline","storyline runs","runs the","the tale","tale of","of a","a many","many century","century old","old legend","legend about","about the","the genesis","genesis of","of Djenne"]}

{"title":"Pelli Koduku","plot":"Naresh (Varalu) is the only son born in a family which has not had a male heir in 4 generations. His mother (Sangeeta) rules the home with an iron fist. Fed up of his wife's domineering ways, Naresh's father urges his to run away from home and find a wife to his liking. In the meanwhile his mother's manager (Dharmavarapu) finds Divyavani, whose family is heavily indebted and tells her to make Naresh fall in love with her. Accordingly when Naresh runs away, he places Divyavani in the way as a rich orphan who wants to marry for money. Naresh falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Divyavani is blown away by Naresh's goodness and tells Dharmavarapu that she will not trap such a good man. Dharmavarapu then spins a tale about Divyavani and extracts money from Sangeetha. Naresh and family believe that she is a con woman. The climax shows how the truth finally comes out, and ends with Naresh and Divyavani marrying with his mother's blessing.","genres":["Drama"," Musical","

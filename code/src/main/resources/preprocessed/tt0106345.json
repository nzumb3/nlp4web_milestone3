{"title":"Bai mei gui","plot":"Traditionally, romantic comedies work hard to create \"meet cute\" situations where the featured couple first come together. Here Maggie Cheung and Roy Cheung \"meet cute\" when he, as a triad gangster, keeps her, as an insurance sales agent, from completing a sale to a hapless fellow who may not last long enough to make his first monthly payment. Maggie, however, does not appreciate Roy's interference; to placate her, he offers to buy a policy. In short order he is attacked by rivals and ends up, somewhat implausibly, in Maggie's care. The script by Chau Ting (later a co-writer of The Storm Riders and three Young and Dangerous films) tosses logic out the window, but fans of Maggie will no doubt enjoy her performance. Veronice Yip has a small yet indelible role as a friend of Maggie, and Michael Wong has a brief cameo.","genres":["Action"," Romance"," Comedy"],"stems":["Tradit",",","romant","comedi","work","hard","to","creat","\"","meet","cute","\"","situat","where","the","featur","coupl","first","come","togeth",".","Here","Maggi","Cheung","and","Roy","Cheung","\"","meet","cute","\"","when","he",",","as","a","triad","gangster",",","keep","her",",","as","an","insur","sale","agent",",","from","complet","a","sale","to","a","hapless","fellow","who","may","not","last","long","enough","to","make","his","first","month","payment",".","Maggi",",","howev",",","doe","not","appreci","Roy","'s","interfer",";","to","placat","her",",","he","offer","to","buy","a","polici",".","In","short","order","he","is","attack","by","rival","and","end","up",",","somewhat","implaus",",","in","Maggi","'s","care",".","The","script","by","Chau","Ting","(","later","a","co-writ","of","The","Storm","Rider","and","three","Young","and","Danger","film",")","toss","logic","out","the","window",",","but","fan","of","Maggi","will","no","doubt","enjoy","her","perform",".","Veronic","Yip","has","a","small","yet","indel","role","as","a","friend","of","Maggi",",","and","Michael","Wong","has","a","brief","cameo","."],"lemmas":["traditionally",",","romantic","comedy","work","hard","to","create","``","meet","cute","''","situation","where","the","featured","couple","first","come","together",".","here","Maggie","Cheung","and","Roy","Cheung","``","meet","cute","''","when","he",",","as","a","triad","gangster",",","keep","she",",","as","a","insurance","sale","agent",",","from","complete","a","sale","to","a","hapless","fellow","who","may","not","last","long","enough","to","make","he","first","monthly","payment",".","Maggie",",","however",",","do","not","appreciate","Roy","'s","interference",";","to","placate","she",",","he","offer","to","buy","a","policy",".","in","short","order","he","be","attack","by","rival","and","end","up",",","somewhat","implausibly",",","in","Maggie","'s","care",".","the","script","by","Chau","Ting","-lrb-","later","a","co-writer","of","the","storm","rider","and","three","young","and","dangerous","film","-rrb-","toss","logic","out","the","window",",","but","fan","of","Maggie","will","no","doubt","enjoy","she","performance",".","Veronice","Yip","have","a","small","yet","indelible","role","as","a","friend","of","Maggie",",","and","Michael","Wong","have","a","brief","cameo","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Traditionally , romantic",", romantic comedies","romantic comedies work","comedies work hard","work hard to","hard to create","to create \"","create \" meet","\" meet cute","meet cute \"","cute \" situations","\" situations where","situations where the","where the featured","the featured couple","featured couple first","couple first come","first come together","Here Maggie Cheung","Maggie Cheung and","Cheung and Roy","and Roy Cheung","Roy Cheung \"","Cheung \" meet","\" meet cute","meet cute \"","cute \" when","\" when he","when he ,","he , as",", as a","as a triad","a triad gangster","triad gangster ,","gangster , keeps",", keeps her","keeps her ,","her , as",", as an","as an insurance","an insurance sales","insurance sales agent","sales agent ,","agent , from",", from completing","from completing a","completing a sale","a sale to","sale to a","to a hapless","a hapless fellow","hapless fellow who","fellow who may","who may not","may not last","not last long","last long enough","long enough to","enough to make","to make his","make his first","his first monthly","first monthly payment","Maggie , however",", however ,","however , does",", does not","does not appreciate","not appreciate Roy","appreciate Roy 's","Roy 's interference","'s interference ;","interference ;

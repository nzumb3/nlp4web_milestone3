{"title":"Stash House","plot":"A couple love their new house, bought for a steal out of a foreclosure. During their first visit they find illegal drugs stashed in the walls, and they realize this is not their dream house. As they are about to leave, suddenly their exit is blocked by a gun-wielding neighbor Spector and his accomplice. They come to realize the house is hiding more than drugs - it's the operation center for mass drug czar who is buried beneath the floorboards. On the run from the professional killers who want the drugs and evidence, the resourceful couple will need to turn the tables on their attackers to survive.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["A","coupl","love","their","new","hous",",","bought","for","a","steal","out","of","a","foreclosur",".","Dure","their","first","visit","they","find","illeg","drug","stash","in","the","wall",",","and","they","realiz","this","is","not","their","dream","hous",".","As","they","are","about","to","leav",",","sudden","their","exit","is","block","by","a","gun-wield","neighbor","Spector","and","his","accomplic",".","They","come","to","realiz","the","hous","is","hide","more","than","drug","-","it","'s","the","oper","center","for","mass","drug","czar","who","is","buri","beneath","the","floorboard",".","On","the","run","from","the","profession","killer","who","want","the","drug","and","evid",",","the","resourc","coupl","will","need","to","turn","the","tabl","on","their","attack","to","surviv","."],"lemmas":["a","couple","love","they","new","house",",","buy","for","a","steal","out","of","a","foreclosure",".","during","they","first","visit","they","find","illegal","drug","stash","in","the","wall",",","and","they","realize","this","be","not","they","dream","house",".","as","they","be","about","to","leave",",","suddenly","they","exit","be","block","by","a","gun-wielding","neighbor","Spector","and","he","accomplice",".","they","come","to","realize","the","house","be","hide","more","than","drug","-","it","be","the","operation","center","for","mass","drug","czar","who","be","bury","beneath","the","floorboard",".","on","the","run","from","the","professional","killer","who","want","the","drug","and","evidence",",","the","resourceful","couple","will","need","to","turn","the","table","on","they","attacker","to","survive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["A couple love","couple love their","love their new","their new house","new house ,","house , bought",", bought for","bought for a","for a steal","a steal out","steal out of","out of a","of a foreclosure","During their first","their first visit","first visit they","visit they find","they find illegal","find illegal drugs","illegal drugs stashed","drugs stashed in","stashed in the","in the walls","the walls ,","walls , and",", and they","and they realize","they realize this","realize this is","this is not","is not their","not their dream","their dream house","As they are","they are about","are about to","about to leave","to leave ,","leave , suddenly",", suddenly their","suddenly their exit","their exit is","exit is blocked","is blocked by","blocked by a","by a gun-wielding","a gun-wielding neighbor","gun-wielding neighbor Spector","neighbor Spector and","Spector and his","and his accomplice","They come to","come to realize","to realize the","realize the house","the house is","house is hiding","is hiding more","hiding more than","more than drugs","than drugs -","drugs -

{"title":"Jogwa","plot":"Suli an innocent, happy carefree girl tethering on the brink of womanhood is unexpectedly forced into a life of servitude to the local deity when the uneducated, rural community in which she resides compels her to live a life of subjugation and serfdom on account of rampant superstitions that plagues the village. As Suli struggles to adjust to the new life unexpectedly thrust upon her, a far cry from the dreams and aspirations she once harbored, she meets Tayappa, a man forced to drape a sari and live the life of a woman and a homosexual as he too is a victim of the same circumstances that afflict her life. Brought together by the plight of their similar circumstances and wretched futures, Suli and Tayappa develop a warm and cherishing camaraderie, which eventually blossoms into love. The two gentle, wounded souls seek solace and comfort in each others company. Together they once again dream of living a happy, normal life, but are forced to face the wrath of a highly disapproving community that is hell-bent upon destroying their union. A heart wrenching tale that exposes the hypocrisies and exploitations of an oppressed society harrowed by archaic traditions and plagued by superstitions in the heart of rural India, Jogwa is a poignant tale of one woman's inspiring journey to break free from the shackles of discrimination, sexual oppression and servitude and find true happiness.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Suli","an","innoc",",","happi","carefre","girl","tether","on","the","brink","of","womanhood","is","unexpect","forc","into","a","life","of","servitud","to","the","local","deiti","when","the","uneduc",",","rural","communiti","in","which","she","resid","compel","her","to","live","a","life","of","subjug","and","serfdom","on","account","of","rampant","superstit","that","plagu","the","villag",".","As","Suli","struggl","to","adjust","to","the","new","life","unexpect","thrust","upon","her",",","a","far","cri","from","the","dream","and","aspir","she","onc","harbor",",","she","meet","Tayappa",",","a","man","forc","to","drape","a","sari","and","live","the","life","of","a","woman","and","a","homosexu","as","he","too","is","a","victim","of","the","same","circumst","that","afflict","her","life",".","Brought","togeth","by","the","plight","of","their","similar","circumst","and","wretch","futur",",","Suli","and","Tayappa","develop","a","warm","and","cherish","camaraderi",",","which","eventu","blossom","into","love",".","The","two","gentl",",","wound","soul","seek","solac","and","comfort","in","each","other","compani",".","Togeth","they","onc","again","dream","of","live","a","happi",",","normal","life",",","but","are","forc","to","face","the","wrath","of","a","high","disapprov","communiti","that","is","hell-bent","upon","destroy","their","union",".","A","heart","wrench","tale","that","expos","the","hypocrisi","and","exploit","of","an","oppress","societi","harrow","by","archaic","tradit","and","plagu","by","superstit","in","the","heart","of","rural","India",",","Jogwa","is","a","poignant","tale","of","one","woman","'s","inspir","journey","to","break","free","from","the","shackl","of","discrimin",",","sexual","oppress","and","servitud","and","find","true","happi","."],"lemmas":["suli","a","innocent",",","happy","carefree","girl","tethering","on","the","brink","of","womanhood","be","unexpectedly","force","into","a","life","of","servitude","to","the","local","deity","when","the","uneducated",",","rural","community","in","which","she","reside","compel","she","to","live","a","life","of","subjugation","and","serfdom","on","account","of","rampant","superstition","that","plague","the","village",".","as","Suli","struggle","to","adjust","to","the","new","life","unexpectedly","thrust","upon","she",",","a","far","cry","from","the","dream","and","aspiration","she","once","harbor",",","she","meet","Tayappa",",","a","man","force","to","drape","a","sari","and","live","the","life","of","a","woman","and","a","homosexual","as","he","too","be","a","victim","of","the","same","circumstance","that","afflict","she","life",".","bring","together","by","the","plight","of","they","similar","circumstance","and","wretched","future",",","Suli","and","Tayappa","develop","a","warm","and","cherish","camaraderie",",","which","eventually","blossom","into","love",".","the","two","gentle",",","wounded","soul","seek","solace","and","comfort","in","each","other","company",".","together","they","once","again","dream","of","live","a","happy",",","normal","life",",","but","be","force","to","face","the","wrath","of","a","highly","disapproving","community","that","be","hell-bent","upon","destroy","they","union",".","a","heart","wrenching","tale","that","expose","the","hypocrisy","and","exploitation","of","a","oppressed","society","harrow","by","archaic","tradition","and","plague","by","superstition","in","the","heart","of","rural","India",",","Jogwa","be","a","poignant","tale","of","one","woman","'s","inspiring","journey","to","break","free","from","the","shackle","of","discrimination",",","sexual","oppression","and","servitude","and","find","true","happiness","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Suli

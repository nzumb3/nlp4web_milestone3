{"title":"The Typewriter (In the 21st Century)","plot":"In May of 2010, Los Angeles based filmmakers Christopher Lockett and Gary Nicholson read an article on Wired.com about The Last Generation of Typewriter Repairmen. Casual conversation over coffee about the importance of the typewriter in world history eventually turned toward the inevitable conclusion that this would make a great documentary. Lockett and Nicholson agreed that the passing of the typewriter, a portable printing press that moved the world's communication technology from pen and ink to the QWERTY keyboards on today's computers, along with the highly skilled technicians who service them, should be documented. In the filmmaker's research, they uncovered many interesting stories, realizing that the typewriter is alive and well and still very relevant in the 21st century.","genres":["Documentary"," History","

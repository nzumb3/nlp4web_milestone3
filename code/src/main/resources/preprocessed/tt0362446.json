{"title":"Beyond Expectations","plot":"Gina and Andy are two self-styled cynics who are coerced into dating by their coupled friends and co-workers. Gina ropes Andy into co-writing a progressive feminist children's book, and the book becomes a surrogate for their insecure but slowly budding affections. But before they can be together, they must juggle co-dependent roommates, depressive ex-es, a divorce, a wedding and burnt Peking duck.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Gina","and","Andi","are","two","self-styl","cynic","who","are","coerc","into","date","by","their","coupl","friend","and","co-work",".","Gina","rope","Andi","into","co-writ","a","progress","feminist","children","'s","book",",","and","the","book","becom","a","surrog","for","their","insecur","but","slowli","bud","affect",".","But","befor","they","can","be","togeth",",","they","must","juggl","co-depend","roommat",",","depress","ex-",",","a","divorc",",","a","wed","and","burnt","Peke","duck","."],"lemmas":["Gina","and","Andy","be","two","self-styled","cynic","who","be","coerce","into","date","by","they","coupled","friend","and","co-worker",".","Gina","rope","Andy","into","co-write","a","progressive","feminist","child","'s","book",",","and","the","book","become","a","surrogate","for","they","insecure","but","slowly","budding","affection",".","but","before","they","can","be","together",",","they","must","juggle","co-dependent","roommate",",","depressive","ex-e",",","a","divorce",",","a","wedding","and","burnt","peking","duck","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Gina and Andy","and Andy are","Andy are two","are two self-styled","two self-styled cynics","self-styled cynics who","cynics who are","who are coerced","are coerced into","coerced into dating","into dating by","dating by their","by their coupled","their coupled friends","coupled friends and","friends and co-workers","Gina ropes Andy","ropes Andy into","Andy into co-writing","into co-writing a","co-writing a progressive","a progressive feminist","progressive feminist children","feminist children 's","children 's book","'s book ,","book , and",", and the","and the book","the book becomes","book becomes a","becomes a surrogate","a surrogate for","surrogate for their","for their insecure","their insecure but","insecure but slowly","but slowly budding","slowly budding affections","But before they","before they can","they can be","can be together","be together ,","together , they",", they must","they must juggle","must juggle co-dependent","juggle co-dependent roommates","co-dependent roommates ,","roommates , depressive",", depressive ex-es","depressive ex-es ,","ex-es , a",", a divorce","a divorce ,","divorce , a",", a wedding","a wedding and","wedding and burnt","and burnt Peking","burnt Peking duck"],"2grams":["Gina and","and Andy","Andy are","are two","two self-styled","self-styled cynics","cynics who","who are","are coerced","coerced into","into dating","dating by","by their","their coupled","coupled friends","friends and","and co-workers","Gina ropes","ropes Andy","Andy into","into co-writing","co-writing a","a progressive","progressive feminist","feminist children","children 's","'s book","book ,",", and","and the","the book","book becomes","becomes a","a surrogate","surrogate for","for their","their insecure","insecure but","but slowly","slowly budding","budding affections","But before","before they","they can","can be","be together","together ,",", they","they must","must juggle","juggle co-dependent","co-dependent roommates","roommates ,",", depressive","depressive ex-es","ex-es ,",", a","a divorce","divorce ,",", a","a wedding","wedding and","and burnt","burnt Peking","Peking duck"]}

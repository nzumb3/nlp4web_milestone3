{"title":"Echoes of a Storyteller","plot":"This documentary looks into the tradition of oral storytelling in Kyrgyzstan through the eyes of two main characters--a revered elder and his teenage student. The film explores Soviet and Islamic influence on the Kyrgyz people, whose epic poem Manas has been transmitted orally for over a thousand years. The revered elder, now a national celebrity, recalls fighting in the Soviet army. His student knows nothing of Soviet life; he prays to Allah and records his friend's band with a cell phone camera. These two characters and their relationship to one another gives an honest and personal context to a Central Asian tradition unlike any other in the world.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["This","documentari","look","into","the","tradit","of","oral","storytel","in","Kyrgyzstan","through","the","eye","of","two","main","charact","--","a","rever","elder","and","his","teenag","student",".","The","film","explor","Soviet","and","Islamic","influenc","on","the","Kyrgyz","peopl",",","whose","epic","poem","Mana","has","been","transmit","oral","for","over","a","thousand","year",".","The","rever","elder",",","now","a","nation","celebr",",","recal","fight","in","the","Soviet","armi",".","His","student","know","noth","of","Soviet","life",";","he","pray","to","Allah","and","record","his","friend","'s","band","with","a","cell","phone","camera",".","These","two","charact","and","their","relationship","to","one","anoth","give","an","honest","and","person","context","to","a","Central","Asian","tradit","unlik","ani","other","in","the","world","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","look","into","the","tradition","of","oral","storytelling","in","Kyrgyzstan","through","the","eye","of","two","main","character","--","a","revered","elder","and","he","teenage","student",".","the","film","explore","soviet","and","islamic","influence","on","the","kyrgyz","people",",","whose","epic","poem","Manas","have","be","transmit","orally","for","over","a","thousand","year",".","the","revere","elder",",","now","a","national","celebrity",",","recall","fight","in","the","soviet","army",".","he","student","know","nothing","of","soviet","life",";","he","pray","to","Allah","and","record","he","friend","'s","band","with","a","cell","phone","camera",".","these","two","character","and","they","relationship","to","one","another","give","a","honest","and","personal","context","to","a","central","asian","tradition","unlike","any","other","in","the","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary looks","documentary looks into","looks into the","into the tradition","the tradition of","tradition of oral","of oral storytelling","oral storytelling in","storytelling in Kyrgyzstan","in Kyrgyzstan through","Kyrgyzstan through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of two","of two main","two main characters","main characters --","characters -- a","-- a revered","a revered elder","revered elder and","elder and his","and his teenage","his teenage student","The film explores","film explores Soviet","explores Soviet and","Soviet and Islamic","and Islamic influence","Islamic influence on","influence on the","on the Kyrgyz","the Kyrgyz people","Kyrgyz people ,","people , whose",", whose epic","whose epic poem","epic poem Manas","poem Manas has","Manas has been","has been transmitted","been transmitted orally","transmitted orally for","orally for over","for over a","over a thousand","a thousand years","The revered elder","revered elder ,","elder , now",", now a","now a national","a national celebrity","national celebrity ,","celebrity , recalls",", recalls fighting","recalls fighting in","fighting in the","in the Soviet","the Soviet army","His student knows","student knows nothing","knows nothing of","nothing of Soviet","of Soviet life","Soviet life ;","life ;

{"title":"Checkpoint","plot":"Examines the status and plight of Palestinians after the Oslo peace process, discussing and documenting situations in which things have gotten worse for refugees, rather than better. The checkpoints at various locations (access to highways, exiting and entering a city or an area under putative Palestinian control, and access to holy sites) become the symbol of Israel's post-Oslo apartheid. The film also argues that, in the islands of Palestinian autonomy that make up three percent of Israel's land, Arab self-determination is virtually non-existent.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Examin","the","status","and","plight","of","Palestinian","after","the","Oslo","peac","process",",","discuss","and","document","situat","in","which","thing","have","gotten","wors","for","refuge",",","rather","than","better",".","The","checkpoint","at","various","locat","(","access","to","highway",",","exit","and","enter","a","citi","or","an","area","under","putat","Palestinian","control",",","and","access","to","holi","site",")","becom","the","symbol","of","Israel","'s","post-Oslo","apartheid",".","The","film","also","argu","that",",","in","the","island","of","Palestinian","autonomi","that","make","up","three","percent","of","Israel","'s","land",",","Arab","self-determin","is","virtual","non-exist","."],"lemmas":["examine","the","status","and","plight","of","Palestinians","after","the","Oslo","peace","process",",","discuss","and","document","situation","in","which","thing","have","get","worse","for","refugee",",","rather","than","better",".","the","checkpoint","at","various","location","-lrb-","access","to","highway",",","exit","and","enter","a","city","or","a","area","under","putative","palestinian","control",",","and","access","to","holy","site","-rrb-","become","the","symbol","of","Israel","'s","post-oslo","apartheid",".","the","film","also","argue","that",",","in","the","island","of","palestinian","autonomy","that","make","up","three","percent","of","Israel","'s","land",",","Arab","self-determination","be","virtually","non-existent","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Examines the status","the status and","status and plight","and plight of","plight of Palestinians","of Palestinians after","Palestinians after the","after the Oslo","the Oslo peace","Oslo peace process","peace process ,","process , discussing",", discussing and","discussing and documenting","and documenting situations","documenting situations in","situations in which","in which things","which things have","things have gotten","have gotten worse","gotten worse for","worse for refugees","for refugees ,","refugees , rather",", rather than","rather than better","The checkpoints at","checkpoints at various","at various locations","various locations (","locations ( access","( access to","access to highways","to highways ,","highways , exiting",", exiting and","exiting and entering","and entering a","entering a city","a city or","city or an","or an area","an area under","area under putative","under putative Palestinian","putative Palestinian control","Palestinian control ,","control , and",", and access","and access to","access to holy","to holy sites","holy sites )","sites ) become",") become the","become the symbol","the symbol of","symbol of Israel","of Israel 's","Israel 's post-Oslo","'s post-Oslo apartheid","The film also","film also argues","also argues that","argues that ,","that , in",", in the","in the islands","the islands of","islands of Palestinian","of Palestinian autonomy","Palestinian autonomy that","autonomy that make","that make up","make up three","up three percent","three percent of","percent of Israel","of Israel 's","Israel 's land","'s land ,","land , Arab",", Arab self-determination","Arab self-determination is","self-determination is virtually","is virtually non-existent"],"2grams":["Examines the","the status","status and","and plight","plight of","of Palestinians","Palestinians after","after the","the Oslo","Oslo peace","peace process","process ,",", discussing","discussing and","and documenting","documenting situations","situations in","in which","which things","things have","have gotten","gotten worse","worse for","for refugees","refugees ,",", rather","rather than","than better","The checkpoints","checkpoints at","at various","various locations","locations (","( access","access to","to highways","highways ,",", exiting","exiting and","and entering","entering a","a city","city or","or an","an area","area under","under putative","putative Palestinian","Palestinian control","control ,",", and","and access","access to","to holy","holy sites","sites )",") become","become the","the symbol","symbol of","of Israel","Israel 's","'s post-Oslo","post-Oslo apartheid","The film","film also","also argues","argues that","that ,",", in","in the","the islands","islands of","of Palestinian","Palestinian autonomy","autonomy that","that make","make up","up three","three percent","percent of","of Israel","Israel 's","'s land","land ,",", Arab","Arab self-determination","self-determination is","is virtually","virtually non-existent"]}

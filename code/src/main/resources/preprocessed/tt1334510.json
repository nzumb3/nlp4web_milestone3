{"title":"Afghan Star","plot":"\"Afghan Star\" is a TV show modeled on the UK's \"Pop Idol.\" We join the 2008 contest when it's down to nine contestants, and we focus on two women, Setara and Lema, and two men, Hameed and Rafi. We watch the two women in particular: Satara sings with emotion and includes dance in her final performance, an action that puts her life in danger; Lema is traditional, but her very appearance brings death threats. The three finalists are from different tribes, and each makes a plea for Afghan unity. The camera visits families watching the competition, there are comments from people in the street, and we return home with a nervous Setara. In Afghanistan, singing is an expression of freedom.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["\"","Afghan","Star","\"","is","a","TV","show","model","on","the","UK","'s","\"","Pop","Idol",".","\"","We","join","the","2008","contest","when","it","'s","down","to","nine","contest",",","and","we","focus","on","two","women",",","Setara","and","Lema",",","and","two","men",",","Hame","and","Rafi",".","We","watch","the","two","women","in","particular",":","Satara","sing","with","emot","and","includ","danc","in","her","final","perform",",","an","action","that","put","her","life","in","danger",";","Lema","is","tradit",",","but","her","veri","appear","bring","death","threat",".","The","three","finalist","are","from","differ","tribe",",","and","each","make","a","plea","for","Afghan","uniti",".","The","camera","visit","famili","watch","the","competit",",","there","are","comment","from","peopl","in","the","street",",","and","we","return","home","with","a","nervous","Setara",".","In","Afghanistan",",","sing","is","an","express","of","freedom","."],"lemmas":["``","Afghan","Star","''","be","a","tv","show","model","on","the","UK","'s","``","Pop","Idol",".","''","we","join","the","2008","contest","when","it","be","down","to","nine","contestant",",","and","we","focus","on","two","woman",",","Setara","and","Lema",",","and","two","man",",","Hameed","and","Rafi",".","we","watch","the","two","woman","in","particular",":","Satara","sing","with","emotion","and","include","dance","in","she","final","performance",",","a","action","that","put","she","life","in","danger",";","Lema","be","traditional",",","but","she","very","appearance","bring","death","threat",".","the","three","finalist","be","from","different","tribe",",","and","each","make","a","plea","for","Afghan","unity",".","the","camera","visit","family","watch","the","competition",",","there","be","comment","from","people","in","the","street",",","and","we","return","home","with","a","nervous","Setara",".","in","Afghanistan",",","singing","be","a","expression","of","freedom","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" Afghan Star","Afghan Star \"","Star \" is","\" is a","is a TV","a TV show","TV show modeled","show modeled on","modeled on the","on the UK","the UK 's","UK 's \"","'s \" Pop","\" Pop Idol","Pop Idol .","Idol . \"","We join the","join the 2008","the 2008 contest","2008 contest when","contest when it","when it 's","it 's down","'s down to","down to nine","to nine contestants","nine contestants ,","contestants , and",", and we","and we focus","we focus on","focus on two","on two women","two women ,","women , Setara",", Setara and","Setara and Lema","and Lema ,","Lema , and",", and two","and two men","two men ,","men , Hameed",", Hameed and","Hameed and Rafi","We watch the","watch the two","the two women","two women in","women in particular","in particular :","particular : Satara",": Satara sings","Satara sings with","sings with emotion","with emotion and","emotion and includes","and includes dance","includes dance in","dance in her","in her final","her final performance","final performance ,","performance , an",", an action","an action that","action that puts","that puts her","puts her life","her life in","life in danger","in danger ;","danger ;

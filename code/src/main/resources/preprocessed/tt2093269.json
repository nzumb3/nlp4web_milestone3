{"title":"The Prophet's Son","plot":"THE PROPHET'S SON intertwines the lives of an internationally acclaimed young musician and a beautiful, young writer of equal popularity. While they discover their deep and abiding love for each other, they move powerfully in their faith and love for God and His people, boldly laying down their lives which are impacted through the teenage drama of school shootings and runaway youth, and in the aftermath of a nuclear hit on several large cities, including their own, in an attempted overthrow of the United States when the borders are opened after the election of a new, inexperienced president.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["THE","PROPHET","'S","SON","intertwin","the","live","of","an","intern","acclaim","young","musician","and","a","beauti",",","young","writer","of","equal","popular",".","While","they","discov","their","deep","and","abid","love","for","each","other",",","they","move","power","in","their","faith","and","love","for","God","and","His","peopl",",","bold","lay","down","their","live","which","are","impact","through","the","teenag","drama","of","school","shoot","and","runaway","youth",",","and","in","the","aftermath","of","a","nuclear","hit","on","sever","larg","citi",",","includ","their","own",",","in","an","attempt","overthrow","of","the","Unite","State","when","the","border","are","open","after","the","elect","of","a","new",",","inexperienc","presid","."],"lemmas":["the","PROPHET","'s","son","intertwine","the","life","of","a","internationally","acclaimed","young","musician","and","a","beautiful",",","young","writer","of","equal","popularity",".","while","they","discover","they","deep","and","abiding","love","for","each","other",",","they","move","powerfully","in","they","faith","and","love","for","God","and","he","people",",","boldly","lay","down","they","life","which","be","impact","through","the","teenage","drama","of","school","shooting","and","runaway","youth",",","and","in","the","aftermath","of","a","nuclear","hit","on","several","large","city",",","include","they","own",",","in","a","attempted","overthrow","of","the","United","States","when","the","border","be","open","after","the","election","of","a","new",",","inexperienced","president","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["THE

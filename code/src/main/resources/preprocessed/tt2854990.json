{"title":"The Last Vampyre on Earth","plot":"Fleeing a cataclysm of unimaginable origin, Catherine Murnau finds herself trapped in a nightmare while holed up in a crumbling warehouse where a cryptic classified \"human predator,\" has been accidentally set free. Catherine soon realizes that she is in fact not alone - coming face to face with the last Vampyre who is starving from being imprisoned in a weakened state for decades. Catherine begins to fear that she may have stumbled into her own tomb, but reaches within herself to engage with the creature learning more about human history than the world outside would dare to face, a truth so alarming and illusion shattering that it could only be told by the last Vampyre on Earth.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Flee","a","cataclysm","of","unimagin","origin",",","Catherin","Murnau","find","herself","trap","in","a","nightmar","while","hole","up","in","a","crumbl","warehous","where","a","cryptic","classifi","\"","human","predat",",","\"","has","been","accident","set","free",".","Catherin","soon","realiz","that","she","is","in","fact","not","alon","-","come","face","to","face","with","the","last","Vampyr","who","is","starv","from","be","imprison","in","a","weaken","state","for","decad",".","Catherin","begin","to","fear","that","she","may","have","stumbl","into","her","own","tomb",",","but","reach","within","herself","to","engag","with","the","creatur","learn","more","about","human","histori","than","the","world","outsid","would","dare","to","face",",","a","truth","so","alarm","and","illus","shatter","that","it","could","onli","be","told","by","the","last","Vampyr","on","Earth","."],"lemmas":["flee","a","cataclysm","of","unimaginable","origin",",","Catherine","Murnau","find","herself","trap","in","a","nightmare","while","hole","up","in","a","crumble","warehouse","where","a","cryptic","classified","``","human","predator",",","''","have","be","accidentally","set","free",".","Catherine","soon","realize","that","she","be","in","fact","not","alone","-","come","face","to","face","with","the","last","Vampyre","who","be","starve","from","be","imprison","in","a","weakened","state","for","decade",".","Catherine","begin","to","fear","that","she","may","have","stumble","into","she","own","tomb",",","but","reach","within","herself","to","engage","with","the","creature","learn","more","about","human","history","than","the","world","outside","would","dare","to","face",",","a","truth","so","alarming","and","illusion","shatter","that","it","could","only","be","tell","by","the","last","Vampyre","on","Earth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Fleeing a cataclysm","a cataclysm of","cataclysm of unimaginable","of unimaginable origin","unimaginable origin ,","origin , Catherine",", Catherine Murnau","Catherine Murnau finds","Murnau finds herself","finds herself trapped","herself trapped in","trapped in a","in a nightmare","a nightmare while","nightmare while holed","while holed up","holed up in","up in a","in a crumbling","a crumbling warehouse","crumbling warehouse where","warehouse where a","where a cryptic","a cryptic classified","cryptic classified \"","classified \" human","\" human predator","human predator ,","predator , \"",", \" has","\" has been","has been accidentally","been accidentally set","accidentally set free","Catherine soon realizes","soon realizes that","realizes that she","that she is","she is in","is in fact","in fact not","fact not alone","not alone -","alone -

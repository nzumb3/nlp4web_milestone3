{"title":"Unclaimed","plot":"Could an American MIA be struggling to find his way home? UNCLAIMED follows a war-torn Vietnam veteran in his quest to uncover the true identity of a man claiming to be a Special Forces soldier still living in Vietnam, decades after being declared Missing In Action. One soldier's true-life struggle to help another forms an emotional tale of lost identity, redemption, love and brotherhood beyond the battlefield. A deeply moving salute to the contributions and sacrifices made by all Vietnam veterans, this award-winning documentary offers a compelling and controversial reason to revive awareness of the POW/MIA discussion. Featuring Vietnam veteran Tom Faunce who served 27 months in-country with the 11th Armored Cavalry and gripping commentary by elite MACV-SOG members and their little-known participation in \"The Secret War\" over Laos make UNCLAIMED a must-see for veterans and history buffs of all generations.","genres":["Documentary","

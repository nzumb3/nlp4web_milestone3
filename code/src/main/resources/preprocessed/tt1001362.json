{"title":"Jerabek","plot":"JERABEK is an intimate portrait of one family that confronts the tragedy of war. Ryan Jerabek wanted to get out of Green Bay, Wisconsin, see the world and do something different. Moved by what happened on September 11th, the honor student and varsity athlete joined the Marines and left for boot camp weeks after his high school graduation. Nine months later, he was killed in Iraq. The film chronicles, over two years, the changes in the lives of his family. Beyond politics, headlines and statistics, JERABEK offers a candid, personal look at the toll one death takes.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["JERABEK","is","an","intim","portrait","of","one","famili","that","confront","the","tragedi","of","war",".","Ryan","Jerabek","want","to","get","out","of","Green","Bay",",","Wisconsin",",","see","the","world","and","do","someth","differ",".","Move","by","what","happen","on","Septemb","11th",",","the","honor","student","and","varsiti","athlet","join","the","Marin","and","left","for","boot","camp","week","after","his","high","school","graduat",".","Nine","month","later",",","he","was","kill","in","Iraq",".","The","film","chronicl",",","over","two","year",",","the","chang","in","the","live","of","his","famili",".","Beyond","polit",",","headlin","and","statist",",","JERABEK","offer","a","candid",",","person","look","at","the","toll","one","death","take","."],"lemmas":["JERABEK","be","a","intimate","portrait","of","one","family","that","confront","the","tragedy","of","war",".","Ryan","Jerabek","want","to","get","out","of","Green","Bay",",","Wisconsin",",","see","the","world","and","do","something","different",".","move","by","what","happen","on","September","11th",",","the","honor","student","and","varsity","athlete","join","the","Marines","and","leave","for","boot","camp","week","after","he","high","school","graduation",".","nine","month","later",",","he","be","kill","in","Iraq",".","the","film","chronicle",",","over","two","year",",","the","change","in","the","life","of","he","family",".","Beyond","politics",",","headline","and","statistics",",","JERABEK","offer","a","candid",",","personal","look","at","the","toll","one","death","take","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["JERABEK is an","is an intimate","an intimate portrait","intimate portrait of","portrait of one","of one family","one family that","family that confronts","that confronts the","confronts the tragedy","the tragedy of","tragedy of war","Ryan Jerabek wanted","Jerabek wanted to","wanted to get","to get out","get out of","out of Green","of Green Bay","Green Bay ,","Bay , Wisconsin",", Wisconsin ,","Wisconsin , see",", see the","see the world","the world and","world and do","and do something","do something different","Moved by what","by what happened","what happened on","happened on September","on September 11th","September 11th ,","11th , the",", the honor","the honor student","honor student and","student and varsity","and varsity athlete","varsity athlete joined","athlete joined the","joined the Marines","the Marines and","Marines and left","and left for","left for boot","for boot camp","boot camp weeks","camp weeks after","weeks after his","after his high","his high school","high school graduation","Nine months later","months later ,","later , he",", he was","he was killed","was killed in","killed in Iraq","The film chronicles","film chronicles ,","chronicles , over",", over two","over two years","two years ,","years , the",", the changes","the changes in","changes in the","in the lives","the lives of","lives of his","of his family","Beyond politics ,","politics , headlines",", headlines and","headlines and statistics","and statistics ,","statistics , JERABEK",", JERABEK offers","JERABEK offers a","offers a candid","a candid ,","candid , personal",", personal look","personal look at","look at the","at the toll","the toll one","toll one death","one death takes"],"2grams":["JERABEK is","is an","an intimate","intimate portrait","portrait of","of one","one family","family that","that confronts","confronts the","the tragedy","tragedy of","of war","Ryan Jerabek","Jerabek wanted","wanted to","to get","get out","out of","of Green","Green Bay","Bay ,",", Wisconsin","Wisconsin ,",", see","see the","the world","world and","and do","do something","something different","Moved by","by what","what happened","happened on","on September","September 11th","11th ,",", the","the honor","honor student","student and","and varsity","varsity athlete","athlete joined","joined the","the Marines","Marines and","and left","left for","for boot","boot camp","camp weeks","weeks after","after his","his high","high school","school graduation","Nine months","months later","later ,",", he","he was","was killed","killed in","in Iraq","The film","film chronicles","chronicles ,",", over","over two","two years","years ,",", the","the changes","changes in","in the","the lives","lives of","of his","his family","Beyond politics","politics ,",", headlines","headlines and","and statistics","statistics ,",", JERABEK","JERABEK offers","offers a","a candid","candid ,",", personal","personal look","look at","at the","the toll","toll one","one death","death takes"]}

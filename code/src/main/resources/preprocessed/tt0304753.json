{"title":"Still Looking for Morphine","plot":"Ricky rides her motorcycle among real and imagined dangers, to arrive unscathed, but unalterably changed, at the end of summer. The unrelenting wind of the season disrupts a landscape of inaction, theft and drug use. The end of innocence has already begun and a new path, dark and hopeful, stands waiting like the ships beyond her window. It will be an act of violence that thrusts the girl into womanhood and leads her to a new life where, not without pain, everything is possible.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ricki","ride","her","motorcycl","among","real","and","imagin","danger",",","to","arriv","unscath",",","but","unalter","chang",",","at","the","end","of","summer",".","The","unrel","wind","of","the","season","disrupt","a","landscap","of","inact",",","theft","and","drug","use",".","The","end","of","innoc","has","alreadi","begun","and","a","new","path",",","dark","and","hope",",","stand","wait","like","the","ship","beyond","her","window",".","It","will","be","an","act","of","violenc","that","thrust","the","girl","into","womanhood","and","lead","her","to","a","new","life","where",",","not","without","pain",",","everyth","is","possibl","."],"lemmas":["Ricky","ride","she","motorcycle","among","real","and","imagine","danger",",","to","arrive","unscathed",",","but","unalterably","change",",","at","the","end","of","summer",".","the","unrelenting","wind","of","the","season","disrupt","a","landscape","of","inaction",",","theft","and","drug","use",".","the","end","of","innocence","have","already","begin","and","a","new","path",",","dark","and","hopeful",",","stand","wait","like","the","ship","beyond","she","window",".","it","will","be","a","act","of","violence","that","thrust","the","girl","into","womanhood","and","lead","she","to","a","new","life","where",",","not","without","pain",",","everything","be","possible","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Ricky rides her","rides her motorcycle","her motorcycle among","motorcycle among real","among real and","real and imagined","and imagined dangers","imagined dangers ,","dangers , to",", to arrive","to arrive unscathed","arrive unscathed ,","unscathed , but",", but unalterably","but unalterably changed","unalterably changed ,","changed , at",", at the","at the end","the end of","end of summer","The unrelenting wind","unrelenting wind of","wind of the","of the season","the season disrupts","season disrupts a","disrupts a landscape","a landscape of","landscape of inaction","of inaction ,","inaction , theft",", theft and","theft and drug","and drug use","The end of","end of innocence","of innocence has","innocence has already","has already begun","already begun and","begun and a","and a new","a new path","new path ,","path , dark",", dark and","dark and hopeful","and hopeful ,","hopeful , stands",", stands waiting","stands waiting like","waiting like the","like the ships","the ships beyond","ships beyond her","beyond her window","It will be","will be an","be an act","an act of","act of violence","of violence that","violence that thrusts","that thrusts the","thrusts the girl","the girl into","girl into womanhood","into womanhood and","womanhood and leads","and leads her","leads her to","her to a","to a new","a new life","new life where","life where ,","where , not",", not without","not without pain","without pain ,","pain , everything",", everything is","everything is possible"],"2grams":["Ricky rides","rides her","her motorcycle","motorcycle among","among real","real and","and imagined","imagined dangers","dangers ,",", to","to arrive","arrive unscathed","unscathed ,",", but","but unalterably","unalterably changed","changed ,",", at","at the","the end","end of","of summer","The unrelenting","unrelenting wind","wind of","of the","the season","season disrupts","disrupts a","a landscape","landscape of","of inaction","inaction ,",", theft","theft and","and drug","drug use","The end","end of","of innocence","innocence has","has already","already begun","begun and","and a","a new","new path","path ,",", dark","dark and","and hopeful","hopeful ,",", stands","stands waiting","waiting like","like the","the ships","ships beyond","beyond her","her window","It will","will be","be an","an act","act of","of violence","violence that","that thrusts","thrusts the","the girl","girl into","into womanhood","womanhood and","and leads","leads her","her to","to a","a new","new life","life where","where ,",", not","not without","without pain","pain ,",", everything","everything is","is possible"]}

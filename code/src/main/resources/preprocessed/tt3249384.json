{"title":"Asphalt Serenade","plot":"ASPHALT SERENADE is a road trip video scrapbook mash-up tale through the American cultural and physical landscape, created using a 'Vusician' writing process by which a narrative film is conceived through the simultaneous interplay of image, sound and music treated as one creative medium to tell a film story. Using original and found media with original music, the film stars Jimmy Rollins, a boyscout headed to Washington, D.C., and whose journey is culled from a late 1950s Greyhound promotional film as he travels across the country. It also features a housewife musing on personal and socio-cultural issues from found 1960 'talking letter' recordings. This film is the basis for future versions edited and scored live as an interpretation/copy of the original film.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama","

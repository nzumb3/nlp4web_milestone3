{"title":"The Children Send Their Regards","plot":"Pupils, wards, acolytes and foster children: all were sexually abused by members of the clergy. Visiting the scenes of past abuse, accounts emerge of a despicable abuse of power. Coming to terms with these events, and discovering obstructions to holding those responsible to account, the painful legacy of their stories persists to the present day. A hugely creative film, which achieves a rare immersion into the tortured worlds of its characters.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Pupil",",","ward",",","acolyt","and","foster","children",":","all","were","sexual","abus","by","member","of","the","clergi",".","Visit","the","scene","of","past","abus",",","account","emerg","of","a","despic","abus","of","power",".","Come","to","term","with","these","event",",","and","discov","obstruct","to","hold","those","respons","to","account",",","the","pain","legaci","of","their","stori","persist","to","the","present","day",".","A","huge","creativ","film",",","which","achiev","a","rare","immers","into","the","tortur","world","of","it","charact","."],"lemmas":["pupil",",","ward",",","acolyte","and","foster","child",":","all","be","sexually","abuse","by","member","of","the","clergy",".","visit","the","scene","of","past","abuse",",","account","emerge","of","a","despicable","abuse","of","power",".","come","to","term","with","these","event",",","and","discover","obstruction","to","hold","those","responsible","to","account",",","the","painful","legacy","of","they","story","persist","to","the","present","day",".","a","hugely","creative","film",",","which","achieve","a","rare","immersion","into","the","tortured","world","of","its","character","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Pupils , wards",", wards ,","wards , acolytes",", acolytes and","acolytes and foster","and foster children","foster children :","children : all",": all were","all were sexually","were sexually abused","sexually abused by","abused by members","by members of","members of the","of the clergy","Visiting the scenes","the scenes of","scenes of past","of past abuse","past abuse ,","abuse , accounts",", accounts emerge","accounts emerge of","emerge of a","of a despicable","a despicable abuse","despicable abuse of","abuse of power","Coming to terms","to terms with","terms with these","with these events","these events ,","events , and",", and discovering","and discovering obstructions","discovering obstructions to","obstructions to holding","to holding those","holding those responsible","those responsible to","responsible to account","to account ,","account , the",", the painful","the painful legacy","painful legacy of","legacy of their","of their stories","their stories persists","stories persists to","persists to the","to the present","the present day","A hugely creative","hugely creative film","creative film ,","film , which",", which achieves","which achieves a","achieves a rare","a rare immersion","rare immersion into","immersion into the","into the tortured","the tortured worlds","tortured worlds of","worlds of its","of its characters"],"2grams":["Pupils ,",", wards","wards ,",", acolytes","acolytes and","and foster","foster children","children :",": all","all were","were sexually","sexually abused","abused by","by members","members of","of the","the clergy","Visiting the","the scenes","scenes of","of past","past abuse","abuse ,",", accounts","accounts emerge","emerge of","of a","a despicable","despicable abuse","abuse of","of power","Coming to","to terms","terms with","with these","these events","events ,",", and","and discovering","discovering obstructions","obstructions to","to holding","holding those","those responsible","responsible to","to account","account ,",", the","the painful","painful legacy","legacy of","of their","their stories","stories persists","persists to","to the","the present","present day","A hugely","hugely creative","creative film","film ,",", which","which achieves","achieves a","a rare","rare immersion","immersion into","into the","the tortured","tortured worlds","worlds of","of its","its characters"]}

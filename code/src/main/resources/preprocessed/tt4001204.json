{"title":"La Zona Grigia","plot":"The Grey zone is not only a geographical spot, it is also a mental state. It is a choice, an attitude, a paradox. It is the apology of sloth. In this case, it is also the destination of a backwards journey for its protagonists. From Italy to Poland, on a train, destination: Krakow. From the heart of the city, where art and culture merge, to Auschwitz, stage of one of the biggest tragedies of the modern era. The stance of a young group, led by young people, towards Holocaust. For a different future, maybe a better one, without grey zones in the civil awareness nor tolerance for the banality of evil.","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"Great Heights","plot":"Paul and Gwen have never met when they are awake, but in their sleep they have been trapped in a room together for the past two weeks. In these dreams, both of them find a comfortable confidence in themselves that they don't have in the conscious world. They find themselves growing more and more distant from their real life relationships and obsessed with their dream world. The attraction to one another is reaching an uncontrollable peak that they may never be able to return from.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Paul","and","Gwen","have","never","met","when","they","are","awak",",","but","in","their","sleep","they","have","been","trap","in","a","room","togeth","for","the","past","two","week",".","In","these","dream",",","both","of","them","find","a","comfort","confid","in","themselv","that","they","do","n't","have","in","the","conscious","world",".","They","find","themselv","grow","more","and","more","distant","from","their","real","life","relationship","and","obsess","with","their","dream","world",".","The","attract","to","one","anoth","is","reach","an","uncontrol","peak","that","they","may","never","be","abl","to","return","from","."],"lemmas":["Paul","and","Gwen","have","never","meet","when","they","be","awake",",","but","in","they","sleep","they","have","be","trap","in","a","room","together","for","the","past","two","week",".","in","these","dream",",","both","of","they","find","a","comfortable","confidence","in","themselves","that","they","do","not","have","in","the","conscious","world",".","they","find","themselves","grow","more","and","more","distant","from","they","real","life","relationship","and","obsess","with","they","dream","world",".","the","attraction","to","one","another","be","reach","a","uncontrollable","peak","that","they","may","never","be","able","to","return","from","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Paul and Gwen","and Gwen have","Gwen have never","have never met","never met when","met when they","when they are","they are awake","are awake ,","awake , but",", but in","but in their","in their sleep","their sleep they","sleep they have","they have been","have been trapped","been trapped in","trapped in a","in a room","a room together","room together for","together for the","for the past","the past two","past two weeks","In these dreams","these dreams ,","dreams , both",", both of","both of them","of them find","them find a","find a comfortable","a comfortable confidence","comfortable confidence in","confidence in themselves","in themselves that","themselves that they","that they do","they do n't","do n't have","n't have in","have in the","in the conscious","the conscious world","They find themselves","find themselves growing","themselves growing more","growing more and","more and more","and more distant","more distant from","distant from their","from their real","their real life","real life relationships","life relationships and","relationships and obsessed","and obsessed with","obsessed with their","with their dream","their dream world","The attraction to","attraction to one","to one another","one another is","another is reaching","is reaching an","reaching an uncontrollable","an uncontrollable peak","uncontrollable peak that","peak that they","that they may","they may never","may never be","never be able","be able to","able to return","to return from"],"2grams":["Paul and","and Gwen","Gwen have","have never","never met","met when","when they","they are","are awake","awake ,",", but","but in","in their","their sleep","sleep they","they have","have been","been trapped","trapped in","in a","a room","room together","together for","for the","the past","past two","two weeks","In these","these dreams","dreams ,",", both","both of","of them","them find","find a","a comfortable","comfortable confidence","confidence in","in themselves","themselves that","that they","they do","do n't","n't have","have in","in the","the conscious","conscious world","They find","find themselves","themselves growing","growing more","more and","and more","more distant","distant from","from their","their real","real life","life relationships","relationships and","and obsessed","obsessed with","with their","their dream","dream world","The attraction","attraction to","to one","one another","another is","is reaching","reaching an","an uncontrollable","uncontrollable peak","peak that","that they","they may","may never","never be","be able","able to","to return","return from"]}

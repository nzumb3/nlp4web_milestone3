{"title":"Time Bombs","plot":"In the spring of 1957 at the height of the Cold War, 40 young Canadian soldiers were sent to Nevada on a top secret mission - to serve as guinea pigs for the military in a nuclear test field. They played war games less than 1,000 meters away from detonated test bombs four times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima. Several veterans fell victim to radiation, and children were born with birth defects. Today, 50 years after being exposed to dangerous nuclear radiation, the few soldiers who survived are fighting for justice. And Ottawa is trying to bury the affair. In this real-life thriller, we follow Jim Huntley, the only veteran still in good health, as he puts his case to the government and confronts the politicians who are trying to dampen their efforts. As the controversy gains media attention, will policy makers listen to the plights of these veterans?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","spring","of","1957","at","the","height","of","the","Cold","War",",","40","young","Canadian","soldier","were","sent","to","Nevada","on","a","top","secret","mission","-","to","serv","as","guinea","pig","for","the","militari","in","a","nuclear","test","field",".","They","play","war","game","less","than","1,000","meter","away","from","deton","test","bomb","four","time","more","power","than","the","one","drop","on","Hiroshima",".","Sever","veteran","fell","victim","to","radiat",",","and","children","were","born","with","birth","defect",".","Today",",","50","year","after","be","expos","to","danger","nuclear","radiat",",","the","few","soldier","who","surviv","are","fight","for","justic",".","And","Ottawa","is","tri","to","buri","the","affair",".","In","this","real-lif","thriller",",","we","follow","Jim","Huntley",",","the","onli","veteran","still","in","good","health",",","as","he","put","his","case","to","the","govern","and","confront","the","politician","who","are","tri","to","dampen","their","effort",".","As","the","controversi","gain","media","attent",",","will","polici","maker","listen","to","the","plight","of","these","veteran","?"],"lemmas":["in","the","spring","of","1957","at","the","height","of","the","Cold","War",",","40","young","canadian","soldier","be","send","to","Nevada","on","a","top","secret","mission","-","to","serve","as","guinea","pig","for","the","military","in","a","nuclear","test","field",".","they","play","war","game","less","than","1,000","meter","away","from","detonate","test","bomb","four","time","more","powerful","than","the","one","drop","on","Hiroshima",".","several","veteran","fall","victim","to","radiation",",","and","child","be","bear","with","birth","defect",".","today",",","50","year","after","be","expose","to","dangerous","nuclear","radiation",",","the","few","soldier","who","survive","be","fight","for","justice",".","and","Ottawa","be","try","to","bury","the","affair",".","in","this","real-life","thriller",",","we","follow","Jim","Huntley",",","the","only","veteran","still","in","good","health",",","as","he","put","he","case","to","the","government","and","confront","the","politician","who","be","try","to","dampen","they","effort",".","as","the","controversy","gain","media","attention",",","will","policy","maker","listen","to","the","plight","of","these","veteran","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the spring","the spring of","spring of 1957","of 1957 at","1957 at the","at the height","the height of","height of the","of the Cold","the Cold War","Cold War ,","War , 40",", 40 young","40 young Canadian","young Canadian soldiers","Canadian soldiers were","soldiers were sent","were sent to","sent to Nevada","to Nevada on","Nevada on a","on a top","a top secret","top secret mission","secret mission -","mission -

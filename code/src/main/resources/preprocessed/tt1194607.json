{"title":"The Ghost","plot":"In Moscow, Anton is out of ideas for his \"Ghost\" novels about a hit man, based on old news accounts. At a book signing, a man buys Anton's latest; then, on a street below, Anton sees the man murder a witness in an upcoming trial. Days later, the killer chats up Anton at a café, offering ideas for plots. Anton accepts and his writing improves. Meanwhile, he has a troubled relationship with Mika: she's forgiving, but his drinking and late-night writing sessions drive her away. Plus, he spends precious little time with his son, who's in an institution. Slowly, the hit man raises the ante with Anton: how far will a writer go to understand his fictional character?","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["In","Moscow",",","Anton","is","out","of","idea","for","his","\"","Ghost","\"","novel","about","a","hit","man",",","base","on","old","news","account",".","At","a","book","sign",",","a","man","buy","Anton","'s","latest",";","then",",","on","a","street","below",",","Anton","see","the","man","murder","a","wit","in","an","upcom","trial",".","Day","later",",","the","killer","chat","up","Anton","at","a","café",",","offer","idea","for","plot",".","Anton","accept","and","his","write","improv",".","Meanwhil",",","he","has","a","troubl","relationship","with","Mika",":","she","'s","forgiv",",","but","his","drink","and","late-night","write","session","drive","her","away",".","Plus",",","he","spend","precious","littl","time","with","his","son",",","who","'s","in","an","institut",".","Slowli",",","the","hit","man","rais","the","ant","with","Anton",":","how","far","will","a","writer","go","to","understand","his","fiction","charact","?"],"lemmas":["in","Moscow",",","Anton","be","out","of","idea","for","he","``","ghost","''","novel","about","a","hit","man",",","base","on","old","news","account",".","at","a","book","signing",",","a","man","buy","Anton","'s","latest",";","then",",","on","a","street","below",",","Anton","see","the","man","murder","a","witness","in","a","upcoming","trial",".","day","later",",","the","killer","chat","up","Anton","at","a","café",",","offer","idea","for","plot",".","Anton","accept","and","he","writing","improve",".","meanwhile",",","he","have","a","troubled","relationship","with","Mika",":","she","be","forgiving",",","but","he","drinking","and","late-night","writing","session","drive","she","away",".","Plus",",","he","spend","precious","little","time","with","he","son",",","who","be","in","a","institution",".","slowly",",","the","hit","man","raise","the","ante","with","Anton",":","how","far","will","a","writer","go","to","understand","he","fictional","character","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Moscow ,","Moscow , Anton",", Anton is","Anton is out","is out of","out of ideas","of ideas for","ideas for his","for his \"","his \" Ghost","\" Ghost \"","Ghost \" novels","\" novels about","novels about a","about a hit","a hit man","hit man ,","man , based",", based on","based on old","on old news","old news accounts","At a book","a book signing","book signing ,","signing , a",", a man","a man buys","man buys Anton","buys Anton 's","Anton 's latest","'s latest ;","latest ;

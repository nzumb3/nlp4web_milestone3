{"title":"More Than Dreams","plot":"The portrait of a hopeless youth, ready to try any experience, however extreme, to find its limits at any cost. Sean, a young actor with no prospects, is at a turning point in his life. Hardly managing to scrape by in London, he struggles to maintain his relationship with girlfriend Claudia, due to spending too much time with his dope dealer friend, Nico. As he sees his own dreams go up in smoke ; Sean finds it increasingly difficult to deal with the success of his flatmate and friend Peter. When Peter then decides to seduce Claudia, it is the end of Sean's little world. Thanks to his mother, he escapes his nightmare in London by embarking on a trip to Geneva (Switzerland). He stays there with his cousin Marc, whose wayward life-style proves to be as problematic and fatal as his own. Once back in London, Sean is given hope by the presence of his father who has made a comeback in his life, with the intention to repair the damages caused by his former absences and hopefully restore some balance and happiness in his son's life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","portrait","of","a","hopeless","youth",",","readi","to","tri","ani","experi",",","howev","extrem",",","to","find","it","limit","at","ani","cost",".","Sean",",","a","young","actor","with","no","prospect",",","is","at","a","turn","point","in","his","life",".","Hard","manag","to","scrape","by","in","London",",","he","struggl","to","maintain","his","relationship","with","girlfriend","Claudia",",","due","to","spend","too","much","time","with","his","dope","dealer","friend",",","Nico",".","As","he","see","his","own","dream","go","up","in","smoke",";","Sean","find","it","increas","difficult","to","deal","with","the","success","of","his","flatmat","and","friend","Peter",".","When","Peter","then","decid","to","seduc","Claudia",",","it","is","the","end","of","Sean","'s","littl","world",".","Thank","to","his","mother",",","he","escap","his","nightmar","in","London","by","embark","on","a","trip","to","Geneva","(","Switzerland",")",".","He","stay","there","with","his","cousin","Marc",",","whose","wayward","life-styl","prove","to","be","as","problemat","and","fatal","as","his","own",".","Once","back","in","London",",","Sean","is","given","hope","by","the","presenc","of","his","father","who","has","made","a","comeback","in","his","life",",","with","the","intent","to","repair","the","damag","caus","by","his","former","absenc","and","hope","restor","some","balanc","and","happi","in","his","son","'s","life","."],"lemmas":["the","portrait","of","a","hopeless","youth",",","ready","to","try","any","experience",",","however","extreme",",","to","find","its","limit","at","any","cost",".","Sean",",","a","young","actor","with","no","prospects",",","be","at","a","turning","point","in","he","life",".","hardly","manage","to","scrape","by","in","London",",","he","struggle","to","maintain","he","relationship","with","girlfriend","Claudia",",","due","to","spend","too","much","time","with","he","dope","dealer","friend",",","Nico",".","as","he","see","he","own","dream","go","up","in","smoke",";","Sean","find","it","increasingly","difficult","to","deal","with","the","success","of","he","flatmate","and","friend","Peter",".","when","Peter","then","decide","to","seduce","Claudia",",","it","be","the","end","of","Sean","'s","little","world",".","thanks","to","he","mother",",","he","escape","he","nightmare","in","London","by","embark","on","a","trip","to","Geneva","-lrb-","Switzerland","-rrb-",".","he","stay","there","with","he","cousin","Marc",",","whose","wayward","life-style","prove","to","be","as","problematic","and","fatal","as","he","own",".","once","back","in","London",",","Sean","be","give","hope","by","the","presence","of","he","father","who","have","make","a","comeback","in","he","life",",","with","the","intention","to","repair","the","damages","cause","by","he","former","absence","and","hopefully","restore","some","balance","and","happiness","in","he","son","'s","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The portrait of","portrait of a","of a hopeless","a hopeless youth","hopeless youth ,","youth , ready",", ready to","ready to try","to try any","try any experience","any experience ,","experience , however",", however extreme","however extreme ,","extreme , to",", to find","to find its","find its limits","its limits at","limits at any","at any cost","Sean , a",", a young","a young actor","young actor with","actor with no","with no prospects","no prospects ,","prospects , is",", is at","is at a","at a turning","a turning point","turning point in","point in his","in his life","Hardly managing to","managing to scrape","to scrape by","scrape by in","by in London","in London ,","London , he",", he struggles","he struggles to","struggles to maintain","to maintain his","maintain his relationship","his relationship with","relationship with girlfriend","with girlfriend Claudia","girlfriend Claudia ,","Claudia , due",", due to","due to spending","to spending too","spending too much","too much time","much time with","time with his","with his dope","his dope dealer","dope dealer friend","dealer friend ,","friend , Nico","As he sees","he sees his","sees his own","his own dreams","own dreams go","dreams go up","go up in","up in smoke","in smoke ;","smoke ;

{"title":"American Buffalo","plot":"AMERICAN BUFFALO is another story of men's interminable struggle toward the top of the heap, a goal which ultimately and inevitably eludes most of us. Don Dubro, the proprietor of a dusty dark inner-city junk shop, holds court there with his friends and makes plans probably on a daily basis for his ascendancy to the top. He does this more out of habit than hope because he's long ago surrendered his future to the daily repetition of his life as guardian of the discarded remnants of others' possessions. Disheveled Teach, on the other hand, is either too dumb or too stubborn to accept the lot life has dealt him. Instead, he bucks like a wild horse under the saddle and refuses to be broken. Most pitiable of the trio which populates the movie is teen-aged Bobby. Mistaking much of the palaver which passes between the older men as pearls of wisdom, Bobby is the only one of the trio who still has a chance to make a life for himself somewhere beyond this tired too-familiar neighborhood. Don seems to recognize, early in their heist scheme, that exposing Bobby to his desperation can only drag the kid down. Teach imposes himself into Bobby and Don's plan to swipe some pricey coins from one of Don's customers. Don's plan to send Bobby in after the coin is too risky, Teach says. The truth is simpler. Teach doesn't want his cut to be too small.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["AMERICAN","BUFFALO","is","anoth","stori","of","men","'s","intermin","struggl","toward","the","top","of","the","heap",",","a","goal","which","ultim","and","inevit","elud","most","of","us",".","Don","Dubro",",","the","proprietor","of","a","dusti","dark","inner-c","junk","shop",",","hold","court","there","with","his","friend","and","make","plan","probabl","on","a","daili","basi","for","his","ascend","to","the","top",".","He","doe","this","more","out","of","habit","than","hope","becaus","he","'s","long","ago","surrend","his","futur","to","the","daili","repetit","of","his","life","as","guardian","of","the","discard","remnant","of","other","'","possess",".","Dishevel","Teach",",","on","the","other","hand",",","is","either","too","dumb","or","too","stubborn","to","accept","the","lot","life","has","dealt","him",".","Instead",",","he","buck","like","a","wild","hors","under","the","saddl","and","refus","to","be","broken",".","Most","pitiabl","of","the","trio","which","popul","the","movi","is","teen-ag","Bobbi",".","Mistak","much","of","the","palav","which","pass","between","the","older","men","as","pearl","of","wisdom",",","Bobbi","is","the","onli","one","of","the","trio","who","still","has","a","chanc","to","make","a","life","for","himself","somewher","beyond","this","tire","too-familiar","neighborhood",".","Don","seem","to","recogn",",","earli","in","their","heist","scheme",",","that","expos","Bobbi","to","his","desper","can","onli","drag","the","kid","down",".","Teach","impos","himself","into","Bobbi","and","Don","'s","plan","to","swipe","some","pricey","coin","from","one","of","Don","'s","custom",".","Don","'s","plan","to","send","Bobbi","in","after","the","coin","is","too","riski",",","Teach","say",".","The","truth","is","simpler",".","Teach","doe","n't","want","his","cut","to","be","too","small","."],"lemmas":["AMERICAN","BUFFALO","be","another","story","of","man","'s","interminable","struggle","toward","the","top","of","the","heap",",","a","goal","which","ultimately","and","inevitably","elude","most","of","we",".","Don","Dubro",",","the","proprietor","of","a","dusty","dark","inner-city","junk","shop",",","hold","court","there","with","he","friend","and","make","plan","probably","on","a","daily","basis","for","he","ascendancy","to","the","top",".","he","do","this","more","out","of","habit","than","hope","because","he","be","long","ago","surrender","he","future","to","the","daily","repetition","of","he","life","as","guardian","of","the","discard","remnant","of","other","'","possession",".","disheveled","teach",",","on","the","other","hand",",","be","either","too","dumb","or","too","stubborn","to","accept","the","lot","life","have","deal","he",".","instead",",","he","buck","like","a","wild","horse","under","the","saddle","and","refuse","to","be","break",".","most","pitiable","of","the","trio","which","populate","the","movie","be","teen-aged","Bobby",".","mistake","much","of","the","palaver","which","pass","between","the","older","man","as","pearl","of","wisdom",",","Bobby","be","the","only","one","of","the","trio","who","still","have","a","chance","to","make","a","life","for","himself","somewhere","beyond","this","tired","too-familiar","neighborhood",".","Don","seem","to","recognize",",","early","in","they","heist","scheme",",","that","expose","Bobby","to","he","desperation","can","only","drag","the","kid","down",".","Teach","impose","himself","into","Bobby","and","Don","'s","plan","to","swipe","some","pricey","coin","from","one","of","Don","'s","customer",".","Don","'s","plan","to","send","Bobby","in","after","the","coin","be","too","risky",",","Teach","say",".","the","truth","be","simpler",".","Teach","do","not","want","he","cut","to","be","too","small","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["AMERICAN

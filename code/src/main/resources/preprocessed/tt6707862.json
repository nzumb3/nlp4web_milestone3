{"title":"Sonica Sequence","plot":"The concept of the sessions are to create unexpected and open musical situations interacting with the public space and a spontaneous audience. The musicians do not rehearse in advance and the sessions are not announced to a public audience - it just takes place. All to create the best conditions for a musical meeting free from expectations and as present in the moment as possible. The sessions will be recorded and filmed in high quality and will be part of a documentary film and released as an album including all of the international sessions in the Sonica Sequence. The Sonica Sequence is an ongoing project where musician and composer Lisa Nordström meet international musicians for an improvised site specific sessions in Cuba, Indonesia, Japan and Sweden.","genres":["Music"],"stems":["The","concept","of","the","session","are","to","creat","unexpect","and","open","music","situat","interact","with","the","public","space","and","a","spontan","audienc",".","The","musician","do","not","rehears","in","advanc","and","the","session","are","not","announc","to","a","public","audienc","-","it","just","take","place",".","All","to","creat","the","best","condit","for","a","music","meet","free","from","expect","and","as","present","in","the","moment","as","possibl",".","The","session","will","be","record","and","film","in","high","qualiti","and","will","be","part","of","a","documentari","film","and","releas","as","an","album","includ","all","of","the","intern","session","in","the","Sonica","Sequenc",".","The","Sonica","Sequenc","is","an","ongo","project","where","musician","and","compos","Lisa","Nordström","meet","intern","musician","for","an","improvis","site","specif","session","in","Cuba",",","Indonesia",",","Japan","and","Sweden","."],"lemmas":["the","concept","of","the","session","be","to","create","unexpected","and","open","musical","situation","interact","with","the","public","space","and","a","spontaneous","audience",".","the","musician","do","not","rehearse","in","advance","and","the","session","be","not","announce","to","a","public","audience","-","it","just","take","place",".","all","to","create","the","best","condition","for","a","musical","meeting","free","from","expectation","and","as","present","in","the","moment","as","possible",".","the","session","will","be","record","and","film","in","high","quality","and","will","be","part","of","a","documentary","film","and","release","as","a","album","include","all","of","the","international","session","in","the","Sonica","sequence",".","the","Sonica","sequence","be","a","ongoing","project","where","musician","and","composer","Lisa","Nordström","meet","international","musician","for","a","improvise","site","specific","session","in","Cuba",",","Indonesia",",","Japan","and","Sweden","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The concept of","concept of the","of the sessions","the sessions are","sessions are to","are to create","to create unexpected","create unexpected and","unexpected and open","and open musical","open musical situations","musical situations interacting","situations interacting with","interacting with the","with the public","the public space","public space and","space and a","and a spontaneous","a spontaneous audience","The musicians do","musicians do not","do not rehearse","not rehearse in","rehearse in advance","in advance and","advance and the","and the sessions","the sessions are","sessions are not","are not announced","not announced to","announced to a","to a public","a public audience","public audience -","audience -

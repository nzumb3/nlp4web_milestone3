{"title":"Bert & Dickie","plot":"In 1948 a London beset by rationing and austerity measures has six weeks to go before the first Olympic Games after the war. With athletes having to supply their own kit the Labour government is desperately hoping the games will attract foreign tourists and their money. Working class Bert Bushnell is anxious for selection in the single sculls event and is upset when former Olympian medallist and innovative organizer Jack Beresford pairs him with journalist Dickie Burnell, whose privileged background he despises. Their initial poor performance sees them at odds but, after Bert has convinced Dickie that their boat needs alterations, their prowess and mutual respect increases. On the eve of the games a nervous Dickie is given confidence by Bert's father and applies a little of his own cunning to ensure a path to the finals. Ultimately Bert also seeks Dickie's father's reassurance, both elders having a secret of their own, and the pair go on to beat the favoured Danish duo and win Olympic gold.","genres":["Biography","

{"title":"About Scout","plot":"A quirky, coming-of-age dramedy about Scout, a rebellious, slightly bad-ass fifteen-year-old girl from the wrong side of the tracks who convinces a wealthy suicidal mental patient to go on a road trip with her across West Texas to track down her little sister who's been taken by the father who abandoned them. At its heart this is a story about family and how two unlikely misfits come together to create their own family.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["A","quirki",",","coming-of-ag","dramedi","about","Scout",",","a","rebelli",",","slight","bad-ass","fifteen-year-old","girl","from","the","wrong","side","of","the","track","who","convinc","a","wealthi","suicid","mental","patient","to","go","on","a","road","trip","with","her","across","West","Texa","to","track","down","her","littl","sister","who","'s","been","taken","by","the","father","who","abandon","them",".","At","it","heart","this","is","a","stori","about","famili","and","how","two","unlik","misfit","come","togeth","to","creat","their","own","famili","."],"lemmas":["a","quirky",",","coming-of-age","dramedy","about","Scout",",","a","rebellious",",","slightly","bad-ass","fifteen-year-old","girl","from","the","wrong","side","of","the","track","who","convince","a","wealthy","suicidal","mental","patient","to","go","on","a","road","trip","with","she","across","West","Texas","to","track","down","she","little","sister","who","be","be","take","by","the","father","who","abandon","they",".","at","its","heart","this","be","a","story","about","family","and","how","two","unlikely","misfit","come","together","to","create","they","own","family","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A quirky ,","quirky , coming-of-age",", coming-of-age dramedy","coming-of-age dramedy about","dramedy about Scout","about Scout ,","Scout , a",", a rebellious","a rebellious ,","rebellious , slightly",", slightly bad-ass","slightly bad-ass fifteen-year-old","bad-ass fifteen-year-old girl","fifteen-year-old girl from","girl from the","from the wrong","the wrong side","wrong side of","side of the","of the tracks","the tracks who","tracks who convinces","who convinces a","convinces a wealthy","a wealthy suicidal","wealthy suicidal mental","suicidal mental patient","mental patient to","patient to go","to go on","go on a","on a road","a road trip","road trip with","trip with her","with her across","her across West","across West Texas","West Texas to","Texas to track","to track down","track down her","down her little","her little sister","little sister who","sister who 's","who 's been","'s been taken","been taken by","taken by the","by the father","the father who","father who abandoned","who abandoned them","At its heart","its heart this","heart this is","this is a","is a story","a story about","story about family","about family and","family and how","and how two","how two unlikely","two unlikely misfits","unlikely misfits come","misfits come together","come together to","together to create","to create their","create their own","their own family"],"2grams":["A quirky","quirky ,",", coming-of-age","coming-of-age dramedy","dramedy about","about Scout","Scout ,",", a","a rebellious","rebellious ,",", slightly","slightly bad-ass","bad-ass fifteen-year-old","fifteen-year-old girl","girl from","from the","the wrong","wrong side","side of","of the","the tracks","tracks who","who convinces","convinces a","a wealthy","wealthy suicidal","suicidal mental","mental patient","patient to","to go","go on","on a","a road","road trip","trip with","with her","her across","across West","West Texas","Texas to","to track","track down","down her","her little","little sister","sister who","who 's","'s been","been taken","taken by","by the","the father","father who","who abandoned","abandoned them","At its","its heart","heart this","this is","is a","a story","story about","about family","family and","and how","how two","two unlikely","unlikely misfits","misfits come","come together","together to","to create","create their","their own","own family"]}

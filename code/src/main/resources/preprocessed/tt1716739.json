{"title":"Dead in France","plot":"Socially-challenged hitman Charles lives in Cannes and wants to retire with a yacht and a woman in tow. He has no experience with either until he lets his cleaning lady (delectable Essex-girl Lisa) into his life, but he doesn't bank on her vile boyfriend Denny or con-artists Simon and Ray stealing a two million quid nest egg from the boot of his car. Charles hunts them down across the Cote d'Azur whilst pursued by his rival Clancy who is incensed by the fact that Charles might actually be retiring.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"," Crime"],"stems":["Socially-challeng","hitman","Charl","live","in","Cann","and","want","to","retir","with","a","yacht","and","a","woman","in","tow",".","He","has","no","experi","with","either","until","he","let","his","clean","ladi","(","delect","Essex-girl","Lisa",")","into","his","life",",","but","he","doe","n't","bank","on","her","vile","boyfriend","Denni","or","con-artist","Simon","and","Ray","steal","a","two","million","quid","nest","egg","from","the","boot","of","his","car",".","Charl","hunt","them","down","across","the","Cote","d'Azur","whilst","pursu","by","his","rival","Clanci","who","is","incens","by","the","fact","that","Charl","might","actual","be","retir","."],"lemmas":["socially-challenged","hitman","Charles","live","in","Cannes","and","want","to","retire","with","a","yacht","and","a","woman","in","tow",".","he","have","no","experience","with","either","until","he","let","he","cleaning","lady","-lrb-","delectable","essex-girl","Lisa","-rrb-","into","he","life",",","but","he","do","not","bank","on","she","vile","boyfriend","Denny","or","con-artist","Simon","and","Ray","steal","a","two","million","quid","nest","egg","from","the","boot","of","he","car",".","Charles","hunt","they","down","across","the","Cote","d'azur","whilst","pursue","by","he","rival","Clancy","who","be","incense","by","the","fact","that","Charles","might","actually","be","retire","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Socially-challenged hitman Charles","hitman Charles lives","Charles lives in","lives in Cannes","in Cannes and","Cannes and wants","and wants to","wants to retire","to retire with","retire with a","with a yacht","a yacht and","yacht and a","and a woman","a woman in","woman in tow","He has no","has no experience","no experience with","experience with either","with either until","either until he","until he lets","he lets his","lets his cleaning","his cleaning lady","cleaning lady (","lady ( delectable","( delectable Essex-girl","delectable Essex-girl Lisa","Essex-girl Lisa )","Lisa ) into",") into his","into his life","his life ,","life , but",", but he","but he does","he does n't","does n't bank","n't bank on","bank on her","on her vile","her vile boyfriend","vile boyfriend Denny","boyfriend Denny or","Denny or con-artists","or con-artists Simon","con-artists Simon and","Simon and Ray","and Ray stealing","Ray stealing a","stealing a two","a two million","two million quid","million quid nest","quid nest egg","nest egg from","egg from the","from the boot","the boot of","boot of his","of his car","Charles hunts them","hunts them down","them down across","down across the","across the Cote","the Cote d'Azur","Cote d'Azur whilst","d'Azur whilst pursued","whilst pursued by","pursued by his","by his rival","his rival Clancy","rival Clancy who","Clancy who is","who is incensed","is incensed by","incensed by the","by the fact","the fact that","fact that Charles","that Charles might","Charles might actually","might actually be","actually be retiring"],"2grams":["Socially-challenged hitman","hitman Charles","Charles lives","lives in","in Cannes","Cannes and","and wants","wants to","to retire","retire with","with a","a yacht","yacht and","and a","a woman","woman in","in tow","He has","has no","no experience","experience with","with either","either until","until he","he lets","lets his","his cleaning","cleaning lady","lady (","( delectable","delectable Essex-girl","Essex-girl Lisa","Lisa )",") into","into his","his life","life ,",", but","but he","he does","does n't","n't bank","bank on","on her","her vile","vile boyfriend","boyfriend Denny","Denny or","or con-artists","con-artists Simon","Simon and","and Ray","Ray stealing","stealing a","a two","two million","million quid","quid nest","nest egg","egg from","from the","the boot","boot of","of his","his car","Charles hunts","hunts them","them down","down across","across the","the Cote","Cote d'Azur","d'Azur whilst","whilst pursued","pursued by","by his","his rival","rival Clancy","Clancy who","who is","is incensed","incensed by","by the","the fact","fact that","that Charles","Charles might","might actually","actually be","be retiring"]}

The transience of their fame is the main topic of this documentary, which provides a glimpse into the lives of three aging jazzmen: trumpeter Laco Deczi, saxophonist Lubomír Tamaskovic, and contrabass player Ján Jankeje, who fled from the Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia to the West, where their stars shone alongside those of the world's famous musicians.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Like","the","steam","that","silent","appear","and","then","disappear","over","a","flow","river",",","the","life","of","everi","human","is","just","as","fleet",",","and","this","particular","appli","in","the","case","of","artist",".","The","transienc","of","their","fame","is","the","main","topic","of","this","documentari",",","which","provid","a","glimps","into","the","live","of","three","age","jazzmen",":","trumpet","Laco","Deczi",",","saxophonist","Lubomír","Tamaskov",",","and","contrabass","player","Ján","Jankej",",","who","fled","from","the","Soviet-occupi","Czechoslovakia","to","the","West",",","where","their","star","shone","alongsid","those","of","the","world","'s","famous","musician","."],"lemmas":["like","the","steam","that","silently","appear","and","then","disappear","over","a","flowing","river",",","the","life","of","every","human","be","just","as","fleeting",",","and","this","particularly","apply","in","the","case","of","artist",".","the","transience","of","they","fame","be","the","main","topic","of","this","documentary",",","which","provide","a","glimpse","into","the","life","of","three","aging","jazzman",":","trumpeter","Laco","Deczi",",","saxophonist","Lubomír","Tamaskovic",",","and","contrabass","player","Ján","Jankeje",",","who","flee","from","the","soviet-occupied","Czechoslovakia","to","the","West",",","where","they","star","shine","alongside","those","of","the","world","'s","famous","musician","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Like the steam","the steam that","steam that silently","that silently appears","silently appears and","appears and then","and then disappears","then disappears over","disappears over a","over a flowing","a flowing river","flowing river ,","river , the",", the life","the life of","life of every","of every human","every human is","human is just","is just as","just as fleeting","as fleeting ,","fleeting , and",", and this","and this particularly","this particularly applies","particularly applies in","applies in the","in the case","the case of","case of artists","The transience of","transience of their","of their fame","their fame is","fame is the","is the main","the main topic","main topic of","topic of this","of this documentary","this documentary ,","documentary , which",", which provides","which provides a","provides a glimpse","a glimpse into","glimpse into the","into the lives","the lives of","lives of three","of three aging","three aging jazzmen","aging jazzmen :","jazzmen : trumpeter",": trumpeter Laco","trumpeter Laco Deczi","Laco Deczi ,","Deczi , saxophonist",", saxophonist Lubomír","saxophonist Lubomír Tamaskovic","Lubomír Tamaskovic ,","Tamaskovic , and",", and contrabass","and contrabass player","contrabass player Ján","player Ján Jankeje","Ján Jankeje ,","Jankeje , who",", who fled","who fled from","fled from the","from the Soviet-occupied","the Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia","Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia to","Czechoslovakia to the","to the West","the West ,","West , where",", where their","where their stars","their stars shone","stars shone alongside","shone alongside those","alongside those of","those of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's famous","'s famous musicians"],"2grams":["Like the","the steam","steam that","that silently","silently appears","appears and","and then","then disappears","disappears over","over a","a flowing","flowing river","river ,",", the","the life","life of","of every","every human","human is","is just","just as","as fleeting","fleeting ,",", and","and this","this particularly","particularly applies","applies in","in the","the case","case of","of artists","The transience","transience of","of their","their fame","fame is","is the","the main","main topic","topic of","of this","this documentary","documentary ,",", which","which provides","provides a","a glimpse","glimpse into","into the","the lives","lives of","of three","three aging","aging jazzmen","jazzmen :",": trumpeter","trumpeter Laco","Laco Deczi","Deczi ,",", saxophonist","saxophonist Lubomír","Lubomír Tamaskovic","Tamaskovic ,",", and","and contrabass","contrabass player","player Ján","Ján Jankeje","Jankeje ,",", who","who fled","fled from","from the","the Soviet-occupied","Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia","Czechoslovakia to","to the","the West","West ,",", where","where their","their stars","stars shone","shone alongside","alongside those","those of","of the","the world","world 's","'s famous","famous musicians"]}

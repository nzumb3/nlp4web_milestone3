{"title":"The Letter: An American Town and the 'Somali Invasion'","plot":"In the wake of the 9/11 tragedy a firestorm erupts when Mayor Larry Raymond of Lewiston, Maine sends a letter to 1,100 newly arrived Somali refugees advising that the city's resources are strained to the limit and asking that other Somalis not to move to the city. Interpreted as racism by some and a rallying cry by white supremacist groups across the United States, THE LETTER documents the crossfire of emotions and events, culminating in a \"hate\" rally convened by The World Church of the Creator and a counter \"peace\" rally involving 4,000 Lewiston residents supporting ethnic and cultural diversity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","wake","of","the","9/11","tragedi","a","firestorm","erupt","when","Mayor","Larri","Raymond","of","Lewiston",",","Main","send","a","letter","to","1,100","newli","arriv","Somali","refuge","advis","that","the","citi","'s","resourc","are","strain","to","the","limit","and","ask","that","other","Somali","not","to","move","to","the","citi",".","Interpret","as","racism","by","some","and","a","ralli","cri","by","white","supremacist","group","across","the","Unite","State",",","THE","LETTER","document","the","crossfir","of","emot","and","event",",","culmin","in","a","\"","hate","\"","ralli","conven","by","The","World","Church","of","the","Creator","and","a","counter","\"","peac","\"","ralli","involv","4,000","Lewiston","resid","support","ethnic","and","cultur","divers","."],"lemmas":["in","the","wake","of","the","9/11","tragedy","a","firestorm","erupt","when","Mayor","Larry","Raymond","of","Lewiston",",","Maine","send","a","letter","to","1,100","newly","arrive","somali","refugee","advise","that","the","city","'s","resource","be","strain","to","the","limit","and","ask","that","other","Somalis","not","to","move","to","the","city",".","interpret","as","racism","by","some","and","a","rally","cry","by","white","supremacist","group","across","the","United","States",",","the","letter","document","the","crossfire","of","emotion","and","event",",","culminate","in","a","``","hate","''","rally","convene","by","the","World","Church","of","the","Creator","and","a","counter","``","peace","''","rally","involve","4,000","Lewiston","resident","support","ethnic","and","cultural","diversity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

{"title":"Hide Away","plot":"This is a story about grief and all the emotions it entails. A successful businessman attempting to resurrect his life buys and boards a dilapidated sailboat in a remote area on the shore of one of the Great Lakes, North America. A business associate comes to urge him to return to work, but relents when he sees his state. This is when viewers get more of a hint of the tragedy that he has experienced. Rather than push him further, the associate agrees to let him take all the time he needs. He passes the winter in this desolate location grieving desperately and gradually repairing the boat though other boaters have left for the winter. In the meantime, he makes friends of a widower sailor and a world-weary waitress at the marina. Through the slow moving yet beautiful and well played drama in this gorgeous lake setting, viewers come to know how he has reached this point in his life. By the early spring, he is feeling stronger and is ready to face society again. He sells the sailboat, now in excellent condition, and says good-bye to this episode of his life.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","is","a","stori","about","grief","and","all","the","emot","it","entail",".","A","success","businessman","attempt","to","resurrect","his","life","buy","and","board","a","dilapid","sailboat","in","a","remot","area","on","the","shore","of","one","of","the","Great","Lake",",","North","America",".","A","busi","associ","come","to","urg","him","to","return","to","work",",","but","relent","when","he","see","his","state",".","This","is","when","viewer","get","more","of","a","hint","of","the","tragedi","that","he","has","experienc",".","Rather","than","push","him","further",",","the","associ","agre","to","let","him","take","all","the","time","he","need",".","He","pass","the","winter","in","this","desol","locat","griev","desper","and","gradual","repair","the","boat","though","other","boater","have","left","for","the","winter",".","In","the","meantim",",","he","make","friend","of","a","widow","sailor","and","a","world-weari","waitress","at","the","marina",".","Through","the","slow","move","yet","beauti","and","well","play","drama","in","this","gorgeous","lake","set",",","viewer","come","to","know","how","he","has","reach","this","point","in","his","life",".","By","the","earli","spring",",","he","is","feel","stronger","and","is","readi","to","face","societi","again",".","He","sell","the","sailboat",",","now","in","excel","condit",",","and","say","good-by","to","this","episod","of","his","life","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","story","about","grief","and","all","the","emotion","it","entail",".","a","successful","businessman","attempt","to","resurrect","he","life","buy","and","board","a","dilapidated","sailboat","in","a","remote","area","on","the","shore","of","one","of","the","Great","Lakes",",","North","America",".","a","business","associate","come","to","urge","he","to","return","to","work",",","but","relent","when","he","see","he","state",".","this","be","when","viewer","get","more","of","a","hint","of","the","tragedy","that","he","have","experience",".","rather","than","push","he","further",",","the","associate","agree","to","let","he","take","all","the","time","he","need",".","he","pass","the","winter","in","this","desolate","location","grieve","desperately","and","gradually","repair","the","boat","though","other","boater","have","leave","for","the","winter",".","in","the","meantime",",","he","make","friend","of","a","widower","sailor","and","a","world-weary","waitress","at","the","marina",".","through","the","slow","move","yet","beautiful","and","well","play","drama","in","this","gorgeous","lake","setting",",","viewer","come","to","know","how","he","have","reach","this","point","in","he","life",".","by","the","early","spring",",","he","be","feel","stronger","and","be","ready","to","face","society","again",".","he","sell","the","sailboat",",","now","in","excellent","condition",",","and","say","good-bye","to","this","episode","of","he","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

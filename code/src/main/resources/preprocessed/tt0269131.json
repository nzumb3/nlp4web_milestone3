{"title":"Dari Jemapoh ke Manchestee","plot":"Two village youths decide to travel from their boring hometown of Jemapoh, Malaysia to England. One wants to see his favourite soccer team Manchester United while the other wants to meet his long-lost father. They drive a stolen red Volvo and hope that Manchester will pop up on the road map soon. Along the way they also pick up a girl who is being sexually harassed, and a rock musician whose concert was disrupted by thugs in batik shirts. By the end you're not sure if they will actually reach Manchester, but they've found some firm friends.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","villag","youth","decid","to","travel","from","their","bore","hometown","of","Jemapoh",",","Malaysia","to","England",".","One","want","to","see","his","favourit","soccer","team","Manchest","Unite","while","the","other","want","to","meet","his","long-lost","father",".","They","drive","a","stolen","red","Volvo","and","hope","that","Manchest","will","pop","up","on","the","road","map","soon",".","Along","the","way","they","also","pick","up","a","girl","who","is","be","sexual","harass",",","and","a","rock","musician","whose","concert","was","disrupt","by","thug","in","batik","shirt",".","By","the","end","you","re","not","sure","if","they","will","actual","reach","Manchest",",","but","they","ve","found","some","firm","friend","."],"lemmas":["two","village","youth","decide","to","travel","from","they","boring","hometown","of","Jemapoh",",","Malaysia","to","England",".","one","want","to","see","he","favourite","soccer","team","Manchester","United","while","the","other","want","to","meet","he","long-lost","father",".","they","drive","a","stolen","red","Volvo","and","hope","that","Manchester","will","pop","up","on","the","road","map","soon",".","along","the","way","they","also","pick","up","a","girl","who","be","be","sexually","harass",",","and","a","rock","musician","whose","concert","be","disrupt","by","thug","in","batik","shirt",".","by","the","end","you","be","not","sure","if","they","will","actually","reach","Manchester",",","but","they","have","find","some","firm","friend","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Two village youths","village youths decide","youths decide to","decide to travel","to travel from","travel from their","from their boring","their boring hometown","boring hometown of","hometown of Jemapoh","of Jemapoh ,","Jemapoh , Malaysia",", Malaysia to","Malaysia to England","One wants to","wants to see","to see his","see his favourite","his favourite soccer","favourite soccer team","soccer team Manchester","team Manchester United","Manchester United while","United while the","while the other","the other wants","other wants to","wants to meet","to meet his","meet his long-lost","his long-lost father","They drive a","drive a stolen","a stolen red","stolen red Volvo","red Volvo and","Volvo and hope","and hope that","hope that Manchester","that Manchester will","Manchester will pop","will pop up","pop up on","up on the","on the road","the road map","road map soon","Along the way","the way they","way they also","they also pick","also pick up","pick up a","up a girl","a girl who","girl who is","who is being","is being sexually","being sexually harassed","sexually harassed ,","harassed , and",", and a","and a rock","a rock musician","rock musician whose","musician whose concert","whose concert was","concert was disrupted","was disrupted by","disrupted by thugs","by thugs in","thugs in batik","in batik shirts","By the end","the end you","end you 're","you 're not","'re not sure","not sure if","sure if they","if they will","they will actually","will actually reach","actually reach Manchester","reach Manchester ,","Manchester , but",", but they","but they 've","they 've found","'ve found some","found some firm","some firm friends"],"2grams":["Two village","village youths","youths decide","decide to","to travel","travel from","from their","their boring","boring hometown","hometown of","of Jemapoh","Jemapoh ,",", Malaysia","Malaysia to","to England","One wants","wants to","to see","see his","his favourite","favourite soccer","soccer team","team Manchester","Manchester United","United while","while the","the other","other wants","wants to","to meet","meet his","his long-lost","long-lost father","They drive","drive a","a stolen","stolen red","red Volvo","Volvo and","and hope","hope that","that Manchester","Manchester will","will pop","pop up","up on","on the","the road","road map","map soon","Along the","the way","way they","they also","also pick","pick up","up a","a girl","girl who","who is","is being","being sexually","sexually harassed","harassed ,",", and","and a","a rock","rock musician","musician whose","whose concert","concert was","was disrupted","disrupted by","by thugs","thugs in","in batik","batik shirts","By the","the end","end you","you 're","'re not","not sure","sure if","if they","they will","will actually","actually reach","reach Manchester","Manchester ,",", but","but they","they 've","'ve found","found some","some firm","firm friends"]}

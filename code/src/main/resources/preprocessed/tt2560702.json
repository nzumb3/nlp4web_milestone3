{"title":"Ballerina","plot":"'Nothing shall come between me and dancing'. Those are the words of 9-year-old Elsa Marianne after a night at the theatre. This is where the magic starts - and so does her fascinating story of a long, passionate and uncompromising life with ballet. Ballerina is a poetic dance documentary inspired by the life and career of world famous Swedish prima ballerina Elsa Marianne von Rosen - a life of magic, hardship, love and not least an unyielding urge to follow your dreams and your heart. No matter the price. Through new choreographed dance scenes with three professional contemporary dancers, a unique archival material with von Rosen (both still and video), a narrative inspired by her own autobiography 'Inte bara en dans på Rosor' and brand new recordings with the now 90 year-old dance legend, the film gives us a poetic peek into von Rosen's deeply passionate relationship to dancing - a passion that gave her life itself, but also almost took it away from her.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["'","Noth","shall","come","between","me","and","danc","'",".","Those","are","the","word","of","9-year-old","Elsa","Mariann","after","a","night","at","the","theatr",".","This","is","where","the","magic","start","-","and","so","doe","her","fascin","stori","of","a","long",",","passion","and","uncompromis","life","with","ballet",".","Ballerina","is","a","poetic","danc","documentari","inspir","by","the","life","and","career","of","world","famous","Swedish","prima","ballerina","Elsa","Mariann","von","Rosen","-","a","life","of","magic",",","hardship",",","love","and","not","least","an","unyield","urg","to","follow","your","dream","and","your","heart",".","No","matter","the","price",".","Through","new","choreograph","danc","scene","with","three","profession","contemporari","dancer",",","a","uniqu","archiv","materi","with","von","Rosen","(","both","still","and","video",")",",","a","narrat","inspir","by","her","own","autobiographi","'","Inte","bara","en","dan","på","Rosor","'","and","brand","new","record","with","the","now","90","year-old","danc","legend",",","the","film","give","us","a","poetic","peek","into","von","Rosen","'s","deepli","passion","relationship","to","danc","-","a","passion","that","gave","her","life","itself",",","but","also","almost","took","it","away","from","her","."],"lemmas":["'","nothing","shall","come","between","I","and","dancing","'",".","those","be","the","word","of","9-year-old","Elsa","Marianne","after","a","night","at","the","theatre",".","this","be","where","the","magic","start","-","and","so","do","she","fascinating","story","of","a","long",",","passionate","and","uncompromising","life","with","ballet",".","Ballerina","be","a","poetic","dance","documentary","inspire","by","the","life","and","career","of","world","famous","swedish","prima","ballerina","Elsa","Marianne","von","Rosen","-","a","life","of","magic",",","hardship",",","love","and","not","least","a","unyielding","urge","to","follow","you","dream","and","you","heart",".","no","matter","the","price",".","through","new","choreographed","dance","scene","with","three","professional","contemporary","dancer",",","a","unique","archival","material","with","von","Rosen","-lrb-","both","still","and","video","-rrb-",",","a","narrative","inspire","by","she","own","autobiography","'","inte","bara","en","dans","på","Rosor","'","and","brand","new","recording","with","the","now","90","year-old","dance","legend",",","the","film","give","we","a","poetic","peek","into","von","Rosen","'s","deeply","passionate","relationship","to","dancing","-","a","passion","that","give","she","life","itself",",","but","also","almost","take","it","away","from","she","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["' Nothing shall","Nothing shall come","shall come between","come between me","between me and","me and dancing","and dancing '","Those are the","are the words","the words of","words of 9-year-old","of 9-year-old Elsa","9-year-old Elsa Marianne","Elsa Marianne after","Marianne after a","after a night","a night at","night at the","at the theatre","This is where","is where the","where the magic","the magic starts","magic starts -","starts -

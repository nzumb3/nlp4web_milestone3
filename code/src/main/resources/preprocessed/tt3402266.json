{"title":"Wind & Rattlesnakes","plot":"Named for an old cowboy's two-word description of Wyoming, 'Wind and Rattlesnakes' documents the history, people and climbing around Lander, Wyoming. The one hour long film follows the development of the region as a world-class climbing area, from the earliest days of Paul Petzoldt's students at the National Outdoor Leadership School tying in with bowlines around the waist, to the current development of Wolf Point which bow has one of the highest concentrations of 5.14's in America. Highlights include archive footage of Todd Skinner, interviews with developers like Paul Piana and Steve Bechtel, and B.J. Tilden on the first ascent of one of America's hardest routes, Moonshine (5.14d) at the Wild Iris.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"," Biography"],"stems":["Name","for","an","old","cowboy","'s","two-word","descript","of","Wyom",",","'","Wind","and","Rattlesnak","'","document","the","histori",",","peopl","and","climb","around","Lander",",","Wyom",".","The","one","hour","long","film","follow","the","develop","of","the","region","as","a","world-class","climb","area",",","from","the","earliest","day","of","Paul","Petzoldt","'s","student","at","the","Nation","Outdoor","Leadership","School","tie","in","with","bowlin","around","the","waist",",","to","the","current","develop","of","Wolf","Point","which","bow","has","one","of","the","highest","concentr","of","5.14","'s","in","America",".","Highlight","includ","archiv","footag","of","Todd","Skinner",",","interview","with","develop","like","Paul","Piana","and","Steve","Bechtel",",","and","B.J.","Tilden","on","the","first","ascent","of","one","of","America","'s","hardest","rout",",","Moonshin","(","5.14","d",")","at","the","Wild","Iris","."],"lemmas":["name","for","a","old","cowboy","'s","two-word","description","of","Wyoming",",","'","wind","and","rattlesnake","'","document","the","history",",","people","and","climb","around","Lander",",","Wyoming",".","the","one","hour","long","film","follow","the","development","of","the","region","as","a","world-class","climbing","area",",","from","the","earliest","day","of","Paul","Petzoldt","'s","student","at","the","National","Outdoor","Leadership","School","tie","in","with","bowline","around","the","waist",",","to","the","current","development","of","Wolf","Point","which","bow","have","one","of","the","highest","concentration","of","5.14","'s","in","America",".","highlight","include","archive","footage","of","Todd","Skinner",",","interview","with","developer","like","Paul","Piana","and","Steve","Bechtel",",","and","B.J.","Tilden","on","the","first","ascent","of","one","of","America","'s","hardest","route",",","moonshine","-lrb-","5.14","d","-rrb-","at","the","Wild","Iris","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Named for an","for an old","an old cowboy","old cowboy 's","cowboy 's two-word","'s two-word description","two-word description of","description of Wyoming","of Wyoming ,","Wyoming , '",", ' Wind","' Wind and","Wind and Rattlesnakes","and Rattlesnakes '","Rattlesnakes ' documents","' documents the","documents the history","the history ,","history , people",", people and","people and climbing","and climbing around","climbing around Lander","around Lander ,","Lander , Wyoming","The one hour","one hour long","hour long film","long film follows","film follows the","follows the development","the development of","development of the","of the region","the region as","region as a","as a world-class","a world-class climbing","world-class climbing area","climbing area ,","area , from",", from the","from the earliest","the earliest days","earliest days of","days of Paul","of Paul Petzoldt","Paul Petzoldt 's","Petzoldt 's students","'s students at","students at the","at the National","the National Outdoor","National Outdoor Leadership","Outdoor Leadership School","Leadership School tying","School tying in","tying in with","in with bowlines","with bowlines around","bowlines around the","around the waist","the waist ,","waist , to",", to the","to the current","the current development","current development of","development of Wolf","of Wolf Point","Wolf Point which","Point which bow","which bow has","bow has one","has one of","one of the","of the highest","the highest concentrations","highest concentrations of","concentrations of 5.14","of 5.14 's","5.14 's in","'s in America","Highlights include archive","include archive footage","archive footage of","footage of Todd","of Todd Skinner","Todd Skinner ,","Skinner , interviews",", interviews with","interviews with developers","with developers like","developers like Paul","like Paul Piana","Paul Piana and","Piana and Steve","and Steve Bechtel","Steve Bechtel ,","Bechtel , and",", and B.J.","and B.J.

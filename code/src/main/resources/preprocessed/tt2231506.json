{"title":"Randslide: The Election of Rand Paul","plot":"In 2010, the American people demanded a new kind of politics. It was the \"year of the outsider\", and the candidate who offered the greatest chance for change was an eye surgeon from Kentucky, Rand Paul. He became the freedom movement's new hope by defending something few political candidates actually believe in: the principles of liberty. \"Randslide: The Election of Rand Paul\" is a documentary that covers one of the most memorable and unpredictable U.S. Senate races in American history. It's the tale of an anti-establishment candidate, an underdog, who won big. A true grassroots documentary, \"Randslide\" features Rand Paul, Ron Paul, and many others. This is a tale that has never been told in full, and this is the only movie that covers it.","genres":["Biography","

{"title":"35 and Ticking","plot":"Centers around the lives of Victoria, Zenobia , Clevon, and Phil -- all friends approaching the age of 35 and struggling to build the families they've always dreamed of. While Zenobia (Parker, \"Soul Food,\" \"Brown Sugar\") is still looking for a man, Victoria (Jones, \"Castle,\" \"One on One\") is married to a man who doesn't want children. Clevon (comic Hart, \"Not Easily Broken,\" \"40 Year-Old Virgin\"), meanwhile, is too geeky to get a woman, and Phil (Keith Robinson, \"Dreamgirls\") is already married with children, but his wife is not very interested in being a mother. All four of them try to rectify their romantic lives and futures while their biological clocks tick away.","genres":["Comedy","

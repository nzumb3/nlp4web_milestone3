{"title":"Flush in the Wild","plot":"Army veteran Erik Packard completed two tours in Iraq. After returning from his second deployment he struggled greatly with PTSD. At one point things got so bad that he attempted suicide. VA doctors and the medication prescribed for Erik helped to stabilize his condition, and yet he didn't feel like he was truly healing. One day Erik signed up for an Outward Bound adventure. These trips for veterans take place in the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness of northern Minnesota. The \"Boundary Waters\" is a 1.1 million acre Wilderness created as part of the 1964 U.S. Wilderness Act. It's a place that Erik's father had taken him to as a child to canoe and fish. But, due to his illness he hadn't visited the Wilderness since his father passed away just before his first deployment. In this film we follow Erik as he returns and goes on his first grouse hunt in the Boundary Waters. He shares his personal story of this place and why it's been such an important part of his healing process. Erik is compelled to help protect the Boundary Waters which is currently threatened by a South American company that would like to bring highly toxic sulfide-ore copper mining to its lake's edge. We hope you enjoy hearing his story and seeing the beauty of this place that provides solace and healing for so many people.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Armi","veteran","Erik","Packard","complet","two","tour","in","Iraq",".","After","return","from","his","second","deploy","he","struggl","great","with","PTSD",".","At","one","point","thing","got","so","bad","that","he","attempt","suicid",".","VA","doctor","and","the","medic","prescrib","for","Erik","help","to","stabil","his","condit",",","and","yet","he","did","n't","feel","like","he","was","truli","heal",".","One","day","Erik","sign","up","for","an","Outward","Bound","adventur",".","These","trip","for","veteran","take","place","in","the","Boundari","Water","Cano","Area","Wilder","of","northern","Minnesota",".","The","\"","Boundari","Water","\"","is","a","1.1","million","acr","Wilder","creat","as","part","of","the","1964","U.S.","Wilder","Act",".","It","'s","a","place","that","Erik","'s","father","had","taken","him","to","as","a","child","to","cano","and","fish",".","But",",","due","to","his","ill","he","had","n't","visit","the","Wilder","sinc","his","father","pass","away","just","befor","his","first","deploy",".","In","this","film","we","follow","Erik","as","he","return","and","goe","on","his","first","grous","hunt","in","the","Boundari","Water",".","He","share","his","person","stori","of","this","place","and","whi","it","'s","been","such","an","import","part","of","his","heal","process",".","Erik","is","compel","to","help","protect","the","Boundari","Water","which","is","current","threaten","by","a","South","American","compani","that","would","like","to","bring","high","toxic","sulfide-or","copper","mine","to","it","lake","'s","edg",".","We","hope","you","enjoy","hear","his","stori","and","see","the","beauti","of","this","place","that","provid","solac","and","heal","for","so","mani","peopl","."],"lemmas":["Army","veteran","Erik","Packard","complete","two","tour","in","Iraq",".","after","return","from","he","second","deployment","he","struggle","greatly","with","ptsd",".","at","one","point","thing","get","so","bad","that","he","attempt","suicide",".","va","doctor","and","the","medication","prescribe","for","Erik","help","to","stabilize","he","condition",",","and","yet","he","do","not","feel","like","he","be","truly","healing",".","one","day","Erik","sign","up","for","a","outward","bind","adventure",".","these","trip","for","veteran","take","place","in","the","Boundary","Waters","Canoe","Area","wilderness","of","northern","Minnesota",".","the","``","Boundary","Waters","''","be","a","1.1","million","acre","wilderness","create","as","part","of","the","1964","U.S.","Wilderness","Act",".","it","be","a","place","that","Erik","'s","father","have","take","he","to","as","a","child","to","canoe","and","fish",".","but",",","due","to","he","illness","he","have","not","visit","the","wilderness","since","he","father","pass","away","just","before","he","first","deployment",".","in","this","film","we","follow","Erik","as","he","return","and","go","on","he","first","grouse","hunt","in","the","Boundary","Waters",".","he","share","he","personal","story","of","this","place","and","why","it","be","be","such","a","important","part","of","he","healing","process",".","Erik","be","compel","to","help","protect","the","Boundary","Waters","which","be","currently","threaten","by","a","south","american","company","that","would","like","to","bring","highly","toxic","sulfide-ore","copper","mining","to","its","lake","'s","edge",".","we","hope","you","enjoy","hear","he","story","and","see","the","beauty","of","this","place","that","provide","solace","and","healing","for","so","many","people","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Army

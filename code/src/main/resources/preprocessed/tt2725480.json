{"title":"SHIULI: In Search of My Goddess!","plot":"This film is an audio-visual that portrays two separate perceptions in parallel. The visual part of the film portrays a joyful reality that has lost its focus. The festive mood has been depicted through some cultural and religious ingredients to add the intensity of belief and devotion. The audio part deals with a lady love, a love that has been juxtaposed with a goddess, for whom there is an everlasting search through the meandering streams of imagination. The film suggests an eternal cycle of thoughts, belief, life and love, and we the human beings are just like the planets being forced to follow the cyclic search for our destination, by virtue of our existence.","genres":["Documentary","

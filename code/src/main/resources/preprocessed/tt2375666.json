{"title":"Fireflies","plot":"Fireflies come out in the night, just to light up the darkness. They live as long as the glow lasts. Even if it is a lifetime, being lived in a day. FIREFLIES is the story of two estranged brothers, Shiv and Rana. Living disparate lives, sometimes illuminated by unexpected intimacies and new found hope, the brothers still remain shackled to the darkness of their past. Haunting memories of a tragic incident must be resolved before they can be brothers again.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["Firefli","come","out","in","the","night",",","just","to","light","up","the","dark",".","They","live","as","long","as","the","glow","last",".","Even","if","it","is","a","lifetim",",","be","live","in","a","day",".","FIREFLIES","is","the","stori","of","two","estrang","brother",",","Shiv","and","Rana",".","Live","dispar","live",",","sometim","illumin","by","unexpect","intimaci","and","new","found","hope",",","the","brother","still","remain","shackl","to","the","dark","of","their","past",".","Haunt","memori","of","a","tragic","incid","must","be","resolv","befor","they","can","be","brother","again","."],"lemmas":["firefly","come","out","in","the","night",",","just","to","light","up","the","darkness",".","they","live","as","long","as","the","glow","last",".","even","if","it","be","a","lifetime",",","be","live","in","a","day",".","FIREFLIES","be","the","story","of","two","estrange","brother",",","Shiv","and","Rana",".","live","disparate","life",",","sometimes","illuminate","by","unexpected","intimacy","and","new","find","hope",",","the","brother","still","remain","shackled","to","the","darkness","of","they","past",".","haunting","memory","of","a","tragic","incident","must","be","resolve","before","they","can","be","brother","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Fireflies come out","come out in","out in the","in the night","the night ,","night , just",", just to","just to light","to light up","light up the","up the darkness","They live as","live as long","as long as","long as the","as the glow","the glow lasts","Even if it","if it is","it is a","is a lifetime","a lifetime ,","lifetime , being",", being lived","being lived in","lived in a","in a day","FIREFLIES is the","is the story","the story of","story of two","of two estranged","two estranged brothers","estranged brothers ,","brothers , Shiv",", Shiv and","Shiv and Rana","Living disparate lives","disparate lives ,","lives , sometimes",", sometimes illuminated","sometimes illuminated by","illuminated by unexpected","by unexpected intimacies","unexpected intimacies and","intimacies and new","and new found","new found hope","found hope ,","hope , the",", the brothers","the brothers still","brothers still remain","still remain shackled","remain shackled to","shackled to the","to the darkness","the darkness of","darkness of their","of their past","Haunting memories of","memories of a","of a tragic","a tragic incident","tragic incident must","incident must be","must be resolved","be resolved before","resolved before they","before they can","they can be","can be brothers","be brothers again"],"2grams":["Fireflies come","come out","out in","in the","the night","night ,",", just","just to","to light","light up","up the","the darkness","They live","live as","as long","long as","as the","the glow","glow lasts","Even if","if it","it is","is a","a lifetime","lifetime ,",", being","being lived","lived in","in a","a day","FIREFLIES is","is the","the story","story of","of two","two estranged","estranged brothers","brothers ,",", Shiv","Shiv and","and Rana","Living disparate","disparate lives","lives ,",", sometimes","sometimes illuminated","illuminated by","by unexpected","unexpected intimacies","intimacies and","and new","new found","found hope","hope ,",", the","the brothers","brothers still","still remain","remain shackled","shackled to","to the","the darkness","darkness of","of their","their past","Haunting memories","memories of","of a","a tragic","tragic incident","incident must","must be","be resolved","resolved before","before they","they can","can be","be brothers","brothers again"]}

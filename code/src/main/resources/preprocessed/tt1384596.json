{"title":"Terra Antarctica, Re-Discovering the Seventh Continent","plot":"For six weeks we explored the Antarctic Peninsula by sea kayak, sailboat, foot and small plane, observing the fast changing evolution of this most remote place. Impacted by climate change - temperatures have warmed along the Peninsula faster than anywhere on the planet during the past 50 years - this part of Antarctica is also experiencing a boom in tourism and nations fighting over who owns what as its ice slowly disappears. This National Geographic-sponsored exploration is a one-of-a-kind look at Antarctica from a unique perspective - sea level.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["For","six","week","we","explor","the","Antarctic","Peninsula","by","sea","kayak",",","sailboat",",","foot","and","small","plane",",","observ","the","fast","chang","evolut","of","this","most","remot","place",".","Impact","by","climat","chang","-","temperatur","have","warm","along","the","Peninsula","faster","than","anywher","on","the","planet","dure","the","past","50","year","-","this","part","of","Antarctica","is","also","experienc","a","boom","in","tourism","and","nation","fight","over","who","own","what","as","it","ice","slowli","disappear",".","This","Nation","Geographic-sponsor","explor","is","a","one-of-a-kind","look","at","Antarctica","from","a","uniqu","perspect","-","sea","level","."],"lemmas":["for","six","week","we","explore","the","Antarctic","Peninsula","by","sea","kayak",",","sailboat",",","foot","and","small","plane",",","observe","the","fast","change","evolution","of","this","most","remote","place",".","impact","by","climate","change","-","temperature","have","warm","along","the","Peninsula","faster","than","anywhere","on","the","planet","during","the","past","50","year","-","this","part","of","Antarctica","be","also","experience","a","boom","in","tourism","and","nation","fight","over","who","own","what","as","its","ice","slowly","disappear",".","this","National","geographic-sponsored","exploration","be","a","one-of-a-kind","look","at","Antarctica","from","a","unique","perspective","-","sea","level","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["For six weeks","six weeks we","weeks we explored","we explored the","explored the Antarctic","the Antarctic Peninsula","Antarctic Peninsula by","Peninsula by sea","by sea kayak","sea kayak ,","kayak , sailboat",", sailboat ,","sailboat , foot",", foot and","foot and small","and small plane","small plane ,","plane , observing",", observing the","observing the fast","the fast changing","fast changing evolution","changing evolution of","evolution of this","of this most","this most remote","most remote place","Impacted by climate","by climate change","climate change -","change - temperatures","- temperatures have","temperatures have warmed","have warmed along","warmed along the","along the Peninsula","the Peninsula faster","Peninsula faster than","faster than anywhere","than anywhere on","anywhere on the","on the planet","the planet during","planet during the","during the past","the past 50","past 50 years","50 years -","years - this","- this part","this part of","part of Antarctica","of Antarctica is","Antarctica is also","is also experiencing","also experiencing a","experiencing a boom","a boom in","boom in tourism","in tourism and","tourism and nations","and nations fighting","nations fighting over","fighting over who","over who owns","who owns what","owns what as","what as its","as its ice","its ice slowly","ice slowly disappears","This National Geographic-sponsored","National Geographic-sponsored exploration","Geographic-sponsored exploration is","exploration is a","is a one-of-a-kind","a one-of-a-kind look","one-of-a-kind look at","look at Antarctica","at Antarctica from","Antarctica from a","from a unique","a unique perspective","unique perspective -","perspective - sea","- sea level"],"2grams":["For six","six weeks","weeks we","we explored","explored the","the Antarctic","Antarctic Peninsula","Peninsula by","by sea","sea kayak","kayak ,",", sailboat","sailboat ,",", foot","foot and","and small","small plane","plane ,",", observing","observing the","the fast","fast changing","changing evolution","evolution of","of this","this most","most remote","remote place","Impacted by","by climate","climate change","change -","- temperatures","temperatures have","have warmed","warmed along","along the","the Peninsula","Peninsula faster","faster than","than anywhere","anywhere on","on the","the planet","planet during","during the","the past","past 50","50 years","years -","- this","this part","part of","of Antarctica","Antarctica is","is also","also experiencing","experiencing a","a boom","boom in","in tourism","tourism and","and nations","nations fighting","fighting over","over who","who owns","owns what","what as","as its","its ice","ice slowly","slowly disappears","This National","National Geographic-sponsored","Geographic-sponsored exploration","exploration is","is a","a one-of-a-kind","one-of-a-kind look","look at","at Antarctica","Antarctica from","from a","a unique","unique perspective","perspective -","- sea","sea level"]}

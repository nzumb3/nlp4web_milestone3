{"title":"Kickboxer 4: The Aggressor","plot":"Sasha Mitchell (\"Kickboxer 2&3\") triumphantly returns to the ring as David Sloan, fighting not just for his survival, but for his beautiful wife, who has become the sexual captive of the despicable world champion, Tong Po. Framed, forgotten and furious, Sloan has been wasting away in prison, but the Feds agree to release him if he will get inside Tong Po's impenetrable Mexican fortress, protected by its deadly guards and adorned by its sexual slaves. Sloan has no choice but to enter into Po's tournament of champions, a savage battle where winner takes all - and to Sloan - that means everything! Reluctantly, alliances form with a few others to help him out.","genres":["Action"," Sport"],"stems":["Sasha","Mitchel","(","\"","Kickbox","2","&","3","\"",")","triumphant","return","to","the","ring","as","David","Sloan",",","fight","not","just","for","his","surviv",",","but","for","his","beauti","wife",",","who","has","becom","the","sexual","captiv","of","the","despic","world","champion",",","Tong","Po",".","Frame",",","forgotten","and","furious",",","Sloan","has","been","wast","away","in","prison",",","but","the","Fed","agre","to","releas","him","if","he","will","get","insid","Tong","Po","'s","impenetr","Mexican","fortress",",","protect","by","it","dead","guard","and","adorn","by","it","sexual","slave",".","Sloan","has","no","choic","but","to","enter","into","Po","'s","tournament","of","champion",",","a","savag","battl","where","winner","take","all","-","and","to","Sloan","-","that","mean","everyth","!","Reluct",",","allianc","form","with","a","few","other","to","help","him","out","."],"lemmas":["Sasha","Mitchell","-lrb-","``","kickboxer","2","&","3","''","-rrb-","triumphantly","return","to","the","ring","as","David","Sloan",",","fight","not","just","for","he","survival",",","but","for","he","beautiful","wife",",","who","have","become","the","sexual","captive","of","the","despicable","world","champion",",","Tong","Po",".","frame",",","forget","and","furious",",","Sloan","have","be","waste","away","in","prison",",","but","the","Feds","agree","to","release","he","if","he","will","get","inside","Tong","Po","'s","impenetrable","mexican","fortress",",","protect","by","its","deadly","guard","and","adorn","by","its","sexual","slave",".","Sloan","have","no","choice","but","to","enter","into","Po","'s","tournament","of","champion",",","a","savage","battle","where","winner","take","all","-","and","to","Sloan","-","that","mean","everything","!","reluctantly",",","alliance","form","with","a","few","other","to","help","he","out","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sasha Mitchell (","Mitchell ( \"","( \" Kickboxer","\" Kickboxer 2","Kickboxer 2 &","2 & 3","& 3 \"","3 \" )","\" ) triumphantly",") triumphantly returns","triumphantly returns to","returns to the","to the ring","the ring as","ring as David","as David Sloan","David Sloan ,","Sloan , fighting",", fighting not","fighting not just","not just for","just for his","for his survival","his survival ,","survival , but",", but for","but for his","for his beautiful","his beautiful wife","beautiful wife ,","wife , who",", who has","who has become","has become the","become the sexual","the sexual captive","sexual captive of","captive of the","of the despicable","the despicable world","despicable world champion","world champion ,","champion , Tong",", Tong Po","Framed , forgotten",", forgotten and","forgotten and furious","and furious ,","furious , Sloan",", Sloan has","Sloan has been","has been wasting","been wasting away","wasting away in","away in prison","in prison ,","prison , but",", but the","but the Feds","the Feds agree","Feds agree to","agree to release","to release him","release him if","him if he","if he will","he will get","will get inside","get inside Tong","inside Tong Po","Tong Po 's","Po 's impenetrable","'s impenetrable Mexican","impenetrable Mexican fortress","Mexican fortress ,","fortress , protected",", protected by","protected by its","by its deadly","its deadly guards","deadly guards and","guards and adorned","and adorned by","adorned by its","by its sexual","its sexual slaves","Sloan has no","has no choice","no choice but","choice but to","but to enter","to enter into","enter into Po","into Po 's","Po 's tournament","'s tournament of","tournament of champions","of champions ,","champions , a",", a savage","a savage battle","savage battle where","battle where winner","where winner takes","winner takes all","takes all -","all -

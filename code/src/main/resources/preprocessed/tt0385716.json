{"title":"Young, Beautiful and Screwed Up","plot":"A young boy, Maurice, lives and works on a farm in the beautiful south of France. His boss pushes him to the limit. He's underpaid and exploited. He supports his mother, a poor witch who lives in a house in the woods. He's never met his father and left school when he was 16. One day a posh Parisian girl and her racist boyfriend on a short break in a convertible lose their way in the countryside and end up in Maurice's village. Maurice falls instantly in love with the girl. The boyfriend has too much to drink and starts a big fight. He flees with the girl. Maurice decides to go after her in the big city.

Philippe's supposed to attend medical school and keeps asking his dad for more money. His roommate Samir grows sensemillia, grass the farmer is not too familiar

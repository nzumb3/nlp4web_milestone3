{"title":"Mohabbat","plot":"The wealthy Kapoor family consists of Madanlal, his wife, Geetarani, daughter, Roshni, and son, Gaurav. One day while Gaurav is returning home from the Oriental Bank of Commerce, he is attacked by a group of men led by Shiva, but a young man named Rohit Malhotra comes to his rescue. Gaurav hires Rohit in his firm, and both become fast and inseparable friends. Both unknowingly fall in love with the same woman, Shweta Sharma, but Gaurav finds out and decides to step away. Shweta and Rohit are in love and want to get married. Then Shiva attacks Rohit and throws him off a cliff. Believing him to be dead, a shocked and devastated Shweta loses her voice. The Kapoors find out that Gaurav loves Shweta and they approach her brother, Shekhar, and arrange their marriage. A reluctant Shweta gives her accent. It is then that she starts seeing Rohit, while Gaurav starts drifting away from her, and unknown to anyone, is hiding a deadly secret. The question remains is Shweta delusional, and what exactly is Gaurav's secret that he does not want anyone to know?","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["The","wealthi","Kapoor","famili","consist","of","Madanl",",","his","wife",",","Geetarani",",","daughter",",","Roshni",",","and","son",",","Gaurav",".","One","day","while","Gaurav","is","return","home","from","the","Oriental","Bank","of","Commerc",",","he","is","attack","by","a","group","of","men","led","by","Shiva",",","but","a","young","man","name","Rohit","Malhotra","come","to","his","rescu",".","Gaurav","hire","Rohit","in","his","firm",",","and","both","becom","fast","and","insepar","friend",".","Both","unknow","fall","in","love","with","the","same","woman",",","Shweta","Sharma",",","but","Gaurav","find","out","and","decid","to","step","away",".","Shweta","and","Rohit","are","in","love","and","want","to","get","marri",".","Then","Shiva","attack","Rohit","and","throw","him","off","a","cliff",".","Believ","him","to","be","dead",",","a","shock","and","devast","Shweta","lose","her","voic",".","The","Kapoor","find","out","that","Gaurav","love","Shweta","and","they","approach","her","brother",",","Shekhar",",","and","arrang","their","marriag",".","A","reluct","Shweta","give","her","accent",".","It","is","then","that","she","start","see","Rohit",",","while","Gaurav","start","drift","away","from","her",",","and","unknown","to","anyon",",","is","hide","a","dead","secret",".","The","question","remain","is","Shweta","delusion",",","and","what","exact","is","Gaurav","'s","secret","that","he","doe","not","want","anyon","to","know","?"],"lemmas":["the","wealthy","Kapoor","family","consist","of","Madanlal",",","he","wife",",","Geetarani",",","daughter",",","Roshni",",","and","son",",","Gaurav",".","one","day","while","Gaurav","be","return","home","from","the","oriental","Bank","of","Commerce",",","he","be","attack","by","a","group","of","man","lead","by","shiva",",","but","a","young","man","name","Rohit","Malhotra","come","to","he","rescue",".","Gaurav","hire","Rohit","in","he","firm",",","and","both","become","fast","and","inseparable","friend",".","both","unknowingly","fall","in","love","with","the","same","woman",",","Shweta","Sharma",",","but","Gaurav","find","out","and","decide","to","step","away",".","Shweta","and","Rohit","be","in","love","and","want","to","get","marry",".","then","shiva","attack","Rohit","and","throw","he","off","a","cliff",".","believe","he","to","be","dead",",","a","shocked","and","devastate","Shweta","lose","she","voice",".","the","Kapoors","find","out","that","Gaurav","love","Shweta","and","they","approach","she","brother",",","Shekhar",",","and","arrange","they","marriage",".","a","reluctant","Shweta","give","she","accent",".","it","be","then","that","she","start","see","Rohit",",","while","Gaurav","start","drift","away","from","she",",","and","unknown","to","anyone",",","be","hide","a","deadly","secret",".","the","question","remain","be","Shweta","delusional",",","and","what","exactly","be","Gaurav","'s","secret","that","he","do","not","want","anyone","to","know","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

{"title":"Bloody Island","plot":"The world now knows the story of this small town massacre, seven Community Service workers and many others, on one horrendous weekend lead by officer Bob Butterfield, an old childhood tormentor of psychiatric serial killer Billy Fouls, but they don't know that you can't kill Billy. Getting ready to take a break from reality for a while, Officer Bob Butterfield agrees to one last job, a few hundred miles away, at an abandon amusement park on a private island. With two x Marines joining on the journey as Community Service Officers, no better way to keep the ten Community Service Workers in line, right? The owner of the amusement park, a cracked out clown, and his pal, \"a little person\", are always on premise and loves to put on a good show for the very few who find this island. The question is, will they be the ones putting on the show.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["The","world","now","know","the","stori","of","this","small","town","massacr",",","seven","Commun","Servic","worker","and","mani","other",",","on","one","horrend","weekend","lead","by","offic","Bob","Butterfield",",","an","old","childhood","tormentor","of","psychiatr","serial","killer","Billi","Foul",",","but","they","do","n't","know","that","you","ca","n't","kill","Billi",".","Get","readi","to","take","a","break","from","realiti","for","a","while",",","Officer","Bob","Butterfield","agre","to","one","last","job",",","a","few","hundr","mile","away",",","at","an","abandon","amus","park","on","a","privat","island",".","With","two","x","Marin","join","on","the","journey","as","Commun","Servic","Officer",",","no","better","way","to","keep","the","ten","Commun","Servic","Worker","in","line",",","right","?","The","owner","of","the","amus","park",",","a","crack","out","clown",",","and","his","pal",",","\"","a","littl","person","\"",",","are","alway","on","premis","and","love","to","put","on","a","good","show","for","the","veri","few","who","find","this","island",".","The","question","is",",","will","they","be","the","one","put","on","the","show","."],"lemmas":["the","world","now","know","the","story","of","this","small","town","massacre",",","seven","Community","Service","worker","and","many","other",",","on","one","horrendous","weekend","lead","by","officer","Bob","Butterfield",",","a","old","childhood","tormentor","of","psychiatric","serial","killer","Billy","Fouls",",","but","they","do","not","know","that","you","can","not","kill","Billy",".","get","ready","to","take","a","break","from","reality","for","a","while",",","Officer","Bob","Butterfield","agree","to","one","last","job",",","a","few","hundred","mile","away",",","at","a","abandon","amusement","park","on","a","private","island",".","with","two","x","Marines","join","on","the","journey","as","Community","Service","Officers",",","no","better","way","to","keep","the","ten","Community","Service","Workers","in","line",",","right","?","the","owner","of","the","amusement","park",",","a","crack","out","clown",",","and","he","pal",",","``","a","little","person","''",",","be","always","on","premise","and","love","to","put","on","a","good","show","for","the","very","few","who","find","this","island",".","the","question","be",",","will","they","be","the","one","put","on","the","show","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The

{"title":"Mundaka","plot":"A thousand year old Basque fishing village reflects on the changes brought about by the introduction of surfing in the early 70's. Now, 30 years since the first surfers arrived, the village of Mundaka plays host to one of surfing's biggest events on the World Championship Tour. How the town people cope with the transformation of a slow-paced village into an over-crowded, hustling destination for surfers, spectators, media, and travelers exposes the fragile relationship between the town and the event.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","thousand","year","old","Basqu","fish","villag","reflect","on","the","chang","brought","about","by","the","introduct","of","surf","in","the","earli","70","'s",".","Now",",","30","year","sinc","the","first","surfer","arriv",",","the","villag","of","Mundaka","play","host","to","one","of","surf","'s","biggest","event","on","the","World","Championship","Tour",".","How","the","town","peopl","cope","with","the","transform","of","a","slow-pac","villag","into","an","over-crowd",",","hustl","destin","for","surfer",",","spectat",",","media",",","and","travel","expos","the","fragil","relationship","between","the","town","and","the","event","."],"lemmas":["a","thousand","year","old","basque","fishing","village","reflect","on","the","change","bring","about","by","the","introduction","of","surfing","in","the","early","70","'s",".","now",",","30","year","since","the","first","surfer","arrive",",","the","village","of","mundaka","play","host","to","one","of","surfing","'s","biggest","event","on","the","World","Championship","Tour",".","how","the","town","people","cope","with","the","transformation","of","a","slow-paced","village","into","a","over-crowded",",","hustle","destination","for","surfer",",","spectator",",","media",",","and","traveler","expose","the","fragile","relationship","between","the","town","and","the","event","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A thousand year","thousand year old","year old Basque","old Basque fishing","Basque fishing village","fishing village reflects","village reflects on","reflects on the","on the changes","the changes brought","changes brought about","brought about by","about by the","by the introduction","the introduction of","introduction of surfing","of surfing in","surfing in the","in the early","the early 70","early 70 's","Now , 30",", 30 years","30 years since","years since the","since the first","the first surfers","first surfers arrived","surfers arrived ,","arrived , the",", the village","the village of","village of Mundaka","of Mundaka plays","Mundaka plays host","plays host to","host to one","to one of","one of surfing","of surfing 's","surfing 's biggest","'s biggest events","biggest events on","events on the","on the World","the World Championship","World Championship Tour","How the town","the town people","town people cope","people cope with","cope with the","with the transformation","the transformation of","transformation of a","of a slow-paced","a slow-paced village","slow-paced village into","village into an","into an over-crowded","an over-crowded ,","over-crowded , hustling",", hustling destination","hustling destination for","destination for surfers","for surfers ,","surfers , spectators",", spectators ,","spectators , media",", media ,","media , and",", and travelers","and travelers exposes","travelers exposes the","exposes the fragile","the fragile relationship","fragile relationship between","relationship between the","between the town","the town and","town and the","and the event"],"2grams":["A thousand","thousand year","year old","old Basque","Basque fishing","fishing village","village reflects","reflects on","on the","the changes","changes brought","brought about","about by","by the","the introduction","introduction of","of surfing","surfing in","in the","the early","early 70","70 's","Now ,",", 30","30 years","years since","since the","the first","first surfers","surfers arrived","arrived ,",", the","the village","village of","of Mundaka","Mundaka plays","plays host","host to","to one","one of","of surfing","surfing 's","'s biggest","biggest events","events on","on the","the World","World Championship","Championship Tour","How the","the town","town people","people cope","cope with","with the","the transformation","transformation of","of a","a slow-paced","slow-paced village","village into","into an","an over-crowded","over-crowded ,",", hustling","hustling destination","destination for","for surfers","surfers ,",", spectators","spectators ,",", media","media ,",", and","and travelers","travelers exposes","exposes the","the fragile","fragile relationship","relationship between","between the","the town","town and","and the","the event"]}

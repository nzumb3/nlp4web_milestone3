{"title":"New Beijing: Reinventing a City","plot":"As China emerges as the new economic powerhouse of the 21-century, no one can disrupt the biggest construction boom in the world's history. We marvel at the Beijing's bright new face as international architects create new icons - the Watercube, Birds Nest, Stadium, and National Theatre. The architects of the iconic buildings and their visions for the future contrast with those of heritage activist Zhang Jinqi. His photography exhibition 'Memories of China' documents the last heritage districts of the old city which are soon to be demolished. With 400 cities of the size of Beijing to build by 2020 the China has little time to reflect on the past.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["As","China","emerg","as","the","new","econom","powerhous","of","the","21-centuri",",","no","one","can","disrupt","the","biggest","construct","boom","in","the","world","'s","histori",".","We","marvel","at","the","Beij","'s","bright","new","face","as","intern","architect","creat","new","icon","-","the","Watercub",",","Bird","Nest",",","Stadium",",","and","Nation","Theatr",".","The","architect","of","the","icon","build","and","their","vision","for","the","futur","contrast","with","those","of","heritag","activist","Zhang","Jinqi",".","His","photographi","exhibit","'","Memori","of","China","'","document","the","last","heritag","district","of","the","old","citi","which","are","soon","to","be","demolish",".","With","400","citi","of","the","size","of","Beij","to","build","by","2020","the","China","has","littl","time","to","reflect","on","the","past","."],"lemmas":["as","China","emerge","as","the","new","economic","powerhouse","of","the","21-century",",","no","one","can","disrupt","the","biggest","construction","boom","in","the","world","'s","history",".","we","marvel","at","the","Beijing","'s","bright","new","face","as","international","architect","create","new","icon","-","the","Watercube",",","Birds","Nest",",","Stadium",",","and","National","Theatre",".","the","architect","of","the","iconic","building","and","they","vision","for","the","future","contrast","with","those","of","heritage","activist","Zhang","Jinqi",".","he","photography","exhibition","'","Memories","of","China","'","document","the","last","heritage","district","of","the","old","city","which","be","soon","to","be","demolish",".","with","400","city","of","the","size","of","Beijing","to","build","by","2020","the","China","have","little","time","to","reflect","on","the","past","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["As China emerges","China emerges as","emerges as the","as the new","the new economic","new economic powerhouse","economic powerhouse of","powerhouse of the","of the 21-century","the 21-century ,","21-century , no",", no one","no one can","one can disrupt","can disrupt the","disrupt the biggest","the biggest construction","biggest construction boom","construction boom in","boom in the","in the world","the world 's","world 's history","We marvel at","marvel at the","at the Beijing","the Beijing 's","Beijing 's bright","'s bright new","bright new face","new face as","face as international","as international architects","international architects create","architects create new","create new icons","new icons -","icons -

{"title":"Ghost Exchange","plot":"'Ghost Exchange' probes the volatile state of U.S. capital markets and their critical impact on America's economic future. The film explores the acceleration of the evolution of U.S. stock exchanges, and uncovers the risks resulting from this wholesale adoption. Wall Street has transformed from the world of human touch trading, to computer algorithm trading- where stocks are owned for mere microseconds. The thought-provoking documentary also examines how recent financial headlines are a direct result of automated systems running unchecked. The capital market system that many considered as the world's best, may have been inadvertently lost by the pursuit of speed and efficiencies that we still do not truly understand. Wall Street has become a 'ghost exchange'.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["'","Ghost","Exchang","'","probe","the","volatil","state","of","U.S.","capit","market","and","their","critic","impact","on","America","'s","econom","futur",".","The","film","explor","the","acceler","of","the","evolut","of","U.S.","stock","exchang",",","and","uncov","the","risk","result","from","this","wholesal","adopt",".","Wall","Street","has","transform","from","the","world","of","human","touch","trade",",","to","comput","algorithm","trade","-","where","stock","are","own","for","mere","microsecond",".","The","thought-provok","documentari","also","examin","how","recent","financi","headlin","are","a","direct","result","of","autom","system","run","uncheck",".","The","capit","market","system","that","mani","consid","as","the","world","'s","best",",","may","have","been","inadvert","lost","by","the","pursuit","of","speed","and","effici","that","we","still","do","not","truli","understand",".","Wall","Street","has","becom","a","'","ghost","exchang","'","."],"lemmas":["'","ghost","Exchange","'","probe","the","volatile","state","of","U.S.","capital","market","and","they","critical","impact","on","America","'s","economic","future",".","the","film","explore","the","acceleration","of","the","evolution","of","U.S.","stock","exchange",",","and","uncover","the","risk","result","from","this","wholesale","adoption",".","Wall","Street","have","transform","from","the","world","of","human","touch","trading",",","to","computer","algorithm","trading","-","where","stock","be","own","for","mere","microsecond",".","the","thought-provoking","documentary","also","examine","how","recent","financial","headline","be","a","direct","result","of","automated","system","run","unchecked",".","the","capital","market","system","that","many","consider","as","the","world","'s","best",",","may","have","be","inadvertently","lose","by","the","pursuit","of","speed","and","efficiency","that","we","still","do","not","truly","understand",".","Wall","Street","have","become","a","'","ghost","exchange","'","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Ghost Exchange","Ghost Exchange '","Exchange ' probes","' probes the","probes the volatile","the volatile state","volatile state of","state of U.S.","of U.S. capital","U.S. capital markets","capital markets and","markets and their","and their critical","their critical impact","critical impact on","impact on America","on America 's","America 's economic","'s economic future","The film explores","film explores the","explores the acceleration","the acceleration of","acceleration of the","of the evolution","the evolution of","evolution of U.S.","of U.S. stock","U.S. stock exchanges","stock exchanges ,","exchanges , and",", and uncovers","and uncovers the","uncovers the risks","the risks resulting","risks resulting from","resulting from this","from this wholesale","this wholesale adoption","Wall Street has","Street has transformed","has transformed from","transformed from the","from the world","the world of","world of human","of human touch","human touch trading","touch trading ,","trading , to",", to computer","to computer algorithm","computer algorithm trading","algorithm trading -","trading -

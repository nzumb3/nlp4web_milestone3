{"title":"Kranti","plot":"Ringo's directional debut Kranti marks the beginning of a new era of Bengali action films. In the credits the director says he has been inspired to make this film by John Woo and Ram Gopal Verma and he has tried to make this film on the theme of Shiva. It is the story of a student Jeet (Jeet) who arrives in the city with his parents and sister after changing residences. Their struggle for existence in that city begins from that very moment. Everyone is terrified of Vishnu (Ashish Vidyarthi), the local don, and it turns out that Deva (Rishi Kaushik) is the Don's younger brother who studies in the same college as Jeet. Deva is the biggest trouble maker in the college along with his gang and nothing stops them from creating trouble including teasing and passing coarse comments at girls . Jeet tries to take control of the situation and there are a number of occasions when he clashes with Deva and beats up a few of his key associates. In retaliation Vishnu's men cause havoc by raping Jeet's elder sister Debosree (Locket Chatterjee) , killing his close friend from college Iqbal (Biswanath Basu) and finally killing his father (Bodhisatwa Majumdar) . All these incidents have a tremendous impact on Jeet who decides to kill Vishnu at any cost. He achieves success at the end of the film when he kills Deva and then finishes off Vishnu and takes his revenge.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Ringo","'s","direct","debut","Kranti","mark","the","begin","of","a","new","era","of","Bengali","action","film",".","In","the","credit","the","director","say","he","has","been","inspir","to","make","this","film","by","John","Woo","and","Ram","Gopal","Verma","and","he","has","tri","to","make","this","film","on","the","theme","of","Shiva",".","It","is","the","stori","of","a","student","Jeet","(","Jeet",")","who","arriv","in","the","citi","with","his","parent","and","sister","after","chang","resid",".","Their","struggl","for","exist","in","that","citi","begin","from","that","veri","moment",".","Everyon","is","terrifi","of","Vishnu","(","Ashish","Vidyarthi",")",",","the","local","don",",","and","it","turn","out","that","Deva","(","Rishi","Kaushik",")","is","the","Don","'s","younger","brother","who","studi","in","the","same","colleg","as","Jeet",".","Deva","is","the","biggest","troubl","maker","in","the","colleg","along","with","his","gang","and","noth","stop","them","from","creat","troubl","includ","teas","and","pass","coars","comment","at","girl",".","Jeet","tri","to","take","control","of","the","situat","and","there","are","a","number","of","occas","when","he","clash","with","Deva","and","beat","up","a","few","of","his","key","associ",".","In","retali","Vishnu","'s","men","caus","havoc","by","rape","Jeet","'s","elder","sister","Debosre","(","Locket","Chatterje",")",",","kill","his","close","friend","from","colleg","Iqbal","(","Biswanath","Basu",")","and","final","kill","his","father","(","Bodhisatwa","Majumdar",")",".","All","these","incid","have","a","tremend","impact","on","Jeet","who","decid","to","kill","Vishnu","at","ani","cost",".","He","achiev","success","at","the","end","of","the","film","when","he","kill","Deva","and","then","finish","off","Vishnu","and","take","his","reveng","."],"lemmas":["Ringo","'s","directional","debut","Kranti","mark","the","beginning","of","a","new","era","of","Bengali","action","film",".","in","the","credit","the","director","say","he","have","be","inspire","to","make","this","film","by","John","Woo","and","Ram","Gopal","Verma","and","he","have","try","to","make","this","film","on","the","theme","of","shiva",".","it","be","the","story","of","a","student","Jeet","-lrb-","Jeet","-rrb-","who","arrive","in","the","city","with","he","parent","and","sister","after","change","residence",".","they","struggle","for","existence","in","that","city","begin","from","that","very","moment",".","everyone","be","terrify","of","Vishnu","-lrb-","Ashish","Vidyarthi","-rrb-",",","the","local","don",",","and","it","turn","out","that","Deva","-lrb-","Rishi","Kaushik","-rrb-","be","the","Don","'s","younger","brother","who","study","in","the","same","college","as","Jeet",".","Deva","be","the","biggest","trouble","maker","in","the","college","along","with","he","gang","and","nothing","stop","they","from","create","trouble","include","tease","and","pass","coarse","comment","at","girl",".","Jeet","try","to","take","control","of","the","situation","and","there","be","a","number","of","occasion","when","he","clash","with","deva","and","beat","up","a","few","of","he","key","associate",".","in","retaliation","Vishnu","'s","man","cause","havoc","by","rape","Jeet","'s","elder","sister","Debosree","-lrb-","Locket","Chatterjee","-rrb-",",","kill","he","close","friend","from","college","Iqbal","-lrb-","Biswanath","Basu","-rrb-","and","finally","kill","he","father","-lrb-","Bodhisatwa","Majumdar","-rrb-",".","all","these","incident","have","a","tremendous","impact","on","Jeet","who","decide","to","kill","Vishnu","at","any","cost",".","he","achieve","success","at","the","end","of","the","film","when","he","kill","Deva","and","then","finish","off","Vishnu","and","take","he","revenge","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ringo

But a person who is gone will never come by.' The film's mind-frame is the same as the elegy above. It's a story about the death of the Chinese young generation.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["'","Dew","On","Scallion","'","is","an","ancient","elegi","which","sang",":","'","Dew","on","scallion","is","so","easili","dri",".","Dri","and","then","next","day","it","would","still","cri",".","But","a","person","who","is","gone","will","never","come","by",".","'","The","film","'s","mind-fram","is","the","same","as","the","elegi","abov",".","It","'s","a","stori","about","the","death","of","the","Chines","young","generat","."],"lemmas":["'","dew","on","scallion","'","be","a","ancient","elegy","which","sing",":","'","dew","on","scallion","be","so","easily","dry",".","dry","and","then","next","day","it","would","still","cry",".","but","a","person","who","be","go","will","never","come","by",".","'","the","film","'s","mind-frame","be","the","same","as","the","elegy","above",".","it","be","a","story","about","the","death","of","the","chinese","young","generation","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["' Dew On","Dew On Scallions","On Scallions '","Scallions ' is","' is an","is an ancient","an ancient elegy","ancient elegy which","elegy which sang","which sang :","sang : '",": ' Dew","' Dew on","Dew on scallions","on scallions is","scallions is so","is so easily","so easily dried","Dried and then","and then next","then next day","next day it","day it would","it would still","would still cry","But a person","a person who","person who is","who is gone","is gone will","gone will never","will never come","never come by","come by .","by .

{"title":"A Dog's Breakfast","plot":"If you've never been good at anything in your life, why would murder be any different? A Dog's Breakfast is a head smacking, bone breaking, fiancé bashing romp, about a family that just loves themselves to pieces. Patrick has always had a somewhat combative relationship with his little sister Marilyn. But when she brings home her new TV star fiancé Ryan, it's all out war. When Patrick fails to drive a wedge between the happy couple, he reaches for sharper instruments. Every family has a few skeletons in the closet; A Dog's Breakfast is the nightmarishly funny mess Patrick makes when he tries to add another to his.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["If","you","ve","never","been","good","at","anyth","in","your","life",",","whi","would","murder","be","ani","differ","?","A","Dog","'s","Breakfast","is","a","head","smack",",","bone","break",",","fiancé","bash","romp",",","about","a","famili","that","just","love","themselv","to","piec",".","Patrick","has","alway","had","a","somewhat","combat","relationship","with","his","littl","sister","Marilyn",".","But","when","she","bring","home","her","new","TV","star","fiancé","Ryan",",","it","'s","all","out","war",".","When","Patrick","fail","to","drive","a","wedg","between","the","happi","coupl",",","he","reach","for","sharper","instrument",".","Everi","famili","has","a","few","skeleton","in","the","closet",";","A","Dog","'s","Breakfast","is","the","nightmarish","funni","mess","Patrick","make","when","he","tri","to","add","anoth","to","his","."],"lemmas":["if","you","have","never","be","good","at","anything","in","you","life",",","why","would","murder","be","any","different","?","a","dog","'s","breakfast","be","a","head","smacking",",","bone","breaking",",","fiancé","bash","romp",",","about","a","family","that","just","love","themselves","to","piece",".","Patrick","have","always","have","a","somewhat","combative","relationship","with","he","little","sister","Marilyn",".","but","when","she","bring","home","she","new","tv","star","fiancé","Ryan",",","it","be","all","out","war",".","when","Patrick","fail","to","drive","a","wedge","between","the","happy","couple",",","he","reach","for","sharper","instrument",".","every","family","have","a","few","skeleton","in","the","closet",";","a","dog","'s","breakfast","be","the","nightmarishly","funny","mess","Patrick","make","when","he","try","to","add","another","to","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["If you 've","you 've never","'ve never been","never been good","been good at","good at anything","at anything in","anything in your","in your life","your life ,","life , why",", why would","why would murder","would murder be","murder be any","be any different","A Dog 's","Dog 's Breakfast","'s Breakfast is","Breakfast is a","is a head","a head smacking","head smacking ,","smacking , bone",", bone breaking","bone breaking ,","breaking , fiancé",", fiancé bashing","fiancé bashing romp","bashing romp ,","romp , about",", about a","about a family","a family that","family that just","that just loves","just loves themselves","loves themselves to","themselves to pieces","Patrick has always","has always had","always had a","had a somewhat","a somewhat combative","somewhat combative relationship","combative relationship with","relationship with his","with his little","his little sister","little sister Marilyn","But when she","when she brings","she brings home","brings home her","home her new","her new TV","new TV star","TV star fiancé","star fiancé Ryan","fiancé Ryan ,","Ryan , it",", it 's","it 's all","'s all out","all out war","When Patrick fails","Patrick fails to","fails to drive","to drive a","drive a wedge","a wedge between","wedge between the","between the happy","the happy couple","happy couple ,","couple , he",", he reaches","he reaches for","reaches for sharper","for sharper instruments","Every family has","family has a","has a few","a few skeletons","few skeletons in","skeletons in the","in the closet","the closet ;","closet ;

{"title":"Injury Slight... Please Advise","plot":"Ace fighter pilot, Charles O'Sullivan, is shot down in New Guinea during WWII. He crash lands his plane and survives 30 days in the jungle. Sully happens upon a village in the jungle, finding himself subject to a tribe of headhunters who attack him. Sully shoots his way out of the village and is then hunted through the jungle. Thirty days after his crash, Sully discovers a friendly Australian patrol that sees him safely back to his base. Fifty years later the wreckage of O'Sullivan's plane is discovered in the jungle. When Sully attempts to visit his plane, he learns that the story of his shoot out is still being told among the locals in New Guinea, endangering his life if he returns.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Ace","fighter","pilot",",","Charl","O'Sullivan",",","is","shot","down","in","New","Guinea","dure","WWII",".","He","crash","land","his","plane","and","surviv","30","day","in","the","jungl",".","Sulli","happen","upon","a","villag","in","the","jungl",",","find","himself","subject","to","a","tribe","of","headhunt","who","attack","him",".","Sulli","shoot","his","way","out","of","the","villag","and","is","then","hunt","through","the","jungl",".","Thirti","day","after","his","crash",",","Sulli","discov","a","friend","Australian","patrol","that","see","him","safe","back","to","his","base",".","Fifti","year","later","the","wreckag","of","O'Sullivan","'s","plane","is","discov","in","the","jungl",".","When","Sulli","attempt","to","visit","his","plane",",","he","learn","that","the","stori","of","his","shoot","out","is","still","be","told","among","the","local","in","New","Guinea",",","endang","his","life","if","he","return","."],"lemmas":["ace","fighter","pilot",",","Charles","O'Sullivan",",","be","shoot","down","in","New","Guinea","during","WWII",".","he","crash","land","he","plane","and","survive","30","day","in","the","jungle",".","Sully","happen","upon","a","village","in","the","jungle",",","find","himself","subject","to","a","tribe","of","headhunter","who","attack","he",".","Sully","shoot","he","way","out","of","the","village","and","be","then","hunt","through","the","jungle",".","thirty","day","after","he","crash",",","Sully","discover","a","friendly","australian","patrol","that","see","he","safely","back","to","he","base",".","fifty","year","later","the","wreckage","of","o'sullivan","'s","plane","be","discover","in","the","jungle",".","when","Sully","attempt","to","visit","he","plane",",","he","learn","that","the","story","of","he","shoot","out","be","still","be","tell","among","the","local","in","New","Guinea",",","endanger","he","life","if","he","return","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Ace

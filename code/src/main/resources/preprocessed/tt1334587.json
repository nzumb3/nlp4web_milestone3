{"title":"The Catfish Summer","plot":"A small-time hustler Jarda Kuchar (Petr Ctvrtnícek) every summer rents his apartment only to escape to a remote lake in the middle of nowhere. For three months each year he is the big-city-weary hotshot in a former holiday resort, especially for a local villager named Kamil Hospes (Josef Polásek), with whom Jarda runs a picturesque pub, the Tropicana. The regulars consist of a pair of odd-ball brothers, Jirka and Peter, and a caretaker of the local transformer, Pepa Vrtilek. However, this season will be different: a local legend - a monster of a catfish called Lojza - has appeared! Ever the opportunist, Jarda sees a chance to improve his income: by inviting all the fishermen to a grand \"fish out\". Jarda secretly calls \"The Successful Fisherman\" magazine to attract the fishing public. \"The public\" in this case is represented by a father/son duo with a secret ambition to be on the cover of the magazine, no matter what! But this is only the beginning of Jarda's problems. A surprise visit from his 20-year-old daughter Pavla, whom Jarda avoided for three years, is under way...","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","small-tim","hustler","Jarda","Kuchar","(","Petr","Ctvrtnícek",")","everi","summer","rent","his","apart","onli","to","escap","to","a","remot","lake","in","the","middl","of","nowher",".","For","three","month","each","year","he","is","the","big-city-weari","hotshot","in","a","former","holiday","resort",",","especi","for","a","local","villag","name","Kamil","Hosp","(","Josef","Polásek",")",",","with","whom","Jarda","run","a","picturesqu","pub",",","the","Tropicana",".","The","regular","consist","of","a","pair","of","odd-bal","brother",",","Jirka","and","Peter",",","and","a","caretak","of","the","local","transform",",","Pepa","Vrtilek",".","Howev",",","this","season","will","be","differ",":","a","local","legend","-","a","monster","of","a","catfish","call","Lojza","-","has","appear","!","Ever","the","opportunist",",","Jarda","see","a","chanc","to","improv","his","incom",":","by","invit","all","the","fishermen","to","a","grand","\"","fish","out","\"",".","Jarda","secret","call","\"","The","Success","Fisherman","\"","magazin","to","attract","the","fish","public",".","\"","The","public","\"","in","this","case","is","repres","by","a","father/son","duo","with","a","secret","ambit","to","be","on","the","cover","of","the","magazin",",","no","matter","what","!","But","this","is","onli","the","begin","of","Jarda","'s","problem",".","A","surpris","visit","from","his","20-year-old","daughter","Pavla",",","whom","Jarda","avoid","for","three","year",",","is","under","way","..."],"lemmas":["a","small-time","hustler","Jarda","Kuchar","-lrb-","Petr","Ctvrtnícek","-rrb-","every","summer","rent","he","apartment","only","to","escape","to","a","remote","lake","in","the","middle","of","nowhere",".","for","three","month","each","year","he","be","the","big-city-weary","hotshot","in","a","former","holiday","resort",",","especially","for","a","local","villager","name","Kamil","Hospes","-lrb-","Josef","Polásek","-rrb-",",","with","whom","Jarda","run","a","picturesque","pub",",","the","Tropicana",".","the","regular","consist","of","a","pair","of","odd-ball","brother",",","Jirka","and","Peter",",","and","a","caretaker","of","the","local","transformer",",","Pepa","Vrtilek",".","however",",","this","season","will","be","different",":","a","local","legend","-","a","monster","of","a","catfish","call","Lojza","-","have","appear","!","ever","the","opportunist",",","Jarda","see","a","chance","to","improve","he","income",":","by","invite","all","the","fisherman","to","a","grand","``","fish","out","''",".","Jarda","secretly","call","``","the","successful","fisherman","''","magazine","to","attract","the","fishing","public",".","``","the","public","''","in","this","case","be","represent","by","a","father/son","duo","with","a","secret","ambition","to","be","on","the","cover","of","the","magazine",",","no","matter","what","!","but","this","be","only","the","beginning","of","Jarda","'s","problem",".","a","surprise","visit","from","he","20-year-old","daughter","Pavla",",","whom","Jarda","avoid","for","three","year",",","be","under","way","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

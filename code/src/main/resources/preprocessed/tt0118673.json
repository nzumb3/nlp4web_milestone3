{"title":"Bade Miyan Chote Miyan","plot":"Fellow Police Inspectors Arjun and Pyare work in the same Police Station in Mumbai, India. Although they work together, they have an unhealthy rivalry between them - leading to considerable acrimony and inefficiency. Then things get worse when a series of crimes and robberies take place - with witnesses coming forward and identifying them as the culprits. Their seniors view this matter very seriously, hold an inquiry, get evidence of their involvement, and suspend them. Now Arjun and Pyare must fore-go all past rivalries, band together and find out who framed them - and why?","genres":["Action"," Musical"," Comedy"],"stems":["Fellow","Polic","Inspector","Arjun","and","Pyar","work","in","the","same","Polic","Station","in","Mumbai",",","India",".","Although","they","work","togeth",",","they","have","an","unhealthi","rivalri","between","them","-","lead","to","consider","acrimoni","and","ineffici",".","Then","thing","get","wors","when","a","seri","of","crime","and","robberi","take","place","-","with","wit","come","forward","and","identifi","them","as","the","culprit",".","Their","senior","view","this","matter","veri","serious",",","hold","an","inquiri",",","get","evid","of","their","involv",",","and","suspend","them",".","Now","Arjun","and","Pyar","must","fore-go","all","past","rivalri",",","band","togeth","and","find","out","who","frame","them","-","and","whi","?"],"lemmas":["Fellow","Police","Inspectors","Arjun","and","Pyare","work","in","the","same","Police","Station","in","Mumbai",",","India",".","although","they","work","together",",","they","have","a","unhealthy","rivalry","between","they","-","lead","to","considerable","acrimony","and","inefficiency",".","then","thing","get","worse","when","a","series","of","crime","and","robbery","take","place","-","with","witness","come","forward","and","identify","they","as","the","culprit",".","they","senior","view","this","matter","very","seriously",",","hold","a","inquiry",",","get","evidence","of","they","involvement",",","and","suspend","they",".","now","Arjun","and","Pyare","must","fore-go","all","past","rivalry",",","band","together","and","find","out","who","frame","they","-","and","why","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Fellow Police Inspectors","Police Inspectors Arjun","Inspectors Arjun and","Arjun and Pyare","and Pyare work","Pyare work in","work in the","in the same","the same Police","same Police Station","Police Station in","Station in Mumbai","in Mumbai ,","Mumbai , India","Although they work","they work together","work together ,","together , they",", they have","they have an","have an unhealthy","an unhealthy rivalry","unhealthy rivalry between","rivalry between them","between them -","them - leading","- leading to","leading to considerable","to considerable acrimony","considerable acrimony and","acrimony and inefficiency","Then things get","things get worse","get worse when","worse when a","when a series","a series of","series of crimes","of crimes and","crimes and robberies","and robberies take","robberies take place","take place -","place - with","- with witnesses","with witnesses coming","witnesses coming forward","coming forward and","forward and identifying","and identifying them","identifying them as","them as the","as the culprits","Their seniors view","seniors view this","view this matter","this matter very","matter very seriously","very seriously ,","seriously , hold",", hold an","hold an inquiry","an inquiry ,","inquiry , get",", get evidence","get evidence of","evidence of their","of their involvement","their involvement ,","involvement , and",", and suspend","and suspend them","Now Arjun and","Arjun and Pyare","and Pyare must","Pyare must fore-go","must fore-go all","fore-go all past","all past rivalries","past rivalries ,","rivalries , band",", band together","band together and","together and find","and find out","find out who","out who framed","who framed them","framed them -","them - and","- and why"],"2grams":["Fellow Police","Police Inspectors","Inspectors Arjun","Arjun and","and Pyare","Pyare work","work in","in the","the same","same Police","Police Station","Station in","in Mumbai","Mumbai ,",", India","Although they","they work","work together","together ,",", they","they have","have an","an unhealthy","unhealthy rivalry","rivalry between","between them","them -","- leading","leading to","to considerable","considerable acrimony","acrimony and","and inefficiency","Then things","things get","get worse","worse when","when a","a series","series of","of crimes","crimes and","and robberies","robberies take","take place","place -","- with","with witnesses","witnesses coming","coming forward","forward and","and identifying","identifying them","them as","as the","the culprits","Their seniors","seniors view","view this","this matter","matter very","very seriously","seriously ,",", hold","hold an","an inquiry","inquiry ,",", get","get evidence","evidence of","of their","their involvement","involvement ,",", and","and suspend","suspend them","Now Arjun","Arjun and","and Pyare","Pyare must","must fore-go","fore-go all","all past","past rivalries","rivalries ,",", band","band together","together and","and find","find out","out who","who framed","framed them","them -","- and","and why"]}

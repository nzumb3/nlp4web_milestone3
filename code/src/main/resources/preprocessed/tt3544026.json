{"title":"Wakhan","plot":"Wakhan, a cinematic poem, sketches two tribes: the Wakhis and the Kyrgyz. Filmed in furthest reaches of this mythical, Hindu-Kush plateau, and far removed from the Taliban, it's an exploration in the pursuit of pure, non-verbal sensations. This journey through the Wakhan Corridor connects with the daily lives of these reclusive peoples living at altitudes of 4,000 m. Artistic, experiential and impressionistic, Wakhan, a documentary, peers into this mysterious Afghan reality.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["Wakhan",",","a","cinemat","poem",",","sketch","two","tribe",":","the","Wakhi","and","the","Kyrgyz",".","Film","in","furthest","reach","of","this","mythic",",","Hindu-Kush","plateau",",","and","far","remov","from","the","Taliban",",","it","'s","an","explor","in","the","pursuit","of","pure",",","non-verb","sensat",".","This","journey","through","the","Wakhan","Corridor","connect","with","the","daili","live","of","these","reclus","peopl","live","at","altitud","of","4,000","m.","Artistic",",","experienti","and","impressionist",",","Wakhan",",","a","documentari",",","peer","into","this","mysteri","Afghan","realiti","."],"lemmas":["Wakhan",",","a","cinematic","poem",",","sketch","two","tribe",":","the","Wakhis","and","the","Kyrgyz",".","film","in","furthest","reach","of","this","mythical",",","hindu-kush","plateau",",","and","far","remove","from","the","Taliban",",","it","be","a","exploration","in","the","pursuit","of","pure",",","non-verbal","sensation",".","this","journey","through","the","Wakhan","Corridor","connect","with","the","daily","life","of","these","reclusive","people","live","at","altitude","of","4,000","m.","Artistic",",","experiential","and","impressionistic",",","Wakhan",",","a","documentary",",","peer","into","this","mysterious","Afghan","reality","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Wakhan , a",", a cinematic","a cinematic poem","cinematic poem ,","poem , sketches",", sketches two","sketches two tribes","two tribes :","tribes : the",": the Wakhis","the Wakhis and","Wakhis and the","and the Kyrgyz","Filmed in furthest","in furthest reaches","furthest reaches of","reaches of this","of this mythical","this mythical ,","mythical , Hindu-Kush",", Hindu-Kush plateau","Hindu-Kush plateau ,","plateau , and",", and far","and far removed","far removed from","removed from the","from the Taliban","the Taliban ,","Taliban , it",", it 's","it 's an","'s an exploration","an exploration in","exploration in the","in the pursuit","the pursuit of","pursuit of pure","of pure ,","pure , non-verbal",", non-verbal sensations","This journey through","journey through the","through the Wakhan","the Wakhan Corridor","Wakhan Corridor connects","Corridor connects with","connects with the","with the daily","the daily lives","daily lives of","lives of these","of these reclusive","these reclusive peoples","reclusive peoples living","peoples living at","living at altitudes","at altitudes of","altitudes of 4,000","of 4,000 m.","4,000 m.

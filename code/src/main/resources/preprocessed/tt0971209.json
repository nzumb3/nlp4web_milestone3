{"title":"A Perfect Getaway","plot":"For their honeymoon, newlyweds Cliff and Cydney head to the tropical islands of Hawaii. While journeying through the paradisaical countryside the couple encounters Kale and Cleo, two disgruntled hitchhikers and Nick and Gina, two wild but well-meaning spirits who help guide them through the lush jungles. The picturesque waterfalls and scenic mountainsides quickly give way to terror when Cliff and Cydney learn of a grisly murder that occurred nearby and realize that they're being followed by chance acquaintances that suspiciously fit the description of the killers.","genres":["Adventure"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["For","their","honeymoon",",","newlyw","Cliff","and","Cydney","head","to","the","tropic","island","of","Hawaii",".","While","journey","through","the","paradisa","countrysid","the","coupl","encount","Kale","and","Cleo",",","two","disgruntl","hitchhik","and","Nick","and","Gina",",","two","wild","but","well-mean","spirit","who","help","guid","them","through","the","lush","jungl",".","The","picturesqu","waterfal","and","scenic","mountainsid","quick","give","way","to","terror","when","Cliff","and","Cydney","learn","of","a","grisli","murder","that","occur","nearbi","and","realiz","that","they","re","be","follow","by","chanc","acquaint","that","suspici","fit","the","descript","of","the","killer","."],"lemmas":["for","they","honeymoon",",","newlywed","Cliff","and","Cydney","head","to","the","tropical","island","of","Hawaii",".","while","journey","through","the","paradisaical","countryside","the","couple","encounter","Kale","and","Cleo",",","two","disgruntled","hitchhiker","and","Nick","and","Gina",",","two","wild","but","well-meaning","spirit","who","help","guide","they","through","the","lush","jungle",".","the","picturesque","waterfall","and","scenic","mountainside","quickly","give","way","to","terror","when","Cliff","and","Cydney","learn","of","a","grisly","murder","that","occur","nearby","and","realize","that","they","be","be","follow","by","chance","acquaintance","that","suspiciously","fit","the","description","of","the","killer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["For their honeymoon","their honeymoon ,","honeymoon , newlyweds",", newlyweds Cliff","newlyweds Cliff and","Cliff and Cydney","and Cydney head","Cydney head to","head to the","to the tropical","the tropical islands","tropical islands of","islands of Hawaii","While journeying through","journeying through the","through the paradisaical","the paradisaical countryside","paradisaical countryside the","countryside the couple","the couple encounters","couple encounters Kale","encounters Kale and","Kale and Cleo","and Cleo ,","Cleo , two",", two disgruntled","two disgruntled hitchhikers","disgruntled hitchhikers and","hitchhikers and Nick","and Nick and","Nick and Gina","and Gina ,","Gina , two",", two wild","two wild but","wild but well-meaning","but well-meaning spirits","well-meaning spirits who","spirits who help","who help guide","help guide them","guide them through","them through the","through the lush","the lush jungles","The picturesque waterfalls","picturesque waterfalls and","waterfalls and scenic","and scenic mountainsides","scenic mountainsides quickly","mountainsides quickly give","quickly give way","give way to","way to terror","to terror when","terror when Cliff","when Cliff and","Cliff and Cydney","and Cydney learn","Cydney learn of","learn of a","of a grisly","a grisly murder","grisly murder that","murder that occurred","that occurred nearby","occurred nearby and","nearby and realize","and realize that","realize that they","that they 're","they 're being","'re being followed","being followed by","followed by chance","by chance acquaintances","chance acquaintances that","acquaintances that suspiciously","that suspiciously fit","suspiciously fit the","fit the description","the description of","description of the","of the killers"],"2grams":["For their","their honeymoon","honeymoon ,",", newlyweds","newlyweds Cliff","Cliff and","and Cydney","Cydney head","head to","to the","the tropical","tropical islands","islands of","of Hawaii","While journeying","journeying through","through the","the paradisaical","paradisaical countryside","countryside the","the couple","couple encounters","encounters Kale","Kale and","and Cleo","Cleo ,",", two","two disgruntled","disgruntled hitchhikers","hitchhikers and","and Nick","Nick and","and Gina","Gina ,",", two","two wild","wild but","but well-meaning","well-meaning spirits","spirits who","who help","help guide","guide them","them through","through the","the lush","lush jungles","The picturesque","picturesque waterfalls","waterfalls and","and scenic","scenic mountainsides","mountainsides quickly","quickly give","give way","way to","to terror","terror when","when Cliff","Cliff and","and Cydney","Cydney learn","learn of","of a","a grisly","grisly murder","murder that","that occurred","occurred nearby","nearby and","and realize","realize that","that they","they 're","'re being","being followed","followed by","by chance","chance acquaintances","acquaintances that","that suspiciously","suspiciously fit","fit the","the description","description of","of the","the killers"]}

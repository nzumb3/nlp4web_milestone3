{"title":"Jayne Mansfield's Car","plot":"A young man in the 1940s raises a family in Alabama after his wife leaves him for an Englishman and moves to England. When the wife dies, she leaves a request to be brought back to Alabama to be buried, and at that point the man hasn't seen her in nearly 30 years. The two families - her original family she abandoned and her English family - meet and make an attempt to adjust to each other, with uneven results.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","young","man","in","the","1940s","rais","a","famili","in","Alabama","after","his","wife","leav","him","for","an","Englishman","and","move","to","England",".","When","the","wife","die",",","she","leav","a","request","to","be","brought","back","to","Alabama","to","be","buri",",","and","at","that","point","the","man","has","n't","seen","her","in","near","30","year",".","The","two","famili","-","her","origin","famili","she","abandon","and","her","English","famili","-","meet","and","make","an","attempt","to","adjust","to","each","other",",","with","uneven","result","."],"lemmas":["a","young","man","in","the","1940s","raise","a","family","in","Alabama","after","he","wife","leave","he","for","a","Englishman","and","move","to","England",".","when","the","wife","die",",","she","leave","a","request","to","be","bring","back","to","Alabama","to","be","bury",",","and","at","that","point","the","man","have","not","see","she","in","nearly","30","year",".","the","two","family","-","she","original","family","she","abandon","and","she","English","family","-","meet","and","make","a","attempt","to","adjust","to","each","other",",","with","uneven","result","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A young man","young man in","man in the","in the 1940s","the 1940s raises","1940s raises a","raises a family","a family in","family in Alabama","in Alabama after","Alabama after his","after his wife","his wife leaves","wife leaves him","leaves him for","him for an","for an Englishman","an Englishman and","Englishman and moves","and moves to","moves to England","When the wife","the wife dies","wife dies ,","dies , she",", she leaves","she leaves a","leaves a request","a request to","request to be","to be brought","be brought back","brought back to","back to Alabama","to Alabama to","Alabama to be","to be buried","be buried ,","buried , and",", and at","and at that","at that point","that point the","point the man","the man has","man has n't","has n't seen","n't seen her","seen her in","her in nearly","in nearly 30","nearly 30 years","The two families","two families -","families - her","- her original","her original family","original family she","family she abandoned","she abandoned and","abandoned and her","and her English","her English family","English family -","family - meet","- meet and","meet and make","and make an","make an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to adjust","to adjust to","adjust to each","to each other","each other ,","other , with",", with uneven","with uneven results"],"2grams":["A young","young man","man in","in the","the 1940s","1940s raises","raises a","a family","family in","in Alabama","Alabama after","after his","his wife","wife leaves","leaves him","him for","for an","an Englishman","Englishman and","and moves","moves to","to England","When the","the wife","wife dies","dies ,",", she","she leaves","leaves a","a request","request to","to be","be brought","brought back","back to","to Alabama","Alabama to","to be","be buried","buried ,",", and","and at","at that","that point","point the","the man","man has","has n't","n't seen","seen her","her in","in nearly","nearly 30","30 years","The two","two families","families -","- her","her original","original family","family she","she abandoned","abandoned and","and her","her English","English family","family -","- meet","meet and","and make","make an","an attempt","attempt to","to adjust","adjust to","to each","each other","other ,",", with","with uneven","uneven results"]}

{"title":"Know Thy Enemy","plot":"Nemesis is the hottest rapper in rap's hottest city; Miami, the 305. But he has a little secret...he's not really a rapper. As a boy the artistic Nate Harris drew cartoons and dreamed of changing the world. A record label discovers Nate's talent, and offers to make him a star, as a rapper. They create Nemesis, a Hip Hop gangster designed to sell records and spit hate. Fame quickly follows, but at a price. The fans demand true street cred, and to get it, Nate's label turns a fellow rapper and former childhood friend against Nate, spawning a rap feud. The feud quickly escalates into a war, and Nate is trapped in the reality of the fiction he has created. Nate is faced with a choice: Either become a superstar by giving Hip-Hop what it wants; a war between two rap rivals, or, give it what it needs; destroy his real rival, the fictional character and become a true hero; he has the ability to save hip hop...but can he save himself?","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["Nemesi","is","the","hottest","rapper","in","rap","'s","hottest","citi",";","Miami",",","the","305",".","But","he","has","a","littl","secret","...","he","'s","not","realli","a","rapper",".","As","a","boy","the","artist","Nate","Harri","drew","cartoon","and","dream","of","chang","the","world",".","A","record","label","discov","Nate","'s","talent",",","and","offer","to","make","him","a","star",",","as","a","rapper",".","They","creat","Nemesi",",","a","Hip","Hop","gangster","design","to","sell","record","and","spit","hate",".","Fame","quick","follow",",","but","at","a","price",".","The","fan","demand","true","street","cred",",","and","to","get","it",",","Nate","'s","label","turn","a","fellow","rapper","and","former","childhood","friend","against","Nate",",","spawn","a","rap","feud",".","The","feud","quick","escal","into","a","war",",","and","Nate","is","trap","in","the","realiti","of","the","fiction","he","has","creat",".","Nate","is","face","with","a","choic",":","Either","becom","a","superstar","by","give","Hip-Hop","what","it","want",";","a","war","between","two","rap","rival",",","or",",","give","it","what","it","need",";","destroy","his","real","rival",",","the","fiction","charact","and","becom","a","true","hero",";","he","has","the","abil","to","save","hip","hop","...","but","can","he","save","himself","?"],"lemmas":["nemesis","be","the","hottest","rapper","in","rap","'s","hottest","city",";","Miami",",","the","305",".","but","he","have","a","little","secret","...","he","be","not","really","a","rapper",".","as","a","boy","the","artistic","Nate","Harris","draw","cartoon","and","dream","of","change","the","world",".","a","record","label","discover","Nate","'s","talent",",","and","offer","to","make","he","a","star",",","as","a","rapper",".","they","create","Nemesis",",","a","hip","hop","gangster","design","to","sell","record","and","spit","hate",".","Fame","quickly","follow",",","but","at","a","price",".","the","fan","demand","true","street","cred",",","and","to","get","it",",","Nate","'s","label","turn","a","fellow","rapper","and","former","childhood","friend","against","Nate",",","spawn","a","rap","feud",".","the","feud","quickly","escalate","into","a","war",",","and","Nate","be","trap","in","the","reality","of","the","fiction","he","have","create",".","Nate","be","face","with","a","choice",":","Either","become","a","superstar","by","give","Hip-Hop","what","it","want",";","a","war","between","two","rap","rival",",","or",",","give","it","what","it","need",";","destroy","he","real","rival",",","the","fictional","character","and","become","a","true","hero",";","he","have","the","ability","to","save","hip","hop","...","but","can","he","save","himself","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nemesis is the","is the hottest","the hottest rapper","hottest rapper in","rapper in rap","in rap 's","rap 's hottest","'s hottest city","hottest city ;","city ;

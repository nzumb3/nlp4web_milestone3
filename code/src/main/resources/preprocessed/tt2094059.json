{"title":"Mero Euta Saathi Cha","plot":"Jay is too spoiled to inherit his grandfather's vast wealth. When he fails to graduate from college, his grandfather's will sends him back to his ancestral village where, long ago, he made a friend. Shikha, Jay's estranged childhood friend, helps Jay rediscover his humanity. But, Shikha is very sick. She shared her dreams with Jay - to rebuild the orphanage where she lives. Jay realizes that this life where he can choose nothing, where money buys nothing important, is dearer to him than a full of privilege. Can he save Shikha and marry her? Will their dream come true? Will Jay re-inherit his ancestral wealth?","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["Jay","is","too","spoil","to","inherit","his","grandfath","'s","vast","wealth",".","When","he","fail","to","graduat","from","colleg",",","his","grandfath","'s","will","send","him","back","to","his","ancestr","villag","where",",","long","ago",",","he","made","a","friend",".","Shikha",",","Jay","'s","estrang","childhood","friend",",","help","Jay","rediscov","his","human",".","But",",","Shikha","is","veri","sick",".","She","share","her","dream","with","Jay","-","to","rebuild","the","orphanag","where","she","live",".","Jay","realiz","that","this","life","where","he","can","choos","noth",",","where","money","buy","noth","import",",","is","dearer","to","him","than","a","full","of","privileg",".","Can","he","save","Shikha","and","marri","her","?","Will","their","dream","come","true","?","Will","Jay","re-inherit","his","ancestr","wealth","?"],"lemmas":["Jay","be","too","spoil","to","inherit","he","grandfather","'s","vast","wealth",".","when","he","fail","to","graduate","from","college",",","he","grandfather","'s","will","send","he","back","to","he","ancestral","village","where",",","long","ago",",","he","make","a","friend",".","Shikha",",","Jay","'s","estrange","childhood","friend",",","help","Jay","rediscover","he","humanity",".","but",",","Shikha","be","very","sick",".","she","share","she","dream","with","Jay","-","to","rebuild","the","orphanage","where","she","live",".","Jay","realize","that","this","life","where","he","can","choose","nothing",",","where","money","buy","nothing","important",",","be","dearer","to","he","than","a","full","of","privilege",".","can","he","save","Shikha","and","marry","she","?","will","they","dream","come","true","?","Will","Jay","re-inherit","he","ancestral","wealth","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jay is too","is too spoiled","too spoiled to","spoiled to inherit","to inherit his","inherit his grandfather","his grandfather 's","grandfather 's vast","'s vast wealth","When he fails","he fails to","fails to graduate","to graduate from","graduate from college","from college ,","college , his",", his grandfather","his grandfather 's","grandfather 's will","'s will sends","will sends him","sends him back","him back to","back to his","to his ancestral","his ancestral village","ancestral village where","village where ,","where , long",", long ago","long ago ,","ago , he",", he made","he made a","made a friend","Shikha , Jay",", Jay 's","Jay 's estranged","'s estranged childhood","estranged childhood friend","childhood friend ,","friend , helps",", helps Jay","helps Jay rediscover","Jay rediscover his","rediscover his humanity","But , Shikha",", Shikha is","Shikha is very","is very sick","She shared her","shared her dreams","her dreams with","dreams with Jay","with Jay -","Jay -

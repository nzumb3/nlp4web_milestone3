{"title":"Three Times Divorced","plot":"Khitam, a Gaza-born Palestinian woman, was married off in an arranged match to an Israeli Palestinian, followed him to Israel and bore him six children. When her husband divorced her - in absentia - in the Sharia Muslim court and gained custody of the children, Khitam was left with nothing. She cannot contact her children, has no property and no citizenship. Although married to an Israeli, a draconian law passed in 2002 and barring any Palestinian from gaining Israeli citizenship has made her an illegal resident there. Now she is out on a dual battle, the most crucial of her life: against the court - which always rules in favor of the husband _ and against the state, in a last-ditch effort to gain citizenship and reunite with her children.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Khitam",",","a","Gaza-born","Palestinian","woman",",","was","marri","off","in","an","arrang","match","to","an","Israeli","Palestinian",",","follow","him","to","Israel","and","bore","him","six","children",".","When","her","husband","divorc","her","-","in","absentia","-","in","the","Sharia","Muslim","court","and","gain","custodi","of","the","children",",","Khitam","was","left","with","noth",".","She","can","not","contact","her","children",",","has","no","properti","and","no","citizenship",".","Although","marri","to","an","Israeli",",","a","draconian","law","pass","in","2002","and","bar","ani","Palestinian","from","gain","Israeli","citizenship","has","made","her","an","illeg","resid","there",".","Now","she","is","out","on","a","dual","battl",",","the","most","crucial","of","her","life",":","against","the","court","-","which","alway","rule","in","favor","of","the","husband","_","and","against","the","state",",","in","a","last-ditch","effort","to","gain","citizenship","and","reunit","with","her","children","."],"lemmas":["Khitam",",","a","gaza-born","palestinian","woman",",","be","marry","off","in","a","arrange","match","to","a","Israeli","Palestinian",",","follow","he","to","Israel","and","bear","he","six","child",".","when","she","husband","divorce","she","-","in","absentia","-","in","the","Sharia","muslim","court","and","gain","custody","of","the","child",",","Khitam","be","leave","with","nothing",".","she","can","not","contact","she","child",",","have","no","property","and","no","citizenship",".","although","marry","to","a","Israeli",",","a","draconian","law","pass","in","2002","and","bar","any","Palestinian","from","gain","israeli","citizenship","have","make","she","a","illegal","resident","there",".","now","she","be","out","on","a","dual","battle",",","the","most","crucial","of","she","life",":","against","the","court","-","which","always","rule","in","favor","of","the","husband","_","and","against","the","state",",","in","a","last-ditch","effort","to","gain","citizenship","and","reunite","with","she","child","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Khitam , a",", a Gaza-born","a Gaza-born Palestinian","Gaza-born Palestinian woman","Palestinian woman ,","woman , was",", was married","was married off","married off in","off in an","in an arranged","an arranged match","arranged match to","match to an","to an Israeli","an Israeli Palestinian","Israeli Palestinian ,","Palestinian , followed",", followed him","followed him to","him to Israel","to Israel and","Israel and bore","and bore him","bore him six","him six children","When her husband","her husband divorced","husband divorced her","divorced her -","her -

{"title":"Where the Water Meets the Sky","plot":"Narrated by Academy Award winning actor, Morgan Freeman, Where the Water Meets the Sky tells the inspiring story of a group of women from a remote town in northern Zambia who are given a unique opportunity: To learn how to make a film, on a subject of their choosing. In one of poorest regions of the country, where women rarely have the chance to speak out, a courageous group of twenty-three women produce a film about an issue that has affected them all, but few will discuss: the plight of young women, orphaned by AIDS. Inspired by the strength of Penelop, a young woman who agrees to share her story on film, the group becomes a force for change, showing how a single story can unite an entire community.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Narrat","by","Academi","Award","win","actor",",","Morgan","Freeman",",","Where","the","Water","Meet","the","Ski","tell","the","inspir","stori","of","a","group","of","women","from","a","remot","town","in","northern","Zambia","who","are","given","a","uniqu","opportun",":","To","learn","how","to","make","a","film",",","on","a","subject","of","their","choos",".","In","one","of","poorest","region","of","the","countri",",","where","women","rare","have","the","chanc","to","speak","out",",","a","courag","group","of","twenty-thre","women","produc","a","film","about","an","issu","that","has","affect","them","all",",","but","few","will","discuss",":","the","plight","of","young","women",",","orphan","by","AIDS",".","Inspire","by","the","strength","of","Penelop",",","a","young","woman","who","agre","to","share","her","stori","on","film",",","the","group","becom","a","forc","for","chang",",","show","how","a","singl","stori","can","unit","an","entir","communiti","."],"lemmas":["narrate","by","academy","award","win","actor",",","Morgan","Freeman",",","where","the","Water","meet","the","Sky","tell","the","inspiring","story","of","a","group","of","woman","from","a","remote","town","in","northern","Zambia","who","be","give","a","unique","opportunity",":","to","learn","how","to","make","a","film",",","on","a","subject","of","they","choosing",".","in","one","of","poorest","region","of","the","country",",","where","woman","rarely","have","the","chance","to","speak","out",",","a","courageous","group","of","twenty-three","woman","produce","a","film","about","a","issue","that","have","affect","they","all",",","but","few","will","discuss",":","the","plight","of","young","woman",",","orphan","by","AIDS",".","inspire","by","the","strength","of","Penelop",",","a","young","woman","who","agree","to","share","she","story","on","film",",","the","group","become","a","force","for","change",",","show","how","a","single","story","can","unite","a","entire","community","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Narrated

{"title":"The Clinic","plot":"The Clinic is a film about an underground treatment center for the broken hearted. Two filmmakers are on the pursuit of the infamous Dr. William J. Slater, PhD., best-selling author of \"Screw Moving On\" and \"I'm OK, You're the One F$$*ed in the Head.\" The doctor is a tough man to catch. Through his group of loyal followers, the filmmakers document Dr. Slater's unconventional techniques for getting over a failed relationship - such as Stalker Therapy and Abduction Therapy, to name a few. As they learn more about the doctor, they are drawn deeper and deeper into a twisted world of abuse and really angry people where nothing is as it seems. \"The Clinic\" explores the motives of a few desperate people who have a hard time letting go.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["The","Clinic","is","a","film","about","an","underground","treatment","center","for","the","broken","heart",".","Two","filmmak","are","on","the","pursuit","of","the","infam","Dr.","William","J.","Slater",",","PhD.",",","best-sel","author","of","\"","Screw","Move","On","\"","and","\"","I","'m","OK",",","You","re","the","One","F$","$","*","ed","in","the","Head",".","\"","The","doctor","is","a","tough","man","to","catch",".","Through","his","group","of","loyal","follow",",","the","filmmak","document","Dr.","Slater","'s","unconvent","techniqu","for","get","over","a","fail","relationship","-","such","as","Stalker","Therapi","and","Abduction","Therapi",",","to","name","a","few",".","As","they","learn","more","about","the","doctor",",","they","are","drawn","deeper","and","deeper","into","a","twist","world","of","abus","and","realli","angri","peopl","where","noth","is","as","it","seem",".","\"","The","Clinic","\"","explor","the","motiv","of","a","few","desper","peopl","who","have","a","hard","time","let","go","."],"lemmas":["the","Clinic","be","a","film","about","a","underground","treatment","center","for","the","broken","hearted",".","two","filmmaker","be","on","the","pursuit","of","the","infamous","Dr.","William","J.","Slater",",","phd.",",","best-selling","author","of","``","Screw","move","on","''","and","``","I","be","ok",",","you","be","the","one","f$","$","*","ed","in","the","Head",".","''","the","doctor","be","a","tough","man","to","catch",".","through","he","group","of","loyal","follower",",","the","filmmaker","document","Dr.","Slater","'s","unconventional","technique","for","get","over","a","fail","relationship","-","such","as","stalker","therapy","and","abduction","therapy",",","to","name","a","few",".","as","they","learn","more","about","the","doctor",",","they","be","draw","deeper","and","deeper","into","a","twisted","world","of","abuse","and","really","angry","people","where","nothing","be","as","it","seem",".","``","the","Clinic","''","explore","the","motive","of","a","few","desperate","people","who","have","a","hard","time","let","go","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The Clinic is","Clinic is a","is a film","a film about","film about an","about an underground","an underground treatment","underground treatment center","treatment center for","center for the","for the broken","the broken hearted","Two filmmakers are","filmmakers are on","are on the","on the pursuit","the pursuit of","pursuit of the","of the infamous","the infamous Dr.","infamous Dr. William","Dr. William J.","William J.

{"title":"Inside Pandora's Box","plot":"It is well documented that the Taliban in Pakistan shot Malala Yousafzai as she sat on her school bus. Her crime, according to the Taliban, was she wished to get an education. In India, Shirin Juwaley's husband threw acid in her face because she wanted to leave him. It was an arranged marriage turned abusive. Shirin married him to please her family. In Africa, the practice of female circumcision in infants and young girls continues to this day. No medical knowledge. No anesthetic. No choice in the matter. Cultural violence against women provides bleak statistics with no possible resolution in sight. While it is true that \"Inside Pandora's Box\" shines a light on the effects of cultural violence against women and young girls throughout the world, the viewer should know that \"Inside Pandora's Box\" is a heroine's story. An honest, open view of the journeys of brave women who have fought and sometimes died for their message. \"Inside Pandora's Box\" presents the grim landscape that is a reality for so many innocent women and young girls, and is committed to challenge both ourselves and world leaders to illuminate the path for solutions, actions and change.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","is","well","document","that","the","Taliban","in","Pakistan","shot","Malala","Yousafzai","as","she","sat","on","her","school","bus",".","Her","crime",",","accord","to","the","Taliban",",","was","she","wish","to","get","an","educ",".","In","India",",","Shirin","Juwaley","'s","husband","threw","acid","in","her","face","becaus","she","want","to","leav","him",".","It","was","an","arrang","marriag","turn","abus",".","Shirin","marri","him","to","pleas","her","famili",".","In","Africa",",","the","practic","of","femal","circumcis","in","infant","and","young","girl","continu","to","this","day",".","No","medic","knowledg",".","No","anesthet",".","No","choic","in","the","matter",".","Cultur","violenc","against","women","provid","bleak","statist","with","no","possibl","resolut","in","sight",".","While","it","is","true","that","\"","Inside","Pandora","'s","Box","\"","shine","a","light","on","the","effect","of","cultur","violenc","against","women","and","young","girl","throughout","the","world",",","the","viewer","should","know","that","\"","Inside","Pandora","'s","Box","\"","is","a","heroin","'s","stori",".","An","honest",",","open","view","of","the","journey","of","brave","women","who","have","fought","and","sometim","die","for","their","messag",".","\"","Inside","Pandora","'s","Box","\"","present","the","grim","landscap","that","is","a","realiti","for","so","mani","innoc","women","and","young","girl",",","and","is","commit","to","challeng","both","ourselv","and","world","leader","to","illumin","the","path","for","solut",",","action","and","chang","."],"lemmas":["it","be","well","document","that","the","Taliban","in","Pakistan","shoot","Malala","Yousafzai","as","she","sit","on","she","school","bus",".","she","crime",",","accord","to","the","Taliban",",","be","she","wish","to","get","a","education",".","in","India",",","Shirin","Juwaley","'s","husband","throw","acid","in","she","face","because","she","want","to","leave","he",".","it","be","a","arrange","marriage","turn","abusive",".","Shirin","marry","he","to","please","she","family",".","in","Africa",",","the","practice","of","female","circumcision","in","infant","and","young","girl","continue","to","this","day",".","no","medical","knowledge",".","no","anesthetic",".","no","choice","in","the","matter",".","cultural","violence","against","woman","provide","bleak","statistics","with","no","possible","resolution","in","sight",".","while","it","be","true","that","``","Inside","Pandora","'s","Box","''","shine","a","light","on","the","effect","of","cultural","violence","against","woman","and","young","girl","throughout","the","world",",","the","viewer","should","know","that","``","Inside","Pandora","'s","Box","''","be","a","heroine","'s","story",".","a","honest",",","open","view","of","the","journey","of","brave","woman","who","have","fight","and","sometimes","die","for","they","message",".","``","inside","Pandora","'s","Box","''","present","the","grim","landscape","that","be","a","reality","for","so","many","innocent","woman","and","young","girl",",","and","be","commit","to","challenge","both","ourselves","and","world","leader","to","illuminate","the","path","for","solution",",","action","and","change","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It

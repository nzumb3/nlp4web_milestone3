{"title":"Freak Out","plot":"Merv Doody (James Heathcote) is a true horror aficionado. He's seen it all. That's when fate delivers an inept psycho killer to his doorstep. At first, Merv is interested in not getting killed, but then it becomes something more. He must transform this bumbling reject from the local asylum into the ultimate killing machine. Enlisting the aid of his best friend Onkey (Dan Palmer), they set about making the best slasher in the world. Forget Jason and Freddy. They're losers. The man with the spatula (that's right, I said spatula. You wanna make something of it, Sissy?) learns his lessons too well. It isn't long before the man with the hockey mask and orange jumper is carving a path of destruction through the sleepy town of Redwater Cove. Merv and Onkey find that they are the only two who can stop the murderous rampage of their own creation. The only question is how do you destroy an unstoppable machine of utter madness?","genres":["Action"," Horror"," Comedy"],"stems":["Merv","Doodi","(","Jame","Heathcot",")","is","a","true","horror","aficionado",".","He","'s","seen","it","all",".","That","'s","when","fate","deliv","an","inept","psycho","killer","to","his","doorstep",".","At","first",",","Merv","is","interest","in","not","get","kill",",","but","then","it","becom","someth","more",".","He","must","transform","this","bumbl","reject","from","the","local","asylum","into","the","ultim","kill","machin",".","Enlist","the","aid","of","his","best","friend","Onkey","(","Dan","Palmer",")",",","they","set","about","make","the","best","slasher","in","the","world",".","Forget","Jason","and","Freddi",".","They","re","loser",".","The","man","with","the","spatula","(","that","'s","right",",","I","said","spatula",".","You","wan","na","make","someth","of","it",",","Sissi","?",")","learn","his","lesson","too","well",".","It","is","n't","long","befor","the","man","with","the","hockey","mask","and","orang","jumper","is","carv","a","path","of","destruct","through","the","sleepi","town","of","Redwat","Cove",".","Merv","and","Onkey","find","that","they","are","the","onli","two","who","can","stop","the","murder","rampag","of","their","own","creation",".","The","onli","question","is","how","do","you","destroy","an","unstopp","machin","of","utter","mad","?"],"lemmas":["Merv","Doody","-lrb-","James","Heathcote","-rrb-","be","a","true","horror","aficionado",".","he","be","see","it","all",".","that","be","when","fate","deliver","a","inept","psycho","killer","to","he","doorstep",".","at","first",",","Merv","be","interested","in","not","get","kill",",","but","then","it","become","something","more",".","he","must","transform","this","bumble","reject","from","the","local","asylum","into","the","ultimate","killing","machine",".","enlist","the","aid","of","he","best","friend","Onkey","-lrb-","Dan","Palmer","-rrb-",",","they","set","about","make","the","best","slasher","in","the","world",".","forget","Jason","and","Freddy",".","they","be","loser",".","the","man","with","the","spatula","-lrb-","that","be","right",",","I","say","spatula",".","you","wan","na","make","something","of","it",",","Sissy","?","-rrb-","learn","he","lesson","too","well",".","it","be","not","long","before","the","man","with","the","hockey","mask","and","orange","jumper","be","carve","a","path","of","destruction","through","the","sleepy","town","of","Redwater","Cove",".","Merv","and","Onkey","find","that","they","be","the","only","two","who","can","stop","the","murderous","rampage","of","they","own","creation",".","the","only","question","be","how","do","you","destroy","a","unstoppable","machine","of","utter","madness","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Merv Doody (","Doody ( James","( James Heathcote","James Heathcote )","Heathcote ) is",") is a","is a true","a true horror","true horror aficionado","He 's seen","'s seen it","seen it all","That 's when","'s when fate","when fate delivers","fate delivers an","delivers an inept","an inept psycho","inept psycho killer","psycho killer to","killer to his","to his doorstep","At first ,","first , Merv",", Merv is","Merv is interested","is interested in","interested in not","in not getting","not getting killed","getting killed ,","killed , but",", but then","but then it","then it becomes","it becomes something","becomes something more","He must transform","must transform this","transform this bumbling","this bumbling reject","bumbling reject from","reject from the","from the local","the local asylum","local asylum into","asylum into the","into the ultimate","the ultimate killing","ultimate killing machine","Enlisting the aid","the aid of","aid of his","of his best","his best friend","best friend Onkey","friend Onkey (","Onkey ( Dan","( Dan Palmer","Dan Palmer )","Palmer ) ,",") , they",", they set","they set about","set about making","about making the","making the best","the best slasher","best slasher in","slasher in the","in the world","Forget Jason and","Jason and Freddy","They 're losers","The man with","man with the","with the spatula","the spatula (","spatula ( that","( that 's","that 's right","'s right ,","right , I",", I said","I said spatula","You wan na","wan na make","na make something","make something of","something of it","of it ,","it , Sissy",", Sissy ?","Sissy ?

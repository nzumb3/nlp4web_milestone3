{"title":"Framing Frankie","plot":"Scott Martin is your average 18 year old. He's happy with his friends Paul, Craig and Jasper. He's also happy with his girlfriend, Frankie. Scott's fallen completely in love with her, and believes she feels the same. She doesn't. Scott's friends soon find out that Frankie is seeing another guy, Cris. And, as any good friends would, they tell Scott, who of course is devastated. It's at this point that Paul jumps in and decides Frankie needs a taste of some kind of medicine: it's not her own, but hey, it works! So, the four friends set out to get cruel, yet comical revenge on Frankie.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Scott","Martin","is","your","averag","18","year","old",".","He","'s","happi","with","his","friend","Paul",",","Craig","and","Jasper",".","He","'s","also","happi","with","his","girlfriend",",","Franki",".","Scott","'s","fallen","complet","in","love","with","her",",","and","believ","she","feel","the","same",".","She","doe","n't",".","Scott","'s","friend","soon","find","out","that","Franki","is","see","anoth","guy",",","Cris",".","And",",","as","ani","good","friend","would",",","they","tell","Scott",",","who","of","cours","is","devast",".","It","'s","at","this","point","that","Paul","jump","in","and","decid","Franki","need","a","tast","of","some","kind","of","medicin",":","it","'s","not","her","own",",","but","hey",",","it","work","!","So",",","the","four","friend","set","out","to","get","cruel",",","yet","comic","reveng","on","Franki","."],"lemmas":["Scott","Martin","be","you","average","18","year","old",".","he","be","happy","with","he","friend","Paul",",","Craig","and","Jasper",".","he","be","also","happy","with","he","girlfriend",",","Frankie",".","Scott","'s","fall","completely","in","love","with","she",",","and","believe","she","feel","the","same",".","she","do","not",".","Scott","'s","friend","soon","find","out","that","Frankie","be","see","another","guy",",","Cris",".","and",",","as","any","good","friend","would",",","they","tell","Scott",",","who","of","course","be","devastate",".","it","be","at","this","point","that","Paul","jump","in","and","decide","Frankie","need","a","taste","of","some","kind","of","medicine",":","it","be","not","she","own",",","but","hey",",","it","work","!","so",",","the","four","friend","set","out","to","get","cruel",",","yet","comical","revenge","on","Frankie","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Scott

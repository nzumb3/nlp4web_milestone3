{"title":"Collaging Film","plot":"\"Collaging Film\" is a series of shorts dating back to 2007. Published NY artist and writer, Stephen Mead, started out fairly bare-bones when beginning to make films, an experimentation which he considered a sort of folk art. Eventually Stephen transitioned from the use of subtitles in his work to creating his own mp3s for soundtracks and effects, finally interweaving actual footage amid paintings and digitized images in hopes of creating a more engaging experience for the viewer. As a Folk Artist, mainly using Windows Movie Maker, a program on many-a-computer, Stephen enjoys the fact that most anyone can use this program to make films of their own. He also likes knowing that these films are \"low-tech Independents\", not subject to Studio Backing (!) and meant to be viewed on the small screens of televisions or computer monitors. Stephen feels this creates for a more intimate viewing experience that is perfect for the variety of themes found in his work. This second disc of Stephen Mead's shorts includes his music videos for the CD song cycle, \"Whispers of Arias, Volumes 1 and 2\". These include \"Rings\", a remembrance piece for 911, and \"Patroclus\", a homage to same-sex love. To round out the collection is \"Our Collage Life\" created for the \"It Gets Better\" project.","genres":["Animation"],"stems":["\"","Collag","Film","\"","is","a","seri","of","short","date","back","to","2007",".","Publish","NY","artist","and","writer",",","Stephen","Mead",",","start","out","fair","bare-bon","when","begin","to","make","film",",","an","experiment","which","he","consid","a","sort","of","folk","art",".","Eventual","Stephen","transit","from","the","use","of","subtitl","in","his","work","to","creat","his","own","mp3s","for","soundtrack","and","effect",",","final","interweav","actual","footag","amid","paint","and","digit","imag","in","hope","of","creat","a","more","engag","experi","for","the","viewer",".","As","a","Folk","Artist",",","main","use","Window","Movi","Maker",",","a","program","on","many-a-comput",",","Stephen","enjoy","the","fact","that","most","anyon","can","use","this","program","to","make","film","of","their","own",".","He","also","like","know","that","these","film","are","\"","low-tech","Independ","\"",",","not","subject","to","Studio","Back","(","!",")","and","meant","to","be","view","on","the","small","screen","of","televis","or","comput","monitor",".","Stephen","feel","this","creat","for","a","more","intim","view","experi","that","is","perfect","for","the","varieti","of","theme","found","in","his","work",".","This","second","disc","of","Stephen","Mead","'s","short","includ","his","music","video","for","the","CD","song","cycl",",","\"","Whisper","of","Aria",",","Volum","1","and","2","\"",".","These","includ","\"","Ring","\"",",","a","remembr","piec","for","911",",","and","\"","Patroclus","\"",",","a","homag","to","same-sex","love",".","To","round","out","the","collect","is","\"","Our","Collag","Life","\"","creat","for","the","\"","It","Get","Better","\"","project","."],"lemmas":["``","Collaging","Film","''","be","a","series","of","shorts","date","back","to","2007",".","publish","NY","artist","and","writer",",","Stephen","Mead",",","start","out","fairly","bare-bones","when","begin","to","make","film",",","a","experimentation","which","he","consider","a","sort","of","folk","art",".","eventually","Stephen","transition","from","the","use","of","subtitle","in","he","work","to","create","he","own","mp3","for","soundtrack","and","effect",",","finally","interweave","actual","footage","amid","painting","and","digitized","image","in","hope","of","create","a","more","engaging","experience","for","the","viewer",".","as","a","folk","Artist",",","mainly","use","Windows","Movie","Maker",",","a","program","on","many-a-computer",",","Stephen","enjoy","the","fact","that","most","anyone","can","use","this","program","to","make","film","of","they","own",".","he","also","like","know","that","these","film","be","``","low-tech","Independents","''",",","not","subject","to","studio","backing","-lrb-","!","-rrb-","and","mean","to","be","view","on","the","small","screen","of","television","or","computer","monitor",".","Stephen","feel","this","create","for","a","more","intimate","viewing","experience","that","be","perfect","for","the","variety","of","theme","find","in","he","work",".","this","second","disc","of","Stephen","Mead","'s","shorts","include","he","music","video","for","the","CD","song","cycle",",","``","Whispers","of","Arias",",","volume","1","and","2","''",".","these","include","``","Rings","''",",","a","remembrance","piece","for","911",",","and","``","Patroclus","''",",","a","homage","to","same-sex","love",".","to","round","out","the","collection","be","``","Our","Collage","Life","''","create","for","the","``","it","get","Better","''","project","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\"

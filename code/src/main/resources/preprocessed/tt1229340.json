He hires Ron, who proceeds to reunite the news team of Champ, Brick, and Brian, and head back to New York City. While there Ron and his news team are given the graveyard shift and a challenge. Ron comes up with a radical new idea to transform the news and that puts him at the top of the game once again. But how long will Ron's newfound fame last? And will Brick finally find true love?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Have","left","San","Diego","for","New","York","Citi",",","Ron","Burgundi","is","live","the","high","life","with","his","wife","Veronica","Corningston","and","son","Walter","Burgundi",".","Howev",",","when","the","boss","decid","to","promot","Veronica","to","full","time","lead","anchor","and","fire","Ron",",","everyth","chang",".","Now","head","back","to","San","Diego",",","Ron","is","wash","up","and","work","part","time","at","Sea","World",".","His","shot","at","redempt","though","come","in","the","form","of","a","man","name","Freddi","Schapp",",","who","'s","an","execut","produc","at","the","Global","New","Network",",","the","world","'s","first","24","hour","round","the","clock","news","channel",".","He","hire","Ron",",","who","proceed","to","reunit","the","news","team","of","Champ",",","Brick",",","and","Brian",",","and","head","back","to","New","York","Citi",".","While","there","Ron","and","his","news","team","are","given","the","graveyard","shift","and","a","challeng",".","Ron","come","up","with","a","radic","new","idea","to","transform","the","news","and","that","put","him","at","the","top","of","the","game","onc","again",".","But","how","long","will","Ron","'s","newfound","fame","last","?","And","will","Brick","final","find","true","love","?"],"lemmas":["have","leave","San","Diego","for","New","York","City",",","Ron","Burgundy","be","live","the","high","life","with","he","wife","Veronica","Corningstone","and","son","Walter","Burgundy",".","however",",","when","the","boss","decide","to","promote","Veronica","to","full","time","lead","anchor","and","fire","Ron",",","everything","change",".","now","head","back","to","San","Diego",",","Ron","be","wash","up","and","work","part","time","at","Sea","World",".","he","shot","at","redemption","though","come","in","the","form","of","a","man","name","Freddie","Schapp",",","who","be","a","executive","producer","at","the","Global","News","Network",",","the","world","'s","first","24","hour","round","the","clock","news","channel",".","he","hire","Ron",",","who","proceed","to","reunite","the","news","team","of","Champ",",","Brick",",","and","Brian",",","and","head","back","to","New","York","City",".","while","there","Ron","and","he","news","team","be","give","the","graveyard","shift","and","a","challenge",".","Ron","come","up","with","a","radical","new","idea","to","transform","the","news","and","that","put","he","at","the","top","of","the","game","once","again",".","but","how","long","will","Ron","'s","newfound","fame","last","?","and","will","Brick","finally","find","true","love","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Having

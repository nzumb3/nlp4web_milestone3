{"title":"Laya Project","plot":"A musical, visual journey. Recorded and filmed on location, it resurrects ancient and forgotten folk music from Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Maldives, India and Myanmar. The experience is brought to life for a contemporary audience through a minimalist orchestration of modern electronic waves and flows, thereby preserving the integrity of the music. The musicians come primarily from the coastal communities, towns and villages practically wiped of the world map by the Tsunami of December 26, 2004. It's beauty lies in it's purity and simplicity, a non-judgmental point of view. For the international team who came together, Laya Project is a personal and collective tribute to the resilience of the human spirit.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","music",",","visual","journey",".","Record","and","film","on","locat",",","it","resurrect","ancient","and","forgotten","folk","music","from","Sri","Lanka",",","Thailand",",","Indonesia",",","Maldiv",",","India","and","Myanmar",".","The","experi","is","brought","to","life","for","a","contemporari","audienc","through","a","minimalist","orchestr","of","modern","electron","wave","and","flow",",","therebi","preserv","the","integr","of","the","music",".","The","musician","come","primarili","from","the","coastal","communiti",",","town","and","villag","practic","wipe","of","the","world","map","by","the","Tsunami","of","Decemb","26",",","2004",".","It","'s","beauti","lie","in","it","'s","puriti","and","simplic",",","a","non-judgment","point","of","view",".","For","the","intern","team","who","came","togeth",",","Laya","Project","is","a","person","and","collect","tribut","to","the","resili","of","the","human","spirit","."],"lemmas":["a","musical",",","visual","journey",".","record","and","film","on","location",",","it","resurrect","ancient","and","forget","folk","music","from","Sri","Lanka",",","Thailand",",","Indonesia",",","Maldives",",","India","and","Myanmar",".","the","experience","be","bring","to","life","for","a","contemporary","audience","through","a","minimalist","orchestration","of","modern","electronic","wave","and","flow",",","thereby","preserve","the","integrity","of","the","music",".","the","musician","come","primarily","from","the","coastal","community",",","town","and","village","practically","wipe","of","the","world","map","by","the","Tsunami","of","December","26",",","2004",".","it","be","beauty","lie","in","it","be","purity","and","simplicity",",","a","non-judgmental","point","of","view",".","for","the","international","team","who","come","together",",","Laya","Project","be","a","personal","and","collective","tribute","to","the","resilience","of","the","human","spirit","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"Food Evolution","plot":"Food Evolution looks at one of the most critical questions facing the world today-that of food security-and demonstrates the desperate need for common sense, solid information, and calm logical deliberation. Using the often angry and emotional controversy over genetically-modified foods as its entry point, Food Evolution shows how easily fear and misinformation can overwhelm objective, evidence-based analysis. Food Evolution takes the position that science and scientists hold the key to solving the food crisis. But whose science? In the GMO debate, both sides claim science is on their side. Who's right? How do we figure this out? What does this mean for the larger issues of food security, sustainability, and environmental well-being? Food Evolution seeks to answer these critically important questions.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Food","Evolut","look","at","one","of","the","most","critic","question","face","the","world","today-that","of","food","security-and","demonstr","the","desper","need","for","common","sens",",","solid","inform",",","and","calm","logic","deliber",".","Using","the","often","angri","and","emot","controversi","over","genetically-modifi","food","as","it","entri","point",",","Food","Evolut","show","how","easili","fear","and","misinform","can","overwhelm","object",",","evidence-bas","analysi",".","Food","Evolut","take","the","posit","that","scienc","and","scientist","hold","the","key","to","solv","the","food","crisi",".","But","whose","scienc","?","In","the","GMO","debat",",","both","side","claim","scienc","is","on","their","side",".","Who","'s","right","?","How","do","we","figur","this","out","?","What","doe","this","mean","for","the","larger","issu","of","food","secur",",","sustain",",","and","environment","well-b","?","Food","Evolut","seek","to","answer","these","critic","import","question","."],"lemmas":["food","evolution","look","at","one","of","the","most","critical","question","face","the","world","today-that","of","food","security-and","demonstrate","the","desperate","need","for","common","sense",",","solid","information",",","and","calm","logical","deliberation",".","use","the","often","angry","and","emotional","controversy","over","genetically-modified","food","as","its","entry","point",",","food","evolution","show","how","easily","fear","and","misinformation","can","overwhelm","objective",",","evidence-based","analysis",".","food","evolution","take","the","position","that","science","and","scientist","hold","the","key","to","solve","the","food","crisis",".","but","whose","science","?","in","the","GMO","debate",",","both","side","claim","science","be","on","they","side",".","who","be","right","?","how","do","we","figure","this","out","?","what","do","this","mean","for","the","larger","issue","of","food","security",",","sustainability",",","and","environmental","well-being","?","food","evolution","seek","to","answer","these","critically","important","question","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Food

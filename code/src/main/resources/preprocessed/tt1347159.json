{"title":"I'm the Divider","plot":"Deep in the desert of Arizona, the conflict caused by illegal immigration drives American citizens into action. The forms those actions take, feed the conflict. In the thick black nights of the southern desert, the Minute Men are watching, looking for the Rule of Law to be followed. Conversely, Humane Borders assemble and fill water tanks for tired, thirsty migrants, helping them to survive the way across sand and rocks.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Deep","in","the","desert","of","Arizona",",","the","conflict","caus","by","illeg","immigr","drive","American","citizen","into","action",".","The","form","those","action","take",",","feed","the","conflict",".","In","the","thick","black","night","of","the","southern","desert",",","the","Minut","Men","are","watch",",","look","for","the","Rule","of","Law","to","be","follow",".","Convers",",","Human","Border","assembl","and","fill","water","tank","for","tire",",","thirsti","migrant",",","help","them","to","surviv","the","way","across","sand","and","rock","."],"lemmas":["deep","in","the","desert","of","Arizona",",","the","conflict","cause","by","illegal","immigration","drive","american","citizen","into","action",".","the","form","those","action","take",",","feed","the","conflict",".","in","the","thick","black","night","of","the","southern","desert",",","the","Minute","Men","be","watch",",","look","for","the","rule","of","law","to","be","follow",".","conversely",",","Humane","Borders","assemble","and","fill","water","tank","for","tired",",","thirsty","migrant",",","help","they","to","survive","the","way","across","sand","and","rock","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Deep in the","in the desert","the desert of","desert of Arizona","of Arizona ,","Arizona , the",", the conflict","the conflict caused","conflict caused by","caused by illegal","by illegal immigration","illegal immigration drives","immigration drives American","drives American citizens","American citizens into","citizens into action","The forms those","forms those actions","those actions take","actions take ,","take , feed",", feed the","feed the conflict","In the thick","the thick black","thick black nights","black nights of","nights of the","of the southern","the southern desert","southern desert ,","desert , the",", the Minute","the Minute Men","Minute Men are","Men are watching","are watching ,","watching , looking",", looking for","looking for the","for the Rule","the Rule of","Rule of Law","of Law to","Law to be","to be followed","Conversely , Humane",", Humane Borders","Humane Borders assemble","Borders assemble and","assemble and fill","and fill water","fill water tanks","water tanks for","tanks for tired","for tired ,","tired , thirsty",", thirsty migrants","thirsty migrants ,","migrants , helping",", helping them","helping them to","them to survive","to survive the","survive the way","the way across","way across sand","across sand and","sand and rocks"],"2grams":["Deep in","in the","the desert","desert of","of Arizona","Arizona ,",", the","the conflict","conflict caused","caused by","by illegal","illegal immigration","immigration drives","drives American","American citizens","citizens into","into action","The forms","forms those","those actions","actions take","take ,",", feed","feed the","the conflict","In the","the thick","thick black","black nights","nights of","of the","the southern","southern desert","desert ,",", the","the Minute","Minute Men","Men are","are watching","watching ,",", looking","looking for","for the","the Rule","Rule of","of Law","Law to","to be","be followed","Conversely ,",", Humane","Humane Borders","Borders assemble","assemble and","and fill","fill water","water tanks","tanks for","for tired","tired ,",", thirsty","thirsty migrants","migrants ,",", helping","helping them","them to","to survive","survive the","the way","way across","across sand","sand and","and rocks"]}

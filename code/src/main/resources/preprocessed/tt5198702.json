{"title":"The Shadow Zone","plot":"In 2016, invaders from space attacked Earth and its people. In an effort to thwart the attackers, brilliant scientist Dr. Diane Landry created an alien-human hybrid to wipe the invaders out. They performed well and drove the invaders out, but then turned on humanity themselves. In 2017, the few remaining survivors, mostly living underground and in secret, must work together to reach a \"safe haven\" where they will not be at the mercy of these new, deadly creatures.","genres":["Sci-Fi"],"stems":["In","2016",",","invad","from","space","attack","Earth","and","it","peopl",".","In","an","effort","to","thwart","the","attack",",","brilliant","scientist","Dr.","Dian","Landri","creat","an","alien-human","hybrid","to","wipe","the","invad","out",".","They","perform","well","and","drove","the","invad","out",",","but","then","turn","on","human","themselv",".","In","2017",",","the","few","remain","survivor",",","most","live","underground","and","in","secret",",","must","work","togeth","to","reach","a","\"","safe","haven","\"","where","they","will","not","be","at","the","merci","of","these","new",",","dead","creatur","."],"lemmas":["in","2016",",","invader","from","space","attack","Earth","and","its","people",".","in","a","effort","to","thwart","the","attacker",",","brilliant","scientist","Dr.","Diane","Landry","create","a","alien-human","hybrid","to","wipe","the","invader","out",".","they","perform","well","and","drive","the","invader","out",",","but","then","turn","on","humanity","themselves",".","in","2017",",","the","few","remain","survivor",",","mostly","live","underground","and","in","secret",",","must","work","together","to","reach","a","``","safe","haven","''","where","they","will","not","be","at","the","mercy","of","these","new",",","deadly","creature","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 2016 ,","2016 , invaders",", invaders from","invaders from space","from space attacked","space attacked Earth","attacked Earth and","Earth and its","and its people","In an effort","an effort to","effort to thwart","to thwart the","thwart the attackers","the attackers ,","attackers , brilliant",", brilliant scientist","brilliant scientist Dr.","scientist Dr. Diane","Dr. Diane Landry","Diane Landry created","Landry created an","created an alien-human","an alien-human hybrid","alien-human hybrid to","hybrid to wipe","to wipe the","wipe the invaders","the invaders out","They performed well","performed well and","well and drove","and drove the","drove the invaders","the invaders out","invaders out ,","out , but",", but then","but then turned","then turned on","turned on humanity","on humanity themselves","In 2017 ,","2017 , the",", the few","the few remaining","few remaining survivors","remaining survivors ,","survivors , mostly",", mostly living","mostly living underground","living underground and","underground and in","and in secret","in secret ,","secret , must",", must work","must work together","work together to","together to reach","to reach a","reach a \"","a \" safe","\" safe haven","safe haven \"","haven \" where","\" where they","where they will","they will not","will not be","not be at","be at the","at the mercy","the mercy of","mercy of these","of these new","these new ,","new , deadly",", deadly creatures"],"2grams":["In 2016","2016 ,",", invaders","invaders from","from space","space attacked","attacked Earth","Earth and","and its","its people","In an","an effort","effort to","to thwart","thwart the","the attackers","attackers ,",", brilliant","brilliant scientist","scientist Dr.","Dr. Diane","Diane Landry","Landry created","created an","an alien-human","alien-human hybrid","hybrid to","to wipe","wipe the","the invaders","invaders out","They performed","performed well","well and","and drove","drove the","the invaders","invaders out","out ,",", but","but then","then turned","turned on","on humanity","humanity themselves","In 2017","2017 ,",", the","the few","few remaining","remaining survivors","survivors ,",", mostly","mostly living","living underground","underground and","and in","in secret","secret ,",", must","must work","work together","together to","to reach","reach a","a \"","\" safe","safe haven","haven \"","\" where","where they","they will","will not","not be","be at","at the","the mercy","mercy of","of these","these new","new ,",", deadly","deadly creatures"]}

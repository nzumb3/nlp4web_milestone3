{"title":"Holy Wars","plot":"Take one Muslim advocate for global jihad and put him in a room with one conservative Christian on a mission to evangelize the world's Muslims. Which man will be left standing? Touching down in four hotbeds of religious fundamentalism - Pakistan, Lebanon, UK, and heartland America - \"Holy Wars\" goes behind the scenes of the 1400 year old conflict between Islam and Christianity. The film follows a danger-seeking Christian missionary and a radical Muslim Irish convert, both of whom believe in an apocalyptic battle, after which their religion will ultimately rule the world. Tracking their lives from the onset of the \"War on Terror\" to the election of Barack Obama, \"Holy Wars\" shows that even the most radical of believers can be transformed by our changing world.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Take","one","Muslim","advoc","for","global","jihad","and","put","him","in","a","room","with","one","conserv","Christian","on","a","mission","to","evangel","the","world","'s","Muslim",".","Which","man","will","be","left","stand","?","Touch","down","in","four","hotb","of","religi","fundament","-","Pakistan",",","Lebanon",",","UK",",","and","heartland","America","-","\"","Holi","War","\"","goe","behind","the","scene","of","the","1400","year","old","conflict","between","Islam","and","Christian",".","The","film","follow","a","danger-seek","Christian","missionari","and","a","radic","Muslim","Irish","convert",",","both","of","whom","believ","in","an","apocalypt","battl",",","after","which","their","religion","will","ultim","rule","the","world",".","Track","their","live","from","the","onset","of","the","\"","War","on","Terror","\"","to","the","elect","of","Barack","Obama",",","\"","Holi","War","\"","show","that","even","the","most","radic","of","believ","can","be","transform","by","our","chang","world","."],"lemmas":["take","one","muslim","advocate","for","global","jihad","and","put","he","in","a","room","with","one","conservative","Christian","on","a","mission","to","evangelize","the","world","'s","Muslims",".","which","man","will","be","left","standing","?","touch","down","in","four","hotbed","of","religious","fundamentalism","-","Pakistan",",","Lebanon",",","UK",",","and","heartland","America","-","``","holy","war","''","go","behind","the","scene","of","the","1400","year","old","conflict","between","Islam","and","Christianity",".","the","film","follow","a","danger-seeking","christian","missionary","and","a","radical","muslim","Irish","convert",",","both","of","whom","believe","in","a","apocalyptic","battle",",","after","which","they","religion","will","ultimately","rule","the","world",".","track","they","life","from","the","onset","of","the","``","war","on","terror","''","to","the","election","of","Barack","Obama",",","``","holy","war","''","show","that","even","the","most","radical","of","believer","can","be","transform","by","we","change","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Take one Muslim","one Muslim advocate","Muslim advocate for","advocate for global","for global jihad","global jihad and","jihad and put","and put him","put him in","him in a","in a room","a room with","room with one","with one conservative","one conservative Christian","conservative Christian on","Christian on a","on a mission","a mission to","mission to evangelize","to evangelize the","evangelize the world","the world 's","world 's Muslims","Which man will","man will be","will be left","be left standing","Touching down in","down in four","in four hotbeds","four hotbeds of","hotbeds of religious","of religious fundamentalism","religious fundamentalism -","fundamentalism -

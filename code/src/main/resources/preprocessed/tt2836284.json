{"title":"A Pride Job","plot":"Mrs Thatcher's famous 1987 'Walk in the wilderness' photograph has become iconic. The Prime Minister's tramp across the ruins of the Head Wrightson engineering works in the Northern town of Thornaby has become symbolic of the decline of industrial Britain. Film maker Derek Smith tracked down some of the people who had worked there to discover how the famous engineers came to be revered across the world. In interviews with surviving workers the film captures some of the spirit of the workplace and reveals a remarkable story of achievement, pride and comradeship. It describes an unusual relationship between work and community in which women workers played a key role especially during the war .","genres":["Documentary","

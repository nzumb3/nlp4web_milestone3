{"title":"Unspoken","plot":"Grace is still grappling with the disappearance of her daughter five years earlier. Her husband Lukas is trapped in his own helpless grief. He and Grace have long since stopped communicating. As Grace confronts a series of small absurdities in her apartment building, Lukas finds himself unable to complete even the simplest of daily tasks. When something truly heartbreaking happens in a family, the deepest response is often unspoken. In this intimate and moving film, the Belgian director probes those inchoate emotions, seeking a visual language for the unsaid. She creates a world in which small gestures can explode with meaning.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Grace","is","still","grappl","with","the","disappear","of","her","daughter","five","year","earlier",".","Her","husband","Luka","is","trap","in","his","own","helpless","grief",".","He","and","Grace","have","long","sinc","stop","communic",".","As","Grace","confront","a","seri","of","small","absurd","in","her","apart","build",",","Luka","find","himself","unabl","to","complet","even","the","simplest","of","daili","task",".","When","someth","truli","heartbreak","happen","in","a","famili",",","the","deepest","respons","is","often","unspoken",".","In","this","intim","and","move","film",",","the","Belgian","director","probe","those","inchoat","emot",",","seek","a","visual","languag","for","the","unsaid",".","She","creat","a","world","in","which","small","gestur","can","explod","with","mean","."],"lemmas":["Grace","be","still","grapple","with","the","disappearance","of","she","daughter","five","year","earlier",".","she","husband","Lukas","be","trap","in","he","own","helpless","grief",".","he","and","Grace","have","long","since","stop","communicate",".","as","Grace","confront","a","series","of","small","absurdity","in","she","apartment","building",",","Lukas","find","himself","unable","to","complete","even","the","simplest","of","daily","task",".","when","something","truly","heartbreaking","happen","in","a","family",",","the","deepest","response","be","often","unspoken",".","in","this","intimate","and","move","film",",","the","belgian","director","probe","those","inchoate","emotion",",","seek","a","visual","language","for","the","unsaid",".","she","create","a","world","in","which","small","gesture","can","explode","with","meaning","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Grace

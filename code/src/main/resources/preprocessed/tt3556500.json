{"title":"Street Society","plot":"Cocky, charismatic and womanizing Rio (Marcel Chandrawinata) is the reigning champion of Indonesia's illegal street racing scene. Along with his friends-tuning genius Monty (Daniel Topan), Balinese champion racer Gde (Yogie Tan), and the beautiful-yet-brash Nanda (Kelly Tandiono)--Rio forms a speed-obsessed society, racing against fellow super car owners in exotic and beautiful locations across the country. Rio's archenemy is Nico (Edward Gunawan), the heavily-guarded heir to a Surabaya crime syndicate-and the city's number one racer-who keeps pushing Rio for a rematch after an embarrassing loss on the former's home turf. Rio's priorities change, however, after he meets the beautiful and smart Karina (Chelsea Islan), a newcomer DJ who plays at one of his regular hangouts. Their friendship soon blossoms into something more serious. For the first time in his life, Rio feels he can focus on something other than racing. After a race ends with a near-death incident that shocked Karina, Rio decides to put his racing days behind. That is, until nervy racer Yopie (Edward Akbar) enters the scene. Yopie bears a violent hatred against Nico, whose family he blamed for the death of his father, a notorious mobster, in the late 90s. His only chance for payback is by taking down Nico on the road-the only place where the latter is not surrounded by his horde of bodyguards. Yopie forces Rio to take the wheel against Nico for one last time, or else Karina would be a victim of Yopie's violent tendencies. Can Rio and his band of misfit petrolheads save Karina? What surprises are installed when they execute their intricate plan?","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Cocki",",","charismat","and","woman","Rio","(","Marcel","Chandrawinata",")","is","the","reign","champion","of","Indonesia","'s","illeg","street","race","scene",".","Along","with","his","friends-tun","genius","Monti","(","Daniel","Topan",")",",","Balines","champion","racer","Gde","(","Yogi","Tan",")",",","and","the","beautiful-yet-brash","Nanda","(","Kelli","Tandiono",")","--","Rio","form","a","speed-obsess","societi",",","race","against","fellow","super","car","owner","in","exot","and","beauti","locat","across","the","countri",".","Rio","'s","archenemi","is","Nico","(","Edward","Gunawan",")",",","the","heavily-guard","heir","to","a","Surabaya","crime","syndicate-and","the","citi","'s","number","one","racer-who","keep","push","Rio","for","a","rematch","after","an","embarrass","loss","on","the","former","'s","home","turf",".","Rio","'s","prioriti","chang",",","howev",",","after","he","meet","the","beauti","and","smart","Karina","(","Chelsea","Islan",")",",","a","newcom","DJ","who","play","at","one","of","his","regular","hangout",".","Their","friendship","soon","blossom","into","someth","more","serious",".","For","the","first","time","in","his","life",",","Rio","feel","he","can","focus","on","someth","other","than","race",".","After","a","race","end","with","a","near-death","incid","that","shock","Karina",",","Rio","decid","to","put","his","race","day","behind",".","That","is",",","until","nervi","racer","Yopi","(","Edward","Akbar",")","enter","the","scene",".","Yopi","bear","a","violent","hatr","against","Nico",",","whose","famili","he","blame","for","the","death","of","his","father",",","a","notori","mobster",",","in","the","late","90s",".","His","onli","chanc","for","payback","is","by","take","down","Nico","on","the","road-th","onli","place","where","the","latter","is","not","surround","by","his","hord","of","bodyguard",".","Yopi","forc","Rio","to","take","the","wheel","against","Nico","for","one","last","time",",","or","els","Karina","would","be","a","victim","of","Yopi","'s","violent","tendenc",".","Can","Rio","and","his","band","of","misfit","petrolhead","save","Karina","?","What","surpris","are","instal","when","they","execut","their","intric","plan","?"],"lemmas":["cocky",",","charismatic","and","womanize","Rio","-lrb-","Marcel","Chandrawinata","-rrb-","be","the","reign","champion","of","Indonesia","'s","illegal","street","racing","scene",".","along","with","he","friends-tuning","genius","Monty","-lrb-","Daniel","Topan","-rrb-",",","balinese","champion","racer","gde","-lrb-","Yogie","Tan","-rrb-",",","and","the","beautiful-yet-brash","Nanda","-lrb-","Kelly","Tandiono","-rrb-","--","Rio","form","a","speed-obsessed","society",",","race","against","fellow","super","car","owner","in","exotic","and","beautiful","location","across","the","country",".","Rio","'s","archenemy","be","Nico","-lrb-","Edward","Gunawan","-rrb-",",","the","heavily-guarded","heir","to","a","Surabaya","crime","syndicate-and","the","city","'s","number","one","racer-who","keep","push","Rio","for","a","rematch","after","a","embarrassing","loss","on","the","former","'s","home","turf",".","Rio","'s","priority","change",",","however",",","after","he","meet","the","beautiful","and","smart","Karina","-lrb-","Chelsea","Islan","-rrb-",",","a","newcomer","DJ","who","play","at","one","of","he","regular","hangout",".","they","friendship","soon","blossom","into","something","more","serious",".","for","the","first","time","in","he","life",",","Rio","feel","he","can","focus","on","something","other","than","racing",".","after","a","race","end","with","a","near-death","incident","that","shock","Karina",",","Rio","decide","to","put","he","racing","day","behind",".","that","be",",","until","nervy","racer","Yopie","-lrb-","Edward","Akbar","-rrb-","enter","the","scene",".","Yopie","bear","a","violent","hatred","against","Nico",",","whose","family","he","blame","for","the","death","of","he","father",",","a","notorious","mobster",",","in","the","late","90",".","he","only","chance","for","payback","be","by","take","down","Nico","on","the","road-the","only","place","where","the","latter","be","not","surround","by","he","horde","of","bodyguard",".","Yopie","force","Rio","to","take","the","wheel","against","Nico","for","one","last","time",",","or","else","Karina","would","be","a","victim","of","Yopie","'s","violent","tendency",".","can","Rio","and","he","band","of","misfit","petrolhead","save","Karina","?","what","surprise","be","install","when","they","execute","they","intricate","plan","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Cocky

{"title":"Groove With Us","plot":"Before they were Passalacqua, Mister and Blaksmith were simply two kids growing up in a middle-class suburb outside Detroit. Hip hop was their connection, and a love for the craft of performing. After years separately honing the words, rhythms, rhymes, and art of the MC, Blaksmith and Mister reunited to form Passalacqua. This is the story of a Detroit hip-hop phenomenon. The kind of group who, seen live, sears into your memory the experience of a hot summer night, beer-soaked and hands sticky with sweat and resin residue, of a small stage outside of some derelict warehouse in a empty city. The hum of a deep bass beat pours out of the speakers as two men take the stage in overblown masks and astronaut helmets, capturing the wily attention of a drunk and rowdy audience. They then put on a performance that makes your senses sharpen and your heart beat a half-second faster with the unmistakable excitement of watching true artists create.","genres":["Documentary","

When Pincus dies unexpectedly, but is miraculously revived after seven minutes, he wakes up to discover that he now has the annoying ability to see ghosts. Even worse, they all want something from him, particularly Frank Herlihy who pesters him into breaking up the impending marriage of his widow Gwen. That puts Pincus squarely in the middle of a triangle with spirited result.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["Bertram","Pincus","is","a","man","whose","peopl","skill","leav","much","to","be","desir",".","When","Pincus","die","unexpect",",","but","is","miracul","reviv","after","seven","minut",",","he","wake","up","to","discov","that","he","now","has","the","annoy","abil","to","see","ghost",".","Even","wors",",","they","all","want","someth","from","him",",","particular","Frank","Herlihi","who","pester","him","into","break","up","the","impend","marriag","of","his","widow","Gwen",".","That","put","Pincus","squar","in","the","middl","of","a","triangl","with","spirit","result","."],"lemmas":["Bertram","Pincus","be","a","man","whose","people","skill","leave","much","to","be","desire",".","when","Pincus","die","unexpectedly",",","but","be","miraculously","revive","after","seven","minute",",","he","wake","up","to","discover","that","he","now","have","the","annoying","ability","to","see","ghost",".","even","worse",",","they","all","want","something","from","he",",","particularly","Frank","Herlihy","who","pester","he","into","break","up","the","impending","marriage","of","he","widow","Gwen",".","that","put","Pincus","squarely","in","the","middle","of","a","triangle","with","spirited","result","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Bertram Pincus is","Pincus is a","is a man","a man whose","man whose people","whose people skills","people skills leave","skills leave much","leave much to","much to be","to be desired","When Pincus dies","Pincus dies unexpectedly","dies unexpectedly ,","unexpectedly , but",", but is","but is miraculously","is miraculously revived","miraculously revived after","revived after seven","after seven minutes","seven minutes ,","minutes , he",", he wakes","he wakes up","wakes up to","up to discover","to discover that","discover that he","that he now","he now has","now has the","has the annoying","the annoying ability","annoying ability to","ability to see","to see ghosts","Even worse ,","worse , they",", they all","they all want","all want something","want something from","something from him","from him ,","him , particularly",", particularly Frank","particularly Frank Herlihy","Frank Herlihy who","Herlihy who pesters","who pesters him","pesters him into","him into breaking","into breaking up","breaking up the","up the impending","the impending marriage","impending marriage of","marriage of his","of his widow","his widow Gwen","That puts Pincus","puts Pincus squarely","Pincus squarely in","squarely in the","in the middle","the middle of","middle of a","of a triangle","a triangle with","triangle with spirited","with spirited result"],"2grams":["Bertram Pincus","Pincus is","is a","a man","man whose","whose people","people skills","skills leave","leave much","much to","to be","be desired","When Pincus","Pincus dies","dies unexpectedly","unexpectedly ,",", but","but is","is miraculously","miraculously revived","revived after","after seven","seven minutes","minutes ,",", he","he wakes","wakes up","up to","to discover","discover that","that he","he now","now has","has the","the annoying","annoying ability","ability to","to see","see ghosts","Even worse","worse ,",", they","they all","all want","want something","something from","from him","him ,",", particularly","particularly Frank","Frank Herlihy","Herlihy who","who pesters","pesters him","him into","into breaking","breaking up","up the","the impending","impending marriage","marriage of","of his","his widow","widow Gwen","That puts","puts Pincus","Pincus squarely","squarely in","in the","the middle","middle of","of a","a triangle","triangle with","with spirited","spirited result"]}

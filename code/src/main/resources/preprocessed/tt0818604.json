{"title":"Independence for a Day","plot":"According to Jewish tradition, a day lasts from sunset to sunset. On Friday 14.05.1948, in a house on Rothschild St. in Tel Aviv, the ceremony of the declaration of the independence of the new State of Israel was hastily held. The time was 16:30. Several hours later, the Egyptian air force struck Tel Aviv, thus marking the beginning of the Israeli War of Independence. In the meantime, the Sabbath began, a new day commenced and so Israel was \"awarded\" a single day of independence. Ever since the State of Israel has been constantly in a state of war... As a tribute to this occasion, the movie was filmed during a single Independence Day. The film is a personal and national journey into the cultural, social and historical landscape of ourselves, as it examines the distinctions between the founders' intentions and the result, encounters figures who are part of this landscape and attempts to create an image for remembrance of a state on a day.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Accord","to","Jewish","tradit",",","a","day","last","from","sunset","to","sunset",".","On","Friday","14.05.1948",",","in","a","hous","on","Rothschild","St.","in","Tel","Aviv",",","the","ceremoni","of","the","declar","of","the","independ","of","the","new","State","of","Israel","was","hastili","held",".","The","time","was","16:30",".","Sever","hour","later",",","the","Egyptian","air","forc","struck","Tel","Aviv",",","thus","mark","the","begin","of","the","Israeli","War","of","Independ",".","In","the","meantim",",","the","Sabbath","began",",","a","new","day","commenc","and","so","Israel","was","\"","award","\"","a","singl","day","of","independ",".","Ever","sinc","the","State","of","Israel","has","been","constant","in","a","state","of","war","...","As","a","tribut","to","this","occas",",","the","movi","was","film","dure","a","singl","Independ","Day",".","The","film","is","a","person","and","nation","journey","into","the","cultur",",","social","and","histor","landscap","of","ourselv",",","as","it","examin","the","distinct","between","the","founder","'","intent","and","the","result",",","encount","figur","who","are","part","of","this","landscap","and","attempt","to","creat","an","imag","for","remembr","of","a","state","on","a","day","."],"lemmas":["accord","to","jewish","tradition",",","a","day","last","from","sunset","to","sunset",".","on","Friday","14.05.1948",",","in","a","house","on","Rothschild","St.","in","Tel","Aviv",",","the","ceremony","of","the","declaration","of","the","independence","of","the","new","State","of","Israel","be","hastily","hold",".","the","time","be","16:30",".","several","hour","later",",","the","egyptian","air","force","strike","Tel","Aviv",",","thus","mark","the","beginning","of","the","Israeli","War","of","Independence",".","in","the","meantime",",","the","Sabbath","begin",",","a","new","day","commence","and","so","Israel","be","``","award","''","a","single","day","of","independence",".","ever","since","the","State","of","Israel","have","be","constantly","in","a","state","of","war","...","as","a","tribute","to","this","occasion",",","the","movie","be","film","during","a","single","Independence","Day",".","the","film","be","a","personal","and","national","journey","into","the","cultural",",","social","and","historical","landscape","of","ourselves",",","as","it","examine","the","distinction","between","the","founder","'","intention","and","the","result",",","encounter","figure","who","be","part","of","this","landscape","and","attempt","to","create","a","image","for","remembrance","of","a","state","on","a","day","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["According to Jewish","to Jewish tradition","Jewish tradition ,","tradition , a",", a day","a day lasts","day lasts from","lasts from sunset","from sunset to","sunset to sunset","On Friday 14.05.1948","Friday 14.05.1948 ,","14.05.1948 , in",", in a","in a house","a house on","house on Rothschild","on Rothschild St.","Rothschild St. in","St. in Tel","in Tel Aviv","Tel Aviv ,","Aviv , the",", the ceremony","the ceremony of","ceremony of the","of the declaration","the declaration of","declaration of the","of the independence","the independence of","independence of the","of the new","the new State","new State of","State of Israel","of Israel was","Israel was hastily","was hastily held","The time was","time was 16:30","Several hours later","hours later ,","later , the",", the Egyptian","the Egyptian air","Egyptian air force","air force struck","force struck Tel","struck Tel Aviv","Tel Aviv ,","Aviv , thus",", thus marking","thus marking the","marking the beginning","the beginning of","beginning of the","of the Israeli","the Israeli War","Israeli War of","War of Independence","In the meantime","the meantime ,","meantime , the",", the Sabbath","the Sabbath began","Sabbath began ,","began , a",", a new","a new day","new day commenced","day commenced and","commenced and so","and so Israel","so Israel was","Israel was \"","was \" awarded","\" awarded \"","awarded \" a","\" a single","a single day","single day of","day of independence","Ever since the","since the State","the State of","State of Israel","of Israel has","Israel has been","has been constantly","been constantly in","constantly in a","in a state","a state of","state of war","of war ...","war ...

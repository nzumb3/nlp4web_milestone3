{"title":"Mr Coperthwaite: A Life in the Maine Woods","plot":"In 1960, Bill Coperthwaite bought 300 acres of wilderness in Machiasport, Maine. Influenced by the poetry of Emily Dickinson and by the back to the land movement of Scott and Helen Nearing, Bill Coperthwaite is committed to what he calls a handmade life. For the last fifty years, Bill Coperthwaite has lived and worked in the forest. He is a builder of yurts, and a maker of spoons, bowls and chairs. A meditation on time and process, this film explores an overlooked aspect of American culture and the critical place of nature within it.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","1960",",","Bill","Coperthwait","bought","300","acr","of","wilder","in","Machiasport",",","Main",".","Influenc","by","the","poetri","of","Emili","Dickinson","and","by","the","back","to","the","land","movement","of","Scott","and","Helen","Near",",","Bill","Coperthwait","is","commit","to","what","he","call","a","handmad","life",".","For","the","last","fifti","year",",","Bill","Coperthwait","has","live","and","work","in","the","forest",".","He","is","a","builder","of","yurt",",","and","a","maker","of","spoon",",","bowl","and","chair",".","A","medit","on","time","and","process",",","this","film","explor","an","overlook","aspect","of","American","cultur","and","the","critic","place","of","natur","within","it","."],"lemmas":["in","1960",",","Bill","Coperthwaite","buy","300","acre","of","wilderness","in","Machiasport",",","Maine",".","Influenced","by","the","poetry","of","Emily","Dickinson","and","by","the","back","to","the","land","movement","of","Scott","and","Helen","Nearing",",","Bill","Coperthwaite","be","commit","to","what","he","call","a","handmade","life",".","for","the","last","fifty","year",",","Bill","Coperthwaite","have","live","and","work","in","the","forest",".","he","be","a","builder","of","yurt",",","and","a","maker","of","spoon",",","bowl","and","chair",".","a","meditation","on","time","and","process",",","this","film","explore","a","overlook","aspect","of","american","culture","and","the","critical","place","of","nature","within","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1960 ,","1960 , Bill",", Bill Coperthwaite","Bill Coperthwaite bought","Coperthwaite bought 300","bought 300 acres","300 acres of","acres of wilderness","of wilderness in","wilderness in Machiasport","in Machiasport ,","Machiasport , Maine","Influenced by the","by the poetry","the poetry of","poetry of Emily","of Emily Dickinson","Emily Dickinson and","Dickinson and by","and by the","by the back","the back to","back to the","to the land","the land movement","land movement of","movement of Scott","of Scott and","Scott and Helen","and Helen Nearing","Helen Nearing ,","Nearing , Bill",", Bill Coperthwaite","Bill Coperthwaite is","Coperthwaite is committed","is committed to","committed to what","to what he","what he calls","he calls a","calls a handmade","a handmade life","For the last","the last fifty","last fifty years","fifty years ,","years , Bill",", Bill Coperthwaite","Bill Coperthwaite has","Coperthwaite has lived","has lived and","lived and worked","and worked in","worked in the","in the forest","He is a","is a builder","a builder of","builder of yurts","of yurts ,","yurts , and",", and a","and a maker","a maker of","maker of spoons","of spoons ,","spoons , bowls",", bowls and","bowls and chairs","A meditation on","meditation on time","on time and","time and process","and process ,","process , this",", this film","this film explores","film explores an","explores an overlooked","an overlooked aspect","overlooked aspect of","aspect of American","of American culture","American culture and","culture and the","and the critical","the critical place","critical place of","place of nature","of nature within","nature within it"],"2grams":["In 1960","1960 ,",", Bill","Bill Coperthwaite","Coperthwaite bought","bought 300","300 acres","acres of","of wilderness","wilderness in","in Machiasport","Machiasport ,",", Maine","Influenced by","by the","the poetry","poetry of","of Emily","Emily Dickinson","Dickinson and","and by","by the","the back","back to","to the","the land","land movement","movement of","of Scott","Scott and","and Helen","Helen Nearing","Nearing ,",", Bill","Bill Coperthwaite","Coperthwaite is","is committed","committed to","to what","what he","he calls","calls a","a handmade","handmade life","For the","the last","last fifty","fifty years","years ,",", Bill","Bill Coperthwaite","Coperthwaite has","has lived","lived and","and worked","worked in","in the","the forest","He is","is a","a builder","builder of","of yurts","yurts ,",", and","and a","a maker","maker of","of spoons","spoons ,",", bowls","bowls and","and chairs","A meditation","meditation on","on time","time and","and process","process ,",", this","this film","film explores","explores an","an overlooked","overlooked aspect","aspect of","of American","American culture","culture and","and the","the critical","critical place","place of","of nature","nature within","within it"]}

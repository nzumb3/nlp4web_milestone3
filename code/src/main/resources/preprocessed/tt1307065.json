{"title":"Love at First Hiccup","plot":"LOVE AT FIRST HICCUP is a charming, innocent, and intelligent romantic comedy about the freshman Victor who has contracted a case of Anya-itis (acute and incurable love-passion for high school senior Anya). And why shouldn't he? She is beautiful and popular. Rich but incredibly sweet with a rare innocence. In other words: Way out of Victor's league. Unfortunately Anya also dates a rich guy, Peter, who drives a fancy lotus and has a stuffed Gucci wallet. However chance meetings riddled with awkward hiccups soon makes sparks fly between Anya and Victor. Maybe Victor's shy and goofy charm can beat out Peters arrogance?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["LOVE","AT","FIRST","HICCUP","is","a","charm",",","innoc",",","and","intellig","romant","comedi","about","the","freshman","Victor","who","has","contract","a","case","of","Anya-iti","(","acut","and","incur","love-pass","for","high","school","senior","Anya",")",".","And","whi","should","n't","he","?","She","is","beauti","and","popular",".","Rich","but","incred","sweet","with","a","rare","innoc",".","In","other","word",":","Way","out","of","Victor","'s","leagu",".","Unfortun","Anya","also","date","a","rich","guy",",","Peter",",","who","drive","a","fanci","lotus","and","has","a","stuf","Gucci","wallet",".","Howev","chanc","meet","riddl","with","awkward","hiccup","soon","make","spark","fli","between","Anya","and","Victor",".","Mayb","Victor","'s","shi","and","goofi","charm","can","beat","out","Peter","arrog","?"],"lemmas":["LOVE","AT","FIRST","HICCUP","be","a","charming",",","innocent",",","and","intelligent","romantic","comedy","about","the","freshman","Victor","who","have","contract","a","case","of","anya-itis","-lrb-","acute","and","incurable","love-passion","for","high","school","senior","Anya","-rrb-",".","and","why","should","not","he","?","she","be","beautiful","and","popular",".","Rich","but","incredibly","sweet","with","a","rare","innocence",".","in","other","word",":","way","out","of","Victor","'s","league",".","unfortunately","Anya","also","date","a","rich","guy",",","Peter",",","who","drive","a","fancy","lotus","and","have","a","stuff","Gucci","wallet",".","however","chance","meeting","riddled","with","awkward","hiccup","soon","make","spark","fly","between","Anya","and","Victor",".","Maybe","Victor","'s","shy","and","goofy","charm","can","beat","out","Peters","arrogance","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["LOVE

{"title":"Going Deep for Vancouver","plot":"Since her childhood Margriet de Schutter has had a dream: to compete at the Olympics in Vancouver as a short track speed skater. Years of vigorous training bring her success, but also a battle with an increasing number of injuries. When she loses her place in the National Team, Margriet suffers a mental crisis. How will she cope without her sport, will she still know who she really is? Her mental coach advises her to find her true self again. The same passion that drove Margriet to 'go deep' as an athlete enables her to go deep in this very personal and revealing documentary.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["Sinc","her","childhood","Margriet","de","Schutter","has","had","a","dream",":","to","compet","at","the","Olympic","in","Vancouv","as","a","short","track","speed","skater",".","Year","of","vigor","train","bring","her","success",",","but","also","a","battl","with","an","increas","number","of","injuri",".","When","she","lose","her","place","in","the","Nation","Team",",","Margriet","suffer","a","mental","crisi",".","How","will","she","cope","without","her","sport",",","will","she","still","know","who","she","realli","is","?","Her","mental","coach","advis","her","to","find","her","true","self","again",".","The","same","passion","that","drove","Margriet","to","'","go","deep","'","as","an","athlet","enabl","her","to","go","deep","in","this","veri","person","and","reveal","documentari","."],"lemmas":["since","she","childhood","Margriet","de","Schutter","have","have","a","dream",":","to","compete","at","the","Olympics","in","Vancouver","as","a","short","track","speed","skater",".","year","of","vigorous","training","bring","she","success",",","but","also","a","battle","with","a","increase","number","of","injury",".","when","she","lose","she","place","in","the","National","Team",",","Margriet","suffer","a","mental","crisis",".","how","will","she","cope","without","she","sport",",","will","she","still","know","who","she","really","be","?","she","mental","coach","advise","she","to","find","she","true","self","again",".","the","same","passion","that","drive","Margriet","to","'","go","deep","'","as","a","athlete","enable","she","to","go","deep","in","this","very","personal","and","revealing","documentary","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Since her childhood","her childhood Margriet","childhood Margriet de","Margriet de Schutter","de Schutter has","Schutter has had","has had a","had a dream","a dream :","dream : to",": to compete","to compete at","compete at the","at the Olympics","the Olympics in","Olympics in Vancouver","in Vancouver as","Vancouver as a","as a short","a short track","short track speed","track speed skater","Years of vigorous","of vigorous training","vigorous training bring","training bring her","bring her success","her success ,","success , but",", but also","but also a","also a battle","a battle with","battle with an","with an increasing","an increasing number","increasing number of","number of injuries","When she loses","she loses her","loses her place","her place in","place in the","in the National","the National Team","National Team ,","Team , Margriet",", Margriet suffers","Margriet suffers a","suffers a mental","a mental crisis","How will she","will she cope","she cope without","cope without her","without her sport","her sport ,","sport , will",", will she","will she still","she still know","still know who","know who she","who she really","she really is","Her mental coach","mental coach advises","coach advises her","advises her to","her to find","to find her","find her true","her true self","true self again","The same passion","same passion that","passion that drove","that drove Margriet","drove Margriet to","Margriet to '","to ' go","' go deep","go deep '","deep ' as","' as an","as an athlete","an athlete enables","athlete enables her","enables her to","her to go","to go deep","go deep in","deep in this","in this very","this very personal","very personal and","personal and revealing","and revealing documentary"],"2grams":["Since her","her childhood","childhood Margriet","Margriet de","de Schutter","Schutter has","has had","had a","a dream","dream :",": to","to compete","compete at","at the","the Olympics","Olympics in","in Vancouver","Vancouver as","as a","a short","short track","track speed","speed skater","Years of","of vigorous","vigorous training","training bring","bring her","her success","success ,",", but","but also","also a","a battle","battle with","with an","an increasing","increasing number","number of","of injuries","When she","she loses","loses her","her place","place in","in the","the National","National Team","Team ,",", Margriet","Margriet suffers","suffers a","a mental","mental crisis","How will","will she","she cope","cope without","without her","her sport","sport ,",", will","will she","she still","still know","know who","who she","she really","really is","Her mental","mental coach","coach advises","advises her","her to","to find","find her","her true","true self","self again","The same","same passion","passion that","that drove","drove Margriet","Margriet to","to '","' go","go deep","deep '","' as","as an","an athlete","athlete enables","enables her","her to","to go","go deep","deep in","in this","this very","very personal","personal and","and revealing","revealing documentary"]}

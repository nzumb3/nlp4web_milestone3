{"title":"Virtual JFK: Vietnam If Kennedy Had Lived","plot":"VIRTUAL JFK investigates one of the most debated \"what if\" scenarios in the history of U.S. foreign policy: What would President John F. Kennedy have done in Vietnam if he had not been assassinated in 1963, and had he been re-elected in 1964? The film employs what Harvard historian Niall Ferguson calls \"virtual history,\" assessing the plausibility of counterfactuals - \"what ifs\" - and the outcomes they might have produced. The heart of the film deals with the question: Does it matter who is president on issues of war and peace?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["VIRTUAL","JFK","investig","one","of","the","most","debat","\"","what","if","\"","scenario","in","the","histori","of","U.S.","foreign","polici",":","What","would","Presid","John","F.","Kennedi","have","done","in","Vietnam","if","he","had","not","been","assassin","in","1963",",","and","had","he","been","re-elect","in","1964","?","The","film","employ","what","Harvard","historian","Niall","Ferguson","call","\"","virtual","histori",",","\"","assess","the","plausibl","of","counterfactu","-","\"","what","if","\"","-","and","the","outcom","they","might","have","produc",".","The","heart","of","the","film","deal","with","the","question",":","Doe","it","matter","who","is","presid","on","issu","of","war","and","peac","?"],"lemmas":["VIRTUAL","JFK","investigate","one","of","the","most","debate","``","what","if","''","scenario","in","the","history","of","U.S.","foreign","policy",":","what","would","President","John","F.","Kennedy","have","do","in","Vietnam","if","he","have","not","be","assassinate","in","1963",",","and","have","he","be","re-elect","in","1964","?","the","film","employ","what","Harvard","historian","Niall","Ferguson","call","``","virtual","history",",","''","assess","the","plausibility","of","counterfactual","-","``","what","if","''","-","and","the","outcome","they","might","have","produce",".","the","heart","of","the","film","deal","with","the","question",":","do","it","matter","who","be","president","on","issue","of","war","and","peace","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["VIRTUAL JFK investigates","JFK investigates one","investigates one of","one of the","of the most","the most debated","most debated \"","debated \" what","\" what if","what if \"","if \" scenarios","\" scenarios in","scenarios in the","in the history","the history of","history of U.S.","of U.S. foreign","U.S. foreign policy","foreign policy :","policy : What",": What would","What would President","would President John","President John F.","John F.

But that changes when Nashville Times reporter Matt Harper meets an idealistic blue blood bent on discovering the truth. Harper undertakes the investigation despite the opposition of his publisher, violent threats from mysterious forces, a break-up with his fiancee and his father's cancer diagnosis. Deadline is a story of murder, family, race, and of redemption - for a small Southern town and for Matt Harper.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["The","murder","of","an","African","American","youth","in","rural","Alabama","has","gone","unpunish",",","unsolv","and","uninvestig","for","almost","twenti","year",".","But","that","chang","when","Nashvill","Time","report","Matt","Harper","meet","an","idealist","blue","blood","bent","on","discov","the","truth",".","Harper","undertak","the","investig","despit","the","opposit","of","his","publish",",","violent","threat","from","mysteri","forc",",","a","break-up","with","his","fiance","and","his","father","'s","cancer","diagnosi",".","Deadlin","is","a","stori","of","murder",",","famili",",","race",",","and","of","redempt","-","for","a","small","Southern","town","and","for","Matt","Harper","."],"lemmas":["the","murder","of","a","african","american","youth","in","rural","Alabama","have","go","unpunished",",","unsolved","and","uninvestigated","for","almost","twenty","year",".","but","that","change","when","Nashville","Times","reporter","Matt","Harper","meet","a","idealistic","blue","blood","bent","on","discover","the","truth",".","Harper","undertake","the","investigation","despite","the","opposition","of","he","publisher",",","violent","threat","from","mysterious","force",",","a","break-up","with","he","fiancee","and","he","father","'s","cancer","diagnosis",".","deadline","be","a","story","of","murder",",","family",",","race",",","and","of","redemption","-","for","a","small","southern","town","and","for","Matt","Harper","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The murder of","murder of an","of an African","an African American","African American youth","American youth in","youth in rural","in rural Alabama","rural Alabama has","Alabama has gone","has gone unpunished","gone unpunished ,","unpunished , unsolved",", unsolved and","unsolved and uninvestigated","and uninvestigated for","uninvestigated for almost","for almost twenty","almost twenty years","But that changes","that changes when","changes when Nashville","when Nashville Times","Nashville Times reporter","Times reporter Matt","reporter Matt Harper","Matt Harper meets","Harper meets an","meets an idealistic","an idealistic blue","idealistic blue blood","blue blood bent","blood bent on","bent on discovering","on discovering the","discovering the truth","Harper undertakes the","undertakes the investigation","the investigation despite","investigation despite the","despite the opposition","the opposition of","opposition of his","of his publisher","his publisher ,","publisher , violent",", violent threats","violent threats from","threats from mysterious","from mysterious forces","mysterious forces ,","forces , a",", a break-up","a break-up with","break-up with his","with his fiancee","his fiancee and","fiancee and his","and his father","his father 's","father 's cancer","'s cancer diagnosis","Deadline is a","is a story","a story of","story of murder","of murder ,","murder , family",", family ,","family , race",", race ,","race , and",", and of","and of redemption","of redemption -","redemption - for","- for a","for a small","a small Southern","small Southern town","Southern town and","town and for","and for Matt","for Matt Harper"],"2grams":["The murder","murder of","of an","an African","African American","American youth","youth in","in rural","rural Alabama","Alabama has","has gone","gone unpunished","unpunished ,",", unsolved","unsolved and","and uninvestigated","uninvestigated for","for almost","almost twenty","twenty years","But that","that changes","changes when","when Nashville","Nashville Times","Times reporter","reporter Matt","Matt Harper","Harper meets","meets an","an idealistic","idealistic blue","blue blood","blood bent","bent on","on discovering","discovering the","the truth","Harper undertakes","undertakes the","the investigation","investigation despite","despite the","the opposition","opposition of","of his","his publisher","publisher ,",", violent","violent threats","threats from","from mysterious","mysterious forces","forces ,",", a","a break-up","break-up with","with his","his fiancee","fiancee and","and his","his father","father 's","'s cancer","cancer diagnosis","Deadline is","is a","a story","story of","of murder","murder ,",", family","family ,",", race","race ,",", and","and of","of redemption","redemption -","- for","for a","a small","small Southern","Southern town","town and","and for","for Matt","Matt Harper"]}

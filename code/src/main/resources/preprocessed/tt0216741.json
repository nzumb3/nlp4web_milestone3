{"title":"Erkan & Stefan","plot":"Editor Eckernförde has come into the possession of an audiocassette that contains a recording of the last minutes of deceased politician Uwe Barschel. The circumstances of his untimely death have never been completely resolved - until now. Unfortunately, the editor's daughter Nina accidentally takes the tape with her to Munich, where she is about to visit her paralyzed Mom in a sanatorium. When this information reaches the CIA and the BND, both organizations compete to get hold of the tape. Meanwhile Erkan & Stefan, two loveable wannabe supercheckers from Munich, are assigned as bodyguards for Nina - of course, they are expected to mess up their job, so that the tape can be retrieved. But the two friends prove to be a bit more streetwise than CIA or BND ever expected.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Editor","Eckernförd","has","come","into","the","possess","of","an","audiocassett","that","contain","a","record","of","the","last","minut","of","deceas","politician","Uwe","Barschel",".","The","circumst","of","his","untim","death","have","never","been","complet","resolv","-","until","now",".","Unfortun",",","the","editor","'s","daughter","Nina","accident","take","the","tape","with","her","to","Munich",",","where","she","is","about","to","visit","her","paralyz","Mom","in","a","sanatorium",".","When","this","inform","reach","the","CIA","and","the","BND",",","both","organ","compet","to","get","hold","of","the","tape",".","Meanwhil","Erkan","&","Stefan",",","two","loveabl","wannab","supercheck","from","Munich",",","are","assign","as","bodyguard","for","Nina","-","of","cours",",","they","are","expect","to","mess","up","their","job",",","so","that","the","tape","can","be","retriev",".","But","the","two","friend","prove","to","be","a","bit","more","streetwis","than","CIA","or","BND","ever","expect","."],"lemmas":["Editor","Eckernförde","have","come","into","the","possession","of","a","audiocassette","that","contain","a","recording","of","the","last","minute","of","deceased","politician","Uwe","Barschel",".","the","circumstance","of","he","untimely","death","have","never","be","completely","resolve","-","until","now",".","unfortunately",",","the","editor","'s","daughter","Nina","accidentally","take","the","tape","with","she","to","Munich",",","where","she","be","about","to","visit","she","paralyzed","mom","in","a","sanatorium",".","when","this","information","reach","the","CIA","and","the","BND",",","both","organization","compete","to","get","hold","of","the","tape",".","meanwhile","Erkan","&","Stefan",",","two","loveable","wannabe","superchecker","from","Munich",",","be","assign","as","bodyguard","for","Nina","-","of","course",",","they","be","expect","to","mess","up","they","job",",","so","that","the","tape","can","be","retrieve",".","but","the","two","friend","prove","to","be","a","bit","more","streetwise","than","CIA","or","BND","ever","expect","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Editor Eckernförde has","Eckernförde has come","has come into","come into the","into the possession","the possession of","possession of an","of an audiocassette","an audiocassette that","audiocassette that contains","that contains a","contains a recording","a recording of","recording of the","of the last","the last minutes","last minutes of","minutes of deceased","of deceased politician","deceased politician Uwe","politician Uwe Barschel","The circumstances of","circumstances of his","of his untimely","his untimely death","untimely death have","death have never","have never been","never been completely","been completely resolved","completely resolved -","resolved -

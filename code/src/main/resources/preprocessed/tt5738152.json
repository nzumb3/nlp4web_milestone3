{"title":"Stronger","plot":"Master Sergeant Victor Raphael is nearing the end of his military career when an explosion in Afghanistan leaves him injured. Back home, he is thrust into battle once again, but he hasn't been trained for this type of warfare. Physical rehabilitation is painful, and he has more to overcome than his physical injuries. His wife, Michelle, is distant, and their marriage seems to be held together only by her sense of duty. Vic's first response is isolation, but that becomes a dead end. Feeling hopeless and alone, he is introduced to something new and uncomfortable- meeting in community with others who have faced trauma. People who endured and survived some terrible things, with the scars to prove it, are brought into his life. It is easy to see that these unlikely heroes now live with a hope and purpose far beyond this life. Somehow, their trials have made them STRONGER.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Master","Sergeant","Victor","Raphael","is","near","the","end","of","his","militari","career","when","an","explos","in","Afghanistan","leav","him","injur",".","Back","home",",","he","is","thrust","into","battl","onc","again",",","but","he","has","n't","been","train","for","this","type","of","warfar",".","Physic","rehabilit","is","pain",",","and","he","has","more","to","overcom","than","his","physic","injuri",".","His","wife",",","Michell",",","is","distant",",","and","their","marriag","seem","to","be","held","togeth","onli","by","her","sens","of","duti",".","Vic","'s","first","respons","is","isol",",","but","that","becom","a","dead","end",".","Feel","hopeless","and","alon",",","he","is","introduc","to","someth","new","and","uncomfort","-","meet","in","communiti","with","other","who","have","face","trauma",".","Peopl","who","endur","and","surviv","some","terribl","thing",",","with","the","scar","to","prove","it",",","are","brought","into","his","life",".","It","is","easi","to","see","that","these","unlik","hero","now","live","with","a","hope","and","purpos","far","beyond","this","life",".","Somehow",",","their","trial","have","made","them","STRONGER","."],"lemmas":["Master","Sergeant","Victor","Raphael","be","near","the","end","of","he","military","career","when","a","explosion","in","Afghanistan","leave","he","injure",".","back","home",",","he","be","thrust","into","battle","once","again",",","but","he","have","not","be","train","for","this","type","of","warfare",".","physical","rehabilitation","be","painful",",","and","he","have","more","to","overcome","than","he","physical","injury",".","he","wife",",","Michelle",",","be","distant",",","and","they","marriage","seem","to","be","hold","together","only","by","she","sense","of","duty",".","Vic","'s","first","response","be","isolation",",","but","that","become","a","dead","end",".","feel","hopeless","and","alone",",","he","be","introduce","to","something","new","and","uncomfortable","-","meeting","in","community","with","other","who","have","face","trauma",".","people","who","endure","and","survive","some","terrible","thing",",","with","the","scar","to","prove","it",",","be","bring","into","he","life",".","it","be","easy","to","see","that","these","unlikely","hero","now","live","with","a","hope","and","purpose","far","beyond","this","life",".","somehow",",","they","trial","have","make","they","STRONGER","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Master Sergeant Victor","Sergeant Victor Raphael","Victor Raphael is","Raphael is nearing","is nearing the","nearing the end","the end of","end of his","of his military","his military career","military career when","career when an","when an explosion","an explosion in","explosion in Afghanistan","in Afghanistan leaves","Afghanistan leaves him","leaves him injured","Back home ,","home , he",", he is","he is thrust","is thrust into","thrust into battle","into battle once","battle once again","once again ,","again , but",", but he","but he has","he has n't","has n't been","n't been trained","been trained for","trained for this","for this type","this type of","type of warfare","Physical rehabilitation is","rehabilitation is painful","is painful ,","painful , and",", and he","and he has","he has more","has more to","more to overcome","to overcome than","overcome than his","than his physical","his physical injuries","His wife ,","wife , Michelle",", Michelle ,","Michelle , is",", is distant","is distant ,","distant , and",", and their","and their marriage","their marriage seems","marriage seems to","seems to be","to be held","be held together","held together only","together only by","only by her","by her sense","her sense of","sense of duty","Vic 's first","'s first response","first response is","response is isolation","is isolation ,","isolation , but",", but that","but that becomes","that becomes a","becomes a dead","a dead end","Feeling hopeless and","hopeless and alone","and alone ,","alone , he",", he is","he is introduced","is introduced to","introduced to something","to something new","something new and","new and uncomfortable","and uncomfortable -","uncomfortable -

{"title":"Joachim Prinz: I Shall Not Be Silent","plot":"Joachim Prinz: I Shall Not Be Silent uncovers the dramatic story of a courageous religious leader whose passion for justice compelled him to speak out against bigotry over the course of five decades. As a young rabbi in Berlin in the 1930s, Joachim Prinz preached openly against the Nazi Regime and saved many lives by encouraging Jews to leave Germany. Twenty years later, Prinz became a prominent leader of the civil rights movement in the US, culminating in his stirring speech at the 1963 March on Washington in which he proclaimed, 'America must not become a nation of onlookers! America must not remain silent.' Prinz also helped build the State of Israel and spoke out boldly for peace in the Middle East.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Joachim","Prinz",":","I","Shall","Not","Be","Silent","uncov","the","dramat","stori","of","a","courag","religi","leader","whose","passion","for","justic","compel","him","to","speak","out","against","bigotri","over","the","cours","of","five","decad",".","As","a","young","rabbi","in","Berlin","in","the","1930s",",","Joachim","Prinz","preach","open","against","the","Nazi","Regim","and","save","mani","live","by","encourag","Jew","to","leav","Germani",".","Twenti","year","later",",","Prinz","becam","a","promin","leader","of","the","civil","right","movement","in","the","US",",","culmin","in","his","stir","speech","at","the","1963","March","on","Washington","in","which","he","proclaim",",","'","America","must","not","becom","a","nation","of","onlook","!","America","must","not","remain","silent",".","'","Prinz","also","help","build","the","State","of","Israel","and","spoke","out","bold","for","peac","in","the","Middl","East","."],"lemmas":["Joachim","Prinz",":","I","Shall","not","be","silent","uncover","the","dramatic","story","of","a","courageous","religious","leader","whose","passion","for","justice","compel","he","to","speak","out","against","bigotry","over","the","course","of","five","decade",".","as","a","young","rabbi","in","Berlin","in","the","1930",",","Joachim","Prinz","preach","openly","against","the","Nazi","Regime","and","save","many","life","by","encourage","jew","to","leave","Germany",".","twenty","year","later",",","Prinz","become","a","prominent","leader","of","the","civil","rights","movement","in","the","US",",","culminate","in","he","stir","speech","at","the","1963","March","on","Washington","in","which","he","proclaim",",","'","America","must","not","become","a","nation","of","onlooker","!","America","must","not","remain","silent",".","'","Prinz","also","help","build","the","State","of","Israel","and","speak","out","boldly","for","peace","in","the","Middle","East","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Joachim Prinz :","Prinz : I",": I Shall","I Shall Not","Shall Not Be","Not Be Silent","Be Silent uncovers","Silent uncovers the","uncovers the dramatic","the dramatic story","dramatic story of","story of a","of a courageous","a courageous religious","courageous religious leader","religious leader whose","leader whose passion","whose passion for","passion for justice","for justice compelled","justice compelled him","compelled him to","him to speak","to speak out","speak out against","out against bigotry","against bigotry over","bigotry over the","over the course","the course of","course of five","of five decades","As a young","a young rabbi","young rabbi in","rabbi in Berlin","in Berlin in","Berlin in the","in the 1930s","the 1930s ,","1930s , Joachim",", Joachim Prinz","Joachim Prinz preached","Prinz preached openly","preached openly against","openly against the","against the Nazi","the Nazi Regime","Nazi Regime and","Regime and saved","and saved many","saved many lives","many lives by","lives by encouraging","by encouraging Jews","encouraging Jews to","Jews to leave","to leave Germany","Twenty years later","years later ,","later , Prinz",", Prinz became","Prinz became a","became a prominent","a prominent leader","prominent leader of","leader of the","of the civil","the civil rights","civil rights movement","rights movement in","movement in the","in the US","the US ,","US , culminating",", culminating in","culminating in his","in his stirring","his stirring speech","stirring speech at","speech at the","at the 1963","the 1963 March","1963 March on","March on Washington","on Washington in","Washington in which","in which he","which he proclaimed","he proclaimed ,","proclaimed , '",", ' America","' America must","America must not","must not become","not become a","become a nation","a nation of","nation of onlookers","America must not","must not remain","not remain silent","remain silent .","silent .

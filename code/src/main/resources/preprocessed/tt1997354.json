{"title":"Exley","plot":"Where magic realism meets the Odyssey, Exley is the story of one man's journey to himself. A rent-cheque away from being a bum, Exley finds himself thrust into a perilous journey when his estranged mother calls to tell him that she is dying and needs him by her bedside on the other side of the world. In one day he encounters more obstacles than most men meet in a lifetime. This comic misadventure shatters our concrete notions of how we define ourselves.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Where","magic","realism","meet","the","Odyssey",",","Exley","is","the","stori","of","one","man","'s","journey","to","himself",".","A","rent-chequ","away","from","be","a","bum",",","Exley","find","himself","thrust","into","a","peril","journey","when","his","estrang","mother","call","to","tell","him","that","she","is","die","and","need","him","by","her","bedsid","on","the","other","side","of","the","world",".","In","one","day","he","encount","more","obstacl","than","most","men","meet","in","a","lifetim",".","This","comic","misadventur","shatter","our","concret","notion","of","how","we","defin","ourselv","."],"lemmas":["where","magic","realism","meet","the","Odyssey",",","Exley","be","the","story","of","one","man","'s","journey","to","himself",".","a","rent-cheque","away","from","be","a","bum",",","Exley","find","himself","thrust","into","a","perilous","journey","when","he","estrange","mother","call","to","tell","he","that","she","be","die","and","need","he","by","she","bedside","on","the","other","side","of","the","world",".","in","one","day","he","encounter","more","obstacle","than","most","man","meet","in","a","lifetime",".","this","comic","misadventure","shatter","we","concrete","notion","of","how","we","define","ourselves","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Where magic realism","magic realism meets","realism meets the","meets the Odyssey","the Odyssey ,","Odyssey , Exley",", Exley is","Exley is the","is the story","the story of","story of one","of one man","one man 's","man 's journey","'s journey to","journey to himself","A rent-cheque away","rent-cheque away from","away from being","from being a","being a bum","a bum ,","bum , Exley",", Exley finds","Exley finds himself","finds himself thrust","himself thrust into","thrust into a","into a perilous","a perilous journey","perilous journey when","journey when his","when his estranged","his estranged mother","estranged mother calls","mother calls to","calls to tell","to tell him","tell him that","him that she","that she is","she is dying","is dying and","dying and needs","and needs him","needs him by","him by her","by her bedside","her bedside on","bedside on the","on the other","the other side","other side of","side of the","of the world","In one day","one day he","day he encounters","he encounters more","encounters more obstacles","more obstacles than","obstacles than most","than most men","most men meet","men meet in","meet in a","in a lifetime","This comic misadventure","comic misadventure shatters","misadventure shatters our","shatters our concrete","our concrete notions","concrete notions of","notions of how","of how we","how we define","we define ourselves"],"2grams":["Where magic","magic realism","realism meets","meets the","the Odyssey","Odyssey ,",", Exley","Exley is","is the","the story","story of","of one","one man","man 's","'s journey","journey to","to himself","A rent-cheque","rent-cheque away","away from","from being","being a","a bum","bum ,",", Exley","Exley finds","finds himself","himself thrust","thrust into","into a","a perilous","perilous journey","journey when","when his","his estranged","estranged mother","mother calls","calls to","to tell","tell him","him that","that she","she is","is dying","dying and","and needs","needs him","him by","by her","her bedside","bedside on","on the","the other","other side","side of","of the","the world","In one","one day","day he","he encounters","encounters more","more obstacles","obstacles than","than most","most men","men meet","meet in","in a","a lifetime","This comic","comic misadventure","misadventure shatters","shatters our","our concrete","concrete notions","notions of","of how","how we","we define","define ourselves"]}

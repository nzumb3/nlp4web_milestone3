{"title":"Pennilesse","plot":"This creative documentary is aimed at offering an interpretation of the genesis of Joyce's masterpiece \"Ulysses\": a Triestine path along the images that inspired Joyce when writing Ulysses, his buildings, visions and deliriums reinterpreted with a special attention to his real world, daily life problems and poetical inspiration, perfectly mirroring the town and its seductions. The art of James Joyce is told by one of his main exegetes, Prof. Renzo Crivelli, who, thanks to some anecdotes of Joyce's life in Trieste, gradually identifies himself with the writer, his characters and ghosts in a stream of consciousness that freely and enthusiastically suggests an interpretation of several cultural places in Trieste interlaced with the episodes of his masterpiece. Some of his characters and allegories (Nausicaa, Molly, the blind tuner, the wandering boat) appear now and then in the story as well as in the contemporary locations of Trieste in order to remind us that, ultimately, the adventure of Man, his creatures and dreams are not related to time.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","creativ","documentari","is","aim","at","offer","an","interpret","of","the","genesi","of","Joyc","'s","masterpiec","\"","Ulyss","\"",":","a","Triestin","path","along","the","imag","that","inspir","Joyc","when","write","Ulyss",",","his","build",",","vision","and","delirium","reinterpret","with","a","special","attent","to","his","real","world",",","daili","life","problem","and","poetic","inspir",",","perfect","mirror","the","town","and","it","seduct",".","The","art","of","Jame","Joyc","is","told","by","one","of","his","main","exeget",",","Prof.","Renzo","Crivelli",",","who",",","thank","to","some","anecdot","of","Joyc","'s","life","in","Triest",",","gradual","identifi","himself","with","the","writer",",","his","charact","and","ghost","in","a","stream","of","conscious","that","freeli","and","enthusiast","suggest","an","interpret","of","sever","cultur","place","in","Triest","interlac","with","the","episod","of","his","masterpiec",".","Some","of","his","charact","and","allegori","(","Nausicaa",",","Molli",",","the","blind","tuner",",","the","wander","boat",")","appear","now","and","then","in","the","stori","as","well","as","in","the","contemporari","locat","of","Triest","in","order","to","remind","us","that",",","ultim",",","the","adventur","of","Man",",","his","creatur","and","dream","are","not","relat","to","time","."],"lemmas":["this","creative","documentary","be","aim","at","offer","a","interpretation","of","the","genesis","of","Joyce","'s","masterpiece","``","Ulysses","''",":","a","Triestine","path","along","the","image","that","inspire","Joyce","when","write","Ulysses",",","he","building",",","vision","and","delirium","reinterpret","with","a","special","attention","to","he","real","world",",","daily","life","problem","and","poetical","inspiration",",","perfectly","mirroring","the","town","and","its","seduction",".","the","art","of","James","Joyce","be","tell","by","one","of","he","main","exegete",",","Prof.","Renzo","Crivelli",",","who",",","thanks","to","some","anecdote","of","Joyce","'s","life","in","Trieste",",","gradually","identify","himself","with","the","writer",",","he","character","and","ghost","in","a","stream","of","consciousness","that","freely","and","enthusiastically","suggest","a","interpretation","of","several","cultural","place","in","Trieste","interlace","with","the","episode","of","he","masterpiece",".","some","of","he","character","and","allegory","-lrb-","Nausicaa",",","Molly",",","the","blind","tuner",",","the","wander","boat","-rrb-","appear","now","and","then","in","the","story","as","well","as","in","the","contemporary","location","of","Trieste","in","order","to","remind","we","that",",","ultimately",",","the","adventure","of","man",",","he","creature","and","dream","be","not","related","to","time","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

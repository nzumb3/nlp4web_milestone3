{"title":"Children of the X-Files","plot":"A desperate housewife discovers she is the mother of an Alien species of mankind destined to survive the coming Apocalypse. Is the father of her Alien/Human hybrid twins an Alien, an Angel, or the Anti-Christ? Kendra dreams that she has had Alien twins abducted from her by an advanced species of Aliens. When her husband takes her to see a doctor, she is told she can't have children. She sees a hypno-therapist, Dr. Farrell, who uncovers lost memories of her abduction and impregnation. Kendra joins a UFO support group and visits Area 51 where she witnesses secret government tests of captured UFO's. Her husband has her committed to an Asylum where she escapes to be re-united with her Alien family. From the secret LAPD X-files, this story is ripped from the investigations of UFO researcher William L. McDonald.","genres":["Horror"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["A","desper","housewif","discov","she","is","the","mother","of","an","Alien","speci","of","mankind","destin","to","surviv","the","come","Apocalyps",".","Is","the","father","of","her","Alien/Human","hybrid","twin","an","Alien",",","an","Angel",",","or","the","Anti-Christ","?","Kendra","dream","that","she","has","had","Alien","twin","abduct","from","her","by","an","advanc","speci","of","Alien",".","When","her","husband","take","her","to","see","a","doctor",",","she","is","told","she","ca","n't","have","children",".","She","see","a","hypno-therapist",",","Dr.","Farrel",",","who","uncov","lost","memori","of","her","abduct","and","impregn",".","Kendra","join","a","UFO","support","group","and","visit","Area","51","where","she","wit","secret","govern","test","of","captur","UFO","'s",".","Her","husband","has","her","commit","to","an","Asylum","where","she","escap","to","be","re-unit","with","her","Alien","famili",".","From","the","secret","LAPD","X-file",",","this","stori","is","rip","from","the","investig","of","UFO","research","William","L.","McDonald","."],"lemmas":["a","desperate","housewife","discover","she","be","the","mother","of","a","alien","species","of","mankind","destine","to","survive","the","come","Apocalypse",".","be","the","father","of","she","alien/human","hybrid","twin","a","Alien",",","a","Angel",",","or","the","Anti-Christ","?","Kendra","dream","that","she","have","have","alien","twin","abducted","from","she","by","a","advanced","species","of","alien",".","when","she","husband","take","she","to","see","a","doctor",",","she","be","tell","she","can","not","have","child",".","she","see","a","hypno-therapist",",","Dr.","Farrell",",","who","uncover","lose","memory","of","she","abduction","and","impregnation",".","Kendra","join","a","UFO","support","group","and","visit","Area","51","where","she","witness","secret","government","test","of","capture","UFO","'s",".","she","husband","have","she","commit","to","a","asylum","where","she","escape","to","be","re-unite","with","she","alien","family",".","from","the","secret","lapd","x-file",",","this","story","be","rip","from","the","investigation","of","UFO","researcher","William","L.","McDonald","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A desperate housewife","desperate housewife discovers","housewife discovers she","discovers she is","she is the","is the mother","the mother of","mother of an","of an Alien","an Alien species","Alien species of","species of mankind","of mankind destined","mankind destined to","destined to survive","to survive the","survive the coming","the coming Apocalypse","Is the father","the father of","father of her","of her Alien/Human","her Alien/Human hybrid","Alien/Human hybrid twins","hybrid twins an","twins an Alien","an Alien ,","Alien , an",", an Angel","an Angel ,","Angel , or",", or the","or the Anti-Christ","Kendra dreams that","dreams that she","that she has","she has had","has had Alien","had Alien twins","Alien twins abducted","twins abducted from","abducted from her","from her by","her by an","by an advanced","an advanced species","advanced species of","species of Aliens","When her husband","her husband takes","husband takes her","takes her to","her to see","to see a","see a doctor","a doctor ,","doctor , she",", she is","she is told","is told she","told she ca","she ca n't","ca n't have","n't have children","She sees a","sees a hypno-therapist","a hypno-therapist ,","hypno-therapist , Dr.",", Dr. Farrell","Dr. Farrell ,","Farrell , who",", who uncovers","who uncovers lost","uncovers lost memories","lost memories of","memories of her","of her abduction","her abduction and","abduction and impregnation","Kendra joins a","joins a UFO","a UFO support","UFO support group","support group and","group and visits","and visits Area","visits Area 51","Area 51 where","51 where she","where she witnesses","she witnesses secret","witnesses secret government","secret government tests","government tests of","tests of captured","of captured UFO","captured UFO 's","Her husband has","husband has her","has her committed","her committed to","committed to an","to an Asylum","an Asylum where","Asylum where she","where she escapes","she escapes to","escapes to be","to be re-united","be re-united with","re-united with her","with her Alien","her Alien family","From the secret","the secret LAPD","secret LAPD X-files","LAPD X-files ,","X-files , this",", this story","this story is","story is ripped","is ripped from","ripped from the","from the investigations","the investigations of","investigations of UFO","of UFO researcher","UFO researcher William","researcher William L.","William L.

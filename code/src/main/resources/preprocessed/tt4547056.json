{"title":"The Girl with All the Gifts","plot":"In a dystopian near future, humanity has been ravaged by a mysterious fungal disease. The afflicted are robbed of all free will and turned into flesh-eating 'hungries'. Humankind's only hope is a small group of hybrid children who crave human flesh but retain the ability to think and feel. The children go to school at an army base in rural Britain, where they're subjected to cruel experiments by Dr. Caroline Caldwell (Glenn Close). School teacher Helen Justineau (Gemma Arterton) grows particularly close to an exceptional girl named Melanie (Sennia Nanua), thus forming a special bond. But when the base is invaded, the trio escape with the assistance of Sgt. Eddie Parks (Paddy Considine) and embark on a perilous journey of survival, during which Melanie must come to terms with who she is.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["In","a","dystopian","near","futur",",","human","has","been","ravag","by","a","mysteri","fungal","diseas",".","The","afflict","are","rob","of","all","free","will","and","turn","into","flesh-eat","'","hungri","'",".","Humankind","'s","onli","hope","is","a","small","group","of","hybrid","children","who","crave","human","flesh","but","retain","the","abil","to","think","and","feel",".","The","children","go","to","school","at","an","armi","base","in","rural","Britain",",","where","they","re","subject","to","cruel","experi","by","Dr.","Carolin","Caldwel","(","Glenn","Close",")",".","School","teacher","Helen","Justineau","(","Gemma","Arterton",")","grow","particular","close","to","an","except","girl","name","Melani","(","Sennia","Nanua",")",",","thus","form","a","special","bond",".","But","when","the","base","is","invad",",","the","trio","escap","with","the","assist","of","Sgt.","Eddie","Park","(","Paddi","Considin",")","and","embark","on","a","peril","journey","of","surviv",",","dure","which","Melani","must","come","to","term","with","who","she","is","."],"lemmas":["in","a","dystopian","near","future",",","humanity","have","be","ravage","by","a","mysterious","fungal","disease",".","the","afflict","be","rob","of","all","free","will","and","turn","into","flesh-eating","'","hungry","'",".","Humankind","'s","only","hope","be","a","small","group","of","hybrid","child","who","crave","human","flesh","but","retain","the","ability","to","think","and","feel",".","the","child","go","to","school","at","a","army","base","in","rural","Britain",",","where","they","be","subject","to","cruel","experiment","by","Dr.","Caroline","Caldwell","-lrb-","Glenn","Close","-rrb-",".","school","teacher","Helen","Justineau","-lrb-","Gemma","Arterton","-rrb-","grow","particularly","close","to","a","exceptional","girl","name","Melanie","-lrb-","Sennia","Nanua","-rrb-",",","thus","form","a","special","bond",".","but","when","the","base","be","invade",",","the","trio","escape","with","the","assistance","of","Sgt.","Eddie","Parks","-lrb-","Paddy","Considine","-rrb-","and","embark","on","a","perilous","journey","of","survival",",","during","which","Melanie","must","come","to","term","with","who","she","be","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In a dystopian","a dystopian near","dystopian near future","near future ,","future , humanity",", humanity has","humanity has been","has been ravaged","been ravaged by","ravaged by a","by a mysterious","a mysterious fungal","mysterious fungal disease","The afflicted are","afflicted are robbed","are robbed of","robbed of all","of all free","all free will","free will and","will and turned","and turned into","turned into flesh-eating","into flesh-eating '","flesh-eating ' hungries","' hungries '","Humankind 's only","'s only hope","only hope is","hope is a","is a small","a small group","small group of","group of hybrid","of hybrid children","hybrid children who","children who crave","who crave human","crave human flesh","human flesh but","flesh but retain","but retain the","retain the ability","the ability to","ability to think","to think and","think and feel","The children go","children go to","go to school","to school at","school at an","at an army","an army base","army base in","base in rural","in rural Britain","rural Britain ,","Britain , where",", where they","where they 're","they 're subjected","'re subjected to","subjected to cruel","to cruel experiments","cruel experiments by","experiments by Dr.","by Dr. Caroline","Dr. Caroline Caldwell","Caroline Caldwell (","Caldwell ( Glenn","( Glenn Close","Glenn Close )","School teacher Helen","teacher Helen Justineau","Helen Justineau (","Justineau ( Gemma","( Gemma Arterton","Gemma Arterton )","Arterton ) grows",") grows particularly","grows particularly close","particularly close to","close to an","to an exceptional","an exceptional girl","exceptional girl named","girl named Melanie","named Melanie (","Melanie ( Sennia","( Sennia Nanua","Sennia Nanua )","Nanua ) ,",") , thus",", thus forming","thus forming a","forming a special","a special bond","But when the","when the base","the base is","base is invaded","is invaded ,","invaded , the",", the trio","the trio escape","trio escape with","escape with the","with the assistance","the assistance of","assistance of Sgt.","of Sgt.

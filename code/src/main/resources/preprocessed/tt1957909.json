{"title":"Gajaar: Journey of the Soul","plot":"GAJAAR is a unique cinematic experience and the story of self-discovery and transformation of Parth during his 18 days Journey of pilgrimage (Waari). Warkaris nonstop chanting and musical celebration in the name of God Mauli [mother of the Universe] means 'Gajaar'. Parth is a young, ambitious and egoistic film director from Mumbai. He is in a live-in relationship with his love Geetali, a sound designer by profession. Eric, an Anthropology PhD student from US and Parth come together to make a film on the traditional Maharashtrian religious pilgrimage journey of 'WAARI'. It was Parth's dream to make a path-breaking international film on Waari wherein millions of devotees walk together for 250 kms in 18 days to meet their beloved lord Vithoba. Parth undertakes the challenge to capture this eventful journey of millions, with the core thoughts behind it, in a contemporary manner. He and his team, work very hard to capture the grandeur and soul of Waari. The 18 Chapters of the Dnyaneshwari (a household religious book followed by Warkaris as a key to bliss and happy living) unfold very interestingly with real life characters in the pilgrimage.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["GAJAAR","is","a","uniqu","cinemat","experi","and","the","stori","of","self-discoveri","and","transform","of","Parth","dure","his","18","day","Journey","of","pilgrimag","(","Waari",")",".","Warkari","nonstop","chant","and","music","celebr","in","the","name","of","God","Mauli","[","mother","of","the","Univers","]","mean","'","Gajaar","'",".","Parth","is","a","young",",","ambiti","and","egoist","film","director","from","Mumbai",".","He","is","in","a","live-in","relationship","with","his","love","Geetali",",","a","sound","design","by","profess",".","Eric",",","an","Anthropolog","PhD","student","from","US","and","Parth","come","togeth","to","make","a","film","on","the","tradit","Maharashtrian","religi","pilgrimag","journey","of","'","WAARI","'",".","It","was","Parth","'s","dream","to","make","a","path-break","intern","film","on","Waari","wherein","million","of","devote","walk","togeth","for","250","kms","in","18","day","to","meet","their","belov","lord","Vithoba",".","Parth","undertak","the","challeng","to","captur","this","event","journey","of","million",",","with","the","core","thought","behind","it",",","in","a","contemporari","manner",".","He","and","his","team",",","work","veri","hard","to","captur","the","grandeur","and","soul","of","Waari",".","The","18","Chapter","of","the","Dnyaneshwari","(","a","household","religi","book","follow","by","Warkari","as","a","key","to","bliss","and","happi","live",")","unfold","veri","interest","with","real","life","charact","in","the","pilgrimag","."],"lemmas":["gajaar","be","a","unique","cinematic","experience","and","the","story","of","self-discovery","and","transformation","of","Parth","during","he","18","day","journey","of","pilgrimage","-lrb-","waari","-rrb-",".","warkaris","nonstop","chanting","and","musical","celebration","in","the","name","of","God","Mauli","-lsb-","mother","of","the","universe","-rsb-","means","'","gajaar","'",".","parth","be","a","young",",","ambitious","and","egoistic","film","director","from","Mumbai",".","he","be","in","a","live-in","relationship","with","he","love","Geetali",",","a","sound","designer","by","profession",".","Eric",",","a","Anthropology","phd","student","from","US","and","Parth","come","together","to","make","a","film","on","the","traditional","maharashtrian","religious","pilgrimage","journey","of","'","waari","'",".","it","be","Parth","'s","dream","to","make","a","path-breaking","international","film","on","Waari","wherein","million","of","devotee","walk","together","for","250","km","in","18","day","to","meet","they","beloved","lord","Vithoba",".","parth","undertake","the","challenge","to","capture","this","eventful","journey","of","million",",","with","the","core","thought","behind","it",",","in","a","contemporary","manner",".","he","and","he","team",",","work","very","hard","to","capture","the","grandeur","and","soul","of","Waari",".","the","18","chapter","of","the","Dnyaneshwari","-lrb-","a","household","religious","book","follow","by","Warkaris","as","a","key","to","bliss","and","happy","living","-rrb-","unfold","very","interestingly","with","real","life","character","in","the","pilgrimage","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["GAJAAR

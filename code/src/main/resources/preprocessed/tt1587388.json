{"title":"Yeh Hai Malegaon Ka Superman","plot":"Funny, irreverent and burlesque, this film-itself modelled on the Bollywood cinema parodies the typical Bollywood fare. It also has a larger purpose, in that it portrays the existing living conditions of a small town in India, which is true of any town in India. Made entirely by a group of non-professionals, its budget is a meagre one hundred thousand rupees(about US $ 2000/-). The superman of Malegaon is skinny, pencil-thin and has sunken cheeks. He does not provide thrills, he ushers in a new awareness in the town that he descends on. Using his special attributes, he tries to solve its problems and set it on the path of progress. It is an idealistic film, non-didactic and humorously told spoof.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"],"stems":["Funni",",","irrever","and","burlesqu",",","this","film-itself","model","on","the","Bollywood","cinema","parodi","the","typic","Bollywood","fare",".","It","also","has","a","larger","purpos",",","in","that","it","portray","the","exist","live","condit","of","a","small","town","in","India",",","which","is","true","of","ani","town","in","India",".","Made","entir","by","a","group","of","non-profession",",","it","budget","is","a","meagr","one","hundr","thousand","rupe","(","about","US","$","2000","/","-",")",".","The","superman","of","Malegaon","is","skinni",",","pencil-thin","and","has","sunken","cheek",".","He","doe","not","provid","thrill",",","he","usher","in","a","new","awar","in","the","town","that","he","descend","on",".","Using","his","special","attribut",",","he","tri","to","solv","it","problem","and","set","it","on","the","path","of","progress",".","It","is","an","idealist","film",",","non-didact","and","humor","told","spoof","."],"lemmas":["funny",",","irreverent","and","burlesque",",","this","film-itself","modelled","on","the","Bollywood","cinema","parody","the","typical","Bollywood","fare",".","it","also","have","a","larger","purpose",",","in","that","it","portray","the","exist","living","condition","of","a","small","town","in","India",",","which","be","true","of","any","town","in","India",".","make","entirely","by","a","group","of","non-professional",",","its","budget","be","a","meagre","one","hundred","thousand","rupee","-lrb-","about","US","$","2000","/","-","-rrb-",".","the","superman","of","Malegaon","be","skinny",",","pencil-thin","and","have","sunken","cheek",".","he","do","not","provide","thrill",",","he","usher","in","a","new","awareness","in","the","town","that","he","descend","on",".","use","he","special","attribute",",","he","try","to","solve","its","problem","and","set","it","on","the","path","of","progress",".","it","be","a","idealistic","film",",","non-didactic","and","humorously","tell","spoof","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Funny , irreverent",", irreverent and","irreverent and burlesque","and burlesque ,","burlesque , this",", this film-itself","this film-itself modelled","film-itself modelled on","modelled on the","on the Bollywood","the Bollywood cinema","Bollywood cinema parodies","cinema parodies the","parodies the typical","the typical Bollywood","typical Bollywood fare","It also has","also has a","has a larger","a larger purpose","larger purpose ,","purpose , in",", in that","in that it","that it portrays","it portrays the","portrays the existing","the existing living","existing living conditions","living conditions of","conditions of a","of a small","a small town","small town in","town in India","in India ,","India , which",", which is","which is true","is true of","true of any","of any town","any town in","town in India","Made entirely by","entirely by a","by a group","a group of","group of non-professionals","of non-professionals ,","non-professionals , its",", its budget","its budget is","budget is a","is a meagre","a meagre one","meagre one hundred","one hundred thousand","hundred thousand rupees","thousand rupees (","rupees ( about","( about US","about US $","US $ 2000","$ 2000 /","2000 / -","/ -

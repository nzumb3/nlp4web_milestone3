{"title":"Lantouri","plot":"Pasha is the mastermind of a street gang that has moved from simple purse snatchings and muggings to car theft, kidnapping and extortion. His backstory is divulged at length and from contradictory points of view: Some say that he's a Robin Hood of sorts who only preys on the corrupt rich and uses his haul to help orphans, while others call him scum. From the standpoint of his fellow gang member Baroon (\"I'm Not Angry\" co-star Baran Kosari, thrilling here as a bad girl with incredibly alluring eyes), he's a sensitive man who cries when he kills someone.","genres":["Action"," Drama","

{"title":"Into the West","plot":"A gigantic white stallion appears mysteriously to a Traveller grandfather and his two grandsons in an Irish slum. Since, puzzlingly, the younger of the two boys is the only individual who can control the horse, ownership falls to him and his older brother by default. There being no place for the animal, they move him into the apartment of their alcoholic Traveller father. Police remove him and, in a shady deal, he ends up under control of a wealthy, underhanded horse breeder. The boys manage to retrieve him and escape on his back, but the stallion seems to have his own travelling agenda.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Family"],"stems":["A","gigant","white","stallion","appear","mysteri","to","a","Travel","grandfath","and","his","two","grandson","in","an","Irish","slum",".","Sinc",",","puzzl",",","the","younger","of","the","two","boy","is","the","onli","individu","who","can","control","the","hors",",","ownership","fall","to","him","and","his","older","brother","by","default",".","There","be","no","place","for","the","anim",",","they","move","him","into","the","apart","of","their","alcohol","Travel","father",".","Polic","remov","him","and",",","in","a","shadi","deal",",","he","end","up","under","control","of","a","wealthi",",","underhand","hors","breeder",".","The","boy","manag","to","retriev","him","and","escap","on","his","back",",","but","the","stallion","seem","to","have","his","own","travel","agenda","."],"lemmas":["a","gigantic","white","stallion","appear","mysteriously","to","a","traveller","grandfather","and","he","two","grandson","in","a","irish","slum",".","since",",","puzzlingly",",","the","younger","of","the","two","boy","be","the","only","individual","who","can","control","the","horse",",","ownership","fall","to","he","and","he","older","brother","by","default",".","there","be","no","place","for","the","animal",",","they","move","he","into","the","apartment","of","they","alcoholic","traveller","father",".","police","remove","he","and",",","in","a","shady","deal",",","he","end","up","under","control","of","a","wealthy",",","underhanded","horse","breeder",".","the","boy","manage","to","retrieve","he","and","escape","on","he","back",",","but","the","stallion","seem","to","have","he","own","travel","agenda","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A gigantic white","gigantic white stallion","white stallion appears","stallion appears mysteriously","appears mysteriously to","mysteriously to a","to a Traveller","a Traveller grandfather","Traveller grandfather and","grandfather and his","and his two","his two grandsons","two grandsons in","grandsons in an","in an Irish","an Irish slum","Since , puzzlingly",", puzzlingly ,","puzzlingly , the",", the younger","the younger of","younger of the","of the two","the two boys","two boys is","boys is the","is the only","the only individual","only individual who","individual who can","who can control","can control the","control the horse","the horse ,","horse , ownership",", ownership falls","ownership falls to","falls to him","to him and","him and his","and his older","his older brother","older brother by","brother by default","There being no","being no place","no place for","place for the","for the animal","the animal ,","animal , they",", they move","they move him","move him into","him into the","into the apartment","the apartment of","apartment of their","of their alcoholic","their alcoholic Traveller","alcoholic Traveller father","Police remove him","remove him and","him and ,","and , in",", in a","in a shady","a shady deal","shady deal ,","deal , he",", he ends","he ends up","ends up under","up under control","under control of","control of a","of a wealthy","a wealthy ,","wealthy , underhanded",", underhanded horse","underhanded horse breeder","The boys manage","boys manage to","manage to retrieve","to retrieve him","retrieve him and","him and escape","and escape on","escape on his","on his back","his back ,","back , but",", but the","but the stallion","the stallion seems","stallion seems to","seems to have","to have his","have his own","his own travelling","own travelling agenda"],"2grams":["A gigantic","gigantic white","white stallion","stallion appears","appears mysteriously","mysteriously to","to a","a Traveller","Traveller grandfather","grandfather and","and his","his two","two grandsons","grandsons in","in an","an Irish","Irish slum","Since ,",", puzzlingly","puzzlingly ,",", the","the younger","younger of","of the","the two","two boys","boys is","is the","the only","only individual","individual who","who can","can control","control the","the horse","horse ,",", ownership","ownership falls","falls to","to him","him and","and his","his older","older brother","brother by","by default","There being","being no","no place","place for","for the","the animal","animal ,",", they","they move","move him","him into","into the","the apartment","apartment of","of their","their alcoholic","alcoholic Traveller","Traveller father","Police remove","remove him","him and","and ,",", in","in a","a shady","shady deal","deal ,",", he","he ends","ends up","up under","under control","control of","of a","a wealthy","wealthy ,",", underhanded","underhanded horse","horse breeder","The boys","boys manage","manage to","to retrieve","retrieve him","him and","and escape","escape on","on his","his back","back ,",", but","but the","the stallion","stallion seems","seems to","to have","have his","his own","own travelling","travelling agenda"]}

{"title":"Voice of the Valley","plot":"Voice of the Valley tells the story of two women from the impoverished, religious and tribal agricultural hub of Jordan, the Jordan Valley. With no formal training and despite the government's refusal to issue them a license, Asma and Munira produce and broadcast a groundbreaking socio-political radio program from Amman. Despite numerous threats and backlash from their community, the women expose social, political and environmental issues plaguing the Jordan Valley; issues which have never been addressed by governmental officials in Amman. The struggle of these people is a universal one; a battle that has been fought for centuries and continues to be fought by disenfranchised populations across the globe.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Voic","of","the","Valley","tell","the","stori","of","two","women","from","the","impoverish",",","religi","and","tribal","agricultur","hub","of","Jordan",",","the","Jordan","Valley",".","With","no","formal","train","and","despit","the","govern","'s","refus","to","issu","them","a","licens",",","Asma","and","Munira","produc","and","broadcast","a","groundbreak","socio-polit","radio","program","from","Amman",".","Despit","numer","threat","and","backlash","from","their","communiti",",","the","women","expos","social",",","polit","and","environment","issu","plagu","the","Jordan","Valley",";","issu","which","have","never","been","address","by","government","offici","in","Amman",".","The","struggl","of","these","peopl","is","a","univers","one",";","a","battl","that","has","been","fought","for","centuri","and","continu","to","be","fought","by","disenfranchis","popul","across","the","globe","."],"lemmas":["Voice","of","the","Valley","tell","the","story","of","two","woman","from","the","impoverished",",","religious","and","tribal","agricultural","hub","of","Jordan",",","the","Jordan","Valley",".","with","no","formal","training","and","despite","the","government","'s","refusal","to","issue","they","a","license",",","Asma","and","Munira","produce","and","broadcast","a","groundbreaking","socio-political","radio","program","from","Amman",".","despite","numerous","threat","and","backlash","from","they","community",",","the","woman","expose","social",",","political","and","environmental","issue","plague","the","Jordan","Valley",";","issue","which","have","never","be","address","by","governmental","official","in","Amman",".","the","struggle","of","these","people","be","a","universal","one",";","a","battle","that","have","be","fight","for","century","and","continue","to","be","fight","by","disenfranchised","population","across","the","globe","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Voice of the","of the Valley","the Valley tells","Valley tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of two","of two women","two women from","women from the","from the impoverished","the impoverished ,","impoverished , religious",", religious and","religious and tribal","and tribal agricultural","tribal agricultural hub","agricultural hub of","hub of Jordan","of Jordan ,","Jordan , the",", the Jordan","the Jordan Valley","With no formal","no formal training","formal training and","training and despite","and despite the","despite the government","the government 's","government 's refusal","'s refusal to","refusal to issue","to issue them","issue them a","them a license","a license ,","license , Asma",", Asma and","Asma and Munira","and Munira produce","Munira produce and","produce and broadcast","and broadcast a","broadcast a groundbreaking","a groundbreaking socio-political","groundbreaking socio-political radio","socio-political radio program","radio program from","program from Amman","Despite numerous threats","numerous threats and","threats and backlash","and backlash from","backlash from their","from their community","their community ,","community , the",", the women","the women expose","women expose social","expose social ,","social , political",", political and","political and environmental","and environmental issues","environmental issues plaguing","issues plaguing the","plaguing the Jordan","the Jordan Valley","Jordan Valley ;","Valley ;

{"title":"Justice, My Foot!","plot":"Stephen Chow's special brand of very modern, very Hong Kong screwball comedy entered a new phase with Justice, My Foot!, a costume farce set in imperial China. Chow is a shyster with an equally eccentric kung-fu ace of a wife, hilariously played with Anita Mui Yim-fong. Accompanied by Chow's number one screen sidekick, Ng Man-tat, he manages to bring justice to the court and laughter to the viewer.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Stephen","Chow","'s","special","brand","of","veri","modern",",","veri","Hong","Kong","screwbal","comedi","enter","a","new","phase","with","Justic",",","My","Foot","!",",","a","costum","farc","set","in","imperi","China",".","Chow","is","a","shyster","with","an","equal","eccentr","kung-fu","ace","of","a","wife",",","hilari","play","with","Anita","Mui","Yim-fong",".","Accompani","by","Chow","'s","number","one","screen","sidekick",",","Ng","Man-tat",",","he","manag","to","bring","justic","to","the","court","and","laughter","to","the","viewer","."],"lemmas":["Stephen","Chow","'s","special","brand","of","very","modern",",","very","Hong","Kong","screwball","comedy","enter","a","new","phase","with","Justice",",","My","Foot","!",",","a","costume","farce","set","in","imperial","China",".","Chow","be","a","shyster","with","a","equally","eccentric","kung-fu","ace","of","a","wife",",","hilariously","play","with","Anita","Mui","yim-fong",".","accompany","by","Chow","'s","number","one","screen","sidekick",",","ng","man-tat",",","he","manage","to","bring","justice","to","the","court","and","laughter","to","the","viewer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Stephen Chow 's","Chow 's special","'s special brand","special brand of","brand of very","of very modern","very modern ,","modern , very",", very Hong","very Hong Kong","Hong Kong screwball","Kong screwball comedy","screwball comedy entered","comedy entered a","entered a new","a new phase","new phase with","phase with Justice","with Justice ,","Justice , My",", My Foot",", a costume","a costume farce","costume farce set","farce set in","set in imperial","in imperial China","Chow is a","is a shyster","a shyster with","shyster with an","with an equally","an equally eccentric","equally eccentric kung-fu","eccentric kung-fu ace","kung-fu ace of","ace of a","of a wife","a wife ,","wife , hilariously",", hilariously played","hilariously played with","played with Anita","with Anita Mui","Anita Mui Yim-fong","Accompanied by Chow","by Chow 's","Chow 's number","'s number one","number one screen","one screen sidekick","screen sidekick ,","sidekick , Ng",", Ng Man-tat","Ng Man-tat ,","Man-tat , he",", he manages","he manages to","manages to bring","to bring justice","bring justice to","justice to the","to the court","the court and","court and laughter","and laughter to","laughter to the","to the viewer"],"2grams":["Stephen Chow","Chow 's","'s special","special brand","brand of","of very","very modern","modern ,",", very","very Hong","Hong Kong","Kong screwball","screwball comedy","comedy entered","entered a","a new","new phase","phase with","with Justice","Justice ,",", My","My Foot",", a","a costume","costume farce","farce set","set in","in imperial","imperial China","Chow is","is a","a shyster","shyster with","with an","an equally","equally eccentric","eccentric kung-fu","kung-fu ace","ace of","of a","a wife","wife ,",", hilariously","hilariously played","played with","with Anita","Anita Mui","Mui Yim-fong","Accompanied by","by Chow","Chow 's","'s number","number one","one screen","screen sidekick","sidekick ,",", Ng","Ng Man-tat","Man-tat ,",", he","he manages","manages to","to bring","bring justice","justice to","to the","the court","court and","and laughter","laughter to","to the","the viewer"]}

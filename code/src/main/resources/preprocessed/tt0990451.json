{"title":"A Wake on the Pier","plot":"Every Sunday morning for over three years, the Santa Barbara chapter of the Veterans for Peace has been putting up a war memorial on the beach. They place a white cross for each soldier who has died in Iraq, laid out like a mock-graveyard. This documentary is about this war memorial and the people who visit it. Many of these visitors come to see a specific cross for a friend or relative. Others merely stumble across it. They knew the casualties were numerous, but they did not feel the enormity of it until they saw Arlington West for themselves.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Everi","Sunday","morn","for","over","three","year",",","the","Santa","Barbara","chapter","of","the","Veteran","for","Peac","has","been","put","up","a","war","memori","on","the","beach",".","They","place","a","white","cross","for","each","soldier","who","has","die","in","Iraq",",","laid","out","like","a","mock-graveyard",".","This","documentari","is","about","this","war","memori","and","the","peopl","who","visit","it",".","Mani","of","these","visitor","come","to","see","a","specif","cross","for","a","friend","or","relat",".","Other","mere","stumbl","across","it",".","They","knew","the","casualti","were","numer",",","but","they","did","not","feel","the","enorm","of","it","until","they","saw","Arlington","West","for","themselv","."],"lemmas":["every","Sunday","morning","for","over","three","year",",","the","Santa","Barbara","chapter","of","the","Veterans","for","Peace","have","be","put","up","a","war","memorial","on","the","beach",".","they","place","a","white","cross","for","each","soldier","who","have","die","in","Iraq",",","lay","out","like","a","mock-graveyard",".","this","documentary","be","about","this","war","memorial","and","the","people","who","visit","it",".","many","of","these","visitor","come","to","see","a","specific","cross","for","a","friend","or","relative",".","other","merely","stumble","across","it",".","they","know","the","casualty","be","numerous",",","but","they","do","not","feel","the","enormity","of","it","until","they","see","Arlington","West","for","themselves","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Every Sunday morning","Sunday morning for","morning for over","for over three","over three years","three years ,","years , the",", the Santa","the Santa Barbara","Santa Barbara chapter","Barbara chapter of","chapter of the","of the Veterans","the Veterans for","Veterans for Peace","for Peace has","Peace has been","has been putting","been putting up","putting up a","up a war","a war memorial","war memorial on","memorial on the","on the beach","They place a","place a white","a white cross","white cross for","cross for each","for each soldier","each soldier who","soldier who has","who has died","has died in","died in Iraq","in Iraq ,","Iraq , laid",", laid out","laid out like","out like a","like a mock-graveyard","This documentary is","documentary is about","is about this","about this war","this war memorial","war memorial and","memorial and the","and the people","the people who","people who visit","who visit it","Many of these","of these visitors","these visitors come","visitors come to","come to see","to see a","see a specific","a specific cross","specific cross for","cross for a","for a friend","a friend or","friend or relative","Others merely stumble","merely stumble across","stumble across it","They knew the","knew the casualties","the casualties were","casualties were numerous","were numerous ,","numerous , but",", but they","but they did","they did not","did not feel","not feel the","feel the enormity","the enormity of","enormity of it","of it until","it until they","until they saw","they saw Arlington","saw Arlington West","Arlington West for","West for themselves"],"2grams":["Every Sunday","Sunday morning","morning for","for over","over three","three years","years ,",", the","the Santa","Santa Barbara","Barbara chapter","chapter of","of the","the Veterans","Veterans for","for Peace","Peace has","has been","been putting","putting up","up a","a war","war memorial","memorial on","on the","the beach","They place","place a","a white","white cross","cross for","for each","each soldier","soldier who","who has","has died","died in","in Iraq","Iraq ,",", laid","laid out","out like","like a","a mock-graveyard","This documentary","documentary is","is about","about this","this war","war memorial","memorial and","and the","the people","people who","who visit","visit it","Many of","of these","these visitors","visitors come","come to","to see","see a","a specific","specific cross","cross for","for a","a friend","friend or","or relative","Others merely","merely stumble","stumble across","across it","They knew","knew the","the casualties","casualties were","were numerous","numerous ,",", but","but they","they did","did not","not feel","feel the","the enormity","enormity of","of it","it until","until they","they saw","saw Arlington","Arlington West","West for","for themselves"]}

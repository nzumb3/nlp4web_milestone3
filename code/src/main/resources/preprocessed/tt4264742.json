{"title":"A Day in the Life of the Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk","plot":"This High-Definition documentary special presents an intimate view of life aboard the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk as it patrolled the United States south coastal region in February and March of 1999. Director Stuart Calcote's High-Definition camera crew spent twelve days aboard the Mohawk as it sailed on a course from Key West, Florida, to Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico. Every aspect of the crew's life and work on board the Mohawk was documented. From early morning revelry to taps at night, from high above the bridge to the depths of the engine room, this program follows the lives of the U.S.S. Mohawk's officers and crew as they guard the shores of America.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","High-Definit","documentari","special","present","an","intim","view","of","life","aboard","the","Unite","State","Coast","Guard","Cutter","Mohawk","as","it","patrol","the","Unite","State","south","coastal","region","in","Februari","and","March","of","1999",".","Director","Stuart","Calcot","'s","High-Definit","camera","crew","spent","twelv","day","aboard","the","Mohawk","as","it","sail","on","a","cours","from","Key","West",",","Florida",",","to","Roosevelt","Road","Naval","Base","in","Puerto","Rico",".","Everi","aspect","of","the","crew","'s","life","and","work","on","board","the","Mohawk","was","document",".","From","earli","morn","revelri","to","tap","at","night",",","from","high","abov","the","bridg","to","the","depth","of","the","engin","room",",","this","program","follow","the","live","of","the","U.S.S.","Mohawk","'s","offic","and","crew","as","they","guard","the","shore","of","America","."],"lemmas":["this","high-definition","documentary","special","present","a","intimate","view","of","life","aboard","the","United","States","Coast","Guard","Cutter","Mohawk","as","it","patrol","the","United","States","south","coastal","region","in","February","and","March","of","1999",".","Director","Stuart","Calcote","'s","High-Definition","camera","crew","spend","twelve","day","aboard","the","Mohawk","as","it","sail","on","a","course","from","Key","West",",","Florida",",","to","Roosevelt","road","Naval","Base","in","Puerto","Rico",".","every","aspect","of","the","crew","'s","life","and","work","on","board","the","Mohawk","be","document",".","from","early","morning","revelry","to","tap","at","night",",","from","high","above","the","bridge","to","the","depths","of","the","engine","room",",","this","program","follow","the","life","of","the","U.S.S.","Mohawk","'s","officer","and","crew","as","they","guard","the","shore","of","America","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This High-Definition documentary","High-Definition documentary special","documentary special presents","special presents an","presents an intimate","an intimate view","intimate view of","view of life","of life aboard","life aboard the","aboard the United","the United States","United States Coast","States Coast Guard","Coast Guard Cutter","Guard Cutter Mohawk","Cutter Mohawk as","Mohawk as it","as it patrolled","it patrolled the","patrolled the United","the United States","United States south","States south coastal","south coastal region","coastal region in","region in February","in February and","February and March","and March of","March of 1999","Director Stuart Calcote","Stuart Calcote 's","Calcote 's High-Definition","'s High-Definition camera","High-Definition camera crew","camera crew spent","crew spent twelve","spent twelve days","twelve days aboard","days aboard the","aboard the Mohawk","the Mohawk as","Mohawk as it","as it sailed","it sailed on","sailed on a","on a course","a course from","course from Key","from Key West","Key West ,","West , Florida",", Florida ,","Florida , to",", to Roosevelt","to Roosevelt Roads","Roosevelt Roads Naval","Roads Naval Base","Naval Base in","Base in Puerto","in Puerto Rico","Every aspect of","aspect of the","of the crew","the crew 's","crew 's life","'s life and","life and work","and work on","work on board","on board the","board the Mohawk","the Mohawk was","Mohawk was documented","From early morning","early morning revelry","morning revelry to","revelry to taps","to taps at","taps at night","at night ,","night , from",", from high","from high above","high above the","above the bridge","the bridge to","bridge to the","to the depths","the depths of","depths of the","of the engine","the engine room","engine room ,","room , this",", this program","this program follows","program follows the","follows the lives","the lives of","lives of the","of the U.S.S.","the U.S.S.

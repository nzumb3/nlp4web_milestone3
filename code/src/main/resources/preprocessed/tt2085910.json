{"title":"Room 237","plot":"A subjective documentary that explores the numerous theories about the hidden meanings within 'Stanley Kubrick (I)' 's Kubrick''s film The Shining (1980). The film may be over 30 years old but it continues to inspire debate, speculation, and mystery. Five very different points of view are illuminated through voice over, film clips, animation and dramatic reenactments. Together they'll draw the audience into a new maze, one with endless detours and dead ends, many ways in, but no way out.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","subject","documentari","that","explor","the","numer","theori","about","the","hidden","mean","within","'","Stanley","Kubrick","(","I",")","'","'s","Kubrick","''","s","film","The","Shine","(","1980",")",".","The","film","may","be","over","30","year","old","but","it","continu","to","inspir","debat",",","specul",",","and","mysteri",".","Five","veri","differ","point","of","view","are","illumin","through","voic","over",",","film","clip",",","anim","and","dramat","reenact",".","Togeth","they","ll","draw","the","audienc","into","a","new","maze",",","one","with","endless","detour","and","dead","end",",","mani","way","in",",","but","no","way","out","."],"lemmas":["a","subjective","documentary","that","explore","the","numerous","theory","about","the","hidden","meaning","within","'","Stanley","Kubrick","-lrb-","I","-rrb-","'","'s","Kubrick","''","s","film","the","shine","-lrb-","1980","-rrb-",".","the","film","may","be","over","30","year","old","but","it","continue","to","inspire","debate",",","speculation",",","and","mystery",".","five","very","different","point","of","view","be","illuminate","through","voice","over",",","film","clip",",","animation","and","dramatic","reenactment",".","together","they","will","draw","the","audience","into","a","new","maze",",","one","with","endless","detour","and","dead","end",",","many","way","in",",","but","no","way","out","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["A subjective documentary","subjective documentary that","documentary that explores","that explores the","explores the numerous","the numerous theories","numerous theories about","theories about the","about the hidden","the hidden meanings","hidden meanings within","meanings within '","within ' Stanley","' Stanley Kubrick","Stanley Kubrick (","Kubrick ( I","( I )","I ) '",") ' 's","' 's Kubrick","'s Kubrick ''","Kubrick '' s","'' s film","s film The","film The Shining","The Shining (","Shining ( 1980","( 1980 )","The film may","film may be","may be over","be over 30","over 30 years","30 years old","years old but","old but it","but it continues","it continues to","continues to inspire","to inspire debate","inspire debate ,","debate , speculation",", speculation ,","speculation , and",", and mystery","Five very different","very different points","different points of","points of view","of view are","view are illuminated","are illuminated through","illuminated through voice","through voice over","voice over ,","over , film",", film clips","film clips ,","clips , animation",", animation and","animation and dramatic","and dramatic reenactments","Together they 'll","they 'll draw","'ll draw the","draw the audience","the audience into","audience into a","into a new","a new maze","new maze ,","maze , one",", one with","one with endless","with endless detours","endless detours and","detours and dead","and dead ends","dead ends ,","ends , many",", many ways","many ways in","ways in ,","in , but",", but no","but no way","no way out"],"2grams":["A subjective","subjective documentary","documentary that","that explores","explores the","the numerous","numerous theories","theories about","about the","the hidden","hidden meanings","meanings within","within '","' Stanley","Stanley Kubrick","Kubrick (","( I","I )",") '","' 's","'s Kubrick","Kubrick ''","'' s","s film","film The","The Shining","Shining (","( 1980","1980 )","The film","film may","may be","be over","over 30","30 years","years old","old but","but it","it continues","continues to","to inspire","inspire debate","debate ,",", speculation","speculation ,",", and","and mystery","Five very","very different","different points","points of","of view","view are","are illuminated","illuminated through","through voice","voice over","over ,",", film","film clips","clips ,",", animation","animation and","and dramatic","dramatic reenactments","Together they","they 'll","'ll draw","draw the","the audience","audience into","into a","a new","new maze","maze ,",", one","one with","with endless","endless detours","detours and","and dead","dead ends","ends ,",", many","many ways","ways in","in ,",", but","but no","no way","way out"]}

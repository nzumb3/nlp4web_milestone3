{"title":"Dark Side of the Moon; an Interpretation","plot":"Set to the music of Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, a man from space transports himself and his younger brother to a new world for observing. Once they arrive, however, they are captures by masked officers who later force the two space men into their extremist socialist society. The space man proceeds to formulate an escape via a rocket ship, but after his plans are destroyed by the officers, the space man comes face to face with the extremities of the environment he's in, prompting his brains to explode.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Music"],"stems":["Set","to","the","music","of","Pink","Floyd","'s","Dark","Side","of","the","Moon",",","a","man","from","space","transport","himself","and","his","younger","brother","to","a","new","world","for","observ",".","Once","they","arriv",",","howev",",","they","are","captur","by","mask","offic","who","later","forc","the","two","space","men","into","their","extremist","socialist","societi",".","The","space","man","proceed","to","formul","an","escap","via","a","rocket","ship",",","but","after","his","plan","are","destroy","by","the","offic",",","the","space","man","come","face","to","face","with","the","extrem","of","the","environ","he","'s","in",",","prompt","his","brain","to","explod","."],"lemmas":["set","to","the","music","of","Pink","Floyd","'s","dark","side","of","the","Moon",",","a","man","from","space","transport","himself","and","he","younger","brother","to","a","new","world","for","observe",".","once","they","arrive",",","however",",","they","be","capture","by","mask","officer","who","later","force","the","two","space","man","into","they","extremist","socialist","society",".","the","space","man","proceeds","to","formulate","a","escape","via","a","rocket","ship",",","but","after","he","plan","be","destroy","by","the","officer",",","the","space","man","come","face","to","face","with","the","extremity","of","the","environment","he","be","in",",","prompt","he","brain","to","explode","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Set to the","to the music","the music of","music of Pink","of Pink Floyd","Pink Floyd 's","Floyd 's Dark","'s Dark Side","Dark Side of","Side of the","of the Moon","the Moon ,","Moon , a",", a man","a man from","man from space","from space transports","space transports himself","transports himself and","himself and his","and his younger","his younger brother","younger brother to","brother to a","to a new","a new world","new world for","world for observing","Once they arrive","they arrive ,","arrive , however",", however ,","however , they",", they are","they are captures","are captures by","captures by masked","by masked officers","masked officers who","officers who later","who later force","later force the","force the two","the two space","two space men","space men into","men into their","into their extremist","their extremist socialist","extremist socialist society","The space man","space man proceeds","man proceeds to","proceeds to formulate","to formulate an","formulate an escape","an escape via","escape via a","via a rocket","a rocket ship","rocket ship ,","ship , but",", but after","but after his","after his plans","his plans are","plans are destroyed","are destroyed by","destroyed by the","by the officers","the officers ,","officers , the",", the space","the space man","space man comes","man comes face","comes face to","face to face","to face with","face with the","with the extremities","the extremities of","extremities of the","of the environment","the environment he","environment he 's","he 's in","'s in ,","in , prompting",", prompting his","prompting his brains","his brains to","brains to explode"],"2grams":["Set to","to the","the music","music of","of Pink","Pink Floyd","Floyd 's","'s Dark","Dark Side","Side of","of the","the Moon","Moon ,",", a","a man","man from","from space","space transports","transports himself","himself and","and his","his younger","younger brother","brother to","to a","a new","new world","world for","for observing","Once they","they arrive","arrive ,",", however","however ,",", they","they are","are captures","captures by","by masked","masked officers","officers who","who later","later force","force the","the two","two space","space men","men into","into their","their extremist","extremist socialist","socialist society","The space","space man","man proceeds","proceeds to","to formulate","formulate an","an escape","escape via","via a","a rocket","rocket ship","ship ,",", but","but after","after his","his plans","plans are","are destroyed","destroyed by","by the","the officers","officers ,",", the","the space","space man","man comes","comes face","face to","to face","face with","with the","the extremities","extremities of","of the","the environment","environment he","he 's","'s in","in ,",", prompting","prompting his","his brains","brains to","to explode"]}

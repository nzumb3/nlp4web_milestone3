{"title":"The Creator's Game","plot":"Daniel Cloud, a Native American Iroquois, leaves his father and sister to attend graduate school. Even though he is a gifted lacrosse player, he hopes to become a football coach. Only football, he believes, will give him and his family the financial security to get them off the reservation and save the family store. As he prepares to leave an unscrupulous businessman gives Daniel's father sixty days to pay off the mortgage or lose the store. When Daniel arrives at North Central State University, he finds to his dismay, all the graduate coaching positions have been filled. The only thing left open is the school's lacrosse team; the Spartans - and they haven't won a game in over a year. The only way Daniel can win over the team and defeat the awesome, undefeated Kingston University Tridents is to show the Spartans how the game of lacrosse was given to his people by the Great Spirit. With the help of his sister and beloved grandfather, Daniel must rediscover the truth of his people; that playing lacrosse is a celebration of the Great Spirit. Only if Daniel can teach the Spartans to play \"The Creator's Game\", can they win on the field and in life.","genres":["Adventure"],"stems":["Daniel","Cloud",",","a","Nativ","American","Iroquoi",",","leav","his","father","and","sister","to","attend","graduat","school",".","Even","though","he","is","a","gift","lacross","player",",","he","hope","to","becom","a","footbal","coach",".","Onli","footbal",",","he","believ",",","will","give","him","and","his","famili","the","financi","secur","to","get","them","off","the","reserv","and","save","the","famili","store",".","As","he","prepar","to","leav","an","unscrupul","businessman","give","Daniel","'s","father","sixti","day","to","pay","off","the","mortgag","or","lose","the","store",".","When","Daniel","arriv","at","North","Central","State","Univers",",","he","find","to","his","dismay",",","all","the","graduat","coach","posit","have","been","fill",".","The","onli","thing","left","open","is","the","school","'s","lacross","team",";","the","Spartan","-","and","they","have","n't","won","a","game","in","over","a","year",".","The","onli","way","Daniel","can","win","over","the","team","and","defeat","the","awesom",",","undef","Kingston","Univers","Trident","is","to","show","the","Spartan","how","the","game","of","lacross","was","given","to","his","peopl","by","the","Great","Spirit",".","With","the","help","of","his","sister","and","belov","grandfath",",","Daniel","must","rediscov","the","truth","of","his","peopl",";","that","play","lacross","is","a","celebr","of","the","Great","Spirit",".","Onli","if","Daniel","can","teach","the","Spartan","to","play","\"","The","Creator","'s","Game","\"",",","can","they","win","on","the","field","and","in","life","."],"lemmas":["Daniel","Cloud",",","a","native","American","Iroquois",",","leave","he","father","and","sister","to","attend","graduate","school",".","even","though","he","be","a","gifted","lacrosse","player",",","he","hope","to","become","a","football","coach",".","only","football",",","he","believe",",","will","give","he","and","he","family","the","financial","security","to","get","they","off","the","reservation","and","save","the","family","store",".","as","he","prepare","to","leave","a","unscrupulous","businessman","give","Daniel","'s","father","sixty","day","to","pay","off","the","mortgage","or","lose","the","store",".","when","Daniel","arrive","at","North","Central","State","University",",","he","find","to","he","dismay",",","all","the","graduate","coaching","position","have","be","fill",".","the","only","thing","leave","open","be","the","school","'s","lacrosse","team",";","the","Spartans","-","and","they","have","not","win","a","game","in","over","a","year",".","the","only","way","Daniel","can","win","over","the","team","and","defeat","the","awesome",",","undefeated","Kingston","University","Tridents","be","to","show","the","Spartans","how","the","game","of","lacrosse","be","give","to","he","people","by","the","great","spirit",".","with","the","help","of","he","sister","and","beloved","grandfather",",","Daniel","must","rediscover","the","truth","of","he","people",";","that","play","lacrosse","be","a","celebration","of","the","great","spirit",".","only","if","Daniel","can","teach","the","Spartans","to","play","``","the","Creator","'s","Game","''",",","can","they","win","on","the","field","and","in","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Daniel

{"title":"Ding Dong Dead","plot":"A gang of lovely young ladies known as the Ding Dong Ditchers terrorize a sleepy suburban town by ringing peoples' doorbells and then running away. Crazed and pathetic loser Doug has just been fired from his job, so he decides to make a stand against the Ding Dong Ditchers in order to impress Claudia, who's the attractive woman who lives right across the street. However, Doug's initially minor dispute with the Ding Dong Ditchers eventually escalates into an all-out no-holds-barred war.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["A","gang","of","love","young","ladi","known","as","the","Ding","Dong","Ditcher","terror","a","sleepi","suburban","town","by","ring","peopl","'","doorbel","and","then","run","away",".","Craze","and","pathet","loser","Doug","has","just","been","fire","from","his","job",",","so","he","decid","to","make","a","stand","against","the","Ding","Dong","Ditcher","in","order","to","impress","Claudia",",","who","'s","the","attract","woman","who","live","right","across","the","street",".","Howev",",","Doug","'s","initi","minor","disput","with","the","Ding","Dong","Ditcher","eventu","escal","into","an","all-out","no-holds-bar","war","."],"lemmas":["a","gang","of","lovely","young","lady","know","as","the","Ding","Dong","Ditchers","terrorize","a","sleepy","suburban","town","by","ring","people","'","doorbell","and","then","run","away",".","crazed","and","pathetic","loser","Doug","have","just","be","fire","from","he","job",",","so","he","decide","to","make","a","stand","against","the","Ding","Dong","Ditchers","in","order","to","impress","Claudia",",","who","be","the","attractive","woman","who","live","right","across","the","street",".","however",",","Doug","'s","initially","minor","dispute","with","the","Ding","Dong","Ditchers","eventually","escalate","into","a","all-out","no-holds-barred","war","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A gang of","gang of lovely","of lovely young","lovely young ladies","young ladies known","ladies known as","known as the","as the Ding","the Ding Dong","Ding Dong Ditchers","Dong Ditchers terrorize","Ditchers terrorize a","terrorize a sleepy","a sleepy suburban","sleepy suburban town","suburban town by","town by ringing","by ringing peoples","ringing peoples '","peoples ' doorbells","' doorbells and","doorbells and then","and then running","then running away","Crazed and pathetic","and pathetic loser","pathetic loser Doug","loser Doug has","Doug has just","has just been","just been fired","been fired from","fired from his","from his job","his job ,","job , so",", so he","so he decides","he decides to","decides to make","to make a","make a stand","a stand against","stand against the","against the Ding","the Ding Dong","Ding Dong Ditchers","Dong Ditchers in","Ditchers in order","in order to","order to impress","to impress Claudia","impress Claudia ,","Claudia , who",", who 's","who 's the","'s the attractive","the attractive woman","attractive woman who","woman who lives","who lives right","lives right across","right across the","across the street","However , Doug",", Doug 's","Doug 's initially","'s initially minor","initially minor dispute","minor dispute with","dispute with the","with the Ding","the Ding Dong","Ding Dong Ditchers","Dong Ditchers eventually","Ditchers eventually escalates","eventually escalates into","escalates into an","into an all-out","an all-out no-holds-barred","all-out no-holds-barred war"],"2grams":["A gang","gang of","of lovely","lovely young","young ladies","ladies known","known as","as the","the Ding","Ding Dong","Dong Ditchers","Ditchers terrorize","terrorize a","a sleepy","sleepy suburban","suburban town","town by","by ringing","ringing peoples","peoples '","' doorbells","doorbells and","and then","then running","running away","Crazed and","and pathetic","pathetic loser","loser Doug","Doug has","has just","just been","been fired","fired from","from his","his job","job ,",", so","so he","he decides","decides to","to make","make a","a stand","stand against","against the","the Ding","Ding Dong","Dong Ditchers","Ditchers in","in order","order to","to impress","impress Claudia","Claudia ,",", who","who 's","'s the","the attractive","attractive woman","woman who","who lives","lives right","right across","across the","the street","However ,",", Doug","Doug 's","'s initially","initially minor","minor dispute","dispute with","with the","the Ding","Ding Dong","Dong Ditchers","Ditchers eventually","eventually escalates","escalates into","into an","an all-out","all-out no-holds-barred","no-holds-barred war"]}

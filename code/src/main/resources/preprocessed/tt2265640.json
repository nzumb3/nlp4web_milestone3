{"title":"All Roads Lead","plot":"Upon discovering lost footage of a raging car fire that takes the lives of two young girls, a group of filmmakers is inspired to go on the search to reveal the humanizing and humbling stories of those involved. Their investigation leads them from the concrete jungle of New York City out to the rural countryside of Midwestern, small town America. There, they enter the town of Colston, IL where they interview and befriend many people related to and touched by the tragic event. These interviews span several generations and tell the stories of hard-working, real Americans who struggle during trying times, yet find balance and strength within the caring support and pride of their community. However, a dark side to the town begins to surface as the filmmakers continue to interview the town. Certain interviewees lend to a theory that the death of the girls may have been more than an accident. An ominous cloud of deceit begins to hover over the filmmakers as they follow these leads into the truth behind the death of the two girls. As the filmmakers continue to uncover and draw connections between key relationships, they must decide how to successfully expose the truth while they protect their own interests.","genres":["Crime","

{"title":"Ich Hunger","plot":"Ich Hunger is an expressionistic German art film about a 'creature boy' who terrorizes a small farming township. Frankfurt Inspector Stephen Heckle has been tracking this elusive creature for years, but when It becomes apparent that the creature has ended his constant migration and settled in Frondenberg, Stephen must leave the bustling city and confront him face to face in the deepest darkest reaches of the forest. Part Gothic horror and part psychedelic dream-scape; Ich Hunger is a feast for the senses.","genres":["Animation"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Ich","Hunger","is","an","expressionist","German","art","film","about","a","'","creatur","boy","'","who","terror","a","small","farm","township",".","Frankfurt","Inspector","Stephen","Heckl","has","been","track","this","elus","creatur","for","year",",","but","when","It","becom","appar","that","the","creatur","has","end","his","constant","migrat","and","settl","in","Frondenberg",",","Stephen","must","leav","the","bustl","citi","and","confront","him","face","to","face","in","the","deepest","darkest","reach","of","the","forest",".","Part","Gothic","horror","and","part","psychedel","dream-scap",";","Ich","Hunger","is","a","feast","for","the","sens","."],"lemmas":["Ich","Hunger","be","a","expressionistic","german","art","film","about","a","'","creature","boy","'","who","terrorize","a","small","farming","township",".","Frankfurt","Inspector","Stephen","Heckle","have","be","track","this","elusive","creature","for","year",",","but","when","it","become","apparent","that","the","creature","have","end","he","constant","migration","and","settle","in","Frondenberg",",","Stephen","must","leave","the","bustling","city","and","confront","he","face","to","face","in","the","deepest","darkest","reach","of","the","forest",".","part","gothic","horror","and","part","psychedelic","dream-scape",";","Ich","Hunger","be","a","feast","for","the","sens","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ich Hunger is","Hunger is an","is an expressionistic","an expressionistic German","expressionistic German art","German art film","art film about","film about a","about a '","a ' creature","' creature boy","creature boy '","boy ' who","' who terrorizes","who terrorizes a","terrorizes a small","a small farming","small farming township","Frankfurt Inspector Stephen","Inspector Stephen Heckle","Stephen Heckle has","Heckle has been","has been tracking","been tracking this","tracking this elusive","this elusive creature","elusive creature for","creature for years","for years ,","years , but",", but when","but when It","when It becomes","It becomes apparent","becomes apparent that","apparent that the","that the creature","the creature has","creature has ended","has ended his","ended his constant","his constant migration","constant migration and","migration and settled","and settled in","settled in Frondenberg","in Frondenberg ,","Frondenberg , Stephen",", Stephen must","Stephen must leave","must leave the","leave the bustling","the bustling city","bustling city and","city and confront","and confront him","confront him face","him face to","face to face","to face in","face in the","in the deepest","the deepest darkest","deepest darkest reaches","darkest reaches of","reaches of the","of the forest","Part Gothic horror","Gothic horror and","horror and part","and part psychedelic","part psychedelic dream-scape","psychedelic dream-scape ;","dream-scape ; Ich","; Ich Hunger","Ich Hunger is","Hunger is a","is a feast","a feast for","feast for the","for the senses"],"2grams":["Ich Hunger","Hunger is","is an","an expressionistic","expressionistic German","German art","art film","film about","about a","a '","' creature","creature boy","boy '","' who","who terrorizes","terrorizes a","a small","small farming","farming township","Frankfurt Inspector","Inspector Stephen","Stephen Heckle","Heckle has","has been","been tracking","tracking this","this elusive","elusive creature","creature for","for years","years ,",", but","but when","when It","It becomes","becomes apparent","apparent that","that the","the creature","creature has","has ended","ended his","his constant","constant migration","migration and","and settled","settled in","in Frondenberg","Frondenberg ,",", Stephen","Stephen must","must leave","leave the","the bustling","bustling city","city and","and confront","confront him","him face","face to","to face","face in","in the","the deepest","deepest darkest","darkest reaches","reaches of","of the","the forest","Part Gothic","Gothic horror","horror and","and part","part psychedelic","psychedelic dream-scape","dream-scape ;","; Ich","Ich Hunger","Hunger is","is a","a feast","feast for","for the","the senses"]}

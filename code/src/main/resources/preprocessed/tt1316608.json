{"title":"Saila","plot":"A marooned area turns into a parallel universe filled with obsession, violence, and anarchy. This is where Saila lives in an abandoned high-rise block. Time and space become blurred while voices over the radio report on disasters and catastrophes . A surreal underground epos with a haunting soundtrack and one of film history's bloodiest love scenes. Julia Ostertag's full-length feature film debut was shot in guerilla-style in East Berlin's industrial wasteland.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","maroon","area","turn","into","a","parallel","univers","fill","with","obsess",",","violenc",",","and","anarchi",".","This","is","where","Saila","live","in","an","abandon","high-ris","block",".","Time","and","space","becom","blur","while","voic","over","the","radio","report","on","disast","and","catastroph",".","A","surreal","underground","epo","with","a","haunt","soundtrack","and","one","of","film","histori","'s","bloodiest","love","scene",".","Julia","Ostertag","'s","full-length","featur","film","debut","was","shot","in","guerilla-styl","in","East","Berlin","'s","industri","wasteland","."],"lemmas":["a","maroon","area","turn","into","a","parallel","universe","fill","with","obsession",",","violence",",","and","anarchy",".","this","be","where","Saila","live","in","a","abandoned","high-rise","block",".","time","and","space","become","blur","while","voice","over","the","radio","report","on","disaster","and","catastrophe",".","a","surreal","underground","epo","with","a","haunting","soundtrack","and","one","of","film","history","'s","bloodiest","love","scene",".","Julia","Ostertag","'s","full-length","feature","film","debut","be","shoot","in","guerilla-style","in","East","Berlin","'s","industrial","wasteland","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A marooned area","marooned area turns","area turns into","turns into a","into a parallel","a parallel universe","parallel universe filled","universe filled with","filled with obsession","with obsession ,","obsession , violence",", violence ,","violence , and",", and anarchy","This is where","is where Saila","where Saila lives","Saila lives in","lives in an","in an abandoned","an abandoned high-rise","abandoned high-rise block","Time and space","and space become","space become blurred","become blurred while","blurred while voices","while voices over","voices over the","over the radio","the radio report","radio report on","report on disasters","on disasters and","disasters and catastrophes","A surreal underground","surreal underground epos","underground epos with","epos with a","with a haunting","a haunting soundtrack","haunting soundtrack and","soundtrack and one","and one of","one of film","of film history","film history 's","history 's bloodiest","'s bloodiest love","bloodiest love scenes","Julia Ostertag 's","Ostertag 's full-length","'s full-length feature","full-length feature film","feature film debut","film debut was","debut was shot","was shot in","shot in guerilla-style","in guerilla-style in","guerilla-style in East","in East Berlin","East Berlin 's","Berlin 's industrial","'s industrial wasteland"],"2grams":["A marooned","marooned area","area turns","turns into","into a","a parallel","parallel universe","universe filled","filled with","with obsession","obsession ,",", violence","violence ,",", and","and anarchy","This is","is where","where Saila","Saila lives","lives in","in an","an abandoned","abandoned high-rise","high-rise block","Time and","and space","space become","become blurred","blurred while","while voices","voices over","over the","the radio","radio report","report on","on disasters","disasters and","and catastrophes","A surreal","surreal underground","underground epos","epos with","with a","a haunting","haunting soundtrack","soundtrack and","and one","one of","of film","film history","history 's","'s bloodiest","bloodiest love","love scenes","Julia Ostertag","Ostertag 's","'s full-length","full-length feature","feature film","film debut","debut was","was shot","shot in","in guerilla-style","guerilla-style in","in East","East Berlin","Berlin 's","'s industrial","industrial wasteland"]}

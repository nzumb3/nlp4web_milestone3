{"title":"On Their Knees","plot":"Mo and Willie are half-sisters who have grown apart over time. Willie is a rebellious, hard-drinking waitress while Mo toils away in an office. When their grandmother, who raised them after the death of their mother, passes away, the two siblings reunite. Although they have not spoken for some time, Mo convinces her sister that their grandmother deserves to be buried back on the east coast, in the place where she grew up and which is home to a family they've never known. The first of many problems is that they have to steal the body; the next is that they have no idea where they're going. Nonetheless, the two quickly turn into bumbling, bickering but virtuous thieves. After buying a used refrigerated ice cream truck to transport the body, the siblings set out across the country. Moving from small town to small town, they come into contact with a bevy of eccentric characters, soon realize that they have a cash flow problem and are forced to continue their criminal ways. Along the route, however, they are able to give others in need a helping hand and to remember, eventually, how to have fun again, especially during a memorable romp through the woods. When they finally arrive, they are met with a reception they never could have imagined.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Mo","and","Willi","are","half-sist","who","have","grown","apart","over","time",".","Willi","is","a","rebelli",",","hard-drink","waitress","while","Mo","toil","away","in","an","offic",".","When","their","grandmoth",",","who","rais","them","after","the","death","of","their","mother",",","pass","away",",","the","two","sibl","reunit",".","Although","they","have","not","spoken","for","some","time",",","Mo","convinc","her","sister","that","their","grandmoth","deserv","to","be","buri","back","on","the","east","coast",",","in","the","place","where","she","grew","up","and","which","is","home","to","a","famili","they","ve","never","known",".","The","first","of","mani","problem","is","that","they","have","to","steal","the","bodi",";","the","next","is","that","they","have","no","idea","where","they","re","go",".","Nonetheless",",","the","two","quick","turn","into","bumbl",",","bicker","but","virtuous","thiev",".","After","buy","a","use","refriger","ice","cream","truck","to","transport","the","bodi",",","the","sibl","set","out","across","the","countri",".","Move","from","small","town","to","small","town",",","they","come","into","contact","with","a","bevi","of","eccentr","charact",",","soon","realiz","that","they","have","a","cash","flow","problem","and","are","forc","to","continu","their","crimin","way",".","Along","the","rout",",","howev",",","they","are","abl","to","give","other","in","need","a","help","hand","and","to","rememb",",","eventu",",","how","to","have","fun","again",",","especi","dure","a","memor","romp","through","the","wood",".","When","they","final","arriv",",","they","are","met","with","a","recept","they","never","could","have","imagin","."],"lemmas":["Mo","and","Willie","be","half-sister","who","have","grow","apart","over","time",".","Willie","be","a","rebellious",",","hard-drinking","waitress","while","mo","toil","away","in","a","office",".","when","they","grandmother",",","who","raise","they","after","the","death","of","they","mother",",","pass","away",",","the","two","sibling","reunite",".","although","they","have","not","speak","for","some","time",",","mo","convince","she","sister","that","they","grandmother","deserve","to","be","bury","back","on","the","east","coast",",","in","the","place","where","she","grow","up","and","which","be","home","to","a","family","they","have","never","know",".","the","first","of","many","problem","be","that","they","have","to","steal","the","body",";","the","next","be","that","they","have","no","idea","where","they","be","go",".","nonetheless",",","the","two","quickly","turn","into","bumble",",","bicker","but","virtuous","thief",".","after","buy","a","use","refrigerated","ice","cream","truck","to","transport","the","body",",","the","sibling","set","out","across","the","country",".","move","from","small","town","to","small","town",",","they","come","into","contact","with","a","bevy","of","eccentric","character",",","soon","realize","that","they","have","a","cash","flow","problem","and","be","force","to","continue","they","criminal","way",".","along","the","route",",","however",",","they","be","able","to","give","other","in","need","a","help","hand","and","to","remember",",","eventually",",","how","to","have","fun","again",",","especially","during","a","memorable","romp","through","the","wood",".","when","they","finally","arrive",",","they","be","meet","with","a","reception","they","never","could","have","imagine","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mo

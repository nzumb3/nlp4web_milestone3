{"title":"Cafe Europa","plot":"Every Sunday a group of holocaust survivors come to dance at Cafe Europa in a suburb north of Tel-Aviv. They tango, waltz, and cha-cha, drink coffee and eat pound cake, but never discuss the horrors of their past. Among the patrons of the cafe is a group that came to Israel after the holocaust and had to pay yet another horrific personal price in Israel's wars. Some are reevaluating their choice to immigrate to Israel, and others wonder if one should sacrifice a son for a country that betrayed them.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," Drama"],"stems":["Everi","Sunday","a","group","of","holocaust","survivor","come","to","danc","at","Cafe","Europa","in","a","suburb","north","of","Tel-Aviv",".","They","tango",",","waltz",",","and","cha-cha",",","drink","coffe","and","eat","pound","cake",",","but","never","discuss","the","horror","of","their","past",".","Among","the","patron","of","the","cafe","is","a","group","that","came","to","Israel","after","the","holocaust","and","had","to","pay","yet","anoth","horrif","person","price","in","Israel","'s","war",".","Some","are","reevalu","their","choic","to","immigr","to","Israel",",","and","other","wonder","if","one","should","sacrific","a","son","for","a","countri","that","betray","them","."],"lemmas":["every","Sunday","a","group","of","holocaust","survivor","come","to","dance","at","Cafe","Europa","in","a","suburb","north","of","Tel-Aviv",".","they","tango",",","waltz",",","and","cha-cha",",","drink","coffee","and","eat","pound","cake",",","but","never","discuss","the","horror","of","they","past",".","among","the","patron","of","the","cafe","be","a","group","that","come","to","Israel","after","the","holocaust","and","have","to","pay","yet","another","horrific","personal","price","in","Israel","'s","war",".","some","be","reevaluate","they","choice","to","immigrate","to","Israel",",","and","other","wonder","if","one","should","sacrifice","a","son","for","a","country","that","betray","they","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Every Sunday a","Sunday a group","a group of","group of holocaust","of holocaust survivors","holocaust survivors come","survivors come to","come to dance","to dance at","dance at Cafe","at Cafe Europa","Cafe Europa in","Europa in a","in a suburb","a suburb north","suburb north of","north of Tel-Aviv","They tango ,","tango , waltz",", waltz ,","waltz , and",", and cha-cha","and cha-cha ,","cha-cha , drink",", drink coffee","drink coffee and","coffee and eat","and eat pound","eat pound cake","pound cake ,","cake , but",", but never","but never discuss","never discuss the","discuss the horrors","the horrors of","horrors of their","of their past","Among the patrons","the patrons of","patrons of the","of the cafe","the cafe is","cafe is a","is a group","a group that","group that came","that came to","came to Israel","to Israel after","Israel after the","after the holocaust","the holocaust and","holocaust and had","and had to","had to pay","to pay yet","pay yet another","yet another horrific","another horrific personal","horrific personal price","personal price in","price in Israel","in Israel 's","Israel 's wars","Some are reevaluating","are reevaluating their","reevaluating their choice","their choice to","choice to immigrate","to immigrate to","immigrate to Israel","to Israel ,","Israel , and",", and others","and others wonder","others wonder if","wonder if one","if one should","one should sacrifice","should sacrifice a","sacrifice a son","a son for","son for a","for a country","a country that","country that betrayed","that betrayed them"],"2grams":["Every Sunday","Sunday a","a group","group of","of holocaust","holocaust survivors","survivors come","come to","to dance","dance at","at Cafe","Cafe Europa","Europa in","in a","a suburb","suburb north","north of","of Tel-Aviv","They tango","tango ,",", waltz","waltz ,",", and","and cha-cha","cha-cha ,",", drink","drink coffee","coffee and","and eat","eat pound","pound cake","cake ,",", but","but never","never discuss","discuss the","the horrors","horrors of","of their","their past","Among the","the patrons","patrons of","of the","the cafe","cafe is","is a","a group","group that","that came","came to","to Israel","Israel after","after the","the holocaust","holocaust and","and had","had to","to pay","pay yet","yet another","another horrific","horrific personal","personal price","price in","in Israel","Israel 's","'s wars","Some are","are reevaluating","reevaluating their","their choice","choice to","to immigrate","immigrate to","to Israel","Israel ,",", and","and others","others wonder","wonder if","if one","one should","should sacrifice","sacrifice a","a son","son for","for a","a country","country that","that betrayed","betrayed them"]}

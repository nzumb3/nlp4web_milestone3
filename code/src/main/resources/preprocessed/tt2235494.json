{"title":"Songs in Stone: An Arctic Journey Home","plot":"In Songs in Stone John Houston uses childhood memories as a prism through which to see the history of the times and the fascinating and complex development of Inuit Art over the last half century. A panoply of 'northern' and 'southern' voices speak of the economic and social circumstances which lead to the birth of the movement to bring Inuit art to the rest of the world. We have an opportunity to meet carvers and printmakers such as Kenojuak Ahsevak, Osuitok Ipeelie, Iyola Kingwatsiaq, Kananginak Pootoogook, Lukta Qiatsuq, and Mannumie Shaqu - all pivotal figures in the development of Inuit Art. Songs in Stone has won a number of prestigious awards and touched the hearts of many.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Song","in","Stone","John","Houston","use","childhood","memori","as","a","prism","through","which","to","see","the","histori","of","the","time","and","the","fascin","and","complex","develop","of","Inuit","Art","over","the","last","half","centuri",".","A","panopli","of","'","northern","'","and","'","southern","'","voic","speak","of","the","econom","and","social","circumst","which","lead","to","the","birth","of","the","movement","to","bring","Inuit","art","to","the","rest","of","the","world",".","We","have","an","opportun","to","meet","carver","and","printmak","such","as","Kenojuak","Ahsevak",",","Osuitok","Ipeeli",",","Iyola","Kingwatsiaq",",","Kananginak","Pootoogook",",","Lukta","Qiatsuq",",","and","Mannumi","Shaqu","-","all","pivot","figur","in","the","develop","of","Inuit","Art",".","Song","in","Stone","has","won","a","number","of","prestigi","award","and","touch","the","heart","of","mani","."],"lemmas":["in","Songs","in","Stone","John","Houston","use","childhood","memory","as","a","prism","through","which","to","see","the","history","of","the","time","and","the","fascinating","and","complex","development","of","Inuit","Art","over","the","last","half","century",".","a","panoply","of","'","northern","'","and","'","southern","'","voice","speak","of","the","economic","and","social","circumstance","which","lead","to","the","birth","of","the","movement","to","bring","Inuit","art","to","the","rest","of","the","world",".","we","have","a","opportunity","to","meet","carver","and","printmaker","such","as","Kenojuak","Ahsevak",",","Osuitok","Ipeelie",",","Iyola","Kingwatsiaq",",","Kananginak","Pootoogook",",","Lukta","Qiatsuq",",","and","Mannumie","Shaqu","-","all","pivotal","figure","in","the","development","of","Inuit","Art",".","song","in","Stone","have","win","a","number","of","prestigious","award","and","touch","the","heart","of","many","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Songs in","Songs in Stone","in Stone John","Stone John Houston","John Houston uses","Houston uses childhood","uses childhood memories","childhood memories as","memories as a","as a prism","a prism through","prism through which","through which to","which to see","to see the","see the history","the history of","history of the","of the times","the times and","times and the","and the fascinating","the fascinating and","fascinating and complex","and complex development","complex development of","development of Inuit","of Inuit Art","Inuit Art over","Art over the","over the last","the last half","last half century","A panoply of","panoply of '","of ' northern","' northern '","northern ' and","' and '","and ' southern","' southern '","southern ' voices","' voices speak","voices speak of","speak of the","of the economic","the economic and","economic and social","and social circumstances","social circumstances which","circumstances which lead","which lead to","lead to the","to the birth","the birth of","birth of the","of the movement","the movement to","movement to bring","to bring Inuit","bring Inuit art","Inuit art to","art to the","to the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the world","We have an","have an opportunity","an opportunity to","opportunity to meet","to meet carvers","meet carvers and","carvers and printmakers","and printmakers such","printmakers such as","such as Kenojuak","as Kenojuak Ahsevak","Kenojuak Ahsevak ,","Ahsevak , Osuitok",", Osuitok Ipeelie","Osuitok Ipeelie ,","Ipeelie , Iyola",", Iyola Kingwatsiaq","Iyola Kingwatsiaq ,","Kingwatsiaq , Kananginak",", Kananginak Pootoogook","Kananginak Pootoogook ,","Pootoogook , Lukta",", Lukta Qiatsuq","Lukta Qiatsuq ,","Qiatsuq , and",", and Mannumie","and Mannumie Shaqu","Mannumie Shaqu -","Shaqu -

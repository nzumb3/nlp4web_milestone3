{"title":"Hunter: For the Record","plot":"Perth musician Robert Hunter was a pioneer of a musical genre, young father, digital communicator, ex drug and alcohol abuser, general hell-raiser and ultimately a terminal cancer patient. When Hunter's time on this earth was in danger of being cruelly cut short at 35, he co-opted the digital tools at his disposal and began to share his physical, emotional and musical journey in a very raw and honest way. For Hunter, the cancer became a lens through which life suddenly came sharply into focus.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Perth","musician","Robert","Hunter","was","a","pioneer","of","a","music","genr",",","young","father",",","digit","communic",",","ex","drug","and","alcohol","abus",",","general","hell-rais","and","ultim","a","termin","cancer","patient",".","When","Hunter","'s","time","on","this","earth","was","in","danger","of","be","cruelli","cut","short","at","35",",","he","co-opt","the","digit","tool","at","his","dispos","and","began","to","share","his","physic",",","emot","and","music","journey","in","a","veri","raw","and","honest","way",".","For","Hunter",",","the","cancer","becam","a","len","through","which","life","sudden","came","sharpli","into","focus","."],"lemmas":["Perth","musician","Robert","Hunter","be","a","pioneer","of","a","musical","genre",",","young","father",",","digital","communicator",",","ex","drug","and","alcohol","abuser",",","general","hell-raiser","and","ultimately","a","terminal","cancer","patient",".","when","Hunter","'s","time","on","this","earth","be","in","danger","of","be","cruelly","cut","short","at","35",",","he","co-opt","the","digital","tool","at","he","disposal","and","begin","to","share","he","physical",",","emotional","and","musical","journey","in","a","very","raw","and","honest","way",".","for","Hunter",",","the","cancer","become","a","lens","through","which","life","suddenly","come","sharply","into","focus","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Perth musician Robert","musician Robert Hunter","Robert Hunter was","Hunter was a","was a pioneer","a pioneer of","pioneer of a","of a musical","a musical genre","musical genre ,","genre , young",", young father","young father ,","father , digital",", digital communicator","digital communicator ,","communicator , ex",", ex drug","ex drug and","drug and alcohol","and alcohol abuser","alcohol abuser ,","abuser , general",", general hell-raiser","general hell-raiser and","hell-raiser and ultimately","and ultimately a","ultimately a terminal","a terminal cancer","terminal cancer patient","When Hunter 's","Hunter 's time","'s time on","time on this","on this earth","this earth was","earth was in","was in danger","in danger of","danger of being","of being cruelly","being cruelly cut","cruelly cut short","cut short at","short at 35","at 35 ,","35 , he",", he co-opted","he co-opted the","co-opted the digital","the digital tools","digital tools at","tools at his","at his disposal","his disposal and","disposal and began","and began to","began to share","to share his","share his physical","his physical ,","physical , emotional",", emotional and","emotional and musical","and musical journey","musical journey in","journey in a","in a very","a very raw","very raw and","raw and honest","and honest way","For Hunter ,","Hunter , the",", the cancer","the cancer became","cancer became a","became a lens","a lens through","lens through which","through which life","which life suddenly","life suddenly came","suddenly came sharply","came sharply into","sharply into focus"],"2grams":["Perth musician","musician Robert","Robert Hunter","Hunter was","was a","a pioneer","pioneer of","of a","a musical","musical genre","genre ,",", young","young father","father ,",", digital","digital communicator","communicator ,",", ex","ex drug","drug and","and alcohol","alcohol abuser","abuser ,",", general","general hell-raiser","hell-raiser and","and ultimately","ultimately a","a terminal","terminal cancer","cancer patient","When Hunter","Hunter 's","'s time","time on","on this","this earth","earth was","was in","in danger","danger of","of being","being cruelly","cruelly cut","cut short","short at","at 35","35 ,",", he","he co-opted","co-opted the","the digital","digital tools","tools at","at his","his disposal","disposal and","and began","began to","to share","share his","his physical","physical ,",", emotional","emotional and","and musical","musical journey","journey in","in a","a very","very raw","raw and","and honest","honest way","For Hunter","Hunter ,",", the","the cancer","cancer became","became a","a lens","lens through","through which","which life","life suddenly","suddenly came","came sharply","sharply into","into focus"]}

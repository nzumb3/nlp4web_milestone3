{"title":"The Blue Umbrella","plot":"Young Biniya lives a poor lifestyle in a small village in the mountainous and snowy region of Himachal Pradesh in India along with her widowed mom and wrestler brother. She entertains various tourists, and while doing so with some tourists from Japan, trades in her bear-tooth amulet with a blue umbrella. She and her umbrella become very popular with both tourists and the local villagers. A restaurant-owner, Nandkishore Khatri, takes a fancy to this umbrella and attempts several times to buy if off of her - in vain. Then one day while tending to her two cows, the umbrella goes missing. The entire village sympathizes with her. She suspects Nandkishore, and the police turn his house upside down but are unable to locate the missing umbrella. An embittered and upset Nandkishore orders a red-and-white Japanese umbrella and, in turn, becomes immensely popular with the local villagers as well as with tourists. The question remains: where did Biniya's umbrella disappear to, and will she ever recover it?","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Young","Biniya","live","a","poor","lifestyl","in","a","small","villag","in","the","mountain","and","snowi","region","of","Himach","Pradesh","in","India","along","with","her","widow","mom","and","wrestler","brother",".","She","entertain","various","tourist",",","and","while","do","so","with","some","tourist","from","Japan",",","trade","in","her","bear-tooth","amulet","with","a","blue","umbrella",".","She","and","her","umbrella","becom","veri","popular","with","both","tourist","and","the","local","villag",".","A","restaurant-own",",","Nandkishor","Khatri",",","take","a","fanci","to","this","umbrella","and","attempt","sever","time","to","buy","if","off","of","her","-","in","vain",".","Then","one","day","while","tend","to","her","two","cow",",","the","umbrella","goe","miss",".","The","entir","villag","sympath","with","her",".","She","suspect","Nandkishor",",","and","the","polic","turn","his","hous","upsid","down","but","are","unabl","to","locat","the","miss","umbrella",".","An","embitt","and","upset","Nandkishor","order","a","red-and-whit","Japanes","umbrella","and",",","in","turn",",","becom","immens","popular","with","the","local","villag","as","well","as","with","tourist",".","The","question","remain",":","where","did","Biniya","'s","umbrella","disappear","to",",","and","will","she","ever","recov","it","?"],"lemmas":["Young","Biniya","live","a","poor","lifestyle","in","a","small","village","in","the","mountainous","and","snowy","region","of","Himachal","Pradesh","in","India","along","with","she","widow","mom","and","wrestler","brother",".","she","entertain","various","tourist",",","and","while","do","so","with","some","tourist","from","Japan",",","trade","in","she","bear-tooth","amulet","with","a","blue","umbrella",".","she","and","she","umbrella","become","very","popular","with","both","tourist","and","the","local","villager",".","a","restaurant-owner",",","Nandkishore","Khatri",",","take","a","fancy","to","this","umbrella","and","attempt","several","time","to","buy","if","off","of","she","-","in","vain",".","then","one","day","while","tend","to","she","two","cow",",","the","umbrella","go","miss",".","the","entire","village","sympathize","with","she",".","she","suspect","Nandkishore",",","and","the","police","turn","he","house","upside","down","but","be","unable","to","locate","the","miss","umbrella",".","a","embittered","and","upset","nandkishore","order","a","red-and-white","japanese","umbrella","and",",","in","turn",",","become","immensely","popular","with","the","local","villager","as","well","as","with","tourist",".","the","question","remain",":","where","do","Biniya","'s","umbrella","disappear","to",",","and","will","she","ever","recover","it","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Young Biniya lives","Biniya lives a","lives a poor","a poor lifestyle","poor lifestyle in","lifestyle in a","in a small","a small village","small village in","village in the","in the mountainous","the mountainous and","mountainous and snowy","and snowy region","snowy region of","region of Himachal","of Himachal Pradesh","Himachal Pradesh in","Pradesh in India","in India along","India along with","along with her","with her widowed","her widowed mom","widowed mom and","mom and wrestler","and wrestler brother","She entertains various","entertains various tourists","various tourists ,","tourists , and",", and while","and while doing","while doing so","doing so with","so with some","with some tourists","some tourists from","tourists from Japan","from Japan ,","Japan , trades",", trades in","trades in her","in her bear-tooth","her bear-tooth amulet","bear-tooth amulet with","amulet with a","with a blue","a blue umbrella","She and her","and her umbrella","her umbrella become","umbrella become very","become very popular","very popular with","popular with both","with both tourists","both tourists and","tourists and the","and the local","the local villagers","A restaurant-owner ,","restaurant-owner , Nandkishore",", Nandkishore Khatri","Nandkishore Khatri ,","Khatri , takes",", takes a","takes a fancy","a fancy to","fancy to this","to this umbrella","this umbrella and","umbrella and attempts","and attempts several","attempts several times","several times to","times to buy","to buy if","buy if off","if off of","off of her","of her -","her -

{"title":"Rebecca's Daughters","plot":"The film is set in Wales and concerns itself with the aristocracy who are taxing to common people to ruin. Naturally, a certain member of said aristocracy decided that all this is not on, chiefly because most of the money collected by the taxes etc is being spent on keeping Lord Sarn drunk. So Anthony Raine dresses up as a woman, calls himself Rebecca, and leads the common people to victory over their masters.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["The","film","is","set","in","Wale","and","concern","itself","with","the","aristocraci","who","are","tax","to","common","peopl","to","ruin",".","Natur",",","a","certain","member","of","said","aristocraci","decid","that","all","this","is","not","on",",","chiefli","becaus","most","of","the","money","collect","by","the","tax","etc","is","be","spent","on","keep","Lord","Sarn","drunk",".","So","Anthoni","Rain","dress","up","as","a","woman",",","call","himself","Rebecca",",","and","lead","the","common","peopl","to","victori","over","their","master","."],"lemmas":["the","film","be","set","in","Wales","and","concern","itself","with","the","aristocracy","who","be","tax","to","common","people","to","ruin",".","naturally",",","a","certain","member","of","say","aristocracy","decide","that","all","this","be","not","on",",","chiefly","because","most","of","the","money","collect","by","the","tax","etc","be","be","spend","on","keep","Lord","Sarn","drunk",".","so","Anthony","Raine","dress","up","as","a","woman",",","call","himself","Rebecca",",","and","lead","the","common","people","to","victory","over","they","master","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The film is","film is set","is set in","set in Wales","in Wales and","Wales and concerns","and concerns itself","concerns itself with","itself with the","with the aristocracy","the aristocracy who","aristocracy who are","who are taxing","are taxing to","taxing to common","to common people","common people to","people to ruin","Naturally , a",", a certain","a certain member","certain member of","member of said","of said aristocracy","said aristocracy decided","aristocracy decided that","decided that all","that all this","all this is","this is not","is not on","not on ,","on , chiefly",", chiefly because","chiefly because most","because most of","most of the","of the money","the money collected","money collected by","collected by the","by the taxes","the taxes etc","taxes etc is","etc is being","is being spent","being spent on","spent on keeping","on keeping Lord","keeping Lord Sarn","Lord Sarn drunk","So Anthony Raine","Anthony Raine dresses","Raine dresses up","dresses up as","up as a","as a woman","a woman ,","woman , calls",", calls himself","calls himself Rebecca","himself Rebecca ,","Rebecca , and",", and leads","and leads the","leads the common","the common people","common people to","people to victory","to victory over","victory over their","over their masters"],"2grams":["The film","film is","is set","set in","in Wales","Wales and","and concerns","concerns itself","itself with","with the","the aristocracy","aristocracy who","who are","are taxing","taxing to","to common","common people","people to","to ruin","Naturally ,",", a","a certain","certain member","member of","of said","said aristocracy","aristocracy decided","decided that","that all","all this","this is","is not","not on","on ,",", chiefly","chiefly because","because most","most of","of the","the money","money collected","collected by","by the","the taxes","taxes etc","etc is","is being","being spent","spent on","on keeping","keeping Lord","Lord Sarn","Sarn drunk","So Anthony","Anthony Raine","Raine dresses","dresses up","up as","as a","a woman","woman ,",", calls","calls himself","himself Rebecca","Rebecca ,",", and","and leads","leads the","the common","common people","people to","to victory","victory over","over their","their masters"]}

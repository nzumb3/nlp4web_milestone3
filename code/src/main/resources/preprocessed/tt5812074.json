{"title":"Photography Gave Me Cancer (and other stories I tell myself)","plot":"What happens after a cancer diagnosis? After earning my graduate degree, I thought the hard part was over. But, an unlikely cancer diagnosis and subsequent treatment propel me to reconsider my uterus, hysteria and the cultural weight of cancer. I discover that the overwhelming need to find a cause is a dead-end road in the search for meaning. But, there is plenty of space for cultural critique.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["What","happen","after","a","cancer","diagnosi","?","After","earn","my","graduat","degre",",","I","thought","the","hard","part","was","over",".","But",",","an","unlik","cancer","diagnosi","and","subsequ","treatment","propel","me","to","reconsid","my","uterus",",","hysteria","and","the","cultur","weight","of","cancer",".","I","discov","that","the","overwhelm","need","to","find","a","caus","is","a","dead-end","road","in","the","search","for","mean",".","But",",","there","is","plenti","of","space","for","cultur","critiqu","."],"lemmas":["what","happen","after","a","cancer","diagnosis","?","after","earn","my","graduate","degree",",","I","think","the","hard","part","be","over",".","but",",","a","unlikely","cancer","diagnosis","and","subsequent","treatment","propel","I","to","reconsider","my","uterus",",","hysteria","and","the","cultural","weight","of","cancer",".","I","discover","that","the","overwhelming","need","to","find","a","cause","be","a","dead-end","road","in","the","search","for","meaning",".","but",",","there","be","plenty","of","space","for","cultural","critique","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["What happens after","happens after a","after a cancer","a cancer diagnosis","After earning my","earning my graduate","my graduate degree","graduate degree ,","degree , I",", I thought","I thought the","thought the hard","the hard part","hard part was","part was over","But , an",", an unlikely","an unlikely cancer","unlikely cancer diagnosis","cancer diagnosis and","diagnosis and subsequent","and subsequent treatment","subsequent treatment propel","treatment propel me","propel me to","me to reconsider","to reconsider my","reconsider my uterus","my uterus ,","uterus , hysteria",", hysteria and","hysteria and the","and the cultural","the cultural weight","cultural weight of","weight of cancer","I discover that","discover that the","that the overwhelming","the overwhelming need","overwhelming need to","need to find","to find a","find a cause","a cause is","cause is a","is a dead-end","a dead-end road","dead-end road in","road in the","in the search","the search for","search for meaning","But , there",", there is","there is plenty","is plenty of","plenty of space","of space for","space for cultural","for cultural critique"],"2grams":["What happens","happens after","after a","a cancer","cancer diagnosis","After earning","earning my","my graduate","graduate degree","degree ,",", I","I thought","thought the","the hard","hard part","part was","was over","But ,",", an","an unlikely","unlikely cancer","cancer diagnosis","diagnosis and","and subsequent","subsequent treatment","treatment propel","propel me","me to","to reconsider","reconsider my","my uterus","uterus ,",", hysteria","hysteria and","and the","the cultural","cultural weight","weight of","of cancer","I discover","discover that","that the","the overwhelming","overwhelming need","need to","to find","find a","a cause","cause is","is a","a dead-end","dead-end road","road in","in the","the search","search for","for meaning","But ,",", there","there is","is plenty","plenty of","of space","space for","for cultural","cultural critique"]}

{"title":"Eye Music","plot":"In a southern Mexico's coast small village, a group of young deaf people receive an unusual proposal: to make a movie out of their dreams. While Eric and his friends watch films and discuss the stories they wish to film, we meet their everyday life full of desires as well as deceptions. Eye Music is a reflection on the dreamy world of silent films and its cross-linking with sign language, perception and culture of the Deaf.","genres":["Documentary"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["In","a","southern","Mexico","'s","coast","small","villag",",","a","group","of","young","deaf","peopl","receiv","an","unusu","propos",":","to","make","a","movi","out","of","their","dream",".","While","Eric","and","his","friend","watch","film","and","discuss","the","stori","they","wish","to","film",",","we","meet","their","everyday","life","full","of","desir","as","well","as","decept",".","Eye","Music","is","a","reflect","on","the","dreami","world","of","silent","film","and","it","cross-link","with","sign","languag",",","percept","and","cultur","of","the","Deaf","."],"lemmas":["in","a","southern","Mexico","'s","coast","small","village",",","a","group","of","young","deaf","people","receive","a","unusual","proposal",":","to","make","a","movie","out","of","they","dream",".","while","Eric","and","he","friend","watch","film","and","discuss","the","story","they","wish","to","film",",","we","meet","they","everyday","life","full","of","desire","as","well","as","deception",".","Eye","Music","be","a","reflection","on","the","dreamy","world","of","silent","film","and","its","cross-linking","with","sign","language",",","perception","and","culture","of","the","Deaf","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In a southern","a southern Mexico","southern Mexico 's","Mexico 's coast","'s coast small","coast small village","small village ,","village , a",", a group","a group of","group of young","of young deaf","young deaf people","deaf people receive","people receive an","receive an unusual","an unusual proposal","unusual proposal :","proposal : to",": to make","to make a","make a movie","a movie out","movie out of","out of their","of their dreams","While Eric and","Eric and his","and his friends","his friends watch","friends watch films","watch films and","films and discuss","and discuss the","discuss the stories","the stories they","stories they wish","they wish to","wish to film","to film ,","film , we",", we meet","we meet their","meet their everyday","their everyday life","everyday life full","life full of","full of desires","of desires as","desires as well","as well as","well as deceptions","Eye Music is","Music is a","is a reflection","a reflection on","reflection on the","on the dreamy","the dreamy world","dreamy world of","world of silent","of silent films","silent films and","films and its","and its cross-linking","its cross-linking with","cross-linking with sign","with sign language","sign language ,","language , perception",", perception and","perception and culture","and culture of","culture of the","of the Deaf"],"2grams":["In a","a southern","southern Mexico","Mexico 's","'s coast","coast small","small village","village ,",", a","a group","group of","of young","young deaf","deaf people","people receive","receive an","an unusual","unusual proposal","proposal :",": to","to make","make a","a movie","movie out","out of","of their","their dreams","While Eric","Eric and","and his","his friends","friends watch","watch films","films and","and discuss","discuss the","the stories","stories they","they wish","wish to","to film","film ,",", we","we meet","meet their","their everyday","everyday life","life full","full of","of desires","desires as","as well","well as","as deceptions","Eye Music","Music is","is a","a reflection","reflection on","on the","the dreamy","dreamy world","world of","of silent","silent films","films and","and its","its cross-linking","cross-linking with","with sign","sign language","language ,",", perception","perception and","and culture","culture of","of the","the Deaf"]}

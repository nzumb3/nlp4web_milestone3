{"title":"The Curve","plot":"The 60s. A road with dangerous curves winds up a rocky mountain. Rudolf and Anton are two brothers, that live as outcasts from society at the base of this rocky mountain. The curvy road is the source of their livelihood, as cars often veer off the road to crash right in front of their house. The fall is so steep, that the crashed travelers are always dead. Rudolf repairs the cars and sells them. Anton finds his fulfillment in writing the sermons and preparing the burials for the victims. After every accident, he sends a letter to the Secretary of Traffic to warn about the danger of the curve. Nothing changes. Twenty four accidents have occurred but with the crash of the twenty fifth car, everything will be different: For the first time ever, there is a survivor. The brothers discover, that the surviving driver is none other than the Secretary of traffic himself...","genres":["Comedy"," Drama","

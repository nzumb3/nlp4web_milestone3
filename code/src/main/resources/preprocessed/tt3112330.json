{"title":"Love Land","plot":"24-year-old Ivy sterilizes needles at a tattoo parlor in a small East Texas town. She has an intellectual disability, but she hides her label with grace, wearing bracelets over her medical information bracelet and keeping her State-issued ID safely in hiding in her purse. What she doesn't hide well is the crush she has on Oscar, a 16-year-old apprentice tattoo artist who (illegally) works at the same parlor. When Ivy's desire to impress Oscar leads to events that convince her sister (and legal guardian) to place her in a public institution for people with developmental and intellectual disabilities, Ivy must face a crisis of identity and choose how far she will go in order to reunite with her dream man.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["24-year-old","Ivi","steril","needl","at","a","tattoo","parlor","in","a","small","East","Texa","town",".","She","has","an","intellectu","disabl",",","but","she","hide","her","label","with","grace",",","wear","bracelet","over","her","medic","inform","bracelet","and","keep","her","State-issu","ID","safe","in","hide","in","her","purs",".","What","she","doe","n't","hide","well","is","the","crush","she","has","on","Oscar",",","a","16-year-old","apprentic","tattoo","artist","who","(","illeg",")","work","at","the","same","parlor",".","When","Ivi","'s","desir","to","impress","Oscar","lead","to","event","that","convinc","her","sister","(","and","legal","guardian",")","to","place","her","in","a","public","institut","for","peopl","with","development","and","intellectu","disabl",",","Ivi","must","face","a","crisi","of","ident","and","choos","how","far","she","will","go","in","order","to","reunit","with","her","dream","man","."],"lemmas":["24-year-old","Ivy","sterilize","needle","at","a","tattoo","parlor","in","a","small","East","Texas","town",".","she","have","a","intellectual","disability",",","but","she","hide","she","label","with","grace",",","wear","bracelet","over","she","medical","information","bracelet","and","keep","she","state-issued","id","safely","in","hiding","in","she","purse",".","what","she","do","not","hide","well","be","the","crush","she","have","on","Oscar",",","a","16-year-old","apprentice","tattoo","artist","who","-lrb-","illegally","-rrb-","work","at","the","same","parlor",".","when","Ivy","'s","desire","to","impress","Oscar","lead","to","event","that","convince","she","sister","-lrb-","and","legal","guardian","-rrb-","to","place","she","in","a","public","institution","for","people","with","developmental","and","intellectual","disability",",","Ivy","must","face","a","crisis","of","identity","and","choose","how","far","she","will","go","in","order","to","reunite","with","she","dream","man","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["24-year-old

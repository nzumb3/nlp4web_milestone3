{"title":"Life Long Road Trip","plot":"There are bands that play a lot, and there bands that play A LOT! The Nace Brothers are the latter. Brothers David and Jimmy have been going at it together with bassist Tim Williams since 1981. And a couple of years ago, Kansas City filmmaker Ben Meade figured it was time to celebrate that perseverance in documentary form. The Nace Brothers: Lifelong Road Trip chronicles everything from their dad Johnny Nace and their musical roots in Warrensburg, to all manner of amazing tales about what it's been like to keep rowdy crowds across America tapping their toes. If you weren't a Nace Brothers fan already, seeing this might just change that.","genres":["Documentary","

Six months later when he came out of jail in a battle to the death of Cesar's son, he also killed him. When he got older he killed a man to rob him, and that crime remained unpunished. But two years later he was accused of a crime he did not commit, and went to jail. In jail he complained to God, but one day God will answer.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["When","Alexi","was","thirteen","year","old",",","he","found","Cesar","beat","his","mother","and","tri","to","rape","her",".","So","Alexi","kill","him",".","Six","month","later","when","he","came","out","of","jail","in","a","battl","to","the","death","of","Cesar","'s","son",",","he","also","kill","him",".","When","he","got","older","he","kill","a","man","to","rob","him",",","and","that","crime","remain","unpunish",".","But","two","year","later","he","was","accus","of","a","crime","he","did","not","commit",",","and","went","to","jail",".","In","jail","he","complain","to","God",",","but","one","day","God","will","answer","."],"lemmas":["when","Alexis","be","thirteen","year","old",",","he","find","Cesar","beat","he","mother","and","try","to","rape","she",".","so","Alexis","kill","he",".","six","month","later","when","he","come","out","of","jail","in","a","battle","to","the","death","of","Cesar","'s","son",",","he","also","kill","he",".","when","he","get","older","he","kill","a","man","to","rob","he",",","and","that","crime","remain","unpunished",".","but","two","year","later","he","be","accuse","of","a","crime","he","do","not","commit",",","and","go","to","jail",".","in","jail","he","complain","to","God",",","but","one","day","God","will","answer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Alexis was","Alexis was thirteen","was thirteen years","thirteen years old","years old ,","old , he",", he found","he found Cesar","found Cesar beating","Cesar beating his","beating his mother","his mother and","mother and trying","and trying to","trying to rape","to rape her","So Alexis killed","Alexis killed him","Six months later","months later when","later when he","when he came","he came out","came out of","out of jail","of jail in","jail in a","in a battle","a battle to","battle to the","to the death","the death of","death of Cesar","of Cesar 's","Cesar 's son","'s son ,","son , he",", he also","he also killed","also killed him","When he got","he got older","got older he","older he killed","he killed a","killed a man","a man to","man to rob","to rob him","rob him ,","him , and",", and that","and that crime","that crime remained","crime remained unpunished","But two years","two years later","years later he","later he was","he was accused","was accused of","accused of a","of a crime","a crime he","crime he did","he did not","did not commit","not commit ,","commit , and",", and went","and went to","went to jail","In jail he","jail he complained","he complained to","complained to God","to God ,","God , but",", but one","but one day","one day God","day God will","God will answer"],"2grams":["When Alexis","Alexis was","was thirteen","thirteen years","years old","old ,",", he","he found","found Cesar","Cesar beating","beating his","his mother","mother and","and trying","trying to","to rape","rape her","So Alexis","Alexis killed","killed him","Six months","months later","later when","when he","he came","came out","out of","of jail","jail in","in a","a battle","battle to","to the","the death","death of","of Cesar","Cesar 's","'s son","son ,",", he","he also","also killed","killed him","When he","he got","got older","older he","he killed","killed a","a man","man to","to rob","rob him","him ,",", and","and that","that crime","crime remained","remained unpunished","But two","two years","years later","later he","he was","was accused","accused of","of a","a crime","crime he","he did","did not","not commit","commit ,",", and","and went","went to","to jail","In jail","jail he","he complained","complained to","to God","God ,",", but","but one","one day","day God","God will","will answer"]}

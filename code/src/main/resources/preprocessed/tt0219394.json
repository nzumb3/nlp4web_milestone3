{"title":"Vergeten straat","plot":"Picture this: a small dead-end street in a big Belgian city. Due to negligence in the city's building-scheme, the inhabitants of this small street find themselves suddenly confronted with expropriation and evacuation. A celebrated Flemish writer, occupying a small apartment in this street, which he uses as a working-place, witnesses how the inhabitants try to fight this injustice, but are faced with selfishness, individualism and resignation. He dreams up a new street, isolated from the world. A street in which human beings understand each other and cooperate in founding a new society. A street in which freedom, love and tolerance are no empty conceptions. A fable on the connection between imagination and reality. A film about eroticism, relationships, social disorder and the system's failure.","genres":["Drama","

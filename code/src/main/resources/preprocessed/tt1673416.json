{"title":"Linked: The Dream-Creativity Connection","plot":"This documentary explores various perspectives concerning the phenomenon [the link between dreams and creativity] that has inspired the director's vision for a Dream-Arts Community Center. The SIRB approved research footage included this documentary takes place: at the Idyllwild Arts Academy, all over New York City, Los Angeles, and Ashland, Oregon. It can be described as a phenomenological urban ethnography, with a cinema verite style. It explores the link between dreams and creativity, through subjectively described experiences of 20 unique individuals. Director Angel K. Morgan narrates chapters of the film with a script and artistic style that she dreamed. There is recorded music in the film that was the product of her dreams and therefore, the documentary itself is some of her own dream-creativity in action.","genres":["Documentary"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["This","documentari","explor","various","perspect","concern","the","phenomenon","[","the","link","between","dream","and","creativ","]","that","has","inspir","the","director","'s","vision","for","a","Dream-Art","Commun","Center",".","The","SIRB","approv","research","footag","includ","this","documentari","take","place",":","at","the","Idyllwild","Arts","Academi",",","all","over","New","York","Citi",",","Los","Angele",",","and","Ashland",",","Oregon",".","It","can","be","describ","as","a","phenomenolog","urban","ethnographi",",","with","a","cinema","verit","style",".","It","explor","the","link","between","dream","and","creativ",",","through","subject","describ","experi","of","20","uniqu","individu",".","Director","Angel","K.","Morgan","narrat","chapter","of","the","film","with","a","script","and","artist","style","that","she","dream",".","There","is","record","music","in","the","film","that","was","the","product","of","her","dream","and","therefor",",","the","documentari","itself","is","some","of","her","own","dream-creat","in","action","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","explore","various","perspective","concern","the","phenomenon","-lsb-","the","link","between","dream","and","creativity","-rsb-","that","have","inspire","the","director","'s","vision","for","a","Dream-Arts","Community","Center",".","the","SIRB","approve","research","footage","include","this","documentary","take","place",":","at","the","Idyllwild","Arts","Academy",",","all","over","New","York","City",",","Los","Angeles",",","and","Ashland",",","Oregon",".","it","can","be","describe","as","a","phenomenological","urban","ethnography",",","with","a","cinema","verite","style",".","it","explore","the","link","between","dream","and","creativity",",","through","subjectively","describe","experience","of","20","unique","individual",".","Director","Angel","K.","Morgan","narrate","chapter","of","the","film","with","a","script","and","artistic","style","that","she","dream",".","there","be","record","music","in","the","film","that","be","the","product","of","she","dream","and","therefore",",","the","documentary","itself","be","some","of","she","own","dream-creativity","in","action","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This documentary explores","documentary explores various","explores various perspectives","various perspectives concerning","perspectives concerning the","concerning the phenomenon","the phenomenon [","phenomenon [ the","[ the link","the link between","link between dreams","between dreams and","dreams and creativity","and creativity ]","creativity ] that","] that has","that has inspired","has inspired the","inspired the director","the director 's","director 's vision","'s vision for","vision for a","for a Dream-Arts","a Dream-Arts Community","Dream-Arts Community Center","The SIRB approved","SIRB approved research","approved research footage","research footage included","footage included this","included this documentary","this documentary takes","documentary takes place","takes place :","place : at",": at the","at the Idyllwild","the Idyllwild Arts","Idyllwild Arts Academy","Arts Academy ,","Academy , all",", all over","all over New","over New York","New York City","York City ,","City , Los",", Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , and",", and Ashland","and Ashland ,","Ashland , Oregon","It can be","can be described","be described as","described as a","as a phenomenological","a phenomenological urban","phenomenological urban ethnography","urban ethnography ,","ethnography , with",", with a","with a cinema","a cinema verite","cinema verite style","It explores the","explores the link","the link between","link between dreams","between dreams and","dreams and creativity","and creativity ,","creativity , through",", through subjectively","through subjectively described","subjectively described experiences","described experiences of","experiences of 20","of 20 unique","20 unique individuals","Director Angel K.","Angel K.

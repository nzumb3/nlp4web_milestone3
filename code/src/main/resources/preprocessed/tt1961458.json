{"title":"Passion Despair","plot":"The documentary film portrays the Swiss Daniel, who lives in Moldova and specialises in photographing girls aged between 9 and 14. He has caused much controversy with the photos of his models which he sells via the internet. The film raises questions of how images are used and their effects in a world increasingly dominated by the media. However, it also shows girls' lives in Moldova's neighbour Transnistria, which does not officially exist. Modelling is not just an important additional source of income for the girls, but more importantly provides a change from the dullness of everyday life.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","documentari","film","portray","the","Swiss","Daniel",",","who","live","in","Moldova","and","specialis","in","photograph","girl","age","between","9","and","14",".","He","has","caus","much","controversi","with","the","photo","of","his","model","which","he","sell","via","the","internet",".","The","film","rais","question","of","how","imag","are","use","and","their","effect","in","a","world","increas","domin","by","the","media",".","Howev",",","it","also","show","girl","'","live","in","Moldova","'s","neighbour","Transnistria",",","which","doe","not","offici","exist",".","Model","is","not","just","an","import","addit","sourc","of","incom","for","the","girl",",","but","more","import","provid","a","chang","from","the","dull","of","everyday","life","."],"lemmas":["the","documentary","film","portray","the","Swiss","Daniel",",","who","live","in","Moldova","and","specialise","in","photograph","girl","aged","between","9","and","14",".","he","have","cause","much","controversy","with","the","photo","of","he","model","which","he","sell","via","the","internet",".","the","film","raise","question","of","how","image","be","use","and","they","effect","in","a","world","increasingly","dominate","by","the","media",".","however",",","it","also","show","girl","'","life","in","Moldova","'s","neighbour","Transnistria",",","which","do","not","officially","exist",".","modelling","be","not","just","a","important","additional","source","of","income","for","the","girl",",","but","more","importantly","provide","a","change","from","the","dullness","of","everyday","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The documentary film","documentary film portrays","film portrays the","portrays the Swiss","the Swiss Daniel","Swiss Daniel ,","Daniel , who",", who lives","who lives in","lives in Moldova","in Moldova and","Moldova and specialises","and specialises in","specialises in photographing","in photographing girls","photographing girls aged","girls aged between","aged between 9","between 9 and","9 and 14","He has caused","has caused much","caused much controversy","much controversy with","controversy with the","with the photos","the photos of","photos of his","of his models","his models which","models which he","which he sells","he sells via","sells via the","via the internet","The film raises","film raises questions","raises questions of","questions of how","of how images","how images are","images are used","are used and","used and their","and their effects","their effects in","effects in a","in a world","a world increasingly","world increasingly dominated","increasingly dominated by","dominated by the","by the media","However , it",", it also","it also shows","also shows girls","shows girls '","girls ' lives","' lives in","lives in Moldova","in Moldova 's","Moldova 's neighbour","'s neighbour Transnistria","neighbour Transnistria ,","Transnistria , which",", which does","which does not","does not officially","not officially exist","Modelling is not","is not just","not just an","just an important","an important additional","important additional source","additional source of","source of income","of income for","income for the","for the girls","the girls ,","girls , but",", but more","but more importantly","more importantly provides","importantly provides a","provides a change","a change from","change from the","from the dullness","the dullness of","dullness of everyday","of everyday life"],"2grams":["The documentary","documentary film","film portrays","portrays the","the Swiss","Swiss Daniel","Daniel ,",", who","who lives","lives in","in Moldova","Moldova and","and specialises","specialises in","in photographing","photographing girls","girls aged","aged between","between 9","9 and","and 14","He has","has caused","caused much","much controversy","controversy with","with the","the photos","photos of","of his","his models","models which","which he","he sells","sells via","via the","the internet","The film","film raises","raises questions","questions of","of how","how images","images are","are used","used and","and their","their effects","effects in","in a","a world","world increasingly","increasingly dominated","dominated by","by the","the media","However ,",", it","it also","also shows","shows girls","girls '","' lives","lives in","in Moldova","Moldova 's","'s neighbour","neighbour Transnistria","Transnistria ,",", which","which does","does not","not officially","officially exist","Modelling is","is not","not just","just an","an important","important additional","additional source","source of","of income","income for","for the","the girls","girls ,",", but","but more","more importantly","importantly provides","provides a","a change","change from","from the","the dullness","dullness of","of everyday","everyday life"]}

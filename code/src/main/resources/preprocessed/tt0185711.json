{"title":"Suits","plot":"A deodorant company with a product called \"Smell No Mo\" pits two rival ad agencies in a race to come up with a campaign for a new-fangled sanitary napkin called Vorcan. The advertising satire follows the New York firm of Cranston & Co. as they fight rival Hoffman & Partners. Cranston fires his creative director which puts a young copywriter with a literature degree on the front line, even though he doesn't want to be. The contest comes down to a schmaltzy campaign by Hoffman with music by Air Supply that uses the tagline \"Vorcan: your own personal air supply.\" or a more down to earth campaign from Cranston of \"The pad ain't bad!\"","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","deodor","compani","with","a","product","call","\"","Smell","No","Mo","\"","pit","two","rival","ad","agenc","in","a","race","to","come","up","with","a","campaign","for","a","new-fangl","sanitari","napkin","call","Vorcan",".","The","advertis","satir","follow","the","New","York","firm","of","Cranston","&","Co.","as","they","fight","rival","Hoffman","&","Partner",".","Cranston","fire","his","creativ","director","which","put","a","young","copywrit","with","a","literatur","degre","on","the","front","line",",","even","though","he","doe","n't","want","to","be",".","The","contest","come","down","to","a","schmaltzi","campaign","by","Hoffman","with","music","by","Air","Suppli","that","use","the","taglin","\"","Vorcan",":","your","own","person","air","suppli",".","\"","or","a","more","down","to","earth","campaign","from","Cranston","of","\"","The","pad","ai","n't","bad","!","\""],"lemmas":["a","deodorant","company","with","a","product","call","``","Smell","No","Mo","''","pit","two","rival","ad","agency","in","a","race","to","come","up","with","a","campaign","for","a","new-fangled","sanitary","napkin","call","Vorcan",".","the","advertising","satire","follow","the","New","York","firm","of","Cranston","&","Co.","as","they","fight","rival","Hoffman","&","Partners",".","Cranston","fire","he","creative","director","which","put","a","young","copywriter","with","a","literature","degree","on","the","front","line",",","even","though","he","do","not","want","to","be",".","the","contest","come","down","to","a","schmaltzy","campaign","by","Hoffman","with","music","by","Air","Supply","that","use","the","tagline","``","Vorcan",":","you","own","personal","air","supply",".","''","or","a","more","down","to","earth","campaign","from","Cranston","of","``","the","pad","be","not","bad","!","''"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A deodorant company","deodorant company with","company with a","with a product","a product called","product called \"","called \" Smell","\" Smell No","Smell No Mo","No Mo \"","Mo \" pits","\" pits two","pits two rival","two rival ad","rival ad agencies","ad agencies in","agencies in a","in a race","a race to","race to come","to come up","come up with","up with a","with a campaign","a campaign for","campaign for a","for a new-fangled","a new-fangled sanitary","new-fangled sanitary napkin","sanitary napkin called","napkin called Vorcan","The advertising satire","advertising satire follows","satire follows the","follows the New","the New York","New York firm","York firm of","firm of Cranston","of Cranston &","Cranston & Co.","& Co. as","Co. as they","as they fight","they fight rival","fight rival Hoffman","rival Hoffman &","Hoffman & Partners","Cranston fires his","fires his creative","his creative director","creative director which","director which puts","which puts a","puts a young","a young copywriter","young copywriter with","copywriter with a","with a literature","a literature degree","literature degree on","degree on the","on the front","the front line","front line ,","line , even",", even though","even though he","though he does","he does n't","does n't want","n't want to","want to be","The contest comes","contest comes down","comes down to","down to a","to a schmaltzy","a schmaltzy campaign","schmaltzy campaign by","campaign by Hoffman","by Hoffman with","Hoffman with music","with music by","music by Air","by Air Supply","Air Supply that","Supply that uses","that uses the","uses the tagline","the tagline \"","tagline \" Vorcan","\" Vorcan :","Vorcan : your",": your own","your own personal","own personal air","personal air supply","air supply .","supply . \"","or a more","a more down","more down to","down to earth","to earth campaign","earth campaign from","campaign from Cranston","from Cranston of","Cranston of \"","of \" The","\" The pad","The pad ai","pad ai n't","ai n't bad","n't bad !","bad !

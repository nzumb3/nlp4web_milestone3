{"title":"Melody","plot":"Jing Shan is not the type that Melody would fall in love at first sight, but all their friends say they look particularly alike. For a while, they begin to feel the same way. Perhaps for this reason, they become a couple. Their look, accent, and even act become similar. Melody never believes in fate; however, the first time she undresses in front of Jing Shan and finds the mole on his right shoulder, she can not help but believe in fate, because she has the same mole on her left shoulder. As to Jing Shan, he is more readily to believe in their destiny. But they are not clear that love islove is so fragile but powerful.","genres":["Animation"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Jing","Shan","is","not","the","type","that","Melodi","would","fall","in","love","at","first","sight",",","but","all","their","friend","say","they","look","particular","alik",".","For","a","while",",","they","begin","to","feel","the","same","way",".","Perhap","for","this","reason",",","they","becom","a","coupl",".","Their","look",",","accent",",","and","even","act","becom","similar",".","Melodi","never","believ","in","fate",";","howev",",","the","first","time","she","undress","in","front","of","Jing","Shan","and","find","the","mole","on","his","right","shoulder",",","she","can","not","help","but","believ","in","fate",",","becaus","she","has","the","same","mole","on","her","left","shoulder",".","As","to","Jing","Shan",",","he","is","more","readili","to","believ","in","their","destini",".","But","they","are","not","clear","that","love","islov","is","so","fragil","but","power","."],"lemmas":["Jing","Shan","be","not","the","type","that","Melody","would","fall","in","love","at","first","sight",",","but","all","they","friend","say","they","look","particularly","alike",".","for","a","while",",","they","begin","to","feel","the","same","way",".","perhaps","for","this","reason",",","they","become","a","couple",".","they","look",",","accent",",","and","even","act","become","similar",".","Melody","never","believe","in","fate",";","however",",","the","first","time","she","undress","in","front","of","Jing","Shan","and","find","the","mole","on","he","right","shoulder",",","she","can","not","help","but","believe","in","fate",",","because","she","have","the","same","mole","on","she","left","shoulder",".","as","to","Jing","Shan",",","he","be","more","readily","to","believe","in","they","destiny",".","but","they","be","not","clear","that","love","islove","be","so","fragile","but","powerful","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jing Shan is","Shan is not","is not the","not the type","the type that","type that Melody","that Melody would","Melody would fall","would fall in","fall in love","in love at","love at first","at first sight","first sight ,","sight , but",", but all","but all their","all their friends","their friends say","friends say they","say they look","they look particularly","look particularly alike","For a while","a while ,","while , they",", they begin","they begin to","begin to feel","to feel the","feel the same","the same way","Perhaps for this","for this reason","this reason ,","reason , they",", they become","they become a","become a couple","Their look ,","look , accent",", accent ,","accent , and",", and even","and even act","even act become","act become similar","Melody never believes","never believes in","believes in fate","in fate ;","fate ;

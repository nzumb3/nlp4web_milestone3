{"title":"At Dawn","plot":"Keltoum and her husband, Omar, live in a village in the heart of the Moroccan mountains. They are both actors, but do not have much work and have been dreaming of staging a play for years. Keltoum is sick and Omar takes her regularly to Tangiers to be treated. While there, he searches for a theatre for their play and also visits his daughter. Starting at dawn, 'At Dawn' portrays one of these trips, in which we meet the characters in the morning and meet up with them again in the afternoon on their way back home.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Keltoum","and","her","husband",",","Omar",",","live","in","a","villag","in","the","heart","of","the","Moroccan","mountain",".","They","are","both","actor",",","but","do","not","have","much","work","and","have","been","dream","of","stage","a","play","for","year",".","Keltoum","is","sick","and","Omar","take","her","regular","to","Tangier","to","be","treat",".","While","there",",","he","search","for","a","theatr","for","their","play","and","also","visit","his","daughter",".","Start","at","dawn",",","'","At","Dawn","'","portray","one","of","these","trip",",","in","which","we","meet","the","charact","in","the","morn","and","meet","up","with","them","again","in","the","afternoon","on","their","way","back","home","."],"lemmas":["Keltoum","and","she","husband",",","Omar",",","live","in","a","village","in","the","heart","of","the","moroccan","mountain",".","they","be","both","actor",",","but","do","not","have","much","work","and","have","be","dream","of","stage","a","play","for","year",".","Keltoum","be","sick","and","Omar","take","she","regularly","to","Tangiers","to","be","treat",".","while","there",",","he","search","for","a","theatre","for","they","play","and","also","visit","he","daughter",".","start","at","dawn",",","'","at","dawn","'","portray","one","of","these","trip",",","in","which","we","meet","the","character","in","the","morning","and","meet","up","with","they","again","in","the","afternoon","on","they","way","back","home","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Keltoum and her","and her husband","her husband ,","husband , Omar",", Omar ,","Omar , live",", live in","live in a","in a village","a village in","village in the","in the heart","the heart of","heart of the","of the Moroccan","the Moroccan mountains","They are both","are both actors","both actors ,","actors , but",", but do","but do not","do not have","not have much","have much work","much work and","work and have","and have been","have been dreaming","been dreaming of","dreaming of staging","of staging a","staging a play","a play for","play for years","Keltoum is sick","is sick and","sick and Omar","and Omar takes","Omar takes her","takes her regularly","her regularly to","regularly to Tangiers","to Tangiers to","Tangiers to be","to be treated","While there ,","there , he",", he searches","he searches for","searches for a","for a theatre","a theatre for","theatre for their","for their play","their play and","play and also","and also visits","also visits his","visits his daughter","Starting at dawn","at dawn ,","dawn , '",", ' At","' At Dawn","At Dawn '","Dawn ' portrays","' portrays one","portrays one of","one of these","of these trips","these trips ,","trips , in",", in which","in which we","which we meet","we meet the","meet the characters","the characters in","characters in the","in the morning","the morning and","morning and meet","and meet up","meet up with","up with them","with them again","them again in","again in the","in the afternoon","the afternoon on","afternoon on their","on their way","their way back","way back home"],"2grams":["Keltoum and","and her","her husband","husband ,",", Omar","Omar ,",", live","live in","in a","a village","village in","in the","the heart","heart of","of the","the Moroccan","Moroccan mountains","They are","are both","both actors","actors ,",", but","but do","do not","not have","have much","much work","work and","and have","have been","been dreaming","dreaming of","of staging","staging a","a play","play for","for years","Keltoum is","is sick","sick and","and Omar","Omar takes","takes her","her regularly","regularly to","to Tangiers","Tangiers to","to be","be treated","While there","there ,",", he","he searches","searches for","for a","a theatre","theatre for","for their","their play","play and","and also","also visits","visits his","his daughter","Starting at","at dawn","dawn ,",", '","' At","At Dawn","Dawn '","' portrays","portrays one","one of","of these","these trips","trips ,",", in","in which","which we","we meet","meet the","the characters","characters in","in the","the morning","morning and","and meet","meet up","up with","with them","them again","again in","in the","the afternoon","afternoon on","on their","their way","way back","back home"]}

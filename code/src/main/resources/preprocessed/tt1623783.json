{"title":"ODC [Ordinary Decent Criminal]","plot":"The city is run by the Consortium, a globally unique grouping of three separate ethnic criminal organizations: the Sicilians, the Muslims and the Irish. Each has a clear division of ranks and powers and the Consortium has run the city without incident for more than five generations. Now the Russian mob have their sights on this place, Soviet ex-patriots from all across the Baltic, and they wield their desire with a violent iron fist. It couldn't be a better or worse time with the Consortium's recent upheaval in light of Cillian Lynch assuming control of the Irish mob from his late father. Making matters more complicated are Cillian's desires to make the East Bay Gang legitimate. Seizing the opportunity the Russian's begin piling bodies turning the Consortium against itself and putting Cillian to the ultimate test: power or family. In a desperate plea Cillian must come to terms with who he is in time to save the one's he loves. In a final reckoning the balance of power is forever changed and no one will get out unscathed.","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["The","citi","is","run","by","the","Consortium",",","a","global","uniqu","group","of","three","separ","ethnic","crimin","organ",":","the","Sicilian",",","the","Muslim","and","the","Irish",".","Each","has","a","clear","divis","of","rank","and","power","and","the","Consortium","has","run","the","citi","without","incid","for","more","than","five","generat",".","Now","the","Russian","mob","have","their","sight","on","this","place",",","Soviet","ex-patriot","from","all","across","the","Baltic",",","and","they","wield","their","desir","with","a","violent","iron","fist",".","It","could","n't","be","a","better","or","wors","time","with","the","Consortium","'s","recent","upheav","in","light","of","Cillian","Lynch","assum","control","of","the","Irish","mob","from","his","late","father",".","Make","matter","more","complic","are","Cillian","'s","desir","to","make","the","East","Bay","Gang","legitim",".","Seiz","the","opportun","the","Russian","'s","begin","pile","bodi","turn","the","Consortium","against","itself","and","put","Cillian","to","the","ultim","test",":","power","or","famili",".","In","a","desper","plea","Cillian","must","come","to","term","with","who","he","is","in","time","to","save","the","one","'s","he","love",".","In","a","final","reckon","the","balanc","of","power","is","forev","chang","and","no","one","will","get","out","unscath","."],"lemmas":["the","city","be","run","by","the","Consortium",",","a","globally","unique","grouping","of","three","separate","ethnic","criminal","organization",":","the","Sicilians",",","the","Muslims","and","the","Irish",".","each","have","a","clear","division","of","rank","and","power","and","the","Consortium","have","run","the","city","without","incident","for","more","than","five","generation",".","now","the","russian","mob","have","they","sight","on","this","place",",","soviet","ex-patriot","from","all","across","the","Baltic",",","and","they","wield","they","desire","with","a","violent","iron","fist",".","it","could","not","be","a","better","or","worse","time","with","the","Consortium","'s","recent","upheaval","in","light","of","Cillian","Lynch","assume","control","of","the","irish","mob","from","he","late","father",".","make","matter","more","complicated","be","Cillian","'s","desire","to","make","the","East","Bay","gang","legitimate",".","seize","the","opportunity","the","Russian","'s","begin","pile","body","turn","the","Consortium","against","itself","and","put","Cillian","to","the","ultimate","test",":","power","or","family",".","in","a","desperate","plea","Cillian","must","come","to","term","with","who","he","be","in","time","to","save","the","one","'s","he","love",".","in","a","final","reckon","the","balance","of","power","be","forever","change","and","no","one","will","get","out","unscathed","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

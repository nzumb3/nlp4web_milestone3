{"title":"Ed Emberley, Children's Book Illustrator","plot":"Award-winning children's book author and illustrator Ed Emberley is truly a national treasure, having drawn nearly 100 books. The warmth of his family and his 17th century home are an essential part of his work. In this installment of the lynda.com flagship documentary series, we go to Ed's home in Ipswich, Massachusetts, to meet him and all of the members of his talented family, including his wife and author, Barbara; children, illustrators Rebecca and Michael; and granddaughter, recording artist Adrian Emberley. A generation of children have learned to draw using Ed's drawing books and we watch as a new generation puts crayon to paper. At 80 years young, Ed is pushing ahead and we meet with his team as he works on his newest iPad app-with graphic artists that, as children, learned to draw with his books.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Award-win","children","'s","book","author","and","illustr","Ed","Emberley","is","truli","a","nation","treasur",",","have","drawn","near","100","book",".","The","warmth","of","his","famili","and","his","17th","centuri","home","are","an","essenti","part","of","his","work",".","In","this","instal","of","the","lynda.com","flagship","documentari","seri",",","we","go","to","Ed","'s","home","in","Ipswich",",","Massachusett",",","to","meet","him","and","all","of","the","member","of","his","talent","famili",",","includ","his","wife","and","author",",","Barbara",";","children",",","illustr","Rebecca","and","Michael",";","and","granddaught",",","record","artist","Adrian","Emberley",".","A","generat","of","children","have","learn","to","draw","use","Ed","'s","draw","book","and","we","watch","as","a","new","generat","put","crayon","to","paper",".","At","80","year","young",",","Ed","is","push","ahead","and","we","meet","with","his","team","as","he","work","on","his","newest","iPad","app-with","graphic","artist","that",",","as","children",",","learn","to","draw","with","his","book","."],"lemmas":["award-winning","child","'s","book","author","and","illustrator","Ed","Emberley","be","truly","a","national","treasure",",","have","draw","nearly","100","book",".","the","warmth","of","he","family","and","he","17th","century","home","be","a","essential","part","of","he","work",".","in","this","installment","of","the","lynda.com","flagship","documentary","series",",","we","go","to","Ed","'s","home","in","Ipswich",",","Massachusetts",",","to","meet","he","and","all","of","the","member","of","he","talented","family",",","include","he","wife","and","author",",","Barbara",";","child",",","illustrator","Rebecca","and","Michael",";","and","granddaughter",",","recording","artist","Adrian","Emberley",".","a","generation","of","child","have","learn","to","draw","use","Ed","'s","drawing","book","and","we","watch","as","a","new","generation","put","crayon","to","paper",".","at","80","year","young",",","Ed","be","push","ahead","and","we","meet","with","he","team","as","he","work","on","he","newest","ipad","app-with","graphic","artist","that",",","as","child",",","learn","to","draw","with","he","book","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Award-winning children 's","children 's book","'s book author","book author and","author and illustrator","and illustrator Ed","illustrator Ed Emberley","Ed Emberley is","Emberley is truly","is truly a","truly a national","a national treasure","national treasure ,","treasure , having",", having drawn","having drawn nearly","drawn nearly 100","nearly 100 books","The warmth of","warmth of his","of his family","his family and","family and his","and his 17th","his 17th century","17th century home","century home are","home are an","are an essential","an essential part","essential part of","part of his","of his work","In this installment","this installment of","installment of the","of the lynda.com","the lynda.com flagship","lynda.com flagship documentary","flagship documentary series","documentary series ,","series , we",", we go","we go to","go to Ed","to Ed 's","Ed 's home","'s home in","home in Ipswich","in Ipswich ,","Ipswich , Massachusetts",", Massachusetts ,","Massachusetts , to",", to meet","to meet him","meet him and","him and all","and all of","all of the","of the members","the members of","members of his","of his talented","his talented family","talented family ,","family , including",", including his","including his wife","his wife and","wife and author","and author ,","author , Barbara",", Barbara ;","Barbara ;

{"title":"Songs Along a Stony Road","plot":"SONGS ALONG A STONY ROAD follows musicologist Zoltan Kallos on his visits to musicians in villages around Transylvania and Romanian Moldavia. In each village Kallos is a welcome distraction from the backbreaking manual labor of farming, and he easily coaxes the citizens to break out a bottle of homemade brandy and sing an old song, or dust off the violin and play. He has collected music in these places for half a century.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["SONGS","ALONG","A","STONi","ROAD","follow","musicologist","Zoltan","Kallo","on","his","visit","to","musician","in","villag","around","Transylvania","and","Romanian","Moldavia",".","In","each","villag","Kallo","is","a","welcom","distract","from","the","backbreak","manual","labor","of","farm",",","and","he","easili","coax","the","citizen","to","break","out","a","bottl","of","homemad","brandi","and","sing","an","old","song",",","or","dust","off","the","violin","and","play",".","He","has","collect","music","in","these","place","for","half","a","centuri","."],"lemmas":["SONGS","ALONG","A","STONY","road","follow","musicologist","Zoltan","Kallos","on","he","visit","to","musician","in","village","around","Transylvania","and","Romanian","Moldavia",".","in","each","village","Kallos","be","a","welcome","distraction","from","the","backbreaking","manual","labor","of","farming",",","and","he","easily","coax","the","citizen","to","break","out","a","bottle","of","homemade","brandy","and","sing","a","old","song",",","or","dust","off","the","violin","and","play",".","he","have","collect","music","in","these","place","for","half","a","century","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["SONGS ALONG A","ALONG A STONY","A STONY ROAD","STONY ROAD follows","ROAD follows musicologist","follows musicologist Zoltan","musicologist Zoltan Kallos","Zoltan Kallos on","Kallos on his","on his visits","his visits to","visits to musicians","to musicians in","musicians in villages","in villages around","villages around Transylvania","around Transylvania and","Transylvania and Romanian","and Romanian Moldavia","In each village","each village Kallos","village Kallos is","Kallos is a","is a welcome","a welcome distraction","welcome distraction from","distraction from the","from the backbreaking","the backbreaking manual","backbreaking manual labor","manual labor of","labor of farming","of farming ,","farming , and",", and he","and he easily","he easily coaxes","easily coaxes the","coaxes the citizens","the citizens to","citizens to break","to break out","break out a","out a bottle","a bottle of","bottle of homemade","of homemade brandy","homemade brandy and","brandy and sing","and sing an","sing an old","an old song","old song ,","song , or",", or dust","or dust off","dust off the","off the violin","the violin and","violin and play","He has collected","has collected music","collected music in","music in these","in these places","these places for","places for half","for half a","half a century"],"2grams":["SONGS ALONG","ALONG A","A STONY","STONY ROAD","ROAD follows","follows musicologist","musicologist Zoltan","Zoltan Kallos","Kallos on","on his","his visits","visits to","to musicians","musicians in","in villages","villages around","around Transylvania","Transylvania and","and Romanian","Romanian Moldavia","In each","each village","village Kallos","Kallos is","is a","a welcome","welcome distraction","distraction from","from the","the backbreaking","backbreaking manual","manual labor","labor of","of farming","farming ,",", and","and he","he easily","easily coaxes","coaxes the","the citizens","citizens to","to break","break out","out a","a bottle","bottle of","of homemade","homemade brandy","brandy and","and sing","sing an","an old","old song","song ,",", or","or dust","dust off","off the","the violin","violin and","and play","He has","has collected","collected music","music in","in these","these places","places for","for half","half a","a century"]}

{"title":"Hell's Pavement","plot":"The film follows five years in the life of a young girl as she struggles against an onslaught of good intentions. From her first encounter with the social care system, through a range of foster placements, to a haunting climax, we are challenged to question how it is that so many well-intentioned people can do so much unintended damage. And how it is that the £4bn a year that people in the UK spend on children in care has failed to break the cycle of abuse, addiction and abandonment.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","film","follow","five","year","in","the","life","of","a","young","girl","as","she","struggl","against","an","onslaught","of","good","intent",".","From","her","first","encount","with","the","social","care","system",",","through","a","rang","of","foster","placement",",","to","a","haunt","climax",",","we","are","challeng","to","question","how","it","is","that","so","mani","well-intent","peopl","can","do","so","much","unintend","damag",".","And","how","it","is","that","the","£","4bn","a","year","that","peopl","in","the","UK","spend","on","children","in","care","has","fail","to","break","the","cycl","of","abus",",","addict","and","abandon","."],"lemmas":["the","film","follow","five","year","in","the","life","of","a","young","girl","as","she","struggle","against","a","onslaught","of","good","intention",".","from","she","first","encounter","with","the","social","care","system",",","through","a","range","of","foster","placement",",","to","a","haunting","climax",",","we","be","challenge","to","question","how","it","be","that","so","many","well-intentioned","people","can","do","so","much","unintended","damage",".","and","how","it","be","that","the","£","4bn","a","year","that","people","in","the","UK","spend","on","child","in","care","have","fail","to","break","the","cycle","of","abuse",",","addiction","and","abandonment","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film follows","film follows five","follows five years","five years in","years in the","in the life","the life of","life of a","of a young","a young girl","young girl as","girl as she","as she struggles","she struggles against","struggles against an","against an onslaught","an onslaught of","onslaught of good","of good intentions","From her first","her first encounter","first encounter with","encounter with the","with the social","the social care","social care system","care system ,","system , through",", through a","through a range","a range of","range of foster","of foster placements","foster placements ,","placements , to",", to a","to a haunting","a haunting climax","haunting climax ,","climax , we",", we are","we are challenged","are challenged to","challenged to question","to question how","question how it","how it is","it is that","is that so","that so many","so many well-intentioned","many well-intentioned people","well-intentioned people can","people can do","can do so","do so much","so much unintended","much unintended damage","And how it","how it is","it is that","is that the","that the £","the £ 4bn","£ 4bn a","4bn a year","a year that","year that people","that people in","people in the","in the UK","the UK spend","UK spend on","spend on children","on children in","children in care","in care has","care has failed","has failed to","failed to break","to break the","break the cycle","the cycle of","cycle of abuse","of abuse ,","abuse , addiction",", addiction and","addiction and abandonment"],"2grams":["The film","film follows","follows five","five years","years in","in the","the life","life of","of a","a young","young girl","girl as","as she","she struggles","struggles against","against an","an onslaught","onslaught of","of good","good intentions","From her","her first","first encounter","encounter with","with the","the social","social care","care system","system ,",", through","through a","a range","range of","of foster","foster placements","placements ,",", to","to a","a haunting","haunting climax","climax ,",", we","we are","are challenged","challenged to","to question","question how","how it","it is","is that","that so","so many","many well-intentioned","well-intentioned people","people can","can do","do so","so much","much unintended","unintended damage","And how","how it","it is","is that","that the","the £","£ 4bn","4bn a","a year","year that","that people","people in","in the","the UK","UK spend","spend on","on children","children in","in care","care has","has failed","failed to","to break","break the","the cycle","cycle of","of abuse","abuse ,",", addiction","addiction and","and abandonment"]}

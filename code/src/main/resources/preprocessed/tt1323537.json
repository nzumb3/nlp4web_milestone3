{"title":"Rehearsal","plot":"Eight actors have been cast in 'Bloody Summer,' a typical schlock horror movie, with low-budget to match. But there's a twist: A week 'on set' at an isolated cabin in the mountains will start the production. One van will take the actors, the producer and the director from the safety of San Francisco to a run down den in La Honda, California. But when people begin to disappear, starting with the van's driver, those left begin to realize they may have auditioned for more than they bargained for.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Eight","actor","have","been","cast","in","'","Bloodi","Summer",",","'","a","typic","schlock","horror","movi",",","with","low-budget","to","match",".","But","there","'s","a","twist",":","A","week","'","on","set","'","at","an","isol","cabin","in","the","mountain","will","start","the","product",".","One","van","will","take","the","actor",",","the","produc","and","the","director","from","the","safeti","of","San","Francisco","to","a","run","down","den","in","La","Honda",",","California",".","But","when","peopl","begin","to","disappear",",","start","with","the","van","'s","driver",",","those","left","begin","to","realiz","they","may","have","audit","for","more","than","they","bargain","for","."],"lemmas":["eight","actor","have","be","cast","in","'","Bloody","Summer",",","'","a","typical","schlock","horror","movie",",","with","low-budget","to","match",".","but","there","be","a","twist",":","a","week","'","on","set","'","at","a","isolate","cabin","in","the","mountain","will","start","the","production",".","one","van","will","take","the","actor",",","the","producer","and","the","director","from","the","safety","of","San","Francisco","to","a","run","down","den","in","La","Honda",",","California",".","but","when","people","begin","to","disappear",",","start","with","the","van","'s","driver",",","those","leave","begin","to","realize","they","may","have","audition","for","more","than","they","bargain","for","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Eight actors have","actors have been","have been cast","been cast in","cast in '","in ' Bloody","' Bloody Summer","Bloody Summer ,","Summer , '",", ' a","' a typical","a typical schlock","typical schlock horror","schlock horror movie","horror movie ,","movie , with",", with low-budget","with low-budget to","low-budget to match","But there 's","there 's a","'s a twist","a twist :","twist : A",": A week","A week '","week ' on","' on set","on set '","set ' at","' at an","at an isolated","an isolated cabin","isolated cabin in","cabin in the","in the mountains","the mountains will","mountains will start","will start the","start the production","One van will","van will take","will take the","take the actors","the actors ,","actors , the",", the producer","the producer and","producer and the","and the director","the director from","director from the","from the safety","the safety of","safety of San","of San Francisco","San Francisco to","Francisco to a","to a run","a run down","run down den","down den in","den in La","in La Honda","La Honda ,","Honda , California","But when people","when people begin","people begin to","begin to disappear","to disappear ,","disappear , starting",", starting with","starting with the","with the van","the van 's","van 's driver","'s driver ,","driver , those",", those left","those left begin","left begin to","begin to realize","to realize they","realize they may","they may have","may have auditioned","have auditioned for","auditioned for more","for more than","more than they","than they bargained","they bargained for"],"2grams":["Eight actors","actors have","have been","been cast","cast in","in '","' Bloody","Bloody Summer","Summer ,",", '","' a","a typical","typical schlock","schlock horror","horror movie","movie ,",", with","with low-budget","low-budget to","to match","But there","there 's","'s a","a twist","twist :",": A","A week","week '","' on","on set","set '","' at","at an","an isolated","isolated cabin","cabin in","in the","the mountains","mountains will","will start","start the","the production","One van","van will","will take","take the","the actors","actors ,",", the","the producer","producer and","and the","the director","director from","from the","the safety","safety of","of San","San Francisco","Francisco to","to a","a run","run down","down den","den in","in La","La Honda","Honda ,",", California","But when","when people","people begin","begin to","to disappear","disappear ,",", starting","starting with","with the","the van","van 's","'s driver","driver ,",", those","those left","left begin","begin to","to realize","realize they","they may","may have","have auditioned","auditioned for","for more","more than","than they","they bargained","bargained for"]}

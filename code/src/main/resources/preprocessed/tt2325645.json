{"title":"Dom Zauvijek","plot":"During the Homeland War (1991-1995) Croatia was devastated with estimates ranging from 20-25% of its economy destroyed. Tens of thousands were killed and many more were left homeless. Through the voices of common people, Homecoming tells a story about the raise of a small, invisible Balkan country with enormous natural and human beauty from the ashes of terror; the country which still bears the scars, both physical and psychological, of the conflict during the War of Independence. It reflects upon a part of history that, although can never be changed, has molded and influenced a generation in a positive way.","genres":["War"],"stems":["Dure","the","Homeland","War","(","1991-1995",")","Croatia","was","devast","with","estim","rang","from","20-25","%","of","it","economi","destroy",".","Ten","of","thousand","were","kill","and","mani","more","were","left","homeless",".","Through","the","voic","of","common","peopl",",","Homecom","tell","a","stori","about","the","rais","of","a","small",",","invis","Balkan","countri","with","enorm","natur","and","human","beauti","from","the","ash","of","terror",";","the","countri","which","still","bear","the","scar",",","both","physic","and","psycholog",",","of","the","conflict","dure","the","War","of","Independ",".","It","reflect","upon","a","part","of","histori","that",",","although","can","never","be","chang",",","has","mold","and","influenc","a","generat","in","a","posit","way","."],"lemmas":["during","the","homeland","war","-lrb-","1991-1995","-rrb-","Croatia","be","devastate","with","estimate","range","from","20-25","%","of","its","economy","destroy",".","ten","of","thousand","be","kill","and","many","more","be","leave","homeless",".","through","the","voice","of","common","people",",","Homecoming","tell","a","story","about","the","raise","of","a","small",",","invisible","Balkan","country","with","enormous","natural","and","human","beauty","from","the","ash","of","terror",";","the","country","which","still","bear","the","scar",",","both","physical","and","psychological",",","of","the","conflict","during","the","War","of","Independence",".","it","reflect","upon","a","part","of","history","that",",","although","can","never","be","change",",","have","mold","and","influence","a","generation","in","a","positive","way","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["During the Homeland","the Homeland War","Homeland War (","War ( 1991-1995","( 1991-1995 )","1991-1995 ) Croatia",") Croatia was","Croatia was devastated","was devastated with","devastated with estimates","with estimates ranging","estimates ranging from","ranging from 20-25","from 20-25 %","20-25 % of","% of its","of its economy","its economy destroyed","Tens of thousands","of thousands were","thousands were killed","were killed and","killed and many","and many more","many more were","more were left","were left homeless","Through the voices","the voices of","voices of common","of common people","common people ,","people , Homecoming",", Homecoming tells","Homecoming tells a","tells a story","a story about","story about the","about the raise","the raise of","raise of a","of a small","a small ,","small , invisible",", invisible Balkan","invisible Balkan country","Balkan country with","country with enormous","with enormous natural","enormous natural and","natural and human","and human beauty","human beauty from","beauty from the","from the ashes","the ashes of","ashes of terror","of terror ;","terror ;

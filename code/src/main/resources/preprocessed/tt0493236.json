{"title":"Dislocation","plot":"In February 2002, families living in the Robert Taylor Homes public housing development were given a 180 day notice of eviction. In six months, the community that had been their home for generations would be demolished. DISLOCATION chronicles the lives of tenants in one building as they move through the six-month relocation process. The filmmakers follow three families as they prepare for their own move and as they help others around them. DISLOCATION is a story of a community coping with its own impending demise. It is a tale of courage, hope, and survival.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","Februari","2002",",","famili","live","in","the","Robert","Taylor","Home","public","hous","develop","were","given","a","180","day","notic","of","evict",".","In","six","month",",","the","communiti","that","had","been","their","home","for","generat","would","be","demolish",".","DISLOCATION","chronicl","the","live","of","tenant","in","one","build","as","they","move","through","the","six-month","reloc","process",".","The","filmmak","follow","three","famili","as","they","prepar","for","their","own","move","and","as","they","help","other","around","them",".","DISLOCATION","is","a","stori","of","a","communiti","cope","with","it","own","impend","demis",".","It","is","a","tale","of","courag",",","hope",",","and","surviv","."],"lemmas":["in","February","2002",",","family","live","in","the","Robert","Taylor","Homes","public","housing","development","be","give","a","180","day","notice","of","eviction",".","in","six","month",",","the","community","that","have","be","they","home","for","generation","would","be","demolish",".","dislocation","chronicle","the","life","of","tenant","in","one","building","as","they","move","through","the","six-month","relocation","process",".","the","filmmaker","follow","three","family","as","they","prepare","for","they","own","move","and","as","they","help","other","around","they",".","dislocation","be","a","story","of","a","community","cope","with","its","own","impending","demise",".","it","be","a","tale","of","courage",",","hope",",","and","survival","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In February 2002","February 2002 ,","2002 , families",", families living","families living in","living in the","in the Robert","the Robert Taylor","Robert Taylor Homes","Taylor Homes public","Homes public housing","public housing development","housing development were","development were given","were given a","given a 180","a 180 day","180 day notice","day notice of","notice of eviction","In six months","six months ,","months , the",", the community","the community that","community that had","that had been","had been their","been their home","their home for","home for generations","for generations would","generations would be","would be demolished","DISLOCATION chronicles the","chronicles the lives","the lives of","lives of tenants","of tenants in","tenants in one","in one building","one building as","building as they","as they move","they move through","move through the","through the six-month","the six-month relocation","six-month relocation process","The filmmakers follow","filmmakers follow three","follow three families","three families as","families as they","as they prepare","they prepare for","prepare for their","for their own","their own move","own move and","move and as","and as they","as they help","they help others","help others around","others around them","DISLOCATION is a","is a story","a story of","story of a","of a community","a community coping","community coping with","coping with its","with its own","its own impending","own impending demise","It is a","is a tale","a tale of","tale of courage","of courage ,","courage , hope",", hope ,","hope , and",", and survival"],"2grams":["In February","February 2002","2002 ,",", families","families living","living in","in the","the Robert","Robert Taylor","Taylor Homes","Homes public","public housing","housing development","development were","were given","given a","a 180","180 day","day notice","notice of","of eviction","In six","six months","months ,",", the","the community","community that","that had","had been","been their","their home","home for","for generations","generations would","would be","be demolished","DISLOCATION chronicles","chronicles the","the lives","lives of","of tenants","tenants in","in one","one building","building as","as they","they move","move through","through the","the six-month","six-month relocation","relocation process","The filmmakers","filmmakers follow","follow three","three families","families as","as they","they prepare","prepare for","for their","their own","own move","move and","and as","as they","they help","help others","others around","around them","DISLOCATION is","is a","a story","story of","of a","a community","community coping","coping with","with its","its own","own impending","impending demise","It is","is a","a tale","tale of","of courage","courage ,",", hope","hope ,",", and","and survival"]}

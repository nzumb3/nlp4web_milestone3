{"title":"Laugh Now Think Later","plot":"One of the most unforgettable TV comedies of the 1980s was doled out thirty seconds at a time, an unending series of wacky, ultra-fast-paced commercial spots for the Southern California electronics chain, The Federated Group that starred 'Fred Rated,' the half-insane, 'BassOMatic' - style, parody of a spokesman played by Shadoe Stevens. Shadoe and his gung-ho skeleton team cranked out endless, memorable, frenetic nuggets of Dadaist, Monty Python-esque video art disguised as VCR and car stereo ads -- amassing over 1,100 hilarious commercials in six years, and leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of every L.A. TV-watcher. This documentary about Shadoe includes the 'Best of Fred,' 'Shadoevision,' the even-more-bonkers 1986 Sci-Fi comedy cable special, out-takes and newly uncovered material not seen for 25 years.","genres":["Comedy"," Documentary"],"stems":["One","of","the","most","unforgett","TV","comedi","of","the","1980s","was","dole","out","thirti","second","at","a","time",",","an","unend","seri","of","wacki",",","ultra-fast-pac","commerci","spot","for","the","Southern","California","electron","chain",",","The","Feder","Group","that","star","'","Fred","Rate",",","'","the","half-insan",",","'","BassOMat","'","-","style",",","parodi","of","a","spokesman","play","by","Shado","Steven",".","Shado","and","his","gung-ho","skeleton","team","crank","out","endless",",","memor",",","frenet","nugget","of","Dadaist",",","Monti","Python-esqu","video","art","disguis","as","VCR","and","car","stereo","ad","--","amass","over","1,100","hilari","commerci","in","six","year",",","and","leav","an","indel","mark","on","the","psych","of","everi","L.A.","TV-watcher",".","This","documentari","about","Shado","includ","the","'","Best","of","Fred",",","'","'","Shadoevis",",","'","the","even-more-bonk","1986","Sci-Fi","comedi","cabl","special",",","out-tak","and","newli","uncov","materi","not","seen","for","25","year","."],"lemmas":["one","of","the","most","unforgettable","tv","comedy","of","the","1980","be","dole","out","thirty","seconds","at","a","time",",","a","unending","series","of","wacky",",","ultra-fast-paced","commercial","spot","for","the","Southern","California","electronics","chain",",","the","Federated","Group","that","star","'","Fred","Rated",",","'","the","half-insane",",","'","BassOMatic","'","-","style",",","parody","of","a","spokesman","play","by","Shadoe","Stevens",".","Shadoe","and","he","gung-ho","skeleton","team","crank","out","endless",",","memorable",",","frenetic","nugget","of","Dadaist",",","Monty","python-esque","video","art","disguise","as","VCR","and","car","stereo","ad","--","amass","over","1,100","hilarious","commercial","in","six","year",",","and","leave","a","indelible","mark","on","the","psyche","of","every","L.A.","tv-watcher",".","this","documentary","about","Shadoe","include","the","'","best","of","Fred",",","'","'","Shadoevision",",","'","the","even-more-bonkers","1986","sci-fi","comedy","cable","special",",","out-take","and","newly","uncover","material","not","see","for","25","year","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["One of the","of the most","the most unforgettable","most unforgettable TV","unforgettable TV comedies","TV comedies of","comedies of the","of the 1980s","the 1980s was","1980s was doled","was doled out","doled out thirty","out thirty seconds","thirty seconds at","seconds at a","at a time","a time ,","time , an",", an unending","an unending series","unending series of","series of wacky","of wacky ,","wacky , ultra-fast-paced",", ultra-fast-paced commercial","ultra-fast-paced commercial spots","commercial spots for","spots for the","for the Southern","the Southern California","Southern California electronics","California electronics chain","electronics chain ,","chain , The",", The Federated","The Federated Group","Federated Group that","Group that starred","that starred '","starred ' Fred","' Fred Rated","Fred Rated ,","Rated , '",", ' the","' the half-insane","the half-insane ,","half-insane , '",", ' BassOMatic","' BassOMatic '","BassOMatic ' -","' - style","- style ,","style , parody",", parody of","parody of a","of a spokesman","a spokesman played","spokesman played by","played by Shadoe","by Shadoe Stevens","Shadoe and his","and his gung-ho","his gung-ho skeleton","gung-ho skeleton team","skeleton team cranked","team cranked out","cranked out endless","out endless ,","endless , memorable",", memorable ,","memorable , frenetic",", frenetic nuggets","frenetic nuggets of","nuggets of Dadaist","of Dadaist ,","Dadaist , Monty",", Monty Python-esque","Monty Python-esque video","Python-esque video art","video art disguised","art disguised as","disguised as VCR","as VCR and","VCR and car","and car stereo","car stereo ads","stereo ads --","ads -- amassing","-- amassing over","amassing over 1,100","over 1,100 hilarious","1,100 hilarious commercials","hilarious commercials in","commercials in six","in six years","six years ,","years , and",", and leaving","and leaving an","leaving an indelible","an indelible mark","indelible mark on","mark on the","on the psyche","the psyche of","psyche of every","of every L.A.","every L.A.

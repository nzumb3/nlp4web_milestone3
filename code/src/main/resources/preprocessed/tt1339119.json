{"title":"M for Mississippi: A Road Trip through the Birthplace of the Blues","plot":"Everyone knows the blues came from Mississippi. Here's an update: They never left. This documentary takes audiences on a wild ride through the heart of Mississippi's current blues scene - from sun-drenched cotton fields to whiskey-soaked juke joints. Following two self-proclaimed blues fanatics, Jeff Konkel and Roger Stolle, on a week-long road trip across the state, \"M for Mississippi\" explores the thriving underbelly of a dying American art form in the land where it began. Using exclusive interviews and all-new musical performances, \"M For Mississippi\" captures the proverbial \"real deal\" in its home where it is most comfortable and authentic. More than just a collection of concert performances, the film collects the sounds, images and feel of both the performers and their native landscape - an environment essential to their livelihoods and inseparable from their art. By showcasing such a fascinating foreign land so close to home, the filmmakers hope to inspire countless others to make their own road trips down Mississippi's blue highways in search of the world's last truly-Delta blues men.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Everyon","know","the","blue","came","from","Mississippi",".","Here","'s","an","updat",":","They","never","left",".","This","documentari","take","audienc","on","a","wild","ride","through","the","heart","of","Mississippi","'s","current","blue","scene","-","from","sun-drench","cotton","field","to","whiskey-soak","juke","joint",".","Follow","two","self-proclaim","blue","fanat",",","Jeff","Konkel","and","Roger","Stoll",",","on","a","week-long","road","trip","across","the","state",",","\"","M","for","Mississippi","\"","explor","the","thrive","underbelli","of","a","die","American","art","form","in","the","land","where","it","began",".","Using","exclus","interview","and","all-new","music","perform",",","\"","M","For","Mississippi","\"","captur","the","proverbi","\"","real","deal","\"","in","it","home","where","it","is","most","comfort","and","authent",".","More","than","just","a","collect","of","concert","perform",",","the","film","collect","the","sound",",","imag","and","feel","of","both","the","perform","and","their","nativ","landscap","-","an","environ","essenti","to","their","livelihood","and","insepar","from","their","art",".","By","showcas","such","a","fascin","foreign","land","so","close","to","home",",","the","filmmak","hope","to","inspir","countless","other","to","make","their","own","road","trip","down","Mississippi","'s","blue","highway","in","search","of","the","world","'s","last","truly-Delta","blue","men","."],"lemmas":["everyone","know","the","blues","come","from","Mississippi",".","here","be","a","update",":","they","never","leave",".","this","documentary","take","audience","on","a","wild","ride","through","the","heart","of","Mississippi","'s","current","blues","scene","-","from","sun-drenched","cotton","field","to","whiskey-soaked","juke","joint",".","follow","two","self-proclaimed","blues","fanatic",",","Jeff","Konkel","and","Roger","Stolle",",","on","a","week-long","road","trip","across","the","state",",","``","m","for","Mississippi","''","explore","the","thriving","underbelly","of","a","die","american","art","form","in","the","land","where","it","begin",".","use","exclusive","interview","and","all-new","musical","performance",",","``","m","for","Mississippi","''","capture","the","proverbial","``","real","deal","''","in","its","home","where","it","be","most","comfortable","and","authentic",".","more","than","just","a","collection","of","concert","performance",",","the","film","collect","the","sound",",","image","and","feel","of","both","the","performer","and","they","native","landscape","-","a","environment","essential","to","they","livelihood","and","inseparable","from","they","art",".","by","showcase","such","a","fascinating","foreign","land","so","close","to","home",",","the","filmmaker","hope","to","inspire","countless","other","to","make","they","own","road","trip","down","Mississippi","'s","blue","highway","in","search","of","the","world","'s","last","truly-delta","blues","man","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Everyone knows the","knows the blues","the blues came","blues came from","came from Mississippi","Here 's an","'s an update","an update :","update : They",": They never","They never left","This documentary takes","documentary takes audiences","takes audiences on","audiences on a","on a wild","a wild ride","wild ride through","ride through the","through the heart","the heart of","heart of Mississippi","of Mississippi 's","Mississippi 's current","'s current blues","current blues scene","blues scene -","scene -

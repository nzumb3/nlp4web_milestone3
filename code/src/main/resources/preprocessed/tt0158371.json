Ray was an irresponsible, free-spending, arrogant, obnoxious, alcohol-abusing, miserable human being, who was also arguably the best guitarist in the world. We follow Ray's life: bouts of getting drunk, his bizzare hobbies of shooting rats and watching passing trains, his dreams of fame and fortune, his strange obsession with the better-known guitarist Django Reinhardt, and of course, playing his beautiful music.","genres":["Comedy"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["A","comed","biopic","focus","on","the","life","of","fiction","jazz","guitarist","Emmett","Ray",".","Ray","was","an","irrespons",",","free-spend",",","arrog",",","obnoxi",",","alcohol-abus",",","miser","human","be",",","who","was","also","arguabl","the","best","guitarist","in","the","world",".","We","follow","Ray","'s","life",":","bout","of","get","drunk",",","his","bizzar","hobbi","of","shoot","rat","and","watch","pass","train",",","his","dream","of","fame","and","fortun",",","his","strang","obsess","with","the","better-known","guitarist","Django","Reinhardt",",","and","of","cours",",","play","his","beauti","music","."],"lemmas":["a","comedic","biopic","focus","on","the","life","of","fictional","jazz","guitarist","Emmett","Ray",".","Ray","be","a","irresponsible",",","free-spending",",","arrogant",",","obnoxious",",","alcohol-abusing",",","miserable","human","being",",","who","be","also","arguably","the","best","guitarist","in","the","world",".","we","follow","Ray","'s","life",":","bout","of","get","drunk",",","he","bizzare","hobby","of","shooting","rat","and","watch","passing","train",",","he","dream","of","fame","and","fortune",",","he","strange","obsession","with","the","better-known","guitarist","Django","Reinhardt",",","and","of","course",",","play","he","beautiful","music","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A comedic biopic","comedic biopic focused","biopic focused on","focused on the","on the life","the life of","life of fictional","of fictional jazz","fictional jazz guitarist","jazz guitarist Emmett","guitarist Emmett Ray","Ray was an","was an irresponsible","an irresponsible ,","irresponsible , free-spending",", free-spending ,","free-spending , arrogant",", arrogant ,","arrogant , obnoxious",", obnoxious ,","obnoxious , alcohol-abusing",", alcohol-abusing ,","alcohol-abusing , miserable",", miserable human","miserable human being","human being ,","being , who",", who was","who was also","was also arguably","also arguably the","arguably the best","the best guitarist","best guitarist in","guitarist in the","in the world","We follow Ray","follow Ray 's","Ray 's life","'s life :","life : bouts",": bouts of","bouts of getting","of getting drunk","getting drunk ,","drunk , his",", his bizzare","his bizzare hobbies","bizzare hobbies of","hobbies of shooting","of shooting rats","shooting rats and","rats and watching","and watching passing","watching passing trains","passing trains ,","trains , his",", his dreams","his dreams of","dreams of fame","of fame and","fame and fortune","and fortune ,","fortune , his",", his strange","his strange obsession","strange obsession with","obsession with the","with the better-known","the better-known guitarist","better-known guitarist Django","guitarist Django Reinhardt","Django Reinhardt ,","Reinhardt , and",", and of","and of course","of course ,","course , playing",", playing his","playing his beautiful","his beautiful music"],"2grams":["A comedic","comedic biopic","biopic focused","focused on","on the","the life","life of","of fictional","fictional jazz","jazz guitarist","guitarist Emmett","Emmett Ray","Ray was","was an","an irresponsible","irresponsible ,",", free-spending","free-spending ,",", arrogant","arrogant ,",", obnoxious","obnoxious ,",", alcohol-abusing","alcohol-abusing ,",", miserable","miserable human","human being","being ,",", who","who was","was also","also arguably","arguably the","the best","best guitarist","guitarist in","in the","the world","We follow","follow Ray","Ray 's","'s life","life :",": bouts","bouts of","of getting","getting drunk","drunk ,",", his","his bizzare","bizzare hobbies","hobbies of","of shooting","shooting rats","rats and","and watching","watching passing","passing trains","trains ,",", his","his dreams","dreams of","of fame","fame and","and fortune","fortune ,",", his","his strange","strange obsession","obsession with","with the","the better-known","better-known guitarist","guitarist Django","Django Reinhardt","Reinhardt ,",", and","and of","of course","course ,",", playing","playing his","his beautiful","beautiful music"]}

{"title":"Go Further","plot":"\"Go Further\", the new film by award-winning documentary filmmaker Ron Mann, explores the idea that the single individual is the key to large-scale transformational change. The film follows actor Woody Harrelson as he takes a small group of friends on a bio-fuelled bus-ride down the Pacific Coast Highway. Their goal? To show the people they encounter that there are viable alternatives to our habitual, environmentally-destructive behaviors. The travellers include a yoga-teacher, a raw food chef, a hemp-activist, a junk-food addict, and a college student who suspends her life to impulsively hop aboard. We see the hostility these pilgrims encounter, and watch as their ideas are challenged from within and without. We meet an entrepreneur who runs a paper company that does not harm trees; an organic farmer who believes Nature is his partner; a man who teaches environmental activists to use humor as a strategic weapon. And throughout, we see Harrelson test his belief that the transformation of our planet begins with the small personal transformations that are within the grasp of each and every one of us, after which... we'll go further.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Go","Further","\"",",","the","new","film","by","award-win","documentari","filmmak","Ron","Mann",",","explor","the","idea","that","the","singl","individu","is","the","key","to","large-scal","transform","chang",".","The","film","follow","actor","Woodi","Harrelson","as","he","take","a","small","group","of","friend","on","a","bio-fuel","bus-rid","down","the","Pacif","Coast","Highway",".","Their","goal","?","To","show","the","peopl","they","encount","that","there","are","viabl","altern","to","our","habitu",",","environmentally-destruct","behavior",".","The","travel","includ","a","yoga-teach",",","a","raw","food","chef",",","a","hemp-activist",",","a","junk-food","addict",",","and","a","colleg","student","who","suspend","her","life","to","impuls","hop","aboard",".","We","see","the","hostil","these","pilgrim","encount",",","and","watch","as","their","idea","are","challeng","from","within","and","without",".","We","meet","an","entrepreneur","who","run","a","paper","compani","that","doe","not","harm","tree",";","an","organ","farmer","who","believ","Natur","is","his","partner",";","a","man","who","teach","environment","activist","to","use","humor","as","a","strateg","weapon",".","And","throughout",",","we","see","Harrelson","test","his","belief","that","the","transform","of","our","planet","begin","with","the","small","person","transform","that","are","within","the","grasp","of","each","and","everi","one","of","us",",","after","which","...","we","ll","go","further","."],"lemmas":["``","go","further","''",",","the","new","film","by","award-winning","documentary","filmmaker","Ron","Mann",",","explore","the","idea","that","the","single","individual","be","the","key","to","large-scale","transformational","change",".","the","film","follow","actor","Woody","Harrelson","as","he","take","a","small","group","of","friend","on","a","bio-fuelled","bus-ride","down","the","Pacific","Coast","Highway",".","they","goal","?","to","show","the","people","they","encounter","that","there","be","viable","alternative","to","we","habitual",",","environmentally-destructive","behavior",".","the","traveller","include","a","yoga-teacher",",","a","raw","food","chef",",","a","hemp-activist",",","a","junk-food","addict",",","and","a","college","student","who","suspend","she","life","to","impulsively","hop","aboard",".","we","see","the","hostility","these","pilgrim","encounter",",","and","watch","as","they","idea","be","challenge","from","within","and","without",".","we","meet","a","entrepreneur","who","run","a","paper","company","that","do","not","harm","tree",";","a","organic","farmer","who","believe","Nature","be","he","partner",";","a","man","who","teach","environmental","activist","to","use","humor","as","a","strategic","weapon",".","and","throughout",",","we","see","Harrelson","test","he","belief","that","the","transformation","of","we","planet","begin","with","the","small","personal","transformation","that","be","within","the","grasp","of","each","and","every","one","of","we",",","after","which","...","we","will","go","further","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["\"

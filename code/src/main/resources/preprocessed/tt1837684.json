{"title":"The Last Chicana","plot":"In the future, the U.S. attempts economic stability by selling states to a now-prosperous Mexico. Liz, a punk rockin' Chicana, must stay in L.A. and become a Mexican citizen or go north and remain American. Everyone around her has an opinion, from 'Mexico is a scary alien culture' to 'You can't change your blood'. Simultaneously, Liz must deal with an ex boyfriend released from prison, street gangs, futuristic weaponry and a car chase through the City of Angels. Ultimately Liz must not only decide where she'll go in the frenzy, but survive long enough to get there.","genres":["Comedy"," Sci-Fi"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","futur",",","the","U.S.","attempt","econom","stabil","by","sell","state","to","a","now-prosper","Mexico",".","Liz",",","a","punk","rockin","'","Chicana",",","must","stay","in","L.A.","and","becom","a","Mexican","citizen","or","go","north","and","remain","American",".","Everyon","around","her","has","an","opinion",",","from","'","Mexico","is","a","scari","alien","cultur","'","to","'","You","ca","n't","chang","your","blood","'",".","Simultan",",","Liz","must","deal","with","an","ex","boyfriend","releas","from","prison",",","street","gang",",","futurist","weaponri","and","a","car","chase","through","the","Citi","of","Angel",".","Ultimat","Liz","must","not","onli","decid","where","she","ll","go","in","the","frenzi",",","but","surviv","long","enough","to","get","there","."],"lemmas":["in","the","future",",","the","U.S.","attempt","economic","stability","by","sell","state","to","a","now-prosperous","Mexico",".","Liz",",","a","punk","rockin","'","Chicana",",","must","stay","in","L.A.","and","become","a","mexican","citizen","or","go","north","and","remain","american",".","everyone","around","she","have","a","opinion",",","from","'","Mexico","be","a","scary","alien","culture","'","to","'","you","can","not","change","you","blood","'",".","simultaneously",",","Liz","must","deal","with","a","ex","boyfriend","release","from","prison",",","street","gang",",","futuristic","weaponry","and","a","car","chase","through","the","City","of","Angels",".","ultimately","Liz","must","not","only","decide","where","she","will","go","in","the","frenzy",",","but","survive","long","enough","to","get","there","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the future","the future ,","future , the",", the U.S.","the U.S. attempts","U.S. attempts economic","attempts economic stability","economic stability by","stability by selling","by selling states","selling states to","states to a","to a now-prosperous","a now-prosperous Mexico","Liz , a",", a punk","a punk rockin","punk rockin '","rockin ' Chicana","' Chicana ,","Chicana , must",", must stay","must stay in","stay in L.A.","in L.A. and","L.A. and become","and become a","become a Mexican","a Mexican citizen","Mexican citizen or","citizen or go","or go north","go north and","north and remain","and remain American","Everyone around her","around her has","her has an","has an opinion","an opinion ,","opinion , from",", from '","from ' Mexico","' Mexico is","Mexico is a","is a scary","a scary alien","scary alien culture","alien culture '","culture ' to","' to '","to ' You","' You ca","You ca n't","ca n't change","n't change your","change your blood","your blood '","Simultaneously , Liz",", Liz must","Liz must deal","must deal with","deal with an","with an ex","an ex boyfriend","ex boyfriend released","boyfriend released from","released from prison","from prison ,","prison , street",", street gangs","street gangs ,","gangs , futuristic",", futuristic weaponry","futuristic weaponry and","weaponry and a","and a car","a car chase","car chase through","chase through the","through the City","the City of","City of Angels","Ultimately Liz must","Liz must not","must not only","not only decide","only decide where","decide where she","where she 'll","she 'll go","'ll go in","go in the","in the frenzy","the frenzy ,","frenzy , but",", but survive","but survive long","survive long enough","long enough to","enough to get","to get there"],"2grams":["In the","the future","future ,",", the","the U.S.","U.S. attempts","attempts economic","economic stability","stability by","by selling","selling states","states to","to a","a now-prosperous","now-prosperous Mexico","Liz ,",", a","a punk","punk rockin","rockin '","' Chicana","Chicana ,",", must","must stay","stay in","in L.A.","L.A. and","and become","become a","a Mexican","Mexican citizen","citizen or","or go","go north","north and","and remain","remain American","Everyone around","around her","her has","has an","an opinion","opinion ,",", from","from '","' Mexico","Mexico is","is a","a scary","scary alien","alien culture","culture '","' to","to '","' You","You ca","ca n't","n't change","change your","your blood","blood '","Simultaneously ,",", Liz","Liz must","must deal","deal with","with an","an ex","ex boyfriend","boyfriend released","released from","from prison","prison ,",", street","street gangs","gangs ,",", futuristic","futuristic weaponry","weaponry and","and a","a car","car chase","chase through","through the","the City","City of","of Angels","Ultimately Liz","Liz must","must not","not only","only decide","decide where","where she","she 'll","'ll go","go in","in the","the frenzy","frenzy ,",", but","but survive","survive long","long enough","enough to","to get","get there"]}

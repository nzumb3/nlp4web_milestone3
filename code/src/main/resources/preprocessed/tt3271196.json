What begins as an attempt to utilize the ever-popular medium of online dating as a means of finding true love turns into a journey of self-discovery.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["Wisconsinit","Bob","Murray","find","himself","in","the","awkward","posit","of","be","a","bachelor","at","34","while","all","of","his","peer","are","settl","down","and","start","famili",".","Wonder","if","it","'s","the","Milwauke","date","scene","or","his","own","neuros","that","have","kept","him","singl",",","he","embark","on","an","ambiti","road","trip","from","Milwauke","to","Los","Angele",",","with","eight","date","schedul","in","eight","differ","citi",",","to","put","his","theori","to","the","test",".","What","begin","as","an","attempt","to","util","the","ever-popular","medium","of","onlin","date","as","a","mean","of","find","true","love","turn","into","a","journey","of","self-discoveri","."],"lemmas":["Wisconsinite","Bob","Murray","find","himself","in","the","awkward","position","of","be","a","bachelor","at","34","while","all","of","he","peer","be","settle","down","and","start","family",".","wonder","if","it","be","the","Milwaukee","date","scene","or","he","own","neurosis","that","have","keep","he","single",",","he","embark","on","a","ambitious","road","trip","from","Milwaukee","to","Los","Angeles",",","with","eight","date","schedule","in","eight","different","city",",","to","put","he","theory","to","the","test",".","what","begin","as","a","attempt","to","utilize","the","ever-popular","medium","of","online","date","as","a","means","of","find","true","love","turn","into","a","journey","of","self-discovery","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Wisconsinite Bob Murray","Bob Murray finds","Murray finds himself","finds himself in","himself in the","in the awkward","the awkward position","awkward position of","position of being","of being a","being a bachelor","a bachelor at","bachelor at 34","at 34 while","34 while all","while all of","all of his","of his peers","his peers are","peers are settling","are settling down","settling down and","down and starting","and starting families","Wondering if it","if it 's","it 's the","'s the Milwaukee","the Milwaukee dating","Milwaukee dating scene","dating scene or","scene or his","or his own","his own neuroses","own neuroses that","neuroses that have","that have kept","have kept him","kept him single","him single ,","single , he",", he embarks","he embarks on","embarks on an","on an ambitious","an ambitious road","ambitious road trip","road trip from","trip from Milwaukee","from Milwaukee to","Milwaukee to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , with",", with eight","with eight dates","eight dates scheduled","dates scheduled in","scheduled in eight","in eight different","eight different cities","different cities ,","cities , to",", to put","to put his","put his theory","his theory to","theory to the","to the test","What begins as","begins as an","as an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to utilize","to utilize the","utilize the ever-popular","the ever-popular medium","ever-popular medium of","medium of online","of online dating","online dating as","dating as a","as a means","a means of","means of finding","of finding true","finding true love","true love turns","love turns into","turns into a","into a journey","a journey of","journey of self-discovery"],"2grams":["Wisconsinite Bob","Bob Murray","Murray finds","finds himself","himself in","in the","the awkward","awkward position","position of","of being","being a","a bachelor","bachelor at","at 34","34 while","while all","all of","of his","his peers","peers are","are settling","settling down","down and","and starting","starting families","Wondering if","if it","it 's","'s the","the Milwaukee","Milwaukee dating","dating scene","scene or","or his","his own","own neuroses","neuroses that","that have","have kept","kept him","him single","single ,",", he","he embarks","embarks on","on an","an ambitious","ambitious road","road trip","trip from","from Milwaukee","Milwaukee to","to Los","Los Angeles","Angeles ,",", with","with eight","eight dates","dates scheduled","scheduled in","in eight","eight different","different cities","cities ,",", to","to put","put his","his theory","theory to","to the","the test","What begins","begins as","as an","an attempt","attempt to","to utilize","utilize the","the ever-popular","ever-popular medium","medium of","of online","online dating","dating as","as a","a means","means of","of finding","finding true","true love","love turns","turns into","into a","a journey","journey of","of self-discovery"]}

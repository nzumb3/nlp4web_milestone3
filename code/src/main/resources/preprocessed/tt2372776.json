{"title":"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction","plot":"Harry Dean Stanton: Partly Fiction is a mesmerizing, impressionistic portrait of the iconic actor comprised of intimate moments, film clips from some of his 250 films and his own heart-breaking renditions of American folk songs. Stunningly lensed in color and b/w by Seamus McGarvey, the film explores the actor's enigmatic outlook on his life, his unexploited talents as a musician, and includes candid scenes with David Lynch, Wim Wenders, Sam Shepard, Kris Kristofferson and Debbie Harry. The fragile soul of an actor emerges from the poignant collage.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Harri","Dean","Stanton",":","Part","Fiction","is","a","mesmer",",","impressionist","portrait","of","the","icon","actor","compris","of","intim","moment",",","film","clip","from","some","of","his","250","film","and","his","own","heart-break","rendit","of","American","folk","song",".","Stun","lens","in","color","and","b/w","by","Seamus","McGarvey",",","the","film","explor","the","actor","'s","enigmat","outlook","on","his","life",",","his","unexploit","talent","as","a","musician",",","and","includ","candid","scene","with","David","Lynch",",","Wim","Wender",",","Sam","Shepard",",","Kris","Kristofferson","and","Debbi","Harri",".","The","fragil","soul","of","an","actor","emerg","from","the","poignant","collag","."],"lemmas":["Harry","Dean","Stanton",":","partly","fiction","be","a","mesmerizing",",","impressionistic","portrait","of","the","iconic","actor","comprise","of","intimate","moment",",","film","clip","from","some","of","he","250","film","and","he","own","heart-breaking","rendition","of","american","folk","song",".","stunningly","lense","in","color","and","b/w","by","Seamus","McGarvey",",","the","film","explore","the","actor","'s","enigmatic","outlook","on","he","life",",","he","unexploited","talent","as","a","musician",",","and","include","candid","scene","with","David","Lynch",",","Wim","Wenders",",","Sam","Shepard",",","Kris","Kristofferson","and","Debbie","Harry",".","the","fragile","soul","of","a","actor","emerge","from","the","poignant","collage","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harry Dean Stanton","Dean Stanton :","Stanton : Partly",": Partly Fiction","Partly Fiction is","Fiction is a","is a mesmerizing","a mesmerizing ,","mesmerizing , impressionistic",", impressionistic portrait","impressionistic portrait of","portrait of the","of the iconic","the iconic actor","iconic actor comprised","actor comprised of","comprised of intimate","of intimate moments","intimate moments ,","moments , film",", film clips","film clips from","clips from some","from some of","some of his","of his 250","his 250 films","250 films and","films and his","and his own","his own heart-breaking","own heart-breaking renditions","heart-breaking renditions of","renditions of American","of American folk","American folk songs","Stunningly lensed in","lensed in color","in color and","color and b/w","and b/w by","b/w by Seamus","by Seamus McGarvey","Seamus McGarvey ,","McGarvey , the",", the film","the film explores","film explores the","explores the actor","the actor 's","actor 's enigmatic","'s enigmatic outlook","enigmatic outlook on","outlook on his","on his life","his life ,","life , his",", his unexploited","his unexploited talents","unexploited talents as","talents as a","as a musician","a musician ,","musician , and",", and includes","and includes candid","includes candid scenes","candid scenes with","scenes with David","with David Lynch","David Lynch ,","Lynch , Wim",", Wim Wenders","Wim Wenders ,","Wenders , Sam",", Sam Shepard","Sam Shepard ,","Shepard , Kris",", Kris Kristofferson","Kris Kristofferson and","Kristofferson and Debbie","and Debbie Harry","The fragile soul","fragile soul of","soul of an","of an actor","an actor emerges","actor emerges from","emerges from the","from the poignant","the poignant collage"],"2grams":["Harry Dean","Dean Stanton","Stanton :",": Partly","Partly Fiction","Fiction is","is a","a mesmerizing","mesmerizing ,",", impressionistic","impressionistic portrait","portrait of","of the","the iconic","iconic actor","actor comprised","comprised of","of intimate","intimate moments","moments ,",", film","film clips","clips from","from some","some of","of his","his 250","250 films","films and","and his","his own","own heart-breaking","heart-breaking renditions","renditions of","of American","American folk","folk songs","Stunningly lensed","lensed in","in color","color and","and b/w","b/w by","by Seamus","Seamus McGarvey","McGarvey ,",", the","the film","film explores","explores the","the actor","actor 's","'s enigmatic","enigmatic outlook","outlook on","on his","his life","life ,",", his","his unexploited","unexploited talents","talents as","as a","a musician","musician ,",", and","and includes","includes candid","candid scenes","scenes with","with David","David Lynch","Lynch ,",", Wim","Wim Wenders","Wenders ,",", Sam","Sam Shepard","Shepard ,",", Kris","Kris Kristofferson","Kristofferson and","and Debbie","Debbie Harry","The fragile","fragile soul","soul of","of an","an actor","actor emerges","emerges from","from the","the poignant","poignant collage"]}

{"title":"Saturn's Embrace","plot":"A mind-bending exploration of Saturn and its moons - and the possibility of life in the salt-water mists of one moon, Enceladus. Dr. Carolyn Porco leads NASA's digital imaging team on the Cassini mission, which has been exploring Saturn since 2004. Dr. Porco and her team have brought back breath-taking photographs, which transport us across Saturn's great luminous rings and onto the surface of its strange, extreme and wondrous moons.","genres":["Adventure"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","mind-bend","explor","of","Saturn","and","it","moon","-","and","the","possibl","of","life","in","the","salt-wat","mist","of","one","moon",",","Enceladus",".","Dr.","Carolyn","Porco","lead","NASA","'s","digit","imag","team","on","the","Cassini","mission",",","which","has","been","explor","Saturn","sinc","2004",".","Dr.","Porco","and","her","team","have","brought","back","breath-tak","photograph",",","which","transport","us","across","Saturn","'s","great","lumin","ring","and","onto","the","surfac","of","it","strang",",","extrem","and","wondrous","moon","."],"lemmas":["a","mind-bending","exploration","of","Saturn","and","its","moon","-","and","the","possibility","of","life","in","the","salt-water","mist","of","one","moon",",","Enceladus",".","Dr.","Carolyn","Porco","lead","NASA","'s","digital","imaging","team","on","the","Cassini","mission",",","which","have","be","explore","Saturn","since","2004",".","Dr.","Porco","and","she","team","have","bring","back","breath-taking","photograph",",","which","transport","we","across","Saturn","'s","great","luminous","ring","and","onto","the","surface","of","its","strange",",","extreme","and","wondrous","moon","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A mind-bending exploration","mind-bending exploration of","exploration of Saturn","of Saturn and","Saturn and its","and its moons","its moons -","moons - and","- and the","and the possibility","the possibility of","possibility of life","of life in","life in the","in the salt-water","the salt-water mists","salt-water mists of","mists of one","of one moon","one moon ,","moon , Enceladus","Dr. Carolyn Porco","Carolyn Porco leads","Porco leads NASA","leads NASA 's","NASA 's digital","'s digital imaging","digital imaging team","imaging team on","team on the","on the Cassini","the Cassini mission","Cassini mission ,","mission , which",", which has","which has been","has been exploring","been exploring Saturn","exploring Saturn since","Saturn since 2004","Dr. Porco and","Porco and her","and her team","her team have","team have brought","have brought back","brought back breath-taking","back breath-taking photographs","breath-taking photographs ,","photographs , which",", which transport","which transport us","transport us across","us across Saturn","across Saturn 's","Saturn 's great","'s great luminous","great luminous rings","luminous rings and","rings and onto","and onto the","onto the surface","the surface of","surface of its","of its strange","its strange ,","strange , extreme",", extreme and","extreme and wondrous","and wondrous moons"],"2grams":["A mind-bending","mind-bending exploration","exploration of","of Saturn","Saturn and","and its","its moons","moons -","- and","and the","the possibility","possibility of","of life","life in","in the","the salt-water","salt-water mists","mists of","of one","one moon","moon ,",", Enceladus","Dr. Carolyn","Carolyn Porco","Porco leads","leads NASA","NASA 's","'s digital","digital imaging","imaging team","team on","on the","the Cassini","Cassini mission","mission ,",", which","which has","has been","been exploring","exploring Saturn","Saturn since","since 2004","Dr. Porco","Porco and","and her","her team","team have","have brought","brought back","back breath-taking","breath-taking photographs","photographs ,",", which","which transport","transport us","us across","across Saturn","Saturn 's","'s great","great luminous","luminous rings","rings and","and onto","onto the","the surface","surface of","of its","its strange","strange ,",", extreme","extreme and","and wondrous","wondrous moons"]}

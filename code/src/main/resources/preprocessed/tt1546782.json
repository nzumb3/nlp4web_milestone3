{"title":"Breaking News: The Collision of Journalism and Consumerism in a Democracy","plot":"In 2004, hundreds of thousands of Ukrainian citizens protested the outcome of their presidential elections. In the dead of winter, people lined the streets in protest. Universities shut down; opening their doors instead to political debate. After nearly six weeks of social unrest, the election results were overturned and Victor Yushchenko was ushered in promising a free press, capitalistic reforms and \"democracy\". Comparing Ukraine to the U.S., media experts around the world explore how the concepts of a free press work in concert and contrast with the consumerism in modern democracies - forcing the audience, regardless of nationality, to ask the difficulty questions: What is a free press? What is a democracy? And what, if anything, does one have to do with the other?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","2004",",","hundr","of","thousand","of","Ukrainian","citizen","protest","the","outcom","of","their","presidenti","elect",".","In","the","dead","of","winter",",","peopl","line","the","street","in","protest",".","Univers","shut","down",";","open","their","door","instead","to","polit","debat",".","After","near","six","week","of","social","unrest",",","the","elect","result","were","overturn","and","Victor","Yushchenko","was","usher","in","promis","a","free","press",",","capitalist","reform","and","\"","democraci","\"",".","Compar","Ukrain","to","the","U.S.",",","media","expert","around","the","world","explor","how","the","concept","of","a","free","press","work","in","concert","and","contrast","with","the","consumer","in","modern","democraci","-","forc","the","audienc",",","regardless","of","nation",",","to","ask","the","difficulti","question",":","What","is","a","free","press","?","What","is","a","democraci","?","And","what",",","if","anyth",",","doe","one","have","to","do","with","the","other","?"],"lemmas":["in","2004",",","hundred","of","thousand","of","ukrainian","citizen","protest","the","outcome","of","they","presidential","election",".","in","the","dead","of","winter",",","people","line","the","street","in","protest",".","university","shut","down",";","open","they","door","instead","to","political","debate",".","after","nearly","six","week","of","social","unrest",",","the","election","result","be","overturn","and","Victor","Yushchenko","be","usher","in","promise","a","free","press",",","capitalistic","reform","and","``","democracy","''",".","compare","Ukraine","to","the","U.S.",",","media","expert","around","the","world","explore","how","the","concept","of","a","free","press","work","in","concert","and","contrast","with","the","consumerism","in","modern","democracy","-","force","the","audience",",","regardless","of","nationality",",","to","ask","the","difficulty","question",":","what","be","a","free","press","?","what","be","a","democracy","?","and","what",",","if","anything",",","do","one","have","to","do","with","the","other","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 2004 ,","2004 , hundreds",", hundreds of","hundreds of thousands","of thousands of","thousands of Ukrainian","of Ukrainian citizens","Ukrainian citizens protested","citizens protested the","protested the outcome","the outcome of","outcome of their","of their presidential","their presidential elections","In the dead","the dead of","dead of winter","of winter ,","winter , people",", people lined","people lined the","lined the streets","the streets in","streets in protest","Universities shut down","shut down ;","down ;

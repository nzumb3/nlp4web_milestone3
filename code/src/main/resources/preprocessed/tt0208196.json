{"title":"Happy Accidents","plot":"Ruby Weaver has man trouble: she tries to fix them, so she's stuck herself with a string of losers. Her current lover, Sam Deed, seems different: he's sweet, tender, just in from Dubuque. But, as Ruby tells her therapist about Sam, in flashbacks we see someone not quite of this world. In fact, Sam informs Ruby that he's from the future, 2470 to be exact. Ruby's sure he's delusional, but most of the time she wants to keep him - and maybe fix him. Although he seems sane, maybe Sam hasn't told her the real story: what's he up to, and who is Chrystie Delancey?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Rubi","Weaver","has","man","troubl",":","she","tri","to","fix","them",",","so","she","'s","stuck","herself","with","a","string","of","loser",".","Her","current","lover",",","Sam","Deed",",","seem","differ",":","he","'s","sweet",",","tender",",","just","in","from","Dubuqu",".","But",",","as","Rubi","tell","her","therapist","about","Sam",",","in","flashback","we","see","someon","not","quit","of","this","world",".","In","fact",",","Sam","inform","Rubi","that","he","'s","from","the","futur",",","2470","to","be","exact",".","Rubi","'s","sure","he","'s","delusion",",","but","most","of","the","time","she","want","to","keep","him","-","and","mayb","fix","him",".","Although","he","seem","sane",",","mayb","Sam","has","n't","told","her","the","real","stori",":","what","'s","he","up","to",",","and","who","is","Chrysti","Delancey","?"],"lemmas":["Ruby","Weaver","have","man","trouble",":","she","try","to","fix","they",",","so","she","be","stick","herself","with","a","string","of","loser",".","she","current","lover",",","Sam","Deed",",","seem","different",":","he","be","sweet",",","tender",",","just","in","from","Dubuque",".","but",",","as","Ruby","tell","she","therapist","about","Sam",",","in","flashback","we","see","someone","not","quite","of","this","world",".","in","fact",",","Sam","inform","Ruby","that","he","be","from","the","future",",","2470","to","be","exact",".","Ruby","'s","sure","he","be","delusional",",","but","most","of","the","time","she","want","to","keep","he","-","and","maybe","fix","he",".","although","he","seem","sane",",","maybe","Sam","have","not","tell","she","the","real","story",":","what","be","he","up","to",",","and","who","be","Chrystie","Delancey","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ruby Weaver has","Weaver has man","has man trouble","man trouble :","trouble : she",": she tries","she tries to","tries to fix","to fix them","fix them ,","them , so",", so she","so she 's","she 's stuck","'s stuck herself","stuck herself with","herself with a","with a string","a string of","string of losers","Her current lover","current lover ,","lover , Sam",", Sam Deed","Sam Deed ,","Deed , seems",", seems different","seems different :","different : he",": he 's","he 's sweet","'s sweet ,","sweet , tender",", tender ,","tender , just",", just in","just in from","in from Dubuque","But , as",", as Ruby","as Ruby tells","Ruby tells her","tells her therapist","her therapist about","therapist about Sam","about Sam ,","Sam , in",", in flashbacks","in flashbacks we","flashbacks we see","we see someone","see someone not","someone not quite","not quite of","quite of this","of this world","In fact ,","fact , Sam",", Sam informs","Sam informs Ruby","informs Ruby that","Ruby that he","that he 's","he 's from","'s from the","from the future","the future ,","future , 2470",", 2470 to","2470 to be","to be exact","Ruby 's sure","'s sure he","sure he 's","he 's delusional","'s delusional ,","delusional , but",", but most","but most of","most of the","of the time","the time she","time she wants","she wants to","wants to keep","to keep him","keep him -","him -

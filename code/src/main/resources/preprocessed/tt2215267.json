{"title":"Little Thirteen","plot":"Sarah is 13. She and her best friend Charly (16) have already lost count of the men they have been to bed with: one night stands, nameless, and interchangeable - no commitments. Then Sarah meets 18-year-old Lukas in a chat room, and for the first time in her life she longs for a real relationship, for true love even. But is Lukas really interested in her? Or is he just using Sarah for a reason that lies far beyond love and affection? Meanwhile, Charly has to find a father for her unborn child, and Sarah's mother has to cope with the fact that she's not a teenager anymore... Three days in the lives of a group of teenagers struggling to grow up and to find their places in life.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Sarah","is","13",".","She","and","her","best","friend","Char","(","16",")","have","alreadi","lost","count","of","the","men","they","have","been","to","bed","with",":","one","night","stand",",","nameless",",","and","interchang","-","no","commit",".","Then","Sarah","meet","18-year-old","Luka","in","a","chat","room",",","and","for","the","first","time","in","her","life","she","long","for","a","real","relationship",",","for","true","love","even",".","But","is","Luka","realli","interest","in","her","?","Or","is","he","just","use","Sarah","for","a","reason","that","lie","far","beyond","love","and","affect","?","Meanwhil",",","Char","has","to","find","a","father","for","her","unborn","child",",","and","Sarah","'s","mother","has","to","cope","with","the","fact","that","she","'s","not","a","teenag","anymor","...","Three","day","in","the","live","of","a","group","of","teenag","struggl","to","grow","up","and","to","find","their","place","in","life","."],"lemmas":["Sarah","be","13",".","she","and","she","best","friend","Charly","-lrb-","16","-rrb-","have","already","lose","count","of","the","man","they","have","be","to","bed","with",":","one","night","stand",",","nameless",",","and","interchangeable","-","no","commitment",".","then","Sarah","meet","18-year-old","Lukas","in","a","chat","room",",","and","for","the","first","time","in","she","life","she","long","for","a","real","relationship",",","for","true","love","even",".","but","be","Lukas","really","interested","in","she","?","or","be","he","just","use","Sarah","for","a","reason","that","lie","far","beyond","love","and","affection","?","meanwhile",",","Charly","have","to","find","a","father","for","she","unborn","child",",","and","Sarah","'s","mother","have","to","cope","with","the","fact","that","she","be","not","a","teenager","anymore","...","three","day","in","the","life","of","a","group","of","teenager","struggle","to","grow","up","and","to","find","they","place","in","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sarah is 13","She and her","and her best","her best friend","best friend Charly","friend Charly (","Charly ( 16","( 16 )","16 ) have",") have already","have already lost","already lost count","lost count of","count of the","of the men","the men they","men they have","they have been","have been to","been to bed","to bed with","bed with :","with : one",": one night","one night stands","night stands ,","stands , nameless",", nameless ,","nameless , and",", and interchangeable","and interchangeable -","interchangeable - no","- no commitments","Then Sarah meets","Sarah meets 18-year-old","meets 18-year-old Lukas","18-year-old Lukas in","Lukas in a","in a chat","a chat room","chat room ,","room , and",", and for","and for the","for the first","the first time","first time in","time in her","in her life","her life she","life she longs","she longs for","longs for a","for a real","a real relationship","real relationship ,","relationship , for",", for true","for true love","true love even","But is Lukas","is Lukas really","Lukas really interested","really interested in","interested in her","Or is he","is he just","he just using","just using Sarah","using Sarah for","Sarah for a","for a reason","a reason that","reason that lies","that lies far","lies far beyond","far beyond love","beyond love and","love and affection","Meanwhile , Charly",", Charly has","Charly has to","has to find","to find a","find a father","a father for","father for her","for her unborn","her unborn child","unborn child ,","child , and",", and Sarah","and Sarah 's","Sarah 's mother","'s mother has","mother has to","has to cope","to cope with","cope with the","with the fact","the fact that","fact that she","that she 's","she 's not","'s not a","not a teenager","a teenager anymore","teenager anymore ...","anymore ...

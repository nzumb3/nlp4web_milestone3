{"title":"Identity Theft","plot":"When a drug deal turns into a bloodbath, a junkie-gangster crosses paths with an illegal alien. The illegal alien ends up with the gangster's ID and uses it to create a new successful life as a US citizen. A near death experience causes the gangster to re-evaluate his life, and when he leaves prison three years later, he is clean, sober, and ready to put his life back together. But both men are haunted by their pasts and they are soon set on a collision course that may destroy them and the women they love.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["When","a","drug","deal","turn","into","a","bloodbath",",","a","junkie-gangst","cross","path","with","an","illeg","alien",".","The","illeg","alien","end","up","with","the","gangster","'s","ID","and","use","it","to","creat","a","new","success","life","as","a","US","citizen",".","A","near","death","experi","caus","the","gangster","to","re-evalu","his","life",",","and","when","he","leav","prison","three","year","later",",","he","is","clean",",","sober",",","and","readi","to","put","his","life","back","togeth",".","But","both","men","are","haunt","by","their","past","and","they","are","soon","set","on","a","collis","cours","that","may","destroy","them","and","the","women","they","love","."],"lemmas":["when","a","drug","deal","turn","into","a","bloodbath",",","a","junkie-gangster","cross","path","with","a","illegal","alien",".","the","illegal","alien","end","up","with","the","gangster","'s","id","and","use","it","to","create","a","new","successful","life","as","a","US","citizen",".","a","near","death","experience","cause","the","gangster","to","re-evaluate","he","life",",","and","when","he","leave","prison","three","year","later",",","he","be","clean",",","sober",",","and","ready","to","put","he","life","back","together",".","but","both","man","be","haunt","by","they","past","and","they","be","soon","set","on","a","collision","course","that","may","destroy","they","and","the","woman","they","love","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["When a drug","a drug deal","drug deal turns","deal turns into","turns into a","into a bloodbath","a bloodbath ,","bloodbath , a",", a junkie-gangster","a junkie-gangster crosses","junkie-gangster crosses paths","crosses paths with","paths with an","with an illegal","an illegal alien","The illegal alien","illegal alien ends","alien ends up","ends up with","up with the","with the gangster","the gangster 's","gangster 's ID","'s ID and","ID and uses","and uses it","uses it to","it to create","to create a","create a new","a new successful","new successful life","successful life as","life as a","as a US","a US citizen","A near death","near death experience","death experience causes","experience causes the","causes the gangster","the gangster to","gangster to re-evaluate","to re-evaluate his","re-evaluate his life","his life ,","life , and",", and when","and when he","when he leaves","he leaves prison","leaves prison three","prison three years","three years later","years later ,","later , he",", he is","he is clean","is clean ,","clean , sober",", sober ,","sober , and",", and ready","and ready to","ready to put","to put his","put his life","his life back","life back together","But both men","both men are","men are haunted","are haunted by","haunted by their","by their pasts","their pasts and","pasts and they","and they are","they are soon","are soon set","soon set on","set on a","on a collision","a collision course","collision course that","course that may","that may destroy","may destroy them","destroy them and","them and the","and the women","the women they","women they love"],"2grams":["When a","a drug","drug deal","deal turns","turns into","into a","a bloodbath","bloodbath ,",", a","a junkie-gangster","junkie-gangster crosses","crosses paths","paths with","with an","an illegal","illegal alien","The illegal","illegal alien","alien ends","ends up","up with","with the","the gangster","gangster 's","'s ID","ID and","and uses","uses it","it to","to create","create a","a new","new successful","successful life","life as","as a","a US","US citizen","A near","near death","death experience","experience causes","causes the","the gangster","gangster to","to re-evaluate","re-evaluate his","his life","life ,",", and","and when","when he","he leaves","leaves prison","prison three","three years","years later","later ,",", he","he is","is clean","clean ,",", sober","sober ,",", and","and ready","ready to","to put","put his","his life","life back","back together","But both","both men","men are","are haunted","haunted by","by their","their pasts","pasts and","and they","they are","are soon","soon set","set on","on a","a collision","collision course","course that","that may","may destroy","destroy them","them and","and the","the women","women they","they love"]}

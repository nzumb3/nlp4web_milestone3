{"title":"Amélie","plot":"Amélie is a story about a girl named Amélie whose childhood was suppressed by her Father's mistaken concerns of a heart defect. With these concerns Amélie gets hardly any real life contact with other people. This leads Amélie to resort to her own fantastical world and dreams of love and beauty. She later on becomes a young woman and moves to the central part of Paris as a waitress. After finding a lost treasure belonging to the former occupant of her apartment, she decides to return it to him. After seeing his reaction and his new found perspective - she decides to devote her life to the people around her. Such as, her father who is obsessed with his garden-gnome, a failed writer, a hypochondriac, a man who stalks his ex girlfriends, the \"ghost\", a suppressed young soul, the love of her life and a man whose bones are as brittle as glass. But after consuming herself with these escapades - she finds out that she is disregarding her own life and damaging her quest for love. Amélie then discovers she must become more aggressive and take a hold of her life and capture the beauty of love she has always dreamed of.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Amélie","is","a","stori","about","a","girl","name","Amélie","whose","childhood","was","suppress","by","her","Father","'s","mistaken","concern","of","a","heart","defect",".","With","these","concern","Amélie","get","hard","ani","real","life","contact","with","other","peopl",".","This","lead","Amélie","to","resort","to","her","own","fantast","world","and","dream","of","love","and","beauti",".","She","later","on","becom","a","young","woman","and","move","to","the","central","part","of","Pari","as","a","waitress",".","After","find","a","lost","treasur","belong","to","the","former","occup","of","her","apart",",","she","decid","to","return","it","to","him",".","After","see","his","reaction","and","his","new","found","perspect","-","she","decid","to","devot","her","life","to","the","peopl","around","her",".","Such","as",",","her","father","who","is","obsess","with","his","garden-gnom",",","a","fail","writer",",","a","hypochondriac",",","a","man","who","stalk","his","ex","girlfriend",",","the","\"","ghost","\"",",","a","suppress","young","soul",",","the","love","of","her","life","and","a","man","whose","bone","are","as","brittl","as","glass",".","But","after","consum","herself","with","these","escapad","-","she","find","out","that","she","is","disregard","her","own","life","and","damag","her","quest","for","love",".","Amélie","then","discov","she","must","becom","more","aggress","and","take","a","hold","of","her","life","and","captur","the","beauti","of","love","she","has","alway","dream","of","."],"lemmas":["Amélie","be","a","story","about","a","girl","name","Amélie","whose","childhood","be","suppress","by","she","Father","'s","mistaken","concern","of","a","heart","defect",".","with","these","concern","Amélie","get","hardly","any","real","life","contact","with","other","people",".","this","lead","Amélie","to","resort","to","she","own","fantastical","world","and","dream","of","love","and","beauty",".","she","later","on","become","a","young","woman","and","move","to","the","central","part","of","Paris","as","a","waitress",".","after","find","a","lose","treasure","belong","to","the","former","occupant","of","she","apartment",",","she","decide","to","return","it","to","he",".","after","see","he","reaction","and","he","new","find","perspective","-","she","decide","to","devote","she","life","to","the","people","around","she",".","such","as",",","she","father","who","be","obsess","with","he","garden-gnome",",","a","fail","writer",",","a","hypochondriac",",","a","man","who","stalk","he","ex","girlfriend",",","the","``","ghost","''",",","a","suppress","young","soul",",","the","love","of","she","life","and","a","man","whose","bone","be","as","brittle","as","glass",".","but","after","consume","herself","with","these","escapade","-","she","find","out","that","she","be","disregard","she","own","life","and","damage","she","quest","for","love",".","Amélie","then","discover","she","must","become","more","aggressive","and","take","a","hold","of","she","life","and","capture","the","beauty","of","love","she","have","always","dream","of","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Amélie is a","is a story","a story about","story about a","about a girl","a girl named","girl named Amélie","named Amélie whose","Amélie whose childhood","whose childhood was","childhood was suppressed","was suppressed by","suppressed by her","by her Father","her Father 's","Father 's mistaken","'s mistaken concerns","mistaken concerns of","concerns of a","of a heart","a heart defect","With these concerns","these concerns Amélie","concerns Amélie gets","Amélie gets hardly","gets hardly any","hardly any real","any real life","real life contact","life contact with","contact with other","with other people","This leads Amélie","leads Amélie to","Amélie to resort","to resort to","resort to her","to her own","her own fantastical","own fantastical world","fantastical world and","world and dreams","and dreams of","dreams of love","of love and","love and beauty","She later on","later on becomes","on becomes a","becomes a young","a young woman","young woman and","woman and moves","and moves to","moves to the","to the central","the central part","central part of","part of Paris","of Paris as","Paris as a","as a waitress","After finding a","finding a lost","a lost treasure","lost treasure belonging","treasure belonging to","belonging to the","to the former","the former occupant","former occupant of","occupant of her","of her apartment","her apartment ,","apartment , she",", she decides","she decides to","decides to return","to return it","return it to","it to him","After seeing his","seeing his reaction","his reaction and","reaction and his","and his new","his new found","new found perspective","found perspective -","perspective -

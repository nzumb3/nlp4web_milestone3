{"title":"Words","plot":"WORDS follows an eclectic group of sixteen American teenagers, ages 15-22, as they travel from New Mexico to northern India. They are participants of the Sustainable Global Leadership Alliance. It is a challenging experience, traveling in a third-world country while dealing with the demanding curriculum and the group dynamics. Myra, the program leader, traveled to India at fourteen and now returns each summer, enabling others to share her profound early experience. Seventeen-year old Neesha grapples with the filth and poverty of India's surroundings. Adopted from Calcutta at birth , she has returned to her native country for the first time. She realizes, '...this could have been me...'. The young seekers navigate both a new world and their encounters with each other- far from home.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["WORDS","follow","an","eclect","group","of","sixteen","American","teenag",",","age","15-22",",","as","they","travel","from","New","Mexico","to","northern","India",".","They","are","particip","of","the","Sustain","Global","Leadership","Allianc",".","It","is","a","challeng","experi",",","travel","in","a","third-world","countri","while","deal","with","the","demand","curriculum","and","the","group","dynam",".","Myra",",","the","program","leader",",","travel","to","India","at","fourteen","and","now","return","each","summer",",","enabl","other","to","share","her","profound","earli","experi",".","Seventeen-year","old","Neesha","grappl","with","the","filth","and","poverti","of","India","'s","surround",".","Adopt","from","Calcutta","at","birth",",","she","has","return","to","her","nativ","countri","for","the","first","time",".","She","realiz",",","'","...","this","could","have","been","me","...","'",".","The","young","seeker","navig","both","a","new","world","and","their","encount","with","each","other","-","far","from","home","."],"lemmas":["word","follow","a","eclectic","group","of","sixteen","american","teenager",",","age","15-22",",","as","they","travel","from","New","Mexico","to","northern","India",".","they","be","participant","of","the","Sustainable","Global","Leadership","Alliance",".","it","be","a","challenging","experience",",","travel","in","a","third-world","country","while","deal","with","the","demand","curriculum","and","the","group","dynamics",".","Myra",",","the","program","leader",",","travel","to","India","at","fourteen","and","now","return","each","summer",",","enable","other","to","share","she","profound","early","experience",".","seventeen-year","old","Neesha","grapple","with","the","filth","and","poverty","of","India","'s","surroundings",".","adopt","from","Calcutta","at","birth",",","she","have","return","to","she","native","country","for","the","first","time",".","she","realize",",","'","...","this","could","have","be","I","...","'",".","the","young","seeker","navigate","both","a","new","world","and","they","encounter","with","each","other","-","far","from","home","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["WORDS follows an","follows an eclectic","an eclectic group","eclectic group of","group of sixteen","of sixteen American","sixteen American teenagers","American teenagers ,","teenagers , ages",", ages 15-22","ages 15-22 ,","15-22 , as",", as they","as they travel","they travel from","travel from New","from New Mexico","New Mexico to","Mexico to northern","to northern India","They are participants","are participants of","participants of the","of the Sustainable","the Sustainable Global","Sustainable Global Leadership","Global Leadership Alliance","It is a","is a challenging","a challenging experience","challenging experience ,","experience , traveling",", traveling in","traveling in a","in a third-world","a third-world country","third-world country while","country while dealing","while dealing with","dealing with the","with the demanding","the demanding curriculum","demanding curriculum and","curriculum and the","and the group","the group dynamics","Myra , the",", the program","the program leader","program leader ,","leader , traveled",", traveled to","traveled to India","to India at","India at fourteen","at fourteen and","fourteen and now","and now returns","now returns each","returns each summer","each summer ,","summer , enabling",", enabling others","enabling others to","others to share","to share her","share her profound","her profound early","profound early experience","Seventeen-year old Neesha","old Neesha grapples","Neesha grapples with","grapples with the","with the filth","the filth and","filth and poverty","and poverty of","poverty of India","of India 's","India 's surroundings","Adopted from Calcutta","from Calcutta at","Calcutta at birth","at birth ,","birth , she",", she has","she has returned","has returned to","returned to her","to her native","her native country","native country for","country for the","for the first","the first time","She realizes ,","realizes , '",", ' ...","' ... this","... this could","this could have","could have been","have been me","been me ...","me ...

{"title":"Selfless","plot":"A chance encounter with a random stranger sets in motion a series of events that lead to the total collapse of Dylan Gray, a young career-driven architect with the world in the palm of his hand. His green-based architecture firm has just landed its first commission to design a major skyscraper in Seattle. Before the project can begin, Dylan's life becomes skillfully unraveled by a spiteful identity thief who sets out to destroy his world. As everything he has worked for collapses around him, Dylan's own sense of self begins to collapse with it. Now Dylan may be forced to do the unthinkable to reclaim his identity - discover himself.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["A","chanc","encount","with","a","random","stranger","set","in","motion","a","seri","of","event","that","lead","to","the","total","collaps","of","Dylan","Gray",",","a","young","career-driven","architect","with","the","world","in","the","palm","of","his","hand",".","His","green-bas","architectur","firm","has","just","land","it","first","commiss","to","design","a","major","skyscrap","in","Seattl",".","Befor","the","project","can","begin",",","Dylan","'s","life","becom","skill","unravel","by","a","spite","ident","thief","who","set","out","to","destroy","his","world",".","As","everyth","he","has","work","for","collaps","around","him",",","Dylan","'s","own","sens","of","self","begin","to","collaps","with","it",".","Now","Dylan","may","be","forc","to","do","the","unthink","to","reclaim","his","ident","-","discov","himself","."],"lemmas":["a","chance","encounter","with","a","random","stranger","set","in","motion","a","series","of","event","that","lead","to","the","total","collapse","of","Dylan","Gray",",","a","young","career-driven","architect","with","the","world","in","the","palm","of","he","hand",".","he","green-based","architecture","firm","have","just","land","its","first","commission","to","design","a","major","skyscraper","in","Seattle",".","before","the","project","can","begin",",","Dylan","'s","life","become","skillfully","unravel","by","a","spiteful","identity","thief","who","set","out","to","destroy","he","world",".","as","everything","he","have","work","for","collapse","around","he",",","Dylan","'s","own","sense","of","self","begin","to","collapse","with","it",".","now","Dylan","may","be","force","to","do","the","unthinkable","to","reclaim","he","identity","-","discover","himself","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A chance encounter","chance encounter with","encounter with a","with a random","a random stranger","random stranger sets","stranger sets in","sets in motion","in motion a","motion a series","a series of","series of events","of events that","events that lead","that lead to","lead to the","to the total","the total collapse","total collapse of","collapse of Dylan","of Dylan Gray","Dylan Gray ,","Gray , a",", a young","a young career-driven","young career-driven architect","career-driven architect with","architect with the","with the world","the world in","world in the","in the palm","the palm of","palm of his","of his hand","His green-based architecture","green-based architecture firm","architecture firm has","firm has just","has just landed","just landed its","landed its first","its first commission","first commission to","commission to design","to design a","design a major","a major skyscraper","major skyscraper in","skyscraper in Seattle","Before the project","the project can","project can begin","can begin ,","begin , Dylan",", Dylan 's","Dylan 's life","'s life becomes","life becomes skillfully","becomes skillfully unraveled","skillfully unraveled by","unraveled by a","by a spiteful","a spiteful identity","spiteful identity thief","identity thief who","thief who sets","who sets out","sets out to","out to destroy","to destroy his","destroy his world","As everything he","everything he has","he has worked","has worked for","worked for collapses","for collapses around","collapses around him","around him ,","him , Dylan",", Dylan 's","Dylan 's own","'s own sense","own sense of","sense of self","of self begins","self begins to","begins to collapse","to collapse with","collapse with it","Now Dylan may","Dylan may be","may be forced","be forced to","forced to do","to do the","do the unthinkable","the unthinkable to","unthinkable to reclaim","to reclaim his","reclaim his identity","his identity -","identity -

{"title":"Mundo Salamone. La reinvenci√≥n de la Pampa","plot":"This film unveils the enigmatic story of Francisco Salamone, an architect-ingeneer who built more than 70 astonishing buildings (mostly town halls, cemeteries and slaughterhouses) between 1936 and 1940 at the Buenos Aires province during the administration of a pro-fascist governor. Academics, artists and common people we can call \"salamonics\" tell us the facts and theories they could get from the silence around these enigmatic art-deco towers. The testimony of Francisco's daughters, an exquisite music and a passionate research keep us hooked to this architectural quest.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["This","film","unveil","the","enigmat","stori","of","Francisco","Salamon",",","an","architect-ingen","who","built","more","than","70","astonish","build","(","most","town","hall",",","cemeteri","and","slaughterhous",")","between","1936","and","1940","at","the","Bueno","Aire","provinc","dure","the","administr","of","a","pro-fascist","governor",".","Academ",",","artist","and","common","peopl","we","can","call","\"","salamon","\"","tell","us","the","fact","and","theori","they","could","get","from","the","silenc","around","these","enigmat","art-deco","tower",".","The","testimoni","of","Francisco","'s","daughter",",","an","exquisit","music","and","a","passion","research","keep","us","hook","to","this","architectur","quest","."],"lemmas":["this","film","unveil","the","enigmatic","story","of","Francisco","Salamone",",","a","architect-ingeneer","who","build","more","than","70","astonishing","building","-lrb-","mostly","town","hall",",","cemetery","and","slaughterhouse","-rrb-","between","1936","and","1940","at","the","Buenos","Aires","province","during","the","administration","of","a","pro-fascist","governor",".","academic",",","artist","and","common","people","we","can","call","``","salamonic","''","tell","we","the","fact","and","theory","they","could","get","from","the","silence","around","these","enigmatic","art-deco","tower",".","the","testimony","of","Francisco","'s","daughter",",","a","exquisite","music","and","a","passionate","research","keep","we","hook","to","this","architectural","quest","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film unveils","film unveils the","unveils the enigmatic","the enigmatic story","enigmatic story of","story of Francisco","of Francisco Salamone","Francisco Salamone ,","Salamone , an",", an architect-ingeneer","an architect-ingeneer who","architect-ingeneer who built","who built more","built more than","more than 70","than 70 astonishing","70 astonishing buildings","astonishing buildings (","buildings ( mostly","( mostly town","mostly town halls","town halls ,","halls , cemeteries",", cemeteries and","cemeteries and slaughterhouses","and slaughterhouses )","slaughterhouses ) between",") between 1936","between 1936 and","1936 and 1940","and 1940 at","1940 at the","at the Buenos","the Buenos Aires","Buenos Aires province","Aires province during","province during the","during the administration","the administration of","administration of a","of a pro-fascist","a pro-fascist governor","Academics , artists",", artists and","artists and common","and common people","common people we","people we can","we can call","can call \"","call \" salamonics","\" salamonics \"","salamonics \" tell","\" tell us","tell us the","us the facts","the facts and","facts and theories","and theories they","theories they could","they could get","could get from","get from the","from the silence","the silence around","silence around these","around these enigmatic","these enigmatic art-deco","enigmatic art-deco towers","The testimony of","testimony of Francisco","of Francisco 's","Francisco 's daughters","'s daughters ,","daughters , an",", an exquisite","an exquisite music","exquisite music and","music and a","and a passionate","a passionate research","passionate research keep","research keep us","keep us hooked","us hooked to","hooked to this","to this architectural","this architectural quest"],"2grams":["This film","film unveils","unveils the","the enigmatic","enigmatic story","story of","of Francisco","Francisco Salamone","Salamone ,",", an","an architect-ingeneer","architect-ingeneer who","who built","built more","more than","than 70","70 astonishing","astonishing buildings","buildings (","( mostly","mostly town","town halls","halls ,",", cemeteries","cemeteries and","and slaughterhouses","slaughterhouses )",") between","between 1936","1936 and","and 1940","1940 at","at the","the Buenos","Buenos Aires","Aires province","province during","during the","the administration","administration of","of a","a pro-fascist","pro-fascist governor","Academics ,",", artists","artists and","and common","common people","people we","we can","can call","call \"","\" salamonics","salamonics \"","\" tell","tell us","us the","the facts","facts and","and theories","theories they","they could","could get","get from","from the","the silence","silence around","around these","these enigmatic","enigmatic art-deco","art-deco towers","The testimony","testimony of","of Francisco","Francisco 's","'s daughters","daughters ,",", an","an exquisite","exquisite music","music and","and a","a passionate","passionate research","research keep","keep us","us hooked","hooked to","to this","this architectural","architectural quest"]}

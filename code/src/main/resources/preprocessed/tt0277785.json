{"title":"Circle","plot":"Ten-year-old Fanynka is the star of the local gymnastics team. She lets her fellow pupils know that she is the best and they play her at her own game. She has a complicated relationship with her mother and lives alone with her father. Her mother left them some time ago, remarried and is now pregnant. Fanynka finds this hard to accept and as a result is unable to concentrate on gymnastics. A serious injury from a fall shifts her out of the limelight and leaves her in a wheelchair. She grapples with the consequences of her injury but, above all, tries to gain the trust of people who are close to her.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["Ten-year-old","Fanynka","is","the","star","of","the","local","gymnast","team",".","She","let","her","fellow","pupil","know","that","she","is","the","best","and","they","play","her","at","her","own","game",".","She","has","a","complic","relationship","with","her","mother","and","live","alon","with","her","father",".","Her","mother","left","them","some","time","ago",",","remarri","and","is","now","pregnant",".","Fanynka","find","this","hard","to","accept","and","as","a","result","is","unabl","to","concentr","on","gymnast",".","A","serious","injuri","from","a","fall","shift","her","out","of","the","limelight","and","leav","her","in","a","wheelchair",".","She","grappl","with","the","consequ","of","her","injuri","but",",","abov","all",",","tri","to","gain","the","trust","of","peopl","who","are","close","to","her","."],"lemmas":["ten-year-old","Fanynka","be","the","star","of","the","local","gymnastics","team",".","she","let","she","fellow","pupil","know","that","she","be","the","best","and","they","play","she","at","she","own","game",".","she","have","a","complicated","relationship","with","she","mother","and","live","alone","with","she","father",".","she","mother","leave","they","some","time","ago",",","remarry","and","be","now","pregnant",".","Fanynka","find","this","hard","to","accept","and","as","a","result","be","unable","to","concentrate","on","gymnastics",".","a","serious","injury","from","a","fall","shift","she","out","of","the","limelight","and","leave","she","in","a","wheelchair",".","she","grapple","with","the","consequence","of","she","injury","but",",","above","all",",","try","to","gain","the","trust","of","people","who","be","close","to","she","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ten-year-old Fanynka is","Fanynka is the","is the star","the star of","star of the","of the local","the local gymnastics","local gymnastics team","She lets her","lets her fellow","her fellow pupils","fellow pupils know","pupils know that","know that she","that she is","she is the","is the best","the best and","best and they","and they play","they play her","play her at","her at her","at her own","her own game","She has a","has a complicated","a complicated relationship","complicated relationship with","relationship with her","with her mother","her mother and","mother and lives","and lives alone","lives alone with","alone with her","with her father","Her mother left","mother left them","left them some","them some time","some time ago","time ago ,","ago , remarried",", remarried and","remarried and is","and is now","is now pregnant","Fanynka finds this","finds this hard","this hard to","hard to accept","to accept and","accept and as","and as a","as a result","a result is","result is unable","is unable to","unable to concentrate","to concentrate on","concentrate on gymnastics","A serious injury","serious injury from","injury from a","from a fall","a fall shifts","fall shifts her","shifts her out","her out of","out of the","of the limelight","the limelight and","limelight and leaves","and leaves her","leaves her in","her in a","in a wheelchair","She grapples with","grapples with the","with the consequences","the consequences of","consequences of her","of her injury","her injury but","injury but ,","but , above",", above all","above all ,","all , tries",", tries to","tries to gain","to gain the","gain the trust","the trust of","trust of people","of people who","people who are","who are close","are close to","close to her"],"2grams":["Ten-year-old Fanynka","Fanynka is","is the","the star","star of","of the","the local","local gymnastics","gymnastics team","She lets","lets her","her fellow","fellow pupils","pupils know","know that","that she","she is","is the","the best","best and","and they","they play","play her","her at","at her","her own","own game","She has","has a","a complicated","complicated relationship","relationship with","with her","her mother","mother and","and lives","lives alone","alone with","with her","her father","Her mother","mother left","left them","them some","some time","time ago","ago ,",", remarried","remarried and","and is","is now","now pregnant","Fanynka finds","finds this","this hard","hard to","to accept","accept and","and as","as a","a result","result is","is unable","unable to","to concentrate","concentrate on","on gymnastics","A serious","serious injury","injury from","from a","a fall","fall shifts","shifts her","her out","out of","of the","the limelight","limelight and","and leaves","leaves her","her in","in a","a wheelchair","She grapples","grapples with","with the","the consequences","consequences of","of her","her injury","injury but","but ,",", above","above all","all ,",", tries","tries to","to gain","gain the","the trust","trust of","of people","people who","who are","are close","close to","to her"]}

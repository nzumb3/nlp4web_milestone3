{"title":"Akhiyon Se Goli Maare","plot":"Akendra alias Topichand Bhangare runs an antique store as a front for illegal activities. He lives near the notorious Chor Bazaar (thieves market) area with his wife, Sulekha, and only daughter, Kiran. He would like Kiran to get married to the mother of all gangsters, and picks gangster Shakti Dada, who is currently undergoing a lengthy prison sentence, to be his prospective son-in-law. But Kiran already loves Raj Oberoi, who belongs to a wealthy family, and has no links with any gangsters. Kiran convinces Raj in order to meet with her dad's requirements, he must first become a gangster. Raj reluctantly agrees, and is introduced to a gangster-trainer called Subramaniam. After a number of misadventures, Raj finally accomplishes his goal, and qualifies to be a suitable groom for Kiran. Then things change abruptly with the arrival of Topichand's dad, a wealthy man, Thakur Rana, who strongly opposes Kiran's marriage with any gangster. A hapless Raj now decides to cleanse himself of his gangster image, with hilarious and unpredictable results.","genres":["Comedy","

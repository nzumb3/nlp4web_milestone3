{"title":"Pablo's Winter","plot":"Pablo needs to stop smoking. Why? Because his wife, family and doctor say he should. But Pablo is a stubborn man. He has worked in the mercury mines of Almadén, Spain, risking his life daily. He has had five severe heart attacks and smoked 20 Winston's a day since he was 12. Now in his seventies, Pablo spends most of his day in front of the TV, surrounded by a cloud of smoke, with his back turned firmly towards a village that has lived through better times. Pablo represents the last generation of Almadén mercury miners, an age-old profession with over 2,000 years of history. Through a straightforward depiction of life's everyday moments, Pablo's Winter explores the decay of the local mining culture, but above all, pays homage to its real protagonists: the miners and their families.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Pablo","need","to","stop","smoke",".","Whi","?","Becaus","his","wife",",","famili","and","doctor","say","he","should",".","But","Pablo","is","a","stubborn","man",".","He","has","work","in","the","mercuri","mine","of","Almadén",",","Spain",",","risk","his","life","daili",".","He","has","had","five","sever","heart","attack","and","smoke","20","Winston","'s","a","day","sinc","he","was","12",".","Now","in","his","seventi",",","Pablo","spend","most","of","his","day","in","front","of","the","TV",",","surround","by","a","cloud","of","smoke",",","with","his","back","turn","firm","toward","a","villag","that","has","live","through","better","time",".","Pablo","repres","the","last","generat","of","Almadén","mercuri","miner",",","an","age-old","profess","with","over","2,000","year","of","histori",".","Through","a","straightforward","depict","of","life","'s","everyday","moment",",","Pablo","'s","Winter","explor","the","decay","of","the","local","mine","cultur",",","but","abov","all",",","pay","homag","to","it","real","protagonist",":","the","miner","and","their","famili","."],"lemmas":["Pablo","need","to","stop","smoking",".","why","?","because","he","wife",",","family","and","doctor","say","he","should",".","but","Pablo","be","a","stubborn","man",".","he","have","work","in","the","mercury","mine","of","Almadén",",","Spain",",","risk","he","life","daily",".","he","have","have","five","severe","heart","attack","and","smoke","20","Winston","'s","a","day","since","he","be","12",".","now","in","he","seventy",",","Pablo","spend","most","of","he","day","in","front","of","the","tv",",","surround","by","a","cloud","of","smoke",",","with","he","back","turn","firmly","towards","a","village","that","have","live","through","better","time",".","Pablo","represent","the","last","generation","of","Almadén","mercury","miner",",","a","age-old","profession","with","over","2,000","year","of","history",".","through","a","straightforward","depiction","of","life","'s","everyday","moment",",","Pablo","'s","Winter","explore","the","decay","of","the","local","mining","culture",",","but","above","all",",","pay","homage","to","its","real","protagonist",":","the","miner","and","they","family","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Pablo

{"title":"Marquise","plot":"Marquise is a drama about the rise and fall of a beauteous actress. As cheerfully portrayed by Sophie Marceau, the eponymous heroine is an engagingly ribald, but perhaps rather too modern, character. She rises from an impoverished background to become a favourite of the Sun King, Louis XIV, and the mistress of the celebrated Racine, who wrote roles especially for her; but her fate, in the end, is a tragic one.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Marquis","is","a","drama","about","the","rise","and","fall","of","a","beauteous","actress",".","As","cheer","portray","by","Sophi","Marceau",",","the","eponym","heroin","is","an","engag","ribald",",","but","perhap","rather","too","modern",",","charact",".","She","rise","from","an","impoverish","background","to","becom","a","favourit","of","the","Sun","King",",","Loui","XIV",",","and","the","mistress","of","the","celebr","Racin",",","who","wrote","role","especi","for","her",";","but","her","fate",",","in","the","end",",","is","a","tragic","one","."],"lemmas":["Marquise","be","a","drama","about","the","rise","and","fall","of","a","beauteous","actress",".","as","cheerfully","portray","by","Sophie","Marceau",",","the","eponymous","heroine","be","a","engagingly","ribald",",","but","perhaps","rather","too","modern",",","character",".","she","rise","from","a","impoverished","background","to","become","a","favourite","of","the","Sun","King",",","Louis","XIV",",","and","the","mistress","of","the","celebrated","Racine",",","who","write","role","especially","for","she",";","but","she","fate",",","in","the","end",",","be","a","tragic","one","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Marquise is a","is a drama","a drama about","drama about the","about the rise","the rise and","rise and fall","and fall of","fall of a","of a beauteous","a beauteous actress","As cheerfully portrayed","cheerfully portrayed by","portrayed by Sophie","by Sophie Marceau","Sophie Marceau ,","Marceau , the",", the eponymous","the eponymous heroine","eponymous heroine is","heroine is an","is an engagingly","an engagingly ribald","engagingly ribald ,","ribald , but",", but perhaps","but perhaps rather","perhaps rather too","rather too modern","too modern ,","modern , character","She rises from","rises from an","from an impoverished","an impoverished background","impoverished background to","background to become","to become a","become a favourite","a favourite of","favourite of the","of the Sun","the Sun King","Sun King ,","King , Louis",", Louis XIV","Louis XIV ,","XIV , and",", and the","and the mistress","the mistress of","mistress of the","of the celebrated","the celebrated Racine","celebrated Racine ,","Racine , who",", who wrote","who wrote roles","wrote roles especially","roles especially for","especially for her","for her ;","her ; but","; but her","but her fate","her fate ,","fate , in",", in the","in the end","the end ,","end , is",", is a","is a tragic","a tragic one"],"2grams":["Marquise is","is a","a drama","drama about","about the","the rise","rise and","and fall","fall of","of a","a beauteous","beauteous actress","As cheerfully","cheerfully portrayed","portrayed by","by Sophie","Sophie Marceau","Marceau ,",", the","the eponymous","eponymous heroine","heroine is","is an","an engagingly","engagingly ribald","ribald ,",", but","but perhaps","perhaps rather","rather too","too modern","modern ,",", character","She rises","rises from","from an","an impoverished","impoverished background","background to","to become","become a","a favourite","favourite of","of the","the Sun","Sun King","King ,",", Louis","Louis XIV","XIV ,",", and","and the","the mistress","mistress of","of the","the celebrated","celebrated Racine","Racine ,",", who","who wrote","wrote roles","roles especially","especially for","for her","her ;","; but","but her","her fate","fate ,",", in","in the","the end","end ,",", is","is a","a tragic","tragic one"]}

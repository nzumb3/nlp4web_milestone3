{"title":"Ani DiFranco: Live at Babeville","plot":"On September 11 and 12, 2007, Ani DiFranco and her band (Allison Miller on drums, Todd Sickafoose on bass and Mike Dillon on vibes and percussion) played two sold-out shows before a hometown audience in Buffalo, New York. What made those nights so special wasn't just the music-that's always special at an Ani show-but the fact that she was playing the inaugural shows in her very own venue, \"Babeville\". Now the highlights of the two shows are available on a single DVD featuring eighteen songs (two of which have not yet appeared on studio albums), plus bonus sound check and interview footage, all shot in high definition video and 5.1 surround sound. The result is a must-have memento of Ani at her finest-onstage, playing her guitar and singing with the passion, intensity, and joy that have made her a legend.","genres":["Music"],"stems":["On","Septemb","11","and","12",",","2007",",","Ani","DiFranco","and","her","band","(","Allison","Miller","on","drum",",","Todd","Sickafoos","on","bass","and","Mike","Dillon","on","vibe","and","percuss",")","play","two","sold-out","show","befor","a","hometown","audienc","in","Buffalo",",","New","York",".","What","made","those","night","so","special","was","n't","just","the","music-that","'s","alway","special","at","an","Ani","show-but","the","fact","that","she","was","play","the","inaugur","show","in","her","veri","own","venu",",","\"","Babevill","\"",".","Now","the","highlight","of","the","two","show","are","avail","on","a","singl","DVD","featur","eighteen","song","(","two","of","which","have","not","yet","appear","on","studio","album",")",",","plus","bonus","sound","check","and","interview","footag",",","all","shot","in","high","definit","video","and","5.1","surround","sound",".","The","result","is","a","must-hav","memento","of","Ani","at","her","finest-onstag",",","play","her","guitar","and","sing","with","the","passion",",","intens",",","and","joy","that","have","made","her","a","legend","."],"lemmas":["on","September","11","and","12",",","2007",",","Ani","DiFranco","and","she","band","-lrb-","Allison","Miller","on","drum",",","Todd","Sickafoose","on","bass","and","Mike","Dillon","on","vibes","and","percussion","-rrb-","play","two","sold-out","show","before","a","hometown","audience","in","Buffalo",",","New","York",".","what","make","those","night","so","special","be","not","just","the","music-that","'s","always","special","at","a","ani","show-but","the","fact","that","she","be","play","the","inaugural","show","in","she","very","own","venue",",","``","Babeville","''",".","now","the","highlight","of","the","two","show","be","available","on","a","single","dvd","feature","eighteen","song","-lrb-","two","of","which","have","not","yet","appear","on","studio","album","-rrb-",",","plus","bonus","sound","check","and","interview","footage",",","all","shot","in","high","definition","video","and","5.1","surround","sound",".","the","result","be","a","must-have","memento","of","Ani","at","she","finest-onstage",",","play","she","guitar","and","singing","with","the","passion",",","intensity",",","and","joy","that","have","make","she","a","legend","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["On

{"title":"Zama Zama","plot":"In South Africa's gold mining region is the subterranean dimension of the Zama Zama, illegal miners that make a living by mining the ore in both operational and abandoned mine shafts. Zama Zama is the personal narrative of two brothers - Malcolm, a successful businessman in the mining industry and his long lost brother Joseph, one of those who work in the underground tunnels - playing off against the tension of the mines' punitive actions against these miners. The plot revolves around moral choices: social standing and success versus loyalty to and love of family.","genres":["Action"],"stems":["In","South","Africa","'s","gold","mine","region","is","the","subterranean","dimens","of","the","Zama","Zama",",","illeg","miner","that","make","a","live","by","mine","the","ore","in","both","oper","and","abandon","mine","shaft",".","Zama","Zama","is","the","person","narrat","of","two","brother","-","Malcolm",",","a","success","businessman","in","the","mine","industri","and","his","long","lost","brother","Joseph",",","one","of","those","who","work","in","the","underground","tunnel","-","play","off","against","the","tension","of","the","mine","'","punit","action","against","these","miner",".","The","plot","revolv","around","moral","choic",":","social","stand","and","success","versus","loyalti","to","and","love","of","famili","."],"lemmas":["in","South","Africa","'s","gold","mining","region","be","the","subterranean","dimension","of","the","Zama","Zama",",","illegal","miner","that","make","a","living","by","mine","the","ore","in","both","operational","and","abandoned","mine","shaft",".","Zama","Zama","be","the","personal","narrative","of","two","brother","-","Malcolm",",","a","successful","businessman","in","the","mining","industry","and","he","long","lose","brother","Joseph",",","one","of","those","who","work","in","the","underground","tunnel","-","play","off","against","the","tension","of","the","mine","'","punitive","action","against","these","miner",".","the","plot","revolve","around","moral","choice",":","social","standing","and","success","versus","loyalty","to","and","love","of","family","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In South Africa","South Africa 's","Africa 's gold","'s gold mining","gold mining region","mining region is","region is the","is the subterranean","the subterranean dimension","subterranean dimension of","dimension of the","of the Zama","the Zama Zama","Zama Zama ,","Zama , illegal",", illegal miners","illegal miners that","miners that make","that make a","make a living","a living by","living by mining","by mining the","mining the ore","the ore in","ore in both","in both operational","both operational and","operational and abandoned","and abandoned mine","abandoned mine shafts","Zama Zama is","Zama is the","is the personal","the personal narrative","personal narrative of","narrative of two","of two brothers","two brothers -","brothers - Malcolm","- Malcolm ,","Malcolm , a",", a successful","a successful businessman","successful businessman in","businessman in the","in the mining","the mining industry","mining industry and","industry and his","and his long","his long lost","long lost brother","lost brother Joseph","brother Joseph ,","Joseph , one",", one of","one of those","of those who","those who work","who work in","work in the","in the underground","the underground tunnels","underground tunnels -","tunnels - playing","- playing off","playing off against","off against the","against the tension","the tension of","tension of the","of the mines","the mines '","mines ' punitive","' punitive actions","punitive actions against","actions against these","against these miners","The plot revolves","plot revolves around","revolves around moral","around moral choices","moral choices :","choices : social",": social standing","social standing and","standing and success","and success versus","success versus loyalty","versus loyalty to","loyalty to and","to and love","and love of","love of family"],"2grams":["In South","South Africa","Africa 's","'s gold","gold mining","mining region","region is","is the","the subterranean","subterranean dimension","dimension of","of the","the Zama","Zama Zama","Zama ,",", illegal","illegal miners","miners that","that make","make a","a living","living by","by mining","mining the","the ore","ore in","in both","both operational","operational and","and abandoned","abandoned mine","mine shafts","Zama Zama","Zama is","is the","the personal","personal narrative","narrative of","of two","two brothers","brothers -","- Malcolm","Malcolm ,",", a","a successful","successful businessman","businessman in","in the","the mining","mining industry","industry and","and his","his long","long lost","lost brother","brother Joseph","Joseph ,",", one","one of","of those","those who","who work","work in","in the","the underground","underground tunnels","tunnels -","- playing","playing off","off against","against the","the tension","tension of","of the","the mines","mines '","' punitive","punitive actions","actions against","against these","these miners","The plot","plot revolves","revolves around","around moral","moral choices","choices :",": social","social standing","standing and","and success","success versus","versus loyalty","loyalty to","to and","and love","love of","of family"]}

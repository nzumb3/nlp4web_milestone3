{"title":"Outrage","plot":"Ana is an equestrian sharpshooter for a one ring circus in Madrid for a week. Marcos is a reporter doing a Sunday supplement piece. He interviews her and she invites him to dinner with the troupe. They dance, then spend the night together; he considers following her around Europe and promises he'd follow her to Hell. While he's in Barcelona to cover a concert, three young men assault her. Bruised, humiliated, and bleeding, she picks up her rifle to hunt them down. Marcos follows her trail that, indeed, takes him to Ana's hell.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Romance"],"stems":["Ana","is","an","equestrian","sharpshoot","for","a","one","ring","circus","in","Madrid","for","a","week",".","Marco","is","a","report","do","a","Sunday","supplement","piec",".","He","interview","her","and","she","invit","him","to","dinner","with","the","troup",".","They","danc",",","then","spend","the","night","togeth",";","he","consid","follow","her","around","Europ","and","promis","he","'d","follow","her","to","Hell",".","While","he","'s","in","Barcelona","to","cover","a","concert",",","three","young","men","assault","her",".","Bruis",",","humili",",","and","bleed",",","she","pick","up","her","rifl","to","hunt","them","down",".","Marco","follow","her","trail","that",",","inde",",","take","him","to","Ana","'s","hell","."],"lemmas":["Ana","be","a","equestrian","sharpshooter","for","a","one","ring","circus","in","Madrid","for","a","week",".","Marcos","be","a","reporter","do","a","Sunday","supplement","piece",".","he","interview","she","and","she","invite","he","to","dinner","with","the","troupe",".","they","dance",",","then","spend","the","night","together",";","he","consider","follow","she","around","Europe","and","promise","he","would","follow","she","to","Hell",".","while","he","be","in","Barcelona","to","cover","a","concert",",","three","young","man","assault","she",".","bruise",",","humiliate",",","and","bleeding",",","she","pick","up","she","rifle","to","hunt","they","down",".","Marcos","follow","she","trail","that",",","indeed",",","take","he","to","Ana","'s","hell","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ana is an","is an equestrian","an equestrian sharpshooter","equestrian sharpshooter for","sharpshooter for a","for a one","a one ring","one ring circus","ring circus in","circus in Madrid","in Madrid for","Madrid for a","for a week","Marcos is a","is a reporter","a reporter doing","reporter doing a","doing a Sunday","a Sunday supplement","Sunday supplement piece","He interviews her","interviews her and","her and she","and she invites","she invites him","invites him to","him to dinner","to dinner with","dinner with the","with the troupe","They dance ,","dance , then",", then spend","then spend the","spend the night","the night together","night together ;","together ; he","; he considers","he considers following","considers following her","following her around","her around Europe","around Europe and","Europe and promises","and promises he","promises he 'd","he 'd follow","'d follow her","follow her to","her to Hell","While he 's","he 's in","'s in Barcelona","in Barcelona to","Barcelona to cover","to cover a","cover a concert","a concert ,","concert , three",", three young","three young men","young men assault","men assault her","Bruised , humiliated",", humiliated ,","humiliated , and",", and bleeding","and bleeding ,","bleeding , she",", she picks","she picks up","picks up her","up her rifle","her rifle to","rifle to hunt","to hunt them","hunt them down","Marcos follows her","follows her trail","her trail that","trail that ,","that , indeed",", indeed ,","indeed , takes",", takes him","takes him to","him to Ana","to Ana 's","Ana 's hell"],"2grams":["Ana is","is an","an equestrian","equestrian sharpshooter","sharpshooter for","for a","a one","one ring","ring circus","circus in","in Madrid","Madrid for","for a","a week","Marcos is","is a","a reporter","reporter doing","doing a","a Sunday","Sunday supplement","supplement piece","He interviews","interviews her","her and","and she","she invites","invites him","him to","to dinner","dinner with","with the","the troupe","They dance","dance ,",", then","then spend","spend the","the night","night together","together ;","; he","he considers","considers following","following her","her around","around Europe","Europe and","and promises","promises he","he 'd","'d follow","follow her","her to","to Hell","While he","he 's","'s in","in Barcelona","Barcelona to","to cover","cover a","a concert","concert ,",", three","three young","young men","men assault","assault her","Bruised ,",", humiliated","humiliated ,",", and","and bleeding","bleeding ,",", she","she picks","picks up","up her","her rifle","rifle to","to hunt","hunt them","them down","Marcos follows","follows her","her trail","trail that","that ,",", indeed","indeed ,",", takes","takes him","him to","to Ana","Ana 's","'s hell"]}

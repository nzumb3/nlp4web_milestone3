{"title":"Cabin Fever","plot":"The college friends Paul, Karen, Bert, Marcy and Jeff rent an isolated cabin in the woods to spend a week together. When they arrive, a man contaminated with a weird disease asks for help to them, but they get in panic and burn the man, who falls in the water reservoir and dies. The whole group, except Karen, makes a pact of drinking only beer along the week without knowing where the dead body is. When Karen drinks tap water and gets the disease, the group begins their journey to hell.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["The","colleg","friend","Paul",",","Karen",",","Bert",",","Marci","and","Jeff","rent","an","isol","cabin","in","the","wood","to","spend","a","week","togeth",".","When","they","arriv",",","a","man","contamin","with","a","weird","diseas","ask","for","help","to","them",",","but","they","get","in","panic","and","burn","the","man",",","who","fall","in","the","water","reservoir","and","die",".","The","whole","group",",","except","Karen",",","make","a","pact","of","drink","onli","beer","along","the","week","without","know","where","the","dead","bodi","is",".","When","Karen","drink","tap","water","and","get","the","diseas",",","the","group","begin","their","journey","to","hell","."],"lemmas":["the","college","friend","Paul",",","Karen",",","Bert",",","Marcy","and","Jeff","rent","a","isolate","cabin","in","the","wood","to","spend","a","week","together",".","when","they","arrive",",","a","man","contaminate","with","a","weird","disease","ask","for","help","to","they",",","but","they","get","in","panic","and","burn","the","man",",","who","fall","in","the","water","reservoir","and","die",".","the","whole","group",",","except","Karen",",","make","a","pact","of","drinking","only","beer","along","the","week","without","know","where","the","dead","body","be",".","when","Karen","drink","tap","water","and","get","the","disease",",","the","group","begin","they","journey","to","hell","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The college friends","college friends Paul","friends Paul ,","Paul , Karen",", Karen ,","Karen , Bert",", Bert ,","Bert , Marcy",", Marcy and","Marcy and Jeff","and Jeff rent","Jeff rent an","rent an isolated","an isolated cabin","isolated cabin in","cabin in the","in the woods","the woods to","woods to spend","to spend a","spend a week","a week together","When they arrive","they arrive ,","arrive , a",", a man","a man contaminated","man contaminated with","contaminated with a","with a weird","a weird disease","weird disease asks","disease asks for","asks for help","for help to","help to them","to them ,","them , but",", but they","but they get","they get in","get in panic","in panic and","panic and burn","and burn the","burn the man","the man ,","man , who",", who falls","who falls in","falls in the","in the water","the water reservoir","water reservoir and","reservoir and dies","The whole group","whole group ,","group , except",", except Karen","except Karen ,","Karen , makes",", makes a","makes a pact","a pact of","pact of drinking","of drinking only","drinking only beer","only beer along","beer along the","along the week","the week without","week without knowing","without knowing where","knowing where the","where the dead","the dead body","dead body is","When Karen drinks","Karen drinks tap","drinks tap water","tap water and","water and gets","and gets the","gets the disease","the disease ,","disease , the",", the group","the group begins","group begins their","begins their journey","their journey to","journey to hell"],"2grams":["The college","college friends","friends Paul","Paul ,",", Karen","Karen ,",", Bert","Bert ,",", Marcy","Marcy and","and Jeff","Jeff rent","rent an","an isolated","isolated cabin","cabin in","in the","the woods","woods to","to spend","spend a","a week","week together","When they","they arrive","arrive ,",", a","a man","man contaminated","contaminated with","with a","a weird","weird disease","disease asks","asks for","for help","help to","to them","them ,",", but","but they","they get","get in","in panic","panic and","and burn","burn the","the man","man ,",", who","who falls","falls in","in the","the water","water reservoir","reservoir and","and dies","The whole","whole group","group ,",", except","except Karen","Karen ,",", makes","makes a","a pact","pact of","of drinking","drinking only","only beer","beer along","along the","the week","week without","without knowing","knowing where","where the","the dead","dead body","body is","When Karen","Karen drinks","drinks tap","tap water","water and","and gets","gets the","the disease","disease ,",", the","the group","group begins","begins their","their journey","journey to","to hell"]}

{"title":"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines","plot":"More than 10 years after 'Terminator 2', John Connor now exists only as a drifter - living 'off the grid', so no more Terminators from the future can hunt him down. Unfortunately, SkyNet does send another one back - and this one is called the T-X, even more powerful & advanced than the dreaded T-1000. However, another CSM-101 Terminator is also sent back to protect John against the T-X. Now, Skynet is patiently assuming control of civilian computer systems, under the guise of a computer virus. John has also met his future wife, Kate Brewster, whose father - a U.S. Air Force General - is in charge of the military computer systems & is leery of up linking SkyNet. However, when the SkyNet virus infects the U.S military computers & leaves the country open to attack, the machines begin their horrific takeover. Soon a nuclear war will result - and the war against the machines will begin. Can the outdated CSM-101 Terminator eliminate the highly advanced T-X - or will a darker future await man following the nuclear attack?","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["More","than","10","year","after","'","Termin","2","'",",","John","Connor","now","exist","onli","as","a","drifter","-","live","'","off","the","grid","'",",","so","no","more","Termin","from","the","futur","can","hunt","him","down",".","Unfortun",",","SkyNet","doe","send","anoth","one","back","-","and","this","one","is","call","the","T-X",",","even","more","power","&","advanc","than","the","dread","T-1000",".","Howev",",","anoth","CSM-101","Termin","is","also","sent","back","to","protect","John","against","the","T-X",".","Now",",","Skynet","is","patient","assum","control","of","civilian","comput","system",",","under","the","guis","of","a","comput","virus",".","John","has","also","met","his","futur","wife",",","Kate","Brewster",",","whose","father","-","a","U.S.","Air","Forc","Gener","-","is","in","charg","of","the","militari","comput","system","&","is","leeri","of","up","link","SkyNet",".","Howev",",","when","the","SkyNet","virus","infect","the","U.S","militari","comput","&","leav","the","countri","open","to","attack",",","the","machin","begin","their","horrif","takeov",".","Soon","a","nuclear","war","will","result","-","and","the","war","against","the","machin","will","begin",".","Can","the","outdat","CSM-101","Termin","elimin","the","high","advanc","T-X","-","or","will","a","darker","futur","await","man","follow","the","nuclear","attack","?"],"lemmas":["more","than","10","year","after","'","Terminator","2","'",",","John","Connor","now","exist","only","as","a","drifter","-","live","'","off","the","grid","'",",","so","no","more","terminator","from","the","future","can","hunt","he","down",".","unfortunately",",","SkyNet","do","send","another","one","back","-","and","this","one","be","call","the","t-x",",","even","more","powerful","&","advanced","than","the","dreaded","t-1000",".","however",",","another","CSM-101","Terminator","be","also","send","back","to","protect","John","against","the","t-x",".","now",",","Skynet","be","patiently","assume","control","of","civilian","computer","system",",","under","the","guise","of","a","computer","virus",".","John","have","also","meet","he","future","wife",",","Kate","Brewster",",","whose","father","-","a","U.S.","Air","Force","General","-","be","in","charge","of","the","military","computer","system","&","be","leery","of","up","link","SkyNet",".","however",",","when","the","SkyNet","virus","infect","the","u.s","military","computer","&","leave","the","country","open","to","attack",",","the","machine","begin","they","horrific","takeover",".","soon","a","nuclear","war","will","result","-","and","the","war","against","the","machine","will","begin",".","can","the","outdated","csm-101","Terminator","eliminate","the","highly","advance","t-x","-","or","will","a","darker","future","await","man","follow","the","nuclear","attack","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["More than 10","than 10 years","10 years after","years after '","after ' Terminator","' Terminator 2","Terminator 2 '","2 ' ,","' , John",", John Connor","John Connor now","Connor now exists","now exists only","exists only as","only as a","as a drifter","a drifter -","drifter -

{"title":"We Are the Best!","plot":"Bobo is a thirteen-year-old ordinary seventh-grader, who lives with Lena, her divorced mother in Stockholm. In the beginning of the 80s, bands like KSMB and Ebba Grön, offer not only a way of expression but also a source of inspiration for young Bobo, who strongly refuses to accept what others say about Punk being dead. She shares the same positive mindset with Klara, a fellow classmate, however, the sense that something is still missing from their lives, is predominant. In the quest of discovering new ways of sharing their untamed taste in music and its political views, the two of them decide to sign up for a rehearsal at a nearby studio, getting their hands on musical instruments for the very first time. Much to their surprise, what started as a joke, is now progressively becoming a reality, if only they knew how to play... Nevertheless, fate is on their side, when out of the blue, help arrives in the face of Hedvig, a talented but introverted girl from eighth grade, who is eager to assist her newly acquired friends. Despite the difficulties and with a song already in their hands, this aspiring Punk band fueled by youthful rebellion, is aiming for the stars without any concern about what others say because THEY ARE THE BEST!","genres":["Drama","

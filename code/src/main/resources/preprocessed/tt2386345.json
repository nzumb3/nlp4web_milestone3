{"title":"Tract of Land (Life on Reserve in Canada)","plot":"Tract of Land is a documentary by award winning Canadian filmmaker Matt LeMay. Timiskaming First Nation is the backdrop for this politically charged film and also the home of Canadian punk rock sensation Friendly Fire. Self-described as hard rocking Algonquin Indians, the group's story is one of unwavering commitment to their music, culture and community. The film chronicles the bands experience of growing up, working and living on reserve in Canada. The film also explores the lingering and damaging effects that residential schools still have on generations of First Nation communities in Canada. Friendly Fires unapologetic and ferocious sound provides a dramatic musical landscape for this film, while examining the contrasts between aboriginal and non-aboriginal communities in Canada. 28 min

{"title":"Joint Security Area","plot":"In the DMZ separating North and South Korea, two North Korean soldiers have been killed, supposedly by one South Korean soldier. But the 11 bullets found in the bodies, together with the 5 remaining rounds in the assassin's magazine, amount to 16 cartridges for a gun that should normally hold 15. The investigating Swiss/Swedish team from the neutral countries overseeing the DMZ suspects that another, unknown party was involved - all of which points to some sort of cover up. The truth is much simpler and much more tragic.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["In","the","DMZ","separ","North","and","South","Korea",",","two","North","Korean","soldier","have","been","kill",",","suppos","by","one","South","Korean","soldier",".","But","the","11","bullet","found","in","the","bodi",",","togeth","with","the","5","remain","round","in","the","assassin","'s","magazin",",","amount","to","16","cartridg","for","a","gun","that","should","normal","hold","15",".","The","investig","Swiss/Swedish","team","from","the","neutral","countri","overse","the","DMZ","suspect","that","anoth",",","unknown","parti","was","involv","-","all","of","which","point","to","some","sort","of","cover","up",".","The","truth","is","much","simpler","and","much","more","tragic","."],"lemmas":["in","the","dmz","separate","North","and","South","Korea",",","two","north","korean","soldier","have","be","kill",",","supposedly","by","one","south","korean","soldier",".","but","the","11","bullet","find","in","the","body",",","together","with","the","5","remain","round","in","the","assassin","'s","magazine",",","amount","to","16","cartridge","for","a","gun","that","should","normally","hold","15",".","the","investigate","swiss/swedish","team","from","the","neutral","country","oversee","the","DMZ","suspect","that","another",",","unknown","party","be","involve","-","all","of","which","point","to","some","sort","of","cover","up",".","the","truth","be","much","simpler","and","much","more","tragic","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In the DMZ","the DMZ separating","DMZ separating North","separating North and","North and South","and South Korea","South Korea ,","Korea , two",", two North","two North Korean","North Korean soldiers","Korean soldiers have","soldiers have been","have been killed","been killed ,","killed , supposedly",", supposedly by","supposedly by one","by one South","one South Korean","South Korean soldier","But the 11","the 11 bullets","11 bullets found","bullets found in","found in the","in the bodies","the bodies ,","bodies , together",", together with","together with the","with the 5","the 5 remaining","5 remaining rounds","remaining rounds in","rounds in the","in the assassin","the assassin 's","assassin 's magazine","'s magazine ,","magazine , amount",", amount to","amount to 16","to 16 cartridges","16 cartridges for","cartridges for a","for a gun","a gun that","gun that should","that should normally","should normally hold","normally hold 15","The investigating Swiss/Swedish","investigating Swiss/Swedish team","Swiss/Swedish team from","team from the","from the neutral","the neutral countries","neutral countries overseeing","countries overseeing the","overseeing the DMZ","the DMZ suspects","DMZ suspects that","suspects that another","that another ,","another , unknown",", unknown party","unknown party was","party was involved","was involved -","involved - all","- all of","all of which","of which points","which points to","points to some","to some sort","some sort of","sort of cover","of cover up","The truth is","truth is much","is much simpler","much simpler and","simpler and much","and much more","much more tragic"],"2grams":["In the","the DMZ","DMZ separating","separating North","North and","and South","South Korea","Korea ,",", two","two North","North Korean","Korean soldiers","soldiers have","have been","been killed","killed ,",", supposedly","supposedly by","by one","one South","South Korean","Korean soldier","But the","the 11","11 bullets","bullets found","found in","in the","the bodies","bodies ,",", together","together with","with the","the 5","5 remaining","remaining rounds","rounds in","in the","the assassin","assassin 's","'s magazine","magazine ,",", amount","amount to","to 16","16 cartridges","cartridges for","for a","a gun","gun that","that should","should normally","normally hold","hold 15","The investigating","investigating Swiss/Swedish","Swiss/Swedish team","team from","from the","the neutral","neutral countries","countries overseeing","overseeing the","the DMZ","DMZ suspects","suspects that","that another","another ,",", unknown","unknown party","party was","was involved","involved -","- all","all of","of which","which points","points to","to some","some sort","sort of","of cover","cover up","The truth","truth is","is much","much simpler","simpler and","and much","much more","more tragic"]}

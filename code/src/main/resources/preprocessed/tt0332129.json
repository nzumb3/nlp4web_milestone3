{"title":"A House on a Hill","plot":"Harry is an irascible, aging architect trying to achieve the dream of building his masterwork. A wealthy young couple has commissioned Harry to design and rebuild a house he once owned that had burned down. Though reluctant at first, he eventually takes on the assignment and develops a new sense of purpose when his ex-wife Mercedes gives him her blessing. Harry soon realizes that the work has tapped into the vigor and promise of his youth. In the meantime Gaby has been hired to make a documentary about Harry--her project helps to reveal a complex man who, because of personal tragedy, has never attained the greatness most people felt he was destined for.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Harri","is","an","irasc",",","age","architect","tri","to","achiev","the","dream","of","build","his","masterwork",".","A","wealthi","young","coupl","has","commiss","Harri","to","design","and","rebuild","a","hous","he","onc","own","that","had","burn","down",".","Though","reluct","at","first",",","he","eventu","take","on","the","assign","and","develop","a","new","sens","of","purpos","when","his","ex-wif","Merced","give","him","her","bless",".","Harri","soon","realiz","that","the","work","has","tap","into","the","vigor","and","promis","of","his","youth",".","In","the","meantim","Gabi","has","been","hire","to","make","a","documentari","about","Harri","--","her","project","help","to","reveal","a","complex","man","who",",","becaus","of","person","tragedi",",","has","never","attain","the","great","most","peopl","felt","he","was","destin","for","."],"lemmas":["Harry","be","a","irascible",",","age","architect","try","to","achieve","the","dream","of","build","he","masterwork",".","a","wealthy","young","couple","have","commission","Harry","to","design","and","rebuild","a","house","he","once","own","that","have","burn","down",".","though","reluctant","at","first",",","he","eventually","take","on","the","assignment","and","develop","a","new","sense","of","purpose","when","he","ex-wife","Mercedes","give","he","she","blessing",".","Harry","soon","realize","that","the","work","have","tap","into","the","vigor","and","promise","of","he","youth",".","in","the","meantime","Gaby","have","be","hire","to","make","a","documentary","about","Harry","--","she","project","help","to","reveal","a","complex","man","who",",","because","of","personal","tragedy",",","have","never","attain","the","greatness","most","people","feel","he","be","destine","for","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Harry

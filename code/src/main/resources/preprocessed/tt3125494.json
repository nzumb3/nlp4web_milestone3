{"title":"Esther en alguna parte","plot":"The peaceful life of Lino, a widower who keeps busy with the simplest everyday things, is turned upside-down when Larry Po, another quirky old man with multiple personalities, confesses to him that his late wife, Maruja, led a double life: by day was a housewife ordinary, and at night was an impressive singer of boleros. Given the possibility that perhaps he had not really known her, he becomes a detective obsessed with finding the truth.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["The","peac","life","of","Lino",",","a","widow","who","keep","busi","with","the","simplest","everyday","thing",",","is","turn","upside-down","when","Larri","Po",",","anoth","quirki","old","man","with","multipl","person",",","confess","to","him","that","his","late","wife",",","Maruja",",","led","a","doubl","life",":","by","day","was","a","housewif","ordinari",",","and","at","night","was","an","impress","singer","of","bolero",".","Given","the","possibl","that","perhap","he","had","not","realli","known","her",",","he","becom","a","detect","obsess","with","find","the","truth","."],"lemmas":["the","peaceful","life","of","Lino",",","a","widower","who","keep","busy","with","the","simplest","everyday","thing",",","be","turn","upside-down","when","Larry","Po",",","another","quirky","old","man","with","multiple","personality",",","confess","to","he","that","he","late","wife",",","Maruja",",","lead","a","double","life",":","by","day","be","a","housewife","ordinary",",","and","at","night","be","a","impressive","singer","of","bolero",".","give","the","possibility","that","perhaps","he","have","not","really","know","she",",","he","become","a","detective","obsess","with","find","the","truth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The peaceful life","peaceful life of","life of Lino","of Lino ,","Lino , a",", a widower","a widower who","widower who keeps","who keeps busy","keeps busy with","busy with the","with the simplest","the simplest everyday","simplest everyday things","everyday things ,","things , is",", is turned","is turned upside-down","turned upside-down when","upside-down when Larry","when Larry Po","Larry Po ,","Po , another",", another quirky","another quirky old","quirky old man","old man with","man with multiple","with multiple personalities","multiple personalities ,","personalities , confesses",", confesses to","confesses to him","to him that","him that his","that his late","his late wife","late wife ,","wife , Maruja",", Maruja ,","Maruja , led",", led a","led a double","a double life","double life :","life : by",": by day","by day was","day was a","was a housewife","a housewife ordinary","housewife ordinary ,","ordinary , and",", and at","and at night","at night was","night was an","was an impressive","an impressive singer","impressive singer of","singer of boleros","Given the possibility","the possibility that","possibility that perhaps","that perhaps he","perhaps he had","he had not","had not really","not really known","really known her","known her ,","her , he",", he becomes","he becomes a","becomes a detective","a detective obsessed","detective obsessed with","obsessed with finding","with finding the","finding the truth"],"2grams":["The peaceful","peaceful life","life of","of Lino","Lino ,",", a","a widower","widower who","who keeps","keeps busy","busy with","with the","the simplest","simplest everyday","everyday things","things ,",", is","is turned","turned upside-down","upside-down when","when Larry","Larry Po","Po ,",", another","another quirky","quirky old","old man","man with","with multiple","multiple personalities","personalities ,",", confesses","confesses to","to him","him that","that his","his late","late wife","wife ,",", Maruja","Maruja ,",", led","led a","a double","double life","life :",": by","by day","day was","was a","a housewife","housewife ordinary","ordinary ,",", and","and at","at night","night was","was an","an impressive","impressive singer","singer of","of boleros","Given the","the possibility","possibility that","that perhaps","perhaps he","he had","had not","not really","really known","known her","her ,",", he","he becomes","becomes a","a detective","detective obsessed","obsessed with","with finding","finding the","the truth"]}

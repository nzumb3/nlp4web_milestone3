{"title":"Farewell","plot":"In 1985, Sergei Gregoriev, a Soviet colonel, wants to force his nation to reform, so he leaks secret information to the West. He picks an unlikely contact, a Pierre Froment, French nebbish in the diplomatic corps. Gregoriev keeps a lot of balls in the air - a marriage, a teen son he's trying to bond with, a mistress who's a colleague at work; his tradecraft is equally reckless. Meanwhile, Froment keeps his spy work secret from his German wife, and Mitterrand uses Gregoriev's information to make France indispensable to Reagan and his government. When Gregoriev leaks a list of key Soviet moles and spies, Gorbachev is left without secret intelligence. Will Gregoriev get what he wants?","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Romance"],"stems":["In","1985",",","Sergei","Gregoriev",",","a","Soviet","colonel",",","want","to","forc","his","nation","to","reform",",","so","he","leak","secret","inform","to","the","West",".","He","pick","an","unlik","contact",",","a","Pierr","Froment",",","French","nebbish","in","the","diplomat","corp",".","Gregoriev","keep","a","lot","of","ball","in","the","air","-","a","marriag",",","a","teen","son","he","'s","tri","to","bond","with",",","a","mistress","who","'s","a","colleagu","at","work",";","his","tradecraft","is","equal","reckless",".","Meanwhil",",","Froment","keep","his","spi","work","secret","from","his","German","wife",",","and","Mitterrand","use","Gregoriev","'s","inform","to","make","Franc","indispens","to","Reagan","and","his","govern",".","When","Gregoriev","leak","a","list","of","key","Soviet","mole","and","spi",",","Gorbachev","is","left","without","secret","intellig",".","Will","Gregoriev","get","what","he","want","?"],"lemmas":["in","1985",",","Sergei","Gregoriev",",","a","soviet","colonel",",","want","to","force","he","nation","to","reform",",","so","he","leak","secret","information","to","the","West",".","he","pick","a","unlikely","contact",",","a","Pierre","Froment",",","french","nebbish","in","the","diplomatic","corps",".","Gregoriev","keep","a","lot","of","ball","in","the","air","-","a","marriage",",","a","teen","son","he","be","try","to","bond","with",",","a","mistress","who","be","a","colleague","at","work",";","he","tradecraft","be","equally","reckless",".","meanwhile",",","Froment","keep","he","spy","work","secret","from","he","german","wife",",","and","Mitterrand","use","Gregoriev","'s","information","to","make","France","indispensable","to","Reagan","and","he","government",".","when","Gregoriev","leak","a","list","of","key","soviet","mole","and","spy",",","Gorbachev","be","leave","without","secret","intelligence",".","Will","Gregoriev","get","what","he","want","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1985 ,","1985 , Sergei",", Sergei Gregoriev","Sergei Gregoriev ,","Gregoriev , a",", a Soviet","a Soviet colonel","Soviet colonel ,","colonel , wants",", wants to","wants to force","to force his","force his nation","his nation to","nation to reform","to reform ,","reform , so",", so he","so he leaks","he leaks secret","leaks secret information","secret information to","information to the","to the West","He picks an","picks an unlikely","an unlikely contact","unlikely contact ,","contact , a",", a Pierre","a Pierre Froment","Pierre Froment ,","Froment , French",", French nebbish","French nebbish in","nebbish in the","in the diplomatic","the diplomatic corps","Gregoriev keeps a","keeps a lot","a lot of","lot of balls","of balls in","balls in the","in the air","the air -","air - a","- a marriage","a marriage ,","marriage , a",", a teen","a teen son","teen son he","son he 's","he 's trying","'s trying to","trying to bond","to bond with","bond with ,","with , a",", a mistress","a mistress who","mistress who 's","who 's a","'s a colleague","a colleague at","colleague at work","at work ;","work ;

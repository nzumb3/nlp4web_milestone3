{"title":"The World's End","plot":"20 years after attempting an epic pub crawl, five childhood friends reunite when one of them becomes hell bent on trying the drinking marathon again. They are convinced to stage an encore by mate Gary King, a 40-year old man trapped at the cigarette end of his teens, who drags his reluctant pals to their home town and once again attempts to reach the fabled pub, The World's End. As they attempt to reconcile the past and present, they realize the real struggle is for the future, not just theirs but humankind's. Reaching The World's End is the least of their worries.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Comedy"],"stems":["20","year","after","attempt","an","epic","pub","crawl",",","five","childhood","friend","reunit","when","one","of","them","becom","hell","bent","on","tri","the","drink","marathon","again",".","They","are","convinc","to","stage","an","encor","by","mate","Gari","King",",","a","40-year","old","man","trap","at","the","cigarett","end","of","his","teen",",","who","drag","his","reluct","pal","to","their","home","town","and","onc","again","attempt","to","reach","the","fabl","pub",",","The","World","'s","End",".","As","they","attempt","to","reconcil","the","past","and","present",",","they","realiz","the","real","struggl","is","for","the","futur",",","not","just","their","but","humankind","'s",".","Reach","The","World","'s","End","is","the","least","of","their","worri","."],"lemmas":["20","year","after","attempt","a","epic","pub","crawl",",","five","childhood","friend","reunite","when","one","of","they","become","hell","bent","on","try","the","drinking","marathon","again",".","they","be","convince","to","stage","a","encore","by","mate","Gary","King",",","a","40-year","old","man","trap","at","the","cigarette","end","of","he","teens",",","who","drag","he","reluctant","pal","to","they","home","town","and","once","again","attempt","to","reach","the","fabled","pub",",","the","World","'s","End",".","as","they","attempt","to","reconcile","the","past","and","present",",","they","realize","the","real","struggle","be","for","the","future",",","not","just","theirs","but","humankind","'s",".","reach","the","World","'s","End","be","the","least","of","they","worry","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["20 years after","years after attempting","after attempting an","attempting an epic","an epic pub","epic pub crawl","pub crawl ,","crawl , five",", five childhood","five childhood friends","childhood friends reunite","friends reunite when","reunite when one","when one of","one of them","of them becomes","them becomes hell","becomes hell bent","hell bent on","bent on trying","on trying the","trying the drinking","the drinking marathon","drinking marathon again","They are convinced","are convinced to","convinced to stage","to stage an","stage an encore","an encore by","encore by mate","by mate Gary","mate Gary King","Gary King ,","King , a",", a 40-year","a 40-year old","40-year old man","old man trapped","man trapped at","trapped at the","at the cigarette","the cigarette end","cigarette end of","end of his","of his teens","his teens ,","teens , who",", who drags","who drags his","drags his reluctant","his reluctant pals","reluctant pals to","pals to their","to their home","their home town","home town and","town and once","and once again","once again attempts","again attempts to","attempts to reach","to reach the","reach the fabled","the fabled pub","fabled pub ,","pub , The",", The World","The World 's","World 's End","As they attempt","they attempt to","attempt to reconcile","to reconcile the","reconcile the past","the past and","past and present","and present ,","present , they",", they realize","they realize the","realize the real","the real struggle","real struggle is","struggle is for","is for the","for the future","the future ,","future , not",", not just","not just theirs","just theirs but","theirs but humankind","but humankind 's","Reaching The World","The World 's","World 's End","'s End is","End is the","is the least","the least of","least of their","of their worries"],"2grams":["20 years","years after","after attempting","attempting an","an epic","epic pub","pub crawl","crawl ,",", five","five childhood","childhood friends","friends reunite","reunite when","when one","one of","of them","them becomes","becomes hell","hell bent","bent on","on trying","trying the","the drinking","drinking marathon","marathon again","They are","are convinced","convinced to","to stage","stage an","an encore","encore by","by mate","mate Gary","Gary King","King ,",", a","a 40-year","40-year old","old man","man trapped","trapped at","at the","the cigarette","cigarette end","end of","of his","his teens","teens ,",", who","who drags","drags his","his reluctant","reluctant pals","pals to","to their","their home","home town","town and","and once","once again","again attempts","attempts to","to reach","reach the","the fabled","fabled pub","pub ,",", The","The World","World 's","'s End","As they","they attempt","attempt to","to reconcile","reconcile the","the past","past and","and present","present ,",", they","they realize","realize the","the real","real struggle","struggle is","is for","for the","the future","future ,",", not","not just","just theirs","theirs but","but humankind","humankind 's","Reaching The","The World","World 's","'s End","End is","is the","the least","least of","of their","their worries"]}

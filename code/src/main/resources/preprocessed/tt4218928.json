{"title":"FuckUmentary","plot":"A zombie appears in the middle of Seoul in 2001. Groups of people start to worship him, and in time they build a church in the name of the zombie. The honorary president of the church is the current president who, in the past, was really fucked up by the zombie himself. And a slew of morons from all over Korea still discuss/worship the zombie. The name of the zombie all these morons worship is-surprise!-the bearer of modern Korea, ex-president Park Jung-Hee.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","zombi","appear","in","the","middl","of","Seoul","in","2001",".","Group","of","peopl","start","to","worship","him",",","and","in","time","they","build","a","church","in","the","name","of","the","zombi",".","The","honorari","presid","of","the","church","is","the","current","presid","who",",","in","the","past",",","was","realli","fuck","up","by","the","zombi","himself",".","And","a","slew","of","moron","from","all","over","Korea","still","discuss/worship","the","zombi",".","The","name","of","the","zombi","all","these","moron","worship","is-surpris","!","-","the","bearer","of","modern","Korea",",","ex-presid","Park","Jung-He","."],"lemmas":["a","zombie","appear","in","the","middle","of","Seoul","in","2001",".","group","of","people","start","to","worship","he",",","and","in","time","they","build","a","church","in","the","name","of","the","zombie",".","the","honorary","president","of","the","church","be","the","current","president","who",",","in","the","past",",","be","really","fuck","up","by","the","zombie","himself",".","and","a","slew","of","moron","from","all","over","Korea","still","discuss/worship","the","zombie",".","the","name","of","the","zombie","all","these","moron","worship","is-surprise","!","-","the","bearer","of","modern","Korea",",","ex-president","Park","Jung-Hee","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A zombie appears","zombie appears in","appears in the","in the middle","the middle of","middle of Seoul","of Seoul in","Seoul in 2001","Groups of people","of people start","people start to","start to worship","to worship him","worship him ,","him , and",", and in","and in time","in time they","time they build","they build a","build a church","a church in","church in the","in the name","the name of","name of the","of the zombie","The honorary president","honorary president of","president of the","of the church","the church is","church is the","is the current","the current president","current president who","president who ,","who , in",", in the","in the past","the past ,","past , was",", was really","was really fucked","really fucked up","fucked up by","up by the","by the zombie","the zombie himself","And a slew","a slew of","slew of morons","of morons from","morons from all","from all over","all over Korea","over Korea still","Korea still discuss/worship","still discuss/worship the","discuss/worship the zombie","The name of","name of the","of the zombie","the zombie all","zombie all these","all these morons","these morons worship","morons worship is-surprise","- the bearer","the bearer of","bearer of modern","of modern Korea","modern Korea ,","Korea , ex-president",", ex-president Park","ex-president Park Jung-Hee"],"2grams":["A zombie","zombie appears","appears in","in the","the middle","middle of","of Seoul","Seoul in","in 2001","Groups of","of people","people start","start to","to worship","worship him","him ,",", and","and in","in time","time they","they build","build a","a church","church in","in the","the name","name of","of the","the zombie","The honorary","honorary president","president of","of the","the church","church is","is the","the current","current president","president who","who ,",", in","in the","the past","past ,",", was","was really","really fucked","fucked up","up by","by the","the zombie","zombie himself","And a","a slew","slew of","of morons","morons from","from all","all over","over Korea","Korea still","still discuss/worship","discuss/worship the","the zombie","The name","name of","of the","the zombie","zombie all","all these","these morons","morons worship","worship is-surprise","- the","the bearer","bearer of","of modern","modern Korea","Korea ,",", ex-president","ex-president Park","Park Jung-Hee"]}

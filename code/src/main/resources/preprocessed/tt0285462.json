{"title":"Boat Trip","plot":"Jerry and Nick are two best buddies whose love lives have hit rock bottom, Jerry's especially, having just vomited all over his fiancée on a hot air balloon trip prior to proposing to her. To escape their troubles and find women, they book a trip on board a cruise-liner, unaware the travel agent has just played a horrid trick on them in retaliation for Nick offending his secret gay lover. And that's the trick; it's a gay cruise-liner for gay men to meet and mingle. Slowly but surely, the two main characters begin to realize this and in turn get into a lot of humorous predicaments.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Jerri","and","Nick","are","two","best","buddi","whose","love","live","have","hit","rock","bottom",",","Jerri","'s","especi",",","have","just","vomit","all","over","his","fiancé","on","a","hot","air","balloon","trip","prior","to","propos","to","her",".","To","escap","their","troubl","and","find","women",",","they","book","a","trip","on","board","a","cruise-lin",",","unawar","the","travel","agent","has","just","play","a","horrid","trick","on","them","in","retali","for","Nick","offend","his","secret","gay","lover",".","And","that","'s","the","trick",";","it","'s","a","gay","cruise-lin","for","gay","men","to","meet","and","mingl",".","Slowli","but","sure",",","the","two","main","charact","begin","to","realiz","this","and","in","turn","get","into","a","lot","of","humor","predica","."],"lemmas":["Jerry","and","Nick","be","two","best","buddy","whose","love","life","have","hit","rock","bottom",",","Jerry","'s","especially",",","have","just","vomit","all","over","he","fiancée","on","a","hot","air","balloon","trip","prior","to","propose","to","she",".","to","escape","they","trouble","and","find","woman",",","they","book","a","trip","on","board","a","cruise-liner",",","unaware","the","travel","agent","have","just","play","a","horrid","trick","on","they","in","retaliation","for","Nick","offend","he","secret","gay","lover",".","and","that","be","the","trick",";","it","be","a","gay","cruise-liner","for","gay","man","to","meet","and","mingle",".","slowly","but","surely",",","the","two","main","character","begin","to","realize","this","and","in","turn","get","into","a","lot","of","humorous","predicament","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jerry and Nick","and Nick are","Nick are two","are two best","two best buddies","best buddies whose","buddies whose love","whose love lives","love lives have","lives have hit","have hit rock","hit rock bottom","rock bottom ,","bottom , Jerry",", Jerry 's","Jerry 's especially","'s especially ,","especially , having",", having just","having just vomited","just vomited all","vomited all over","all over his","over his fiancée","his fiancée on","fiancée on a","on a hot","a hot air","hot air balloon","air balloon trip","balloon trip prior","trip prior to","prior to proposing","to proposing to","proposing to her","To escape their","escape their troubles","their troubles and","troubles and find","and find women","find women ,","women , they",", they book","they book a","book a trip","a trip on","trip on board","on board a","board a cruise-liner","a cruise-liner ,","cruise-liner , unaware",", unaware the","unaware the travel","the travel agent","travel agent has","agent has just","has just played","just played a","played a horrid","a horrid trick","horrid trick on","trick on them","on them in","them in retaliation","in retaliation for","retaliation for Nick","for Nick offending","Nick offending his","offending his secret","his secret gay","secret gay lover","And that 's","that 's the","'s the trick","the trick ;","trick ;

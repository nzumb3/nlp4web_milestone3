{"title":"Secret Ballot","plot":"A soldier stationed on a deserted beach wakes up and discovers that it's not going to be an ordinary day: there are the elections, but nobody seems to know anything about them. Just as an electoral urn is being parachuted from the sky, a young woman disembarks on the beach. To the soldier's bafflement, it turns out that she is in charge of the mobile electoral seat and voting on the islands; therefore the soldier is obliged to obey her orders and escort her with his rifle and army jeep across the desert, where the woman obstinately intends to collect the votes. During the day, stressed by a series of absurd events, the two learn to get to know each other. At sunset, when the young woman leaves, the man realizes that the secret vote contained much more than he had ever imagined.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["A","soldier","station","on","a","desert","beach","wake","up","and","discov","that","it","'s","not","go","to","be","an","ordinari","day",":","there","are","the","elect",",","but","nobodi","seem","to","know","anyth","about","them",".","Just","as","an","elector","urn","is","be","parachut","from","the","sky",",","a","young","woman","disembark","on","the","beach",".","To","the","soldier","'s","bafflement",",","it","turn","out","that","she","is","in","charg","of","the","mobil","elector","seat","and","vote","on","the","island",";","therefor","the","soldier","is","oblig","to","obey","her","order","and","escort","her","with","his","rifl","and","armi","jeep","across","the","desert",",","where","the","woman","obstin","intend","to","collect","the","vote",".","Dure","the","day",",","stress","by","a","seri","of","absurd","event",",","the","two","learn","to","get","to","know","each","other",".","At","sunset",",","when","the","young","woman","leav",",","the","man","realiz","that","the","secret","vote","contain","much","more","than","he","had","ever","imagin","."],"lemmas":["a","soldier","station","on","a","desert","beach","wake","up","and","discover","that","it","be","not","go","to","be","a","ordinary","day",":","there","be","the","election",",","but","nobody","seem","to","know","anything","about","they",".","just","as","a","electoral","urn","be","be","parachute","from","the","sky",",","a","young","woman","disembark","on","the","beach",".","to","the","soldier","'s","bafflement",",","it","turn","out","that","she","be","in","charge","of","the","mobile","electoral","seat","and","voting","on","the","island",";","therefore","the","soldier","be","oblige","to","obey","she","order","and","escort","she","with","he","rifle","and","army","jeep","across","the","desert",",","where","the","woman","obstinately","intend","to","collect","the","vote",".","during","the","day",",","stress","by","a","series","of","absurd","event",",","the","two","learn","to","get","to","know","each","other",".","at","sunset",",","when","the","young","woman","leave",",","the","man","realize","that","the","secret","vote","contain","much","more","than","he","have","ever","imagine","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A soldier stationed","soldier stationed on","stationed on a","on a deserted","a deserted beach","deserted beach wakes","beach wakes up","wakes up and","up and discovers","and discovers that","discovers that it","that it 's","it 's not","'s not going","not going to","going to be","to be an","be an ordinary","an ordinary day","ordinary day :","day : there",": there are","there are the","are the elections","the elections ,","elections , but",", but nobody","but nobody seems","nobody seems to","seems to know","to know anything","know anything about","anything about them","Just as an","as an electoral","an electoral urn","electoral urn is","urn is being","is being parachuted","being parachuted from","parachuted from the","from the sky","the sky ,","sky , a",", a young","a young woman","young woman disembarks","woman disembarks on","disembarks on the","on the beach","To the soldier","the soldier 's","soldier 's bafflement","'s bafflement ,","bafflement , it",", it turns","it turns out","turns out that","out that she","that she is","she is in","is in charge","in charge of","charge of the","of the mobile","the mobile electoral","mobile electoral seat","electoral seat and","seat and voting","and voting on","voting on the","on the islands","the islands ;","islands ;

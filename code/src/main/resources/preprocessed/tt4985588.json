{"title":"Return to Cuba","plot":"A documentary about the return of a Cuban migrant to her homeland. After 18 years living in Italy, Barbara Ramos returns to live in Cuba. In the small town of Santa Clara, she discovers through family and friends what has changed in Cuba but also what has not and will likely never change. Shot over a period of three years - the time it took Barbara to build her dream house - 'Return To Cuba' chronicles her life in the wake of Raul Castro's liberal reforms and reconciliation with the United States of America. A new Cuban reality reveals itself with spirit, energy and humour.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","documentari","about","the","return","of","a","Cuban","migrant","to","her","homeland",".","After","18","year","live","in","Itali",",","Barbara","Ramo","return","to","live","in","Cuba",".","In","the","small","town","of","Santa","Clara",",","she","discov","through","famili","and","friend","what","has","chang","in","Cuba","but","also","what","has","not","and","will","like","never","chang",".","Shot","over","a","period","of","three","year","-","the","time","it","took","Barbara","to","build","her","dream","hous","-","'","Return","To","Cuba","'","chronicl","her","life","in","the","wake","of","Raul","Castro","'s","liber","reform","and","reconcili","with","the","Unite","State","of","America",".","A","new","Cuban","realiti","reveal","itself","with","spirit",",","energi","and","humour","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","about","the","return","of","a","cuban","migrant","to","she","homeland",".","after","18","year","live","in","Italy",",","Barbara","Ramos","return","to","live","in","Cuba",".","in","the","small","town","of","Santa","Clara",",","she","discover","through","family","and","friend","what","have","change","in","Cuba","but","also","what","have","not","and","will","likely","never","change",".","shot","over","a","period","of","three","year","-","the","time","it","take","Barbara","to","build","she","dream","house","-","'","return","to","Cuba","'","chronicle","she","life","in","the","wake","of","Raul","Castro","'s","liberal","reform","and","reconciliation","with","the","United","States","of","America",".","a","new","Cuban","reality","reveal","itself","with","spirit",",","energy","and","humour","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A documentary about","documentary about the","about the return","the return of","return of a","of a Cuban","a Cuban migrant","Cuban migrant to","migrant to her","to her homeland","After 18 years","18 years living","years living in","living in Italy","in Italy ,","Italy , Barbara",", Barbara Ramos","Barbara Ramos returns","Ramos returns to","returns to live","to live in","live in Cuba","In the small","the small town","small town of","town of Santa","of Santa Clara","Santa Clara ,","Clara , she",", she discovers","she discovers through","discovers through family","through family and","family and friends","and friends what","friends what has","what has changed","has changed in","changed in Cuba","in Cuba but","Cuba but also","but also what","also what has","what has not","has not and","not and will","and will likely","will likely never","likely never change","Shot over a","over a period","a period of","period of three","of three years","three years -","years - the","- the time","the time it","time it took","it took Barbara","took Barbara to","Barbara to build","to build her","build her dream","her dream house","dream house -","house - '","- ' Return","' Return To","Return To Cuba","To Cuba '","Cuba ' chronicles","' chronicles her","chronicles her life","her life in","life in the","in the wake","the wake of","wake of Raul","of Raul Castro","Raul Castro 's","Castro 's liberal","'s liberal reforms","liberal reforms and","reforms and reconciliation","and reconciliation with","reconciliation with the","with the United","the United States","United States of","States of America","A new Cuban","new Cuban reality","Cuban reality reveals","reality reveals itself","reveals itself with","itself with spirit","with spirit ,","spirit , energy",", energy and","energy and humour"],"2grams":["A documentary","documentary about","about the","the return","return of","of a","a Cuban","Cuban migrant","migrant to","to her","her homeland","After 18","18 years","years living","living in","in Italy","Italy ,",", Barbara","Barbara Ramos","Ramos returns","returns to","to live","live in","in Cuba","In the","the small","small town","town of","of Santa","Santa Clara","Clara ,",", she","she discovers","discovers through","through family","family and","and friends","friends what","what has","has changed","changed in","in Cuba","Cuba but","but also","also what","what has","has not","not and","and will","will likely","likely never","never change","Shot over","over a","a period","period of","of three","three years","years -","- the","the time","time it","it took","took Barbara","Barbara to","to build","build her","her dream","dream house","house -","- '","' Return","Return To","To Cuba","Cuba '","' chronicles","chronicles her","her life","life in","in the","the wake","wake of","of Raul","Raul Castro","Castro 's","'s liberal","liberal reforms","reforms and","and reconciliation","reconciliation with","with the","the United","United States","States of","of America","A new","new Cuban","Cuban reality","reality reveals","reveals itself","itself with","with spirit","spirit ,",", energy","energy and","and humour"]}

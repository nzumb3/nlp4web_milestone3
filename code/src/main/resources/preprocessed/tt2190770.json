{"title":"Neuk√∂lln-Aktiv","plot":"Without graduation and no prospect of vocational training young males between 17 and 25 are outsiders in a labor-oriented society. The Job Center and the Youth Welfare Service of Berlin's district Neukoelln fund a small team of teachers and social workers, who work full time in order to 'activate' the young men. The film observes the measure 'Neukoelln-Active' with a Direct Cinema approach over a period of three months. It shows fairly successful attempts and hollow rituals, imposition of discipline and social-pedagogical interventions that go far beyond the scope of the 'activation measure'. It also shows the institutions troubled relations to the sponsors of the program, who foster a questionable attitude towards administering the young 'customers'.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Without","graduat","and","no","prospect","of","vocat","train","young","male","between","17","and","25","are","outsid","in","a","labor-ori","societi",".","The","Job","Center","and","the","Youth","Welfar","Servic","of","Berlin","'s","district","Neukoelln","fund","a","small","team","of","teacher","and","social","worker",",","who","work","full","time","in","order","to","'","activ","'","the","young","men",".","The","film","observ","the","measur","'","Neukoelln-Act","'","with","a","Direct","Cinema","approach","over","a","period","of","three","month",".","It","show","fair","success","attempt","and","hollow","ritual",",","imposit","of","disciplin","and","social-pedagog","intervent","that","go","far","beyond","the","scope","of","the","'","activ","measur","'",".","It","also","show","the","institut","troubl","relat","to","the","sponsor","of","the","program",",","who","foster","a","question","attitud","toward","administ","the","young","'","custom","'","."],"lemmas":["without","graduation","and","no","prospect","of","vocational","training","young","male","between","17","and","25","be","outsider","in","a","labor-oriented","society",".","the","Job","Center","and","the","Youth","Welfare","Service","of","Berlin","'s","district","Neukoelln","fund","a","small","team","of","teacher","and","social","worker",",","who","work","full","time","in","order","to","'","activate","'","the","young","man",".","the","film","observe","the","measure","'","neukoelln-active","'","with","a","Direct","Cinema","approach","over","a","period","of","three","month",".","it","show","fairly","successful","attempt","and","hollow","ritual",",","imposition","of","discipline","and","social-pedagogical","intervention","that","go","far","beyond","the","scope","of","the","'","activation","measure","'",".","it","also","show","the","institution","trouble","relation","to","the","sponsor","of","the","program",",","who","foster","a","questionable","attitude","towards","administer","the","young","'","customer","'","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Without

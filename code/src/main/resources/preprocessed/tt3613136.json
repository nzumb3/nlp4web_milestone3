{"title":"Pretty Girl, Why Have You Come, Do You Want to Do My Job?","plot":"A look at the Armenian people's campaign to preserve the forest of Teghut, which is threatened by mining. The loosely organized Occupy Teghut movement finds inspiration in Occupy Wall Street while trying to launch an apolitically motivated movement to fight the country's social ills. This documentary record of an activist march through Teghut forest, and of the bureaucracy involved in entering the area, paints a broader picture of a deplorable societal situation. For the young Armenians, environmental protection begins with redemption from poverty.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","look","at","the","Armenian","peopl","'s","campaign","to","preserv","the","forest","of","Teghut",",","which","is","threaten","by","mine",".","The","loos","organ","Occupi","Teghut","movement","find","inspir","in","Occupi","Wall","Street","while","tri","to","launch","an","apolit","motiv","movement","to","fight","the","countri","'s","social","ill",".","This","documentari","record","of","an","activist","march","through","Teghut","forest",",","and","of","the","bureaucraci","involv","in","enter","the","area",",","paint","a","broader","pictur","of","a","deplor","societ","situat",".","For","the","young","Armenian",",","environment","protect","begin","with","redempt","from","poverti","."],"lemmas":["a","look","at","the","armenian","people","'s","campaign","to","preserve","the","forest","of","Teghut",",","which","be","threaten","by","mining",".","the","loosely","organize","Occupy","Teghut","movement","find","inspiration","in","Occupy","Wall","Street","while","try","to","launch","a","apolitically","motivated","movement","to","fight","the","country","'s","social","ill",".","this","documentary","record","of","a","activist","march","through","Teghut","forest",",","and","of","the","bureaucracy","involve","in","enter","the","area",",","paint","a","broader","picture","of","a","deplorable","societal","situation",".","for","the","young","Armenians",",","environmental","protection","begin","with","redemption","from","poverty","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A look at","look at the","at the Armenian","the Armenian people","Armenian people 's","people 's campaign","'s campaign to","campaign to preserve","to preserve the","preserve the forest","the forest of","forest of Teghut","of Teghut ,","Teghut , which",", which is","which is threatened","is threatened by","threatened by mining","The loosely organized","loosely organized Occupy","organized Occupy Teghut","Occupy Teghut movement","Teghut movement finds","movement finds inspiration","finds inspiration in","inspiration in Occupy","in Occupy Wall","Occupy Wall Street","Wall Street while","Street while trying","while trying to","trying to launch","to launch an","launch an apolitically","an apolitically motivated","apolitically motivated movement","motivated movement to","movement to fight","to fight the","fight the country","the country 's","country 's social","'s social ills","This documentary record","documentary record of","record of an","of an activist","an activist march","activist march through","march through Teghut","through Teghut forest","Teghut forest ,","forest , and",", and of","and of the","of the bureaucracy","the bureaucracy involved","bureaucracy involved in","involved in entering","in entering the","entering the area","the area ,","area , paints",", paints a","paints a broader","a broader picture","broader picture of","picture of a","of a deplorable","a deplorable societal","deplorable societal situation","For the young","the young Armenians","young Armenians ,","Armenians , environmental",", environmental protection","environmental protection begins","protection begins with","begins with redemption","with redemption from","redemption from poverty"],"2grams":["A look","look at","at the","the Armenian","Armenian people","people 's","'s campaign","campaign to","to preserve","preserve the","the forest","forest of","of Teghut","Teghut ,",", which","which is","is threatened","threatened by","by mining","The loosely","loosely organized","organized Occupy","Occupy Teghut","Teghut movement","movement finds","finds inspiration","inspiration in","in Occupy","Occupy Wall","Wall Street","Street while","while trying","trying to","to launch","launch an","an apolitically","apolitically motivated","motivated movement","movement to","to fight","fight the","the country","country 's","'s social","social ills","This documentary","documentary record","record of","of an","an activist","activist march","march through","through Teghut","Teghut forest","forest ,",", and","and of","of the","the bureaucracy","bureaucracy involved","involved in","in entering","entering the","the area","area ,",", paints","paints a","a broader","broader picture","picture of","of a","a deplorable","deplorable societal","societal situation","For the","the young","young Armenians","Armenians ,",", environmental","environmental protection","protection begins","begins with","with redemption","redemption from","from poverty"]}

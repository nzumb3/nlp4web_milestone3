{"title":"The Dark Dealer","plot":"A trio of desperate men are forced to participate in a nightmarish game of blackjack for their souls. The circumstances behind how these fellows wound up in purgatory are revealed in three individual segments: Two vicious hoodlums break into the basement dwelling of an old hermit who isn't nearly as harmless as he appears to be; an unscrupulous entertainment lawyer gets more than he bargained for when he decides to steal several songs from a deceased blues singer; and a young ex-con agrees to help a scuzzy drug dealer rob a pharmaceutical lab in order to save his girlfriend from the clutches of said dope pusher.","genres":["Comedy"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["A","trio","of","desper","men","are","forc","to","particip","in","a","nightmarish","game","of","blackjack","for","their","soul",".","The","circumst","behind","how","these","fellow","wound","up","in","purgatori","are","reveal","in","three","individu","segment",":","Two","vicious","hoodlum","break","into","the","basement","dwell","of","an","old","hermit","who","is","n't","near","as","harmless","as","he","appear","to","be",";","an","unscrupul","entertain","lawyer","get","more","than","he","bargain","for","when","he","decid","to","steal","sever","song","from","a","deceas","blue","singer",";","and","a","young","ex-con","agre","to","help","a","scuzzi","drug","dealer","rob","a","pharmaceut","lab","in","order","to","save","his","girlfriend","from","the","clutch","of","said","dope","pusher","."],"lemmas":["a","trio","of","desperate","man","be","force","to","participate","in","a","nightmarish","game","of","blackjack","for","they","soul",".","the","circumstance","behind","how","these","fellow","wind","up","in","purgatory","be","reveal","in","three","individual","segment",":","two","vicious","hoodlum","break","into","the","basement","dwelling","of","a","old","hermit","who","be","not","nearly","as","harmless","as","he","appear","to","be",";","a","unscrupulous","entertainment","lawyer","get","more","than","he","bargain","for","when","he","decide","to","steal","several","song","from","a","deceased","blues","singer",";","and","a","young","ex-con","agree","to","help","a","scuzzy","drug","dealer","rob","a","pharmaceutical","lab","in","order","to","save","he","girlfriend","from","the","clutch","of","say","dope","pusher","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A trio of","trio of desperate","of desperate men","desperate men are","men are forced","are forced to","forced to participate","to participate in","participate in a","in a nightmarish","a nightmarish game","nightmarish game of","game of blackjack","of blackjack for","blackjack for their","for their souls","The circumstances behind","circumstances behind how","behind how these","how these fellows","these fellows wound","fellows wound up","wound up in","up in purgatory","in purgatory are","purgatory are revealed","are revealed in","revealed in three","in three individual","three individual segments","individual segments :","segments : Two",": Two vicious","Two vicious hoodlums","vicious hoodlums break","hoodlums break into","break into the","into the basement","the basement dwelling","basement dwelling of","dwelling of an","of an old","an old hermit","old hermit who","hermit who is","who is n't","is n't nearly","n't nearly as","nearly as harmless","as harmless as","harmless as he","as he appears","he appears to","appears to be","to be ;","be ;

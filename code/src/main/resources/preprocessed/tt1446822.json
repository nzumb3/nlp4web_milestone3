{"title":"Anyone Accept David","plot":"Softball may seem like a trivial sport to some, but not for Jason, a small town high school senior, who loves the game. Jason struggles not with good ball playing, but with acceptance by his friends on the Sluggers softball team. Easy enough, except for one problem: his younger brother, David. In Jason's mind, David is a hopeless klutz without remedy, and very embarrassing to have join the team. In reality, David is an average early teenager, trying to make it to manhood without getting squashed. Unable to discern the reason for Jason's attitude, David wonders if their relationship will ever be like it once was when they were younger. Jason's disdain for David leads to his own ostracization from his friends.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Softbal","may","seem","like","a","trivial","sport","to","some",",","but","not","for","Jason",",","a","small","town","high","school","senior",",","who","love","the","game",".","Jason","struggl","not","with","good","ball","play",",","but","with","accept","by","his","friend","on","the","Slugger","softbal","team",".","Easi","enough",",","except","for","one","problem",":","his","younger","brother",",","David",".","In","Jason","'s","mind",",","David","is","a","hopeless","klutz","without","remedi",",","and","veri","embarrass","to","have","join","the","team",".","In","realiti",",","David","is","an","averag","earli","teenag",",","tri","to","make","it","to","manhood","without","get","squash",".","Unabl","to","discern","the","reason","for","Jason","'s","attitud",",","David","wonder","if","their","relationship","will","ever","be","like","it","onc","was","when","they","were","younger",".","Jason","'s","disdain","for","David","lead","to","his","own","ostrac","from","his","friend","."],"lemmas":["softball","may","seem","like","a","trivial","sport","to","some",",","but","not","for","Jason",",","a","small","town","high","school","senior",",","who","love","the","game",".","Jason","struggle","not","with","good","ball","playing",",","but","with","acceptance","by","he","friend","on","the","Sluggers","softball","team",".","Easy","enough",",","except","for","one","problem",":","he","younger","brother",",","David",".","in","Jason","'s","mind",",","David","be","a","hopeless","klutz","without","remedy",",","and","very","embarrassing","to","have","join","the","team",".","in","reality",",","David","be","a","average","early","teenager",",","try","to","make","it","to","manhood","without","get","squashed",".","unable","to","discern","the","reason","for","Jason","'s","attitude",",","David","wonder","if","they","relationship","will","ever","be","like","it","once","be","when","they","be","younger",".","Jason","'s","disdain","for","David","lead","to","he","own","ostracization","from","he","friend","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Softball

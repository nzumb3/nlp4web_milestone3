{"title":"Songs of the Blue Hills","plot":"Contrary to the general misconception even within India, the Nagas are not a single tribe. Rather, they comprise a range of ethnic communities spread across several states of Northeastern India and also Northwestern Myanmar. Like ethnic communities the world over, folk music and dances form the core of Naga culture, but what makes it even more important ethnographically is the fact that the Naga folk traditions also comprise the tradition of oral history-keeping. Naga folk songs, thus, could be like any other folk song, and also could be an historical account of an important incident from the past. This feature-length documentary is the first-ever film to present such a wide range of Naga music - and musicians - together.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," History"],"stems":["Contrari","to","the","general","misconcept","even","within","India",",","the","Naga","are","not","a","singl","tribe",".","Rather",",","they","compris","a","rang","of","ethnic","communiti","spread","across","sever","state","of","Northeastern","India","and","also","Northwestern","Myanmar",".","Like","ethnic","communiti","the","world","over",",","folk","music","and","danc","form","the","core","of","Naga","cultur",",","but","what","make","it","even","more","import","ethnograph","is","the","fact","that","the","Naga","folk","tradit","also","compris","the","tradit","of","oral","history-keep",".","Naga","folk","song",",","thus",",","could","be","like","ani","other","folk","song",",","and","also","could","be","an","histor","account","of","an","import","incid","from","the","past",".","This","feature-length","documentari","is","the","first-ev","film","to","present","such","a","wide","rang","of","Naga","music","-","and","musician","-","togeth","."],"lemmas":["contrary","to","the","general","misconception","even","within","India",",","the","Nagas","be","not","a","single","tribe",".","rather",",","they","comprise","a","range","of","ethnic","community","spread","across","several","state","of","Northeastern","India","and","also","Northwestern","Myanmar",".","like","ethnic","community","the","world","over",",","folk","music","and","dance","form","the","core","of","naga","culture",",","but","what","make","it","even","more","important","ethnographically","be","the","fact","that","the","Naga","folk","tradition","also","comprise","the","tradition","of","oral","history-keeping",".","naga","folk","song",",","thus",",","could","be","like","any","other","folk","song",",","and","also","could","be","a","historical","account","of","a","important","incident","from","the","past",".","this","feature-length","documentary","be","the","first-ever","film","to","present","such","a","wide","range","of","naga","music","-","and","musician","-","together","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Contrary to the","to the general","the general misconception","general misconception even","misconception even within","even within India","within India ,","India , the",", the Nagas","the Nagas are","Nagas are not","are not a","not a single","a single tribe","Rather , they",", they comprise","they comprise a","comprise a range","a range of","range of ethnic","of ethnic communities","ethnic communities spread","communities spread across","spread across several","across several states","several states of","states of Northeastern","of Northeastern India","Northeastern India and","India and also","and also Northwestern","also Northwestern Myanmar","Like ethnic communities","ethnic communities the","communities the world","the world over","world over ,","over , folk",", folk music","folk music and","music and dances","and dances form","dances form the","form the core","the core of","core of Naga","of Naga culture","Naga culture ,","culture , but",", but what","but what makes","what makes it","makes it even","it even more","even more important","more important ethnographically","important ethnographically is","ethnographically is the","is the fact","the fact that","fact that the","that the Naga","the Naga folk","Naga folk traditions","folk traditions also","traditions also comprise","also comprise the","comprise the tradition","the tradition of","tradition of oral","of oral history-keeping","Naga folk songs","folk songs ,","songs , thus",", thus ,","thus , could",", could be","could be like","be like any","like any other","any other folk","other folk song","folk song ,","song , and",", and also","and also could","also could be","could be an","be an historical","an historical account","historical account of","account of an","of an important","an important incident","important incident from","incident from the","from the past","This feature-length documentary","feature-length documentary is","documentary is the","is the first-ever","the first-ever film","first-ever film to","film to present","to present such","present such a","such a wide","a wide range","wide range of","range of Naga","of Naga music","Naga music -","music -

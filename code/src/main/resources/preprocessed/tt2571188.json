{"title":"Redbelly","plot":"A grim, mind-bending fairy tale which follows a brother and sister who are banished as children by their father, a greedy and lecherous King. The Princess is locked in a lone tower where she lives for years in complete isolation, surrounding herself with a vast menagerie of tiny objects which become the locus of her disturbed imagination. The Prince, abandoned in a swamp with the magical glass vessel that serves as his stomach, is found and raised by a Moonshiner, who uses the boy for slave labor and the vessel as a receptacle for his poisonous shine.","genres":["Drama"," Fantasy"],"stems":["A","grim",",","mind-bend","fairi","tale","which","follow","a","brother","and","sister","who","are","banish","as","children","by","their","father",",","a","greedi","and","lecher","King",".","The","Princess","is","lock","in","a","lone","tower","where","she","live","for","year","in","complet","isol",",","surround","herself","with","a","vast","menageri","of","tini","object","which","becom","the","locus","of","her","disturb","imagin",".","The","Princ",",","abandon","in","a","swamp","with","the","magic","glass","vessel","that","serv","as","his","stomach",",","is","found","and","rais","by","a","Moonshin",",","who","use","the","boy","for","slave","labor","and","the","vessel","as","a","receptacl","for","his","poison","shine","."],"lemmas":["a","grim",",","mind-bending","fairy","tale","which","follow","a","brother","and","sister","who","be","banish","as","child","by","they","father",",","a","greedy","and","lecherous","King",".","the","Princess","be","lock","in","a","lone","tower","where","she","live","for","year","in","complete","isolation",",","surround","herself","with","a","vast","menagerie","of","tiny","object","which","become","the","locus","of","she","disturbed","imagination",".","the","Prince",",","abandon","in","a","swamp","with","the","magical","glass","vessel","that","serve","as","he","stomach",",","be","find","and","raise","by","a","Moonshiner",",","who","use","the","boy","for","slave","labor","and","the","vessel","as","a","receptacle","for","he","poisonous","shine","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A grim ,","grim , mind-bending",", mind-bending fairy","mind-bending fairy tale","fairy tale which","tale which follows","which follows a","follows a brother","a brother and","brother and sister","and sister who","sister who are","who are banished","are banished as","banished as children","as children by","children by their","by their father","their father ,","father , a",", a greedy","a greedy and","greedy and lecherous","and lecherous King","The Princess is","Princess is locked","is locked in","locked in a","in a lone","a lone tower","lone tower where","tower where she","where she lives","she lives for","lives for years","for years in","years in complete","in complete isolation","complete isolation ,","isolation , surrounding",", surrounding herself","surrounding herself with","herself with a","with a vast","a vast menagerie","vast menagerie of","menagerie of tiny","of tiny objects","tiny objects which","objects which become","which become the","become the locus","the locus of","locus of her","of her disturbed","her disturbed imagination","The Prince ,","Prince , abandoned",", abandoned in","abandoned in a","in a swamp","a swamp with","swamp with the","with the magical","the magical glass","magical glass vessel","glass vessel that","vessel that serves","that serves as","serves as his","as his stomach","his stomach ,","stomach , is",", is found","is found and","found and raised","and raised by","raised by a","by a Moonshiner","a Moonshiner ,","Moonshiner , who",", who uses","who uses the","uses the boy","the boy for","boy for slave","for slave labor","slave labor and","labor and the","and the vessel","the vessel as","vessel as a","as a receptacle","a receptacle for","receptacle for his","for his poisonous","his poisonous shine"],"2grams":["A grim","grim ,",", mind-bending","mind-bending fairy","fairy tale","tale which","which follows","follows a","a brother","brother and","and sister","sister who","who are","are banished","banished as","as children","children by","by their","their father","father ,",", a","a greedy","greedy and","and lecherous","lecherous King","The Princess","Princess is","is locked","locked in","in a","a lone","lone tower","tower where","where she","she lives","lives for","for years","years in","in complete","complete isolation","isolation ,",", surrounding","surrounding herself","herself with","with a","a vast","vast menagerie","menagerie of","of tiny","tiny objects","objects which","which become","become the","the locus","locus of","of her","her disturbed","disturbed imagination","The Prince","Prince ,",", abandoned","abandoned in","in a","a swamp","swamp with","with the","the magical","magical glass","glass vessel","vessel that","that serves","serves as","as his","his stomach","stomach ,",", is","is found","found and","and raised","raised by","by a","a Moonshiner","Moonshiner ,",", who","who uses","uses the","the boy","boy for","for slave","slave labor","labor and","and the","the vessel","vessel as","as a","a receptacle","receptacle for","for his","his poisonous","poisonous shine"]}

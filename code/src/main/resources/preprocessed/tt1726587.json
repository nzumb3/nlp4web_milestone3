{"title":"Alpini","plot":"The tormented history of the twentieth century northern Italy feeds this major work by the writer Mario Rigoni Stern. In this final account (he died in June 2008), he takes us on a journey through the imagination of Asiago's mountain people. To man's place at the heart of nature, at the heart of war, blenched in with the writer's voice. A territory that is but a border, the ever-present fascist past, war inscribed underneath a snowy peacefulness... where man resides.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","torment","histori","of","the","twentieth","centuri","northern","Itali","feed","this","major","work","by","the","writer","Mario","Rigoni","Stern",".","In","this","final","account","(","he","die","in","June","2008",")",",","he","take","us","on","a","journey","through","the","imagin","of","Asiago","'s","mountain","peopl",".","To","man","'s","place","at","the","heart","of","natur",",","at","the","heart","of","war",",","blench","in","with","the","writer","'s","voic",".","A","territori","that","is","but","a","border",",","the","ever-pres","fascist","past",",","war","inscrib","underneath","a","snowi","peac","...","where","man","resid","."],"lemmas":["the","tormented","history","of","the","twentieth","century","northern","Italy","feed","this","major","work","by","the","writer","Mario","Rigoni","Stern",".","in","this","final","account","-lrb-","he","die","in","June","2008","-rrb-",",","he","take","we","on","a","journey","through","the","imagination","of","Asiago","'s","mountain","people",".","to","man","'s","place","at","the","heart","of","nature",",","at","the","heart","of","war",",","blench","in","with","the","writer","'s","voice",".","a","territory","that","be","but","a","border",",","the","ever-present","fascist","past",",","war","inscribe","underneath","a","snowy","peacefulness","...","where","man","reside","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The tormented history","tormented history of","history of the","of the twentieth","the twentieth century","twentieth century northern","century northern Italy","northern Italy feeds","Italy feeds this","feeds this major","this major work","major work by","work by the","by the writer","the writer Mario","writer Mario Rigoni","Mario Rigoni Stern","In this final","this final account","final account (","account ( he","( he died","he died in","died in June","in June 2008","June 2008 )","2008 ) ,",") , he",", he takes","he takes us","takes us on","us on a","on a journey","a journey through","journey through the","through the imagination","the imagination of","imagination of Asiago","of Asiago 's","Asiago 's mountain","'s mountain people","To man 's","man 's place","'s place at","place at the","at the heart","the heart of","heart of nature","of nature ,","nature , at",", at the","at the heart","the heart of","heart of war","of war ,","war , blenched",", blenched in","blenched in with","in with the","with the writer","the writer 's","writer 's voice","A territory that","territory that is","that is but","is but a","but a border","a border ,","border , the",", the ever-present","the ever-present fascist","ever-present fascist past","fascist past ,","past , war",", war inscribed","war inscribed underneath","inscribed underneath a","underneath a snowy","a snowy peacefulness","snowy peacefulness ...","peacefulness ... where","... where man","where man resides"],"2grams":["The tormented","tormented history","history of","of the","the twentieth","twentieth century","century northern","northern Italy","Italy feeds","feeds this","this major","major work","work by","by the","the writer","writer Mario","Mario Rigoni","Rigoni Stern","In this","this final","final account","account (","( he","he died","died in","in June","June 2008","2008 )",") ,",", he","he takes","takes us","us on","on a","a journey","journey through","through the","the imagination","imagination of","of Asiago","Asiago 's","'s mountain","mountain people","To man","man 's","'s place","place at","at the","the heart","heart of","of nature","nature ,",", at","at the","the heart","heart of","of war","war ,",", blenched","blenched in","in with","with the","the writer","writer 's","'s voice","A territory","territory that","that is","is but","but a","a border","border ,",", the","the ever-present","ever-present fascist","fascist past","past ,",", war","war inscribed","inscribed underneath","underneath a","a snowy","snowy peacefulness","peacefulness ...","... where","where man","man resides"]}

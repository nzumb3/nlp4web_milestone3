{"title":"The Suffering Grasses: When Elephants Fight, It Is the Grass That Suffers","plot":"With thousands dead and counting, the ongoing conflict in Syria has become a microcosm for the complicated politics of the region, and an unsavory reflection of the world at large. Against the backdrop of the Arab Spring and the complicated politics of the region, this film explores the Syrian conflict through the humanity of the civilians who have been killed, abused, and displaced. In all such conflicts, it is civilians, women and children, families and whole communities, who suffer at the leisure of those in power. When elephants go to war, it is the grass that suffers.","genres":["Documentary"," War"," News"],"stems":["With","thousand","dead","and","count",",","the","ongo","conflict","in","Syria","has","becom","a","microcosm","for","the","complic","polit","of","the","region",",","and","an","unsavori","reflect","of","the","world","at","larg",".","Against","the","backdrop","of","the","Arab","Spring","and","the","complic","polit","of","the","region",",","this","film","explor","the","Syrian","conflict","through","the","human","of","the","civilian","who","have","been","kill",",","abus",",","and","displac",".","In","all","such","conflict",",","it","is","civilian",",","women","and","children",",","famili","and","whole","communiti",",","who","suffer","at","the","leisur","of","those","in","power",".","When","eleph","go","to","war",",","it","is","the","grass","that","suffer","."],"lemmas":["with","thousand","dead","and","counting",",","the","ongoing","conflict","in","Syria","have","become","a","microcosm","for","the","complicated","politics","of","the","region",",","and","a","unsavory","reflection","of","the","world","at","large",".","against","the","backdrop","of","the","Arab","Spring","and","the","complicated","politics","of","the","region",",","this","film","explore","the","syrian","conflict","through","the","humanity","of","the","civilian","who","have","be","kill",",","abuse",",","and","displaced",".","in","all","such","conflict",",","it","be","civilian",",","woman","and","child",",","family","and","whole","community",",","who","suffer","at","the","leisure","of","those","in","power",".","when","elephant","go","to","war",",","it","be","the","grass","that","suffer","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["With thousands dead","thousands dead and","dead and counting","and counting ,","counting , the",", the ongoing","the ongoing conflict","ongoing conflict in","conflict in Syria","in Syria has","Syria has become","has become a","become a microcosm","a microcosm for","microcosm for the","for the complicated","the complicated politics","complicated politics of","politics of the","of the region","the region ,","region , and",", and an","and an unsavory","an unsavory reflection","unsavory reflection of","reflection of the","of the world","the world at","world at large","Against the backdrop","the backdrop of","backdrop of the","of the Arab","the Arab Spring","Arab Spring and","Spring and the","and the complicated","the complicated politics","complicated politics of","politics of the","of the region","the region ,","region , this",", this film","this film explores","film explores the","explores the Syrian","the Syrian conflict","Syrian conflict through","conflict through the","through the humanity","the humanity of","humanity of the","of the civilians","the civilians who","civilians who have","who have been","have been killed","been killed ,","killed , abused",", abused ,","abused , and",", and displaced","In all such","all such conflicts","such conflicts ,","conflicts , it",", it is","it is civilians","is civilians ,","civilians , women",", women and","women and children","and children ,","children , families",", families and","families and whole","and whole communities","whole communities ,","communities , who",", who suffer","who suffer at","suffer at the","at the leisure","the leisure of","leisure of those","of those in","those in power","When elephants go","elephants go to","go to war","to war ,","war , it",", it is","it is the","is the grass","the grass that","grass that suffers"],"2grams":["With thousands","thousands dead","dead and","and counting","counting ,",", the","the ongoing","ongoing conflict","conflict in","in Syria","Syria has","has become","become a","a microcosm","microcosm for","for the","the complicated","complicated politics","politics of","of the","the region","region ,",", and","and an","an unsavory","unsavory reflection","reflection of","of the","the world","world at","at large","Against the","the backdrop","backdrop of","of the","the Arab","Arab Spring","Spring and","and the","the complicated","complicated politics","politics of","of the","the region","region ,",", this","this film","film explores","explores the","the Syrian","Syrian conflict","conflict through","through the","the humanity","humanity of","of the","the civilians","civilians who","who have","have been","been killed","killed ,",", abused","abused ,",", and","and displaced","In all","all such","such conflicts","conflicts ,",", it","it is","is civilians","civilians ,",", women","women and","and children","children ,",", families","families and","and whole","whole communities","communities ,",", who","who suffer","suffer at","at the","the leisure","leisure of","of those","those in","in power","When elephants","elephants go","go to","to war","war ,",", it","it is","is the","the grass","grass that","that suffers"]}

{"title":"Breathe In, Breathe Out","plot":"The generation gap is difficult enough to bridge on its own-add a father's service in Vietnam and the gap gets even wider. Following three veterans and their grown children back to the land where they witnessed incredible carnage as soldiers, director Beth B investigates \"what we pass on from one generation to the next\" in the hope that the experience will help both fathers and children come to grips with the war and each other. In doing so, she provides proof that the trauma of war does not end when peace begins.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","generat","gap","is","difficult","enough","to","bridg","on","it","own-add","a","father","'s","servic","in","Vietnam","and","the","gap","get","even","wider",".","Follow","three","veteran","and","their","grown","children","back","to","the","land","where","they","wit","incred","carnag","as","soldier",",","director","Beth","B","investig","\"","what","we","pass","on","from","one","generat","to","the","next","\"","in","the","hope","that","the","experi","will","help","both","father","and","children","come","to","grip","with","the","war","and","each","other",".","In","do","so",",","she","provid","proof","that","the","trauma","of","war","doe","not","end","when","peac","begin","."],"lemmas":["the","generation","gap","be","difficult","enough","to","bridge","on","its","own-add","a","father","'s","service","in","Vietnam","and","the","gap","get","even","wider",".","follow","three","veteran","and","they","grown","child","back","to","the","land","where","they","witness","incredible","carnage","as","soldier",",","director","Beth","B","investigate","``","what","we","pass","on","from","one","generation","to","the","next","''","in","the","hope","that","the","experience","will","help","both","father","and","child","come","to","grip","with","the","war","and","each","other",".","in","do","so",",","she","provide","proof","that","the","trauma","of","war","do","not","end","when","peace","begin","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The generation gap","generation gap is","gap is difficult","is difficult enough","difficult enough to","enough to bridge","to bridge on","bridge on its","on its own-add","its own-add a","own-add a father","a father 's","father 's service","'s service in","service in Vietnam","in Vietnam and","Vietnam and the","and the gap","the gap gets","gap gets even","gets even wider","Following three veterans","three veterans and","veterans and their","and their grown","their grown children","grown children back","children back to","back to the","to the land","the land where","land where they","where they witnessed","they witnessed incredible","witnessed incredible carnage","incredible carnage as","carnage as soldiers","as soldiers ,","soldiers , director",", director Beth","director Beth B","Beth B investigates","B investigates \"","investigates \" what","\" what we","what we pass","we pass on","pass on from","on from one","from one generation","one generation to","generation to the","to the next","the next \"","next \" in","\" in the","in the hope","the hope that","hope that the","that the experience","the experience will","experience will help","will help both","help both fathers","both fathers and","fathers and children","and children come","children come to","come to grips","to grips with","grips with the","with the war","the war and","war and each","and each other","In doing so","doing so ,","so , she",", she provides","she provides proof","provides proof that","proof that the","that the trauma","the trauma of","trauma of war","of war does","war does not","does not end","not end when","end when peace","when peace begins"],"2grams":["The generation","generation gap","gap is","is difficult","difficult enough","enough to","to bridge","bridge on","on its","its own-add","own-add a","a father","father 's","'s service","service in","in Vietnam","Vietnam and","and the","the gap","gap gets","gets even","even wider","Following three","three veterans","veterans and","and their","their grown","grown children","children back","back to","to the","the land","land where","where they","they witnessed","witnessed incredible","incredible carnage","carnage as","as soldiers","soldiers ,",", director","director Beth","Beth B","B investigates","investigates \"","\" what","what we","we pass","pass on","on from","from one","one generation","generation to","to the","the next","next \"","\" in","in the","the hope","hope that","that the","the experience","experience will","will help","help both","both fathers","fathers and","and children","children come","come to","to grips","grips with","with the","the war","war and","and each","each other","In doing","doing so","so ,",", she","she provides","provides proof","proof that","that the","the trauma","trauma of","of war","war does","does not","not end","end when","when peace","peace begins"]}

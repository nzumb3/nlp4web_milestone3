{"title":"El Boxeo","plot":"EL BOXEO tells the dramatic and timely story of the emergence and dominance of Latinos in what was once considered the traditional all-white sport of boxing. The film illustrates the evolution of the sport as Latino fighters exploded onto the scene. And, reveals how these immigrant pugilists redefined the world of boxing and established the west coast as the new mecca in the sport. EL BOXEO is as much a film about Latinos in boxing as it is about the immigrant stories that reshaped the sport.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["EL","BOXEO","tell","the","dramat","and","time","stori","of","the","emerg","and","domin","of","Latino","in","what","was","onc","consid","the","tradit","all-whit","sport","of","box",".","The","film","illustr","the","evolut","of","the","sport","as","Latino","fighter","explod","onto","the","scene",".","And",",","reveal","how","these","immigr","pugilist","redefin","the","world","of","box","and","establish","the","west","coast","as","the","new","mecca","in","the","sport",".","EL","BOXEO","is","as","much","a","film","about","Latino","in","box","as","it","is","about","the","immigr","stori","that","reshap","the","sport","."],"lemmas":["EL","BOXEO","tell","the","dramatic","and","timely","story","of","the","emergence","and","dominance","of","Latinos","in","what","be","once","consider","the","traditional","all-white","sport","of","boxing",".","the","film","illustrate","the","evolution","of","the","sport","as","Latino","fighter","explode","onto","the","scene",".","and",",","reveal","how","these","immigrant","pugilist","redefine","the","world","of","boxing","and","establish","the","west","coast","as","the","new","mecca","in","the","sport",".","EL","BOXEO","be","as","much","a","film","about","latinos","in","boxing","as","it","be","about","the","immigrant","story","that","reshape","the","sport","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["EL BOXEO tells","BOXEO tells the","tells the dramatic","the dramatic and","dramatic and timely","and timely story","timely story of","story of the","of the emergence","the emergence and","emergence and dominance","and dominance of","dominance of Latinos","of Latinos in","Latinos in what","in what was","what was once","was once considered","once considered the","considered the traditional","the traditional all-white","traditional all-white sport","all-white sport of","sport of boxing","The film illustrates","film illustrates the","illustrates the evolution","the evolution of","evolution of the","of the sport","the sport as","sport as Latino","as Latino fighters","Latino fighters exploded","fighters exploded onto","exploded onto the","onto the scene","And , reveals",", reveals how","reveals how these","how these immigrant","these immigrant pugilists","immigrant pugilists redefined","pugilists redefined the","redefined the world","the world of","world of boxing","of boxing and","boxing and established","and established the","established the west","the west coast","west coast as","coast as the","as the new","the new mecca","new mecca in","mecca in the","in the sport","EL BOXEO is","BOXEO is as","is as much","as much a","much a film","a film about","film about Latinos","about Latinos in","Latinos in boxing","in boxing as","boxing as it","as it is","it is about","is about the","about the immigrant","the immigrant stories","immigrant stories that","stories that reshaped","that reshaped the","reshaped the sport"],"2grams":["EL BOXEO","BOXEO tells","tells the","the dramatic","dramatic and","and timely","timely story","story of","of the","the emergence","emergence and","and dominance","dominance of","of Latinos","Latinos in","in what","what was","was once","once considered","considered the","the traditional","traditional all-white","all-white sport","sport of","of boxing","The film","film illustrates","illustrates the","the evolution","evolution of","of the","the sport","sport as","as Latino","Latino fighters","fighters exploded","exploded onto","onto the","the scene","And ,",", reveals","reveals how","how these","these immigrant","immigrant pugilists","pugilists redefined","redefined the","the world","world of","of boxing","boxing and","and established","established the","the west","west coast","coast as","as the","the new","new mecca","mecca in","in the","the sport","EL BOXEO","BOXEO is","is as","as much","much a","a film","film about","about Latinos","Latinos in","in boxing","boxing as","as it","it is","is about","about the","the immigrant","immigrant stories","stories that","that reshaped","reshaped the","the sport"]}

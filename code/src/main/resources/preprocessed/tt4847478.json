{"title":"47 to 84: Hun Main Kisnu Watan Kahunga","plot":"47 to 84 is the journey of a young Sikh girl, Sukhmani, who loses all her loved ones and is forced to leave the newly-formed Pakistan during the partition. Alone in the world with nowhere to go and no belongings, Sukhmani finds her way to Delhi. While fending for herself, Sukhmani builds a family and life over time. India was what she now called home and felt a strong sense of attachment and belonging here. But her world was turned upside down once again during the anti-Sikh Genocide of 1984. The lives of all her loved ones were in danger. The country that she called her motherland was now the most unsafe place for her, her family and her community. Will the Sikh community be able to live safe and secure in India and call it their home?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["47","to","84","is","the","journey","of","a","young","Sikh","girl",",","Sukhmani",",","who","lose","all","her","love","one","and","is","forc","to","leav","the","newly-form","Pakistan","dure","the","partit",".","Alone","in","the","world","with","nowher","to","go","and","no","belong",",","Sukhmani","find","her","way","to","Delhi",".","While","fend","for","herself",",","Sukhmani","build","a","famili","and","life","over","time",".","India","was","what","she","now","call","home","and","felt","a","strong","sens","of","attach","and","belong","here",".","But","her","world","was","turn","upsid","down","onc","again","dure","the","anti-Sikh","Genocid","of","1984",".","The","live","of","all","her","love","one","were","in","danger",".","The","countri","that","she","call","her","motherland","was","now","the","most","unsaf","place","for","her",",","her","famili","and","her","communiti",".","Will","the","Sikh","communiti","be","abl","to","live","safe","and","secur","in","India","and","call","it","their","home","?"],"lemmas":["47","to","84","be","the","journey","of","a","young","sikh","girl",",","Sukhmani",",","who","lose","all","she","love","one","and","be","force","to","leave","the","newly-formed","Pakistan","during","the","partition",".","alone","in","the","world","with","nowhere","to","go","and","no","belongings",",","Sukhmani","find","she","way","to","Delhi",".","while","fend","for","herself",",","Sukhmani","build","a","family","and","life","over","time",".","India","be","what","she","now","call","home","and","feel","a","strong","sense","of","attachment","and","belong","here",".","but","she","world","be","turn","upside","down","once","again","during","the","anti-sikh","genocide","of","1984",".","the","life","of","all","she","love","one","be","in","danger",".","the","country","that","she","call","she","motherland","be","now","the","most","unsafe","place","for","she",",","she","family","and","she","community",".","will","the","sikh","community","be","able","to","live","safe","and","secure","in","India","and","call","it","they","home","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["47

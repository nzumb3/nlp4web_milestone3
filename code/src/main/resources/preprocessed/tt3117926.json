{"title":"A Bad Summer for Tomatoes","plot":"\"My Little Tomatoes\" seems a cute nickname from a father to his motherless children, but after the death of the household cat instigates the telling of an old family fairytale, the name takes on a more literal meaning. Six-year old Sam and nine-year old Maggie bicker over the truth of the tale (and most everything else) until a sudden accident kills their dad. As strange things begin to happen on the farm, Maggie struggles beneath the onslaught of new adult responsibility while her brother throws all of his efforts into trying to bring their father back to life, by means of the fairytale's promise... A Bad Summer for Tomatoes is a story of sibling rivalry, magic, birth/death, and the importance of family to all of us.","genres":["Drama"," Fantasy"],"stems":["\"","My","Littl","Tomato","\"","seem","a","cute","nicknam","from","a","father","to","his","motherless","children",",","but","after","the","death","of","the","household","cat","instig","the","tell","of","an","old","famili","fairytal",",","the","name","take","on","a","more","liter","mean",".","Six-year","old","Sam","and","nine-year","old","Maggi","bicker","over","the","truth","of","the","tale","(","and","most","everyth","els",")","until","a","sudden","accid","kill","their","dad",".","As","strang","thing","begin","to","happen","on","the","farm",",","Maggi","struggl","beneath","the","onslaught","of","new","adult","respons","while","her","brother","throw","all","of","his","effort","into","tri","to","bring","their","father","back","to","life",",","by","mean","of","the","fairytal","'s","promis","...","A","Bad","Summer","for","Tomato","is","a","stori","of","sibl","rivalri",",","magic",",","birth/death",",","and","the","import","of","famili","to","all","of","us","."],"lemmas":["``","my","little","tomato","''","seem","a","cute","nickname","from","a","father","to","he","motherless","child",",","but","after","the","death","of","the","household","cat","instigate","the","tell","of","a","old","family","fairytale",",","the","name","take","on","a","more","literal","meaning",".","six-year","old","Sam","and","nine-year","old","Maggie","bicker","over","the","truth","of","the","tale","-lrb-","and","most","everything","else","-rrb-","until","a","sudden","accident","kill","they","dad",".","as","strange","thing","begin","to","happen","on","the","farm",",","Maggie","struggle","beneath","the","onslaught","of","new","adult","responsibility","while","she","brother","throw","all","of","he","effort","into","try","to","bring","they","father","back","to","life",",","by","means","of","the","fairytale","'s","promise","...","A","Bad","Summer","for","Tomatoes","be","a","story","of","sibling","rivalry",",","magic",",","birth/death",",","and","the","importance","of","family","to","all","of","we","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["\" My Little","My Little Tomatoes","Little Tomatoes \"","Tomatoes \" seems","\" seems a","seems a cute","a cute nickname","cute nickname from","nickname from a","from a father","a father to","father to his","to his motherless","his motherless children","motherless children ,","children , but",", but after","but after the","after the death","the death of","death of the","of the household","the household cat","household cat instigates","cat instigates the","instigates the telling","the telling of","telling of an","of an old","an old family","old family fairytale","family fairytale ,","fairytale , the",", the name","the name takes","name takes on","takes on a","on a more","a more literal","more literal meaning","Six-year old Sam","old Sam and","Sam and nine-year","and nine-year old","nine-year old Maggie","old Maggie bicker","Maggie bicker over","bicker over the","over the truth","the truth of","truth of the","of the tale","the tale (","tale ( and","( and most","and most everything","most everything else","everything else )","else ) until",") until a","until a sudden","a sudden accident","sudden accident kills","accident kills their","kills their dad","As strange things","strange things begin","things begin to","begin to happen","to happen on","happen on the","on the farm","the farm ,","farm , Maggie",", Maggie struggles","Maggie struggles beneath","struggles beneath the","beneath the onslaught","the onslaught of","onslaught of new","of new adult","new adult responsibility","adult responsibility while","responsibility while her","while her brother","her brother throws","brother throws all","throws all of","all of his","of his efforts","his efforts into","efforts into trying","into trying to","trying to bring","to bring their","bring their father","their father back","father back to","back to life","to life ,","life , by",", by means","by means of","means of the","of the fairytale","the fairytale 's","fairytale 's promise","'s promise ...","promise ...

{"title":"Ruby Skye P.I.: The Haunted Library","plot":"\"The Haunted Library\" opens with teen detective, Ruby Skye, hot on the trail of whoever or whatever is making those scary noises late at night in the spooky old O'Deary Library. Before she makes much progress on the case, Ava O'Deary, the library's puzzle-loving owner dies without leaving a will. That means Ava's nearest living relative, Lillian O'Shyte, will inherit everything. And she plans to bulldoze the library and replace it with an adults-only condo tower. Ruby vows to save the library.

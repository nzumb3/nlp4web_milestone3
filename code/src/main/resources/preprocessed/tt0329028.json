{"title":"Dumb and Dumberer: When Harry Met Lloyd","plot":"It's the 1980s, and it's the moment that Lloyd Christmas and Harry Dunne meet. The two individuals are seen by many as 'special', and become best friends as soon as they meet. Principal Collins and his lover, the lunch lady Ms. Heller, want to make as much money out of scams, and their next idea is to create a special needs class. Ms. Heller is the teacher, and they have assigned Harry and Lloyd to round the special students up. School News Reporter Jessica is suspicious though, and desperately tries to find out the truth, even if it means gaining Harry and Lloyd's help.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["It","'s","the","1980s",",","and","it","'s","the","moment","that","Lloyd","Christma","and","Harri","Dunn","meet",".","The","two","individu","are","seen","by","mani","as","'","special","'",",","and","becom","best","friend","as","soon","as","they","meet",".","Princip","Collin","and","his","lover",",","the","lunch","ladi","Ms.","Heller",",","want","to","make","as","much","money","out","of","scam",",","and","their","next","idea","is","to","creat","a","special","need","class",".","Ms.","Heller","is","the","teacher",",","and","they","have","assign","Harri","and","Lloyd","to","round","the","special","student","up",".","School","New","Report","Jessica","is","suspici","though",",","and","desper","tri","to","find","out","the","truth",",","even","if","it","mean","gain","Harri","and","Lloyd","'s","help","."],"lemmas":["it","be","the","1980s",",","and","it","be","the","moment","that","Lloyd","Christmas","and","Harry","Dunne","meet",".","the","two","individual","be","see","by","many","as","'","special","'",",","and","become","best","friend","as","soon","as","they","meet",".","principal","Collins","and","he","lover",",","the","lunch","lady","Ms.","Heller",",","want","to","make","as","much","money","out","of","scam",",","and","they","next","idea","be","to","create","a","special","need","class",".","Ms.","Heller","be","the","teacher",",","and","they","have","assign","Harry","and","Lloyd","to","round","the","special","student","up",".","School","News","reporter","Jessica","be","suspicious","though",",","and","desperately","try","to","find","out","the","truth",",","even","if","it","mean","gain","Harry","and","Lloyd","'s","help","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["It

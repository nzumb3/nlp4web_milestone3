{"title":"Narcopolis","plot":"Narcopolis is a futuristic thriller set in the near future where all classes of drugs have been legalized. Frank Grieves is a 'Dreck', a roaming narc responsible for keeping the black market dealers off the streets and the licenced drugs companies rich. When he discovers a rogue substance in an unidentified corpse, evidence suggests that Ambro, the most powerful drug manufacturer of all, are conducting secret tests on an experimental narcotic. Grieves discovers a second victim - this time alive - but she disappears and he is suddenly taken off the case by his superiors. As his options drain away, it's clear that legalization has come at a heavy price. Is it too late to save the city?","genres":["Mystery"," Thriller"," Sci-Fi"],"stems":["Narcopoli","is","a","futurist","thriller","set","in","the","near","futur","where","all","class","of","drug","have","been","legal",".","Frank","Griev","is","a","'","Dreck","'",",","a","roam","narc","respons","for","keep","the","black","market","dealer","off","the","street","and","the","licenc","drug","compani","rich",".","When","he","discov","a","rogu","substanc","in","an","unidentifi","corps",",","evid","suggest","that","Ambro",",","the","most","power","drug","manufactur","of","all",",","are","conduct","secret","test","on","an","experiment","narcot",".","Griev","discov","a","second","victim","-","this","time","aliv","-","but","she","disappear","and","he","is","sudden","taken","off","the","case","by","his","superior",".","As","his","option","drain","away",",","it","'s","clear","that","legal","has","come","at","a","heavi","price",".","Is","it","too","late","to","save","the","citi","?"],"lemmas":["Narcopolis","be","a","futuristic","thriller","set","in","the","near","future","where","all","class","of","drug","have","be","legalize",".","Frank","Grieves","be","a","'","dreck","'",",","a","roam","narc","responsible","for","keep","the","black","market","dealer","off","the","street","and","the","licenced","drug","company","rich",".","when","he","discover","a","rogue","substance","in","a","unidentified","corpse",",","evidence","suggest","that","Ambro",",","the","most","powerful","drug","manufacturer","of","all",",","be","conduct","secret","test","on","a","experimental","narcotic",".","Grieves","discover","a","second","victim","-","this","time","alive","-","but","she","disappear","and","he","be","suddenly","take","off","the","case","by","he","superior",".","as","he","option","drain","away",",","it","be","clear","that","legalization","have","come","at","a","heavy","price",".","be","it","too","late","to","save","the","city","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Narcopolis is a","is a futuristic","a futuristic thriller","futuristic thriller set","thriller set in","set in the","in the near","the near future","near future where","future where all","where all classes","all classes of","classes of drugs","of drugs have","drugs have been","have been legalized","Frank Grieves is","Grieves is a","is a '","a ' Dreck","' Dreck '","Dreck ' ,","' , a",", a roaming","a roaming narc","roaming narc responsible","narc responsible for","responsible for keeping","for keeping the","keeping the black","the black market","black market dealers","market dealers off","dealers off the","off the streets","the streets and","streets and the","and the licenced","the licenced drugs","licenced drugs companies","drugs companies rich","When he discovers","he discovers a","discovers a rogue","a rogue substance","rogue substance in","substance in an","in an unidentified","an unidentified corpse","unidentified corpse ,","corpse , evidence",", evidence suggests","evidence suggests that","suggests that Ambro","that Ambro ,","Ambro , the",", the most","the most powerful","most powerful drug","powerful drug manufacturer","drug manufacturer of","manufacturer of all","of all ,","all , are",", are conducting","are conducting secret","conducting secret tests","secret tests on","tests on an","on an experimental","an experimental narcotic","Grieves discovers a","discovers a second","a second victim","second victim -","victim -

{"title":"The Secret Life of Words","plot":"Hannah, who wears a hearing aid, is forced to go on holiday. On holiday she manages to find a job: caring for Josef, a burn victim on an oil rig who temporarily lost his sight, until he's stable enough to be transferred. There is almost no one on the rig, except a cook, an oceanographer and a few others out at sea. Hannah tends to Josef and he slowly breaks her shell of silence.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Hannah",",","who","wear","a","hear","aid",",","is","forc","to","go","on","holiday",".","On","holiday","she","manag","to","find","a","job",":","care","for","Josef",",","a","burn","victim","on","an","oil","rig","who","temporarili","lost","his","sight",",","until","he","'s","stabl","enough","to","be","transfer",".","There","is","almost","no","one","on","the","rig",",","except","a","cook",",","an","oceanograph","and","a","few","other","out","at","sea",".","Hannah","tend","to","Josef","and","he","slowli","break","her","shell","of","silenc","."],"lemmas":["Hannah",",","who","wear","a","hearing","aid",",","be","force","to","go","on","holiday",".","on","holiday","she","manage","to","find","a","job",":","care","for","Josef",",","a","burn","victim","on","a","oil","rig","who","temporarily","lose","he","sight",",","until","he","be","stable","enough","to","be","transfer",".","there","be","almost","no","one","on","the","rig",",","except","a","cook",",","a","oceanographer","and","a","few","other","out","at","sea",".","Hannah","tend","to","Josef","and","he","slowly","break","she","shell","of","silence","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hannah , who",", who wears","who wears a","wears a hearing","a hearing aid","hearing aid ,","aid , is",", is forced","is forced to","forced to go","to go on","go on holiday","On holiday she","holiday she manages","she manages to","manages to find","to find a","find a job","a job :","job : caring",": caring for","caring for Josef","for Josef ,","Josef , a",", a burn","a burn victim","burn victim on","victim on an","on an oil","an oil rig","oil rig who","rig who temporarily","who temporarily lost","temporarily lost his","lost his sight","his sight ,","sight , until",", until he","until he 's","he 's stable","'s stable enough","stable enough to","enough to be","to be transferred","There is almost","is almost no","almost no one","no one on","one on the","on the rig","the rig ,","rig , except",", except a","except a cook","a cook ,","cook , an",", an oceanographer","an oceanographer and","oceanographer and a","and a few","a few others","few others out","others out at","out at sea","Hannah tends to","tends to Josef","to Josef and","Josef and he","and he slowly","he slowly breaks","slowly breaks her","breaks her shell","her shell of","shell of silence"],"2grams":["Hannah ,",", who","who wears","wears a","a hearing","hearing aid","aid ,",", is","is forced","forced to","to go","go on","on holiday","On holiday","holiday she","she manages","manages to","to find","find a","a job","job :",": caring","caring for","for Josef","Josef ,",", a","a burn","burn victim","victim on","on an","an oil","oil rig","rig who","who temporarily","temporarily lost","lost his","his sight","sight ,",", until","until he","he 's","'s stable","stable enough","enough to","to be","be transferred","There is","is almost","almost no","no one","one on","on the","the rig","rig ,",", except","except a","a cook","cook ,",", an","an oceanographer","oceanographer and","and a","a few","few others","others out","out at","at sea","Hannah tends","tends to","to Josef","Josef and","and he","he slowly","slowly breaks","breaks her","her shell","shell of","of silence"]}

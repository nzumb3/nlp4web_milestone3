{"title":"Scape","plot":"Based on the short story 'The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes' by Rudyard Kipling, Scape takes place in the early 1800s on the Oregon Trail. Indians attack Morrowbie's caravan and he becomes separated from his wife. He walks alone through the open frontier, searching for her, when he wanders into a remote colony in the forest for the mentally ill. Once in the colony, none can leave; a mysterious and fearsome army soldier guards the boundary between the colony and freedom. With the fate of his wife looming, Morrowbie must attempt the impossible: escape.","genres":["Action"," Mystery"," Adventure"],"stems":["Base","on","the","short","stori","'","The","Strang","Ride","of","Morrowbi","Juke","'","by","Rudyard","Kipl",",","Scape","take","place","in","the","earli","1800s","on","the","Oregon","Trail",".","Indian","attack","Morrowbi","'s","caravan","and","he","becom","separ","from","his","wife",".","He","walk","alon","through","the","open","frontier",",","search","for","her",",","when","he","wander","into","a","remot","coloni","in","the","forest","for","the","mental","ill",".","Once","in","the","coloni",",","none","can","leav",";","a","mysteri","and","fearsom","armi","soldier","guard","the","boundari","between","the","coloni","and","freedom",".","With","the","fate","of","his","wife","loom",",","Morrowbi","must","attempt","the","imposs",":","escap","."],"lemmas":["base","on","the","short","story","'","the","strange","ride","of","Morrowbie","Jukes","'","by","Rudyard","Kipling",",","Scape","take","place","in","the","early","1800","on","the","Oregon","trail",".","Indians","attack","Morrowbie","'s","caravan","and","he","become","separate","from","he","wife",".","he","walk","alone","through","the","open","frontier",",","search","for","she",",","when","he","wander","into","a","remote","colony","in","the","forest","for","the","mentally","ill",".","once","in","the","colony",",","none","can","leave",";","a","mysterious","and","fearsome","army","soldier","guard","the","boundary","between","the","colony","and","freedom",".","with","the","fate","of","he","wife","loom",",","Morrowbie","must","attempt","the","impossible",":","escape","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Based on the","on the short","the short story","short story '","story ' The","' The Strange","The Strange Ride","Strange Ride of","Ride of Morrowbie","of Morrowbie Jukes","Morrowbie Jukes '","Jukes ' by","' by Rudyard","by Rudyard Kipling","Rudyard Kipling ,","Kipling , Scape",", Scape takes","Scape takes place","takes place in","place in the","in the early","the early 1800s","early 1800s on","1800s on the","on the Oregon","the Oregon Trail","Indians attack Morrowbie","attack Morrowbie 's","Morrowbie 's caravan","'s caravan and","caravan and he","and he becomes","he becomes separated","becomes separated from","separated from his","from his wife","He walks alone","walks alone through","alone through the","through the open","the open frontier","open frontier ,","frontier , searching",", searching for","searching for her","for her ,","her , when",", when he","when he wanders","he wanders into","wanders into a","into a remote","a remote colony","remote colony in","colony in the","in the forest","the forest for","forest for the","for the mentally","the mentally ill","Once in the","in the colony","the colony ,","colony , none",", none can","none can leave","can leave ;","leave ; a","; a mysterious","a mysterious and","mysterious and fearsome","and fearsome army","fearsome army soldier","army soldier guards","soldier guards the","guards the boundary","the boundary between","boundary between the","between the colony","the colony and","colony and freedom","With the fate","the fate of","fate of his","of his wife","his wife looming","wife looming ,","looming , Morrowbie",", Morrowbie must","Morrowbie must attempt","must attempt the","attempt the impossible","the impossible :","impossible : escape"],"2grams":["Based on","on the","the short","short story","story '","' The","The Strange","Strange Ride","Ride of","of Morrowbie","Morrowbie Jukes","Jukes '","' by","by Rudyard","Rudyard Kipling","Kipling ,",", Scape","Scape takes","takes place","place in","in the","the early","early 1800s","1800s on","on the","the Oregon","Oregon Trail","Indians attack","attack Morrowbie","Morrowbie 's","'s caravan","caravan and","and he","he becomes","becomes separated","separated from","from his","his wife","He walks","walks alone","alone through","through the","the open","open frontier","frontier ,",", searching","searching for","for her","her ,",", when","when he","he wanders","wanders into","into a","a remote","remote colony","colony in","in the","the forest","forest for","for the","the mentally","mentally ill","Once in","in the","the colony","colony ,",", none","none can","can leave","leave ;","; a","a mysterious","mysterious and","and fearsome","fearsome army","army soldier","soldier guards","guards the","the boundary","boundary between","between the","the colony","colony and","and freedom","With the","the fate","fate of","of his","his wife","wife looming","looming ,",", Morrowbie","Morrowbie must","must attempt","attempt the","the impossible","impossible :",": escape"]}

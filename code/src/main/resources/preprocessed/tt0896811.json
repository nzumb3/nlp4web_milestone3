Now, in med school as they attempt to balance the weight of their studies, his job, her band, their parents, their friends (their sanity), they find little time for relationships...but lots of time for the desire. One fateful day, a brave Owen proposes the \"perfect\" solution: Friends (read: no messy relationship stuff)...with benefits (read: insanely messy sex stuff). \"Perfect,\" that is...if the two hadn't always been secretly in love with one another So what DOES happen when two close friends decide to secretly blur the lines dividing friendship and relationship...and the rest of their tight knit group of friends finds out? The answer: complications arise. A LOT of complications. In fact, to quote their therapist, \"It's brought down empires; imagine what it can do to a group of friends\".","genres":["Comedy","

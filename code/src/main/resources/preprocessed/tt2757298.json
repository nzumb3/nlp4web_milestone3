{"title":"Oil Sands Karaoke","plot":"Oil Sands Karaoke is a documentary about five oil patch workers vying to win a karaoke contest in one of the most controversial places on the planet - Northern Alberta's infamous Oil Sands. These five characters know they're at the center of a global controversy and yet they continue to work there under extremely arduous physical conditions for long hours for extended periods without a single day off. Why? Obviously for the high wages. But what could motivate a person in this situation to sing karaoke, let alone take it seriously? A documentary unlike any other, Oil Sands Karaoke will make us laugh, sing along, and perhaps re-examine our biases.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Oil","Sand","Karaok","is","a","documentari","about","five","oil","patch","worker","vy","to","win","a","karaok","contest","in","one","of","the","most","controversi","place","on","the","planet","-","Northern","Alberta","'s","infam","Oil","Sand",".","These","five","charact","know","they","re","at","the","center","of","a","global","controversi","and","yet","they","continu","to","work","there","under","extrem","arduous","physic","condit","for","long","hour","for","extend","period","without","a","singl","day","off",".","Whi","?","Obviousli","for","the","high","wage",".","But","what","could","motiv","a","person","in","this","situat","to","sing","karaok",",","let","alon","take","it","serious","?","A","documentari","unlik","ani","other",",","Oil","Sand","Karaok","will","make","us","laugh",",","sing","along",",","and","perhap","re-examin","our","bias","."],"lemmas":["Oil","Sands","Karaoke","be","a","documentary","about","five","oil","patch","worker","vie","to","win","a","karaoke","contest","in","one","of","the","most","controversial","place","on","the","planet","-","Northern","Alberta","'s","infamous","Oil","Sands",".","these","five","character","know","they","be","at","the","center","of","a","global","controversy","and","yet","they","continue","to","work","there","under","extremely","arduous","physical","condition","for","long","hour","for","extend","period","without","a","single","day","off",".","why","?","obviously","for","the","high","wages",".","but","what","could","motivate","a","person","in","this","situation","to","sing","karaoke",",","let","alone","take","it","seriously","?","a","documentary","unlike","any","other",",","Oil","Sands","Karaoke","will","make","we","laugh",",","sing","along",",","and","perhaps","re-examine","we","bias","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Oil Sands Karaoke","Sands Karaoke is","Karaoke is a","is a documentary","a documentary about","documentary about five","about five oil","five oil patch","oil patch workers","patch workers vying","workers vying to","vying to win","to win a","win a karaoke","a karaoke contest","karaoke contest in","contest in one","in one of","one of the","of the most","the most controversial","most controversial places","controversial places on","places on the","on the planet","the planet -","planet -

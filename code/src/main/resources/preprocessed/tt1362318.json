{"title":"Till Death... Do Us Part","plot":"Aaron Corbin, is a successful businessman with a thriving corporation and his beautiful new wife, Kelly, on arm. Not only is his business thriving, but it is set to go global in six months, guaranteeing him a new life living in the lap of luxury. No sooner is the ink dried on the contract, than a mysterious man from Aaron's past shows up and demands that he repay him all the money he borrowed to start his company plus interest. The mystery man not only demands payment within thirty days, but adds on an additional deadly incentive for Aaron to pay him sooner rather than later. After a series of unfortunate events, Aaron determines that the only way he can get the money to repay his debt and save his life is to kill his wife to obtain the proceeds from their life insurance policy. The madness and mayhem that ensues creates a bevy of unforeseen twists and turns that will never cease to leave the viewers guessing.","genres":["Drama","

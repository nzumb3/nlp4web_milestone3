{"title":"På bølgelengde","plot":"In a world of fast cars and jealousy, one man must make the ultimate choice between two worlds: a world of love, friendship and commitment, or a world he knows all too well: the world of the bachelor. Will he make the right choice? In a perfect world he would, but the wild rugged coast of Western Norway is no such place. It's a place where real men make difficult decisions forged by the ancient conflicts of men, women and nature. For one man it may just be too much.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["In","a","world","of","fast","car","and","jealousi",",","one","man","must","make","the","ultim","choic","between","two","world",":","a","world","of","love",",","friendship","and","commit",",","or","a","world","he","know","all","too","well",":","the","world","of","the","bachelor",".","Will","he","make","the","right","choic","?","In","a","perfect","world","he","would",",","but","the","wild","rug","coast","of","Western","Norway","is","no","such","place",".","It","'s","a","place","where","real","men","make","difficult","decis","forg","by","the","ancient","conflict","of","men",",","women","and","natur",".","For","one","man","it","may","just","be","too","much","."],"lemmas":["in","a","world","of","fast","car","and","jealousy",",","one","man","must","make","the","ultimate","choice","between","two","world",":","a","world","of","love",",","friendship","and","commitment",",","or","a","world","he","know","all","too","well",":","the","world","of","the","bachelor",".","will","he","make","the","right","choice","?","in","a","perfect","world","he","would",",","but","the","wild","rugged","coast","of","Western","Norway","be","no","such","place",".","it","be","a","place","where","real","man","make","difficult","decision","forge","by","the","ancient","conflict","of","man",",","woman","and","nature",".","for","one","man","it","may","just","be","too","much","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a world","a world of","world of fast","of fast cars","fast cars and","cars and jealousy","and jealousy ,","jealousy , one",", one man","one man must","man must make","must make the","make the ultimate","the ultimate choice","ultimate choice between","choice between two","between two worlds","two worlds :","worlds : a",": a world","a world of","world of love","of love ,","love , friendship",", friendship and","friendship and commitment","and commitment ,","commitment , or",", or a","or a world","a world he","world he knows","he knows all","knows all too","all too well","too well :","well : the",": the world","the world of","world of the","of the bachelor","Will he make","he make the","make the right","the right choice","In a perfect","a perfect world","perfect world he","world he would","he would ,","would , but",", but the","but the wild","the wild rugged","wild rugged coast","rugged coast of","coast of Western","of Western Norway","Western Norway is","Norway is no","is no such","no such place","It 's a","'s a place","a place where","place where real","where real men","real men make","men make difficult","make difficult decisions","difficult decisions forged","decisions forged by","forged by the","by the ancient","the ancient conflicts","ancient conflicts of","conflicts of men","of men ,","men , women",", women and","women and nature","For one man","one man it","man it may","it may just","may just be","just be too","be too much"],"2grams":["In a","a world","world of","of fast","fast cars","cars and","and jealousy","jealousy ,",", one","one man","man must","must make","make the","the ultimate","ultimate choice","choice between","between two","two worlds","worlds :",": a","a world","world of","of love","love ,",", friendship","friendship and","and commitment","commitment ,",", or","or a","a world","world he","he knows","knows all","all too","too well","well :",": the","the world","world of","of the","the bachelor","Will he","he make","make the","the right","right choice","In a","a perfect","perfect world","world he","he would","would ,",", but","but the","the wild","wild rugged","rugged coast","coast of","of Western","Western Norway","Norway is","is no","no such","such place","It 's","'s a","a place","place where","where real","real men","men make","make difficult","difficult decisions","decisions forged","forged by","by the","the ancient","ancient conflicts","conflicts of","of men","men ,",", women","women and","and nature","For one","one man","man it","it may","may just","just be","be too","too much"]}

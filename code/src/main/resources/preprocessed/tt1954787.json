{"title":"Roger Pelerin, là où l'on s'arrête en passant","plot":"Roger Pelerin, is a brilliant artist who left the city to establish himself on the Island of Nepawa, in the deepest corners of Abitibi, to live an atypical life and work on his craft without selling out. Over the course of four seasons, we see him labor his masterpiece: a magnificent book of prints illustrating the story of his island, its simple and honest residents, and its natural beauty - a source of profound inspiration. The result is a beautiful portrait of an uncompromising artist and his very human experiences of ups and downs, small setbacks and infinite joys.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Roger","Pelerin",",","is","a","brilliant","artist","who","left","the","citi","to","establish","himself","on","the","Island","of","Nepawa",",","in","the","deepest","corner","of","Abitibi",",","to","live","an","atyp","life","and","work","on","his","craft","without","sell","out",".","Over","the","cours","of","four","season",",","we","see","him","labor","his","masterpiec",":","a","magnific","book","of","print","illustr","the","stori","of","his","island",",","it","simpl","and","honest","resid",",","and","it","natur","beauti","-","a","sourc","of","profound","inspir",".","The","result","is","a","beauti","portrait","of","an","uncompromis","artist","and","his","veri","human","experi","of","up","and","down",",","small","setback","and","infinit","joy","."],"lemmas":["Roger","Pelerin",",","be","a","brilliant","artist","who","leave","the","city","to","establish","himself","on","the","Island","of","Nepawa",",","in","the","deepest","corner","of","Abitibi",",","to","live","a","atypical","life","and","work","on","he","craft","without","sell","out",".","over","the","course","of","four","season",",","we","see","he","labor","he","masterpiece",":","a","magnificent","book","of","print","illustrate","the","story","of","he","island",",","its","simple","and","honest","resident",",","and","its","natural","beauty","-","a","source","of","profound","inspiration",".","the","result","be","a","beautiful","portrait","of","a","uncompromising","artist","and","he","very","human","experience","of","up","and","downs",",","small","setback","and","infinite","joy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Roger Pelerin ,","Pelerin , is",", is a","is a brilliant","a brilliant artist","brilliant artist who","artist who left","who left the","left the city","the city to","city to establish","to establish himself","establish himself on","himself on the","on the Island","the Island of","Island of Nepawa","of Nepawa ,","Nepawa , in",", in the","in the deepest","the deepest corners","deepest corners of","corners of Abitibi","of Abitibi ,","Abitibi , to",", to live","to live an","live an atypical","an atypical life","atypical life and","life and work","and work on","work on his","on his craft","his craft without","craft without selling","without selling out","Over the course","the course of","course of four","of four seasons","four seasons ,","seasons , we",", we see","we see him","see him labor","him labor his","labor his masterpiece","his masterpiece :","masterpiece : a",": a magnificent","a magnificent book","magnificent book of","book of prints","of prints illustrating","prints illustrating the","illustrating the story","the story of","story of his","of his island","his island ,","island , its",", its simple","its simple and","simple and honest","and honest residents","honest residents ,","residents , and",", and its","and its natural","its natural beauty","natural beauty -","beauty - a","- a source","a source of","source of profound","of profound inspiration","The result is","result is a","is a beautiful","a beautiful portrait","beautiful portrait of","portrait of an","of an uncompromising","an uncompromising artist","uncompromising artist and","artist and his","and his very","his very human","very human experiences","human experiences of","experiences of ups","of ups and","ups and downs","and downs ,","downs , small",", small setbacks","small setbacks and","setbacks and infinite","and infinite joys"],"2grams":["Roger Pelerin","Pelerin ,",", is","is a","a brilliant","brilliant artist","artist who","who left","left the","the city","city to","to establish","establish himself","himself on","on the","the Island","Island of","of Nepawa","Nepawa ,",", in","in the","the deepest","deepest corners","corners of","of Abitibi","Abitibi ,",", to","to live","live an","an atypical","atypical life","life and","and work","work on","on his","his craft","craft without","without selling","selling out","Over the","the course","course of","of four","four seasons","seasons ,",", we","we see","see him","him labor","labor his","his masterpiece","masterpiece :",": a","a magnificent","magnificent book","book of","of prints","prints illustrating","illustrating the","the story","story of","of his","his island","island ,",", its","its simple","simple and","and honest","honest residents","residents ,",", and","and its","its natural","natural beauty","beauty -","- a","a source","source of","of profound","profound inspiration","The result","result is","is a","a beautiful","beautiful portrait","portrait of","of an","an uncompromising","uncompromising artist","artist and","and his","his very","very human","human experiences","experiences of","of ups","ups and","and downs","downs ,",", small","small setbacks","setbacks and","and infinite","infinite joys"]}

{"title":"Between Places","plot":"For those prepared to forego the common precepts of 'adventure', Arctic mountaineering requires dedication into topographical research and desire for something that is real and committing. Director Henrik Rostrup chronicles the adventure of European alpinists Edurne Pasarban, Erwan Le Lann and Martial Dumas, as they set sail on a 10-day expedition onboard the sailboat 'La Louise'. Sailing and climbing in these areas have not been explored much, it's strange and gorgeous. The skipper, Thierry Dubois is no stranger to these waters, having completed many solo races around the world. He completes the list of the films main characters and provides a perfect balance to the narrative of the story. From the start of the film, each scene seamlessly echoes back and forth between images of the surreal mountains in Greenland. The climbers are older, wiser and more reflected of their past adventures. Edurne, fresh off her incredible feat of being the first woman to climb all fourteen 8000 meter peaks in the world, tells us of her life story, while Erwan and Martial seek out new first ascents along the coastline, climbing, mountaineering and ski touring. Their story comes to life with archival footage of past hardships and hand drawn animations. Each of the climbers story flow in-and-out of this voyage through the fjords in this magic land.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["For","those","prepar","to","forego","the","common","precept","of","'","adventur","'",",","Arctic","mountain","requir","dedic","into","topograph","research","and","desir","for","someth","that","is","real","and","commit",".","Director","Henrik","Rostrup","chronicl","the","adventur","of","European","alpinist","Edurn","Pasarban",",","Erwan","Le","Lann","and","Martial","Duma",",","as","they","set","sail","on","a","10-day","expedit","onboard","the","sailboat","'","La","Louis","'",".","Sail","and","climb","in","these","area","have","not","been","explor","much",",","it","'s","strang","and","gorgeous",".","The","skipper",",","Thierri","Duboi","is","no","stranger","to","these","water",",","have","complet","mani","solo","race","around","the","world",".","He","complet","the","list","of","the","film","main","charact","and","provid","a","perfect","balanc","to","the","narrat","of","the","stori",".","From","the","start","of","the","film",",","each","scene","seamless","echo","back","and","forth","between","imag","of","the","surreal","mountain","in","Greenland",".","The","climber","are","older",",","wiser","and","more","reflect","of","their","past","adventur",".","Edurn",",","fresh","off","her","incred","feat","of","be","the","first","woman","to","climb","all","fourteen","8000","meter","peak","in","the","world",",","tell","us","of","her","life","stori",",","while","Erwan","and","Martial","seek","out","new","first","ascent","along","the","coastlin",",","climb",",","mountain","and","ski","tour",".","Their","stori","come","to","life","with","archiv","footag","of","past","hardship","and","hand","drawn","anim",".","Each","of","the","climber","stori","flow","in-and-out","of","this","voyag","through","the","fjord","in","this","magic","land","."],"lemmas":["for","those","prepare","to","forego","the","common","precept","of","'","adventure","'",",","Arctic","mountaineering","require","dedication","into","topographical","research","and","desire","for","something","that","be","real","and","commit",".","Director","Henrik","Rostrup","chronicle","the","adventure","of","european","alpinist","Edurne","Pasarban",",","Erwan","Le","Lann","and","Martial","Dumas",",","as","they","set","sail","on","a","10-day","expedition","onboard","the","sailboat","'","La","Louise","'",".","Sailing","and","climb","in","these","area","have","not","be","explore","much",",","it","be","strange","and","gorgeous",".","the","skipper",",","Thierry","Dubois","be","no","stranger","to","these","water",",","have","complete","many","solo","race","around","the","world",".","he","complete","the","list","of","the","film","main","character","and","provide","a","perfect","balance","to","the","narrative","of","the","story",".","from","the","start","of","the","film",",","each","scene","seamlessly","echo","back","and","forth","between","image","of","the","surreal","mountain","in","Greenland",".","the","climber","be","older",",","wiser","and","more","reflect","of","they","past","adventure",".","Edurne",",","fresh","off","she","incredible","feat","of","be","the","first","woman","to","climb","all","fourteen","8000","meter","peak","in","the","world",",","tell","we","of","she","life","story",",","while","Erwan","and","Martial","seek","out","new","first","ascent","along","the","coastline",",","climbing",",","mountaineering","and","ski","touring",".","they","story","come","to","life","with","archival","footage","of","past","hardship","and","hand","draw","animation",".","each","of","the","climber","story","flow","in-and-out","of","this","voyage","through","the","fjord","in","this","magic","land","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["For

{"title":"Aji-Bi","plot":"'Aji, Akhti, come, sister', this is how Mareme, in her twenties, calls up to potential female customers, among the passers-by of the old Casablanca, to put them false eyelashes on and do rasta braids. Mareme is an 'Aji-bi', a street-hairdresser living in a small community of Senegalese women, all stranded in Casablanca. Tossed between settling down and transiting to Europe, these young women try to find their way to survive in generous and hostile Moroccan society.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Aji",",","Akhti",",","come",",","sister","'",",","this","is","how","Marem",",","in","her","twenti",",","call","up","to","potenti","femal","custom",",","among","the","passers-bi","of","the","old","Casablanca",",","to","put","them","fals","eyelash","on","and","do","rasta","braid",".","Marem","is","an","'","Aji-bi","'",",","a","street-hairdress","live","in","a","small","communiti","of","Senegales","women",",","all","strand","in","Casablanca",".","Toss","between","settl","down","and","transit","to","Europ",",","these","young","women","tri","to","find","their","way","to","surviv","in","generous","and","hostil","Moroccan","societi","."],"lemmas":["'","Aji",",","Akhti",",","come",",","sister","'",",","this","be","how","Mareme",",","in","she","twenty",",","call","up","to","potential","female","customer",",","among","the","passer-by","of","the","old","Casablanca",",","to","put","they","false","eyelash","on","and","do","rasta","braid",".","Mareme","be","a","'","aji-bi","'",",","a","street-hairdresser","living","in","a","small","community","of","senegalese","woman",",","all","strand","in","Casablanca",".","toss","between","settle","down","and","transit","to","Europe",",","these","young","woman","try","to","find","they","way","to","survive","in","generous","and","hostile","moroccan","society","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Aji ,","Aji , Akhti",", Akhti ,","Akhti , come",", come ,","come , sister",", sister '","sister ' ,","' , this",", this is","this is how","is how Mareme","how Mareme ,","Mareme , in",", in her","in her twenties","her twenties ,","twenties , calls",", calls up","calls up to","up to potential","to potential female","potential female customers","female customers ,","customers , among",", among the","among the passers-by","the passers-by of","passers-by of the","of the old","the old Casablanca","old Casablanca ,","Casablanca , to",", to put","to put them","put them false","them false eyelashes","false eyelashes on","eyelashes on and","on and do","and do rasta","do rasta braids","Mareme is an","is an '","an ' Aji-bi","' Aji-bi '","Aji-bi ' ,","' , a",", a street-hairdresser","a street-hairdresser living","street-hairdresser living in","living in a","in a small","a small community","small community of","community of Senegalese","of Senegalese women","Senegalese women ,","women , all",", all stranded","all stranded in","stranded in Casablanca","Tossed between settling","between settling down","settling down and","down and transiting","and transiting to","transiting to Europe","to Europe ,","Europe , these",", these young","these young women","young women try","women try to","try to find","to find their","find their way","their way to","way to survive","to survive in","survive in generous","in generous and","generous and hostile","and hostile Moroccan","hostile Moroccan society"],"2grams":["' Aji","Aji ,",", Akhti","Akhti ,",", come","come ,",", sister","sister '","' ,",", this","this is","is how","how Mareme","Mareme ,",", in","in her","her twenties","twenties ,",", calls","calls up","up to","to potential","potential female","female customers","customers ,",", among","among the","the passers-by","passers-by of","of the","the old","old Casablanca","Casablanca ,",", to","to put","put them","them false","false eyelashes","eyelashes on","on and","and do","do rasta","rasta braids","Mareme is","is an","an '","' Aji-bi","Aji-bi '","' ,",", a","a street-hairdresser","street-hairdresser living","living in","in a","a small","small community","community of","of Senegalese","Senegalese women","women ,",", all","all stranded","stranded in","in Casablanca","Tossed between","between settling","settling down","down and","and transiting","transiting to","to Europe","Europe ,",", these","these young","young women","women try","try to","to find","find their","their way","way to","to survive","survive in","in generous","generous and","and hostile","hostile Moroccan","Moroccan society"]}

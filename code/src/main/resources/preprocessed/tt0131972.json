{"title":"Better Living","plot":"Three grown daughters try to find their own personal ways to deal with their dysfunctional parents. The mother is an unorthodox woman with out-of-the-ordinary ideas, including one where she takes a jackhammer to the basement floor of their house to build a cavern where the family can live better. Their father, an ex-cop, disappeared 15 years earlier and then re-appeared with no explanation and commandeers his wife's project by placing the whole family in a survivalist situation. Jack is the priest-brother to the mother, who is forced to counsel the family despite his own problems with his faith.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Three","grown","daughter","tri","to","find","their","own","person","way","to","deal","with","their","dysfunct","parent",".","The","mother","is","an","unorthodox","woman","with","out-of-the-ordinari","idea",",","includ","one","where","she","take","a","jackhamm","to","the","basement","floor","of","their","hous","to","build","a","cavern","where","the","famili","can","live","better",".","Their","father",",","an","ex-cop",",","disappear","15","year","earlier","and","then","re-appear","with","no","explan","and","command","his","wife","'s","project","by","place","the","whole","famili","in","a","survivalist","situat",".","Jack","is","the","priest-broth","to","the","mother",",","who","is","forc","to","counsel","the","famili","despit","his","own","problem","with","his","faith","."],"lemmas":["three","grown","daughter","try","to","find","they","own","personal","way","to","deal","with","they","dysfunctional","parent",".","the","mother","be","a","unorthodox","woman","with","out-of-the-ordinary","idea",",","include","one","where","she","take","a","jackhammer","to","the","basement","floor","of","they","house","to","build","a","cavern","where","the","family","can","live","better",".","they","father",",","a","ex-cop",",","disappear","15","year","earlier","and","then","re-appear","with","no","explanation","and","commandeer","he","wife","'s","project","by","place","the","whole","family","in","a","survivalist","situation",".","Jack","be","the","priest-brother","to","the","mother",",","who","be","force","to","counsel","the","family","despite","he","own","problem","with","he","faith","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Three grown daughters","grown daughters try","daughters try to","try to find","to find their","find their own","their own personal","own personal ways","personal ways to","ways to deal","to deal with","deal with their","with their dysfunctional","their dysfunctional parents","The mother is","mother is an","is an unorthodox","an unorthodox woman","unorthodox woman with","woman with out-of-the-ordinary","with out-of-the-ordinary ideas","out-of-the-ordinary ideas ,","ideas , including",", including one","including one where","one where she","where she takes","she takes a","takes a jackhammer","a jackhammer to","jackhammer to the","to the basement","the basement floor","basement floor of","floor of their","of their house","their house to","house to build","to build a","build a cavern","a cavern where","cavern where the","where the family","the family can","family can live","can live better","Their father ,","father , an",", an ex-cop","an ex-cop ,","ex-cop , disappeared",", disappeared 15","disappeared 15 years","15 years earlier","years earlier and","earlier and then","and then re-appeared","then re-appeared with","re-appeared with no","with no explanation","no explanation and","explanation and commandeers","and commandeers his","commandeers his wife","his wife 's","wife 's project","'s project by","project by placing","by placing the","placing the whole","the whole family","whole family in","family in a","in a survivalist","a survivalist situation","Jack is the","is the priest-brother","the priest-brother to","priest-brother to the","to the mother","the mother ,","mother , who",", who is","who is forced","is forced to","forced to counsel","to counsel the","counsel the family","the family despite","family despite his","despite his own","his own problems","own problems with","problems with his","with his faith"],"2grams":["Three grown","grown daughters","daughters try","try to","to find","find their","their own","own personal","personal ways","ways to","to deal","deal with","with their","their dysfunctional","dysfunctional parents","The mother","mother is","is an","an unorthodox","unorthodox woman","woman with","with out-of-the-ordinary","out-of-the-ordinary ideas","ideas ,",", including","including one","one where","where she","she takes","takes a","a jackhammer","jackhammer to","to the","the basement","basement floor","floor of","of their","their house","house to","to build","build a","a cavern","cavern where","where the","the family","family can","can live","live better","Their father","father ,",", an","an ex-cop","ex-cop ,",", disappeared","disappeared 15","15 years","years earlier","earlier and","and then","then re-appeared","re-appeared with","with no","no explanation","explanation and","and commandeers","commandeers his","his wife","wife 's","'s project","project by","by placing","placing the","the whole","whole family","family in","in a","a survivalist","survivalist situation","Jack is","is the","the priest-brother","priest-brother to","to the","the mother","mother ,",", who","who is","is forced","forced to","to counsel","counsel the","the family","family despite","despite his","his own","own problems","problems with","with his","his faith"]}

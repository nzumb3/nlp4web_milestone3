{"title":"Up Not Down","plot":"Welcome to the world of rock climbing in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Climbing in the Black Hills has a rich history that spans nearly a century. This film takes the journey, from the earliest pioneers; Herb and Jan Conn, to the climbers who are pushing the standards of today. Funded by the South Dakota Artist Council and Kick starter this film has been in the making for over three years. My hope is that it will expose people to a world they did not know existed, and inspire them to create their own adventure's.","genres":["Adventure"," Sport"," Documentary"],"stems":["Welcom","to","the","world","of","rock","climb","in","the","Black","Hill","of","South","Dakota","and","Wyom",".","Climb","in","the","Black","Hill","has","a","rich","histori","that","span","near","a","centuri",".","This","film","take","the","journey",",","from","the","earliest","pioneer",";","Herb","and","Jan","Conn",",","to","the","climber","who","are","push","the","standard","of","today",".","Fund","by","the","South","Dakota","Artist","Council","and","Kick","starter","this","film","has","been","in","the","make","for","over","three","year",".","My","hope","is","that","it","will","expos","peopl","to","a","world","they","did","not","know","exist",",","and","inspir","them","to","creat","their","own","adventur","'s","."],"lemmas":["welcome","to","the","world","of","rock","climbing","in","the","Black","Hills","of","South","Dakota","and","Wyoming",".","climb","in","the","Black","Hills","have","a","rich","history","that","span","nearly","a","century",".","this","film","take","the","journey",",","from","the","earliest","pioneer",";","Herb","and","Jan","Conn",",","to","the","climber","who","be","push","the","standard","of","today",".","fund","by","the","South","Dakota","Artist","Council","and","Kick","starter","this","film","have","be","in","the","making","for","over","three","year",".","my","hope","be","that","it","will","expose","people","to","a","world","they","do","not","know","exist",",","and","inspire","they","to","create","they","own","adventure","'s","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Welcome to the","to the world","the world of","world of rock","of rock climbing","rock climbing in","climbing in the","in the Black","the Black Hills","Black Hills of","Hills of South","of South Dakota","South Dakota and","Dakota and Wyoming","Climbing in the","in the Black","the Black Hills","Black Hills has","Hills has a","has a rich","a rich history","rich history that","history that spans","that spans nearly","spans nearly a","nearly a century","This film takes","film takes the","takes the journey","the journey ,","journey , from",", from the","from the earliest","the earliest pioneers","earliest pioneers ;","pioneers ; Herb","; Herb and","Herb and Jan","and Jan Conn","Jan Conn ,","Conn , to",", to the","to the climbers","the climbers who","climbers who are","who are pushing","are pushing the","pushing the standards","the standards of","standards of today","Funded by the","by the South","the South Dakota","South Dakota Artist","Dakota Artist Council","Artist Council and","Council and Kick","and Kick starter","Kick starter this","starter this film","this film has","film has been","has been in","been in the","in the making","the making for","making for over","for over three","over three years","My hope is","hope is that","is that it","that it will","it will expose","will expose people","expose people to","people to a","to a world","a world they","world they did","they did not","did not know","not know existed","know existed ,","existed , and",", and inspire","and inspire them","inspire them to","them to create","to create their","create their own","their own adventure","own adventure 's"],"2grams":["Welcome to","to the","the world","world of","of rock","rock climbing","climbing in","in the","the Black","Black Hills","Hills of","of South","South Dakota","Dakota and","and Wyoming","Climbing in","in the","the Black","Black Hills","Hills has","has a","a rich","rich history","history that","that spans","spans nearly","nearly a","a century","This film","film takes","takes the","the journey","journey ,",", from","from the","the earliest","earliest pioneers","pioneers ;","; Herb","Herb and","and Jan","Jan Conn","Conn ,",", to","to the","the climbers","climbers who","who are","are pushing","pushing the","the standards","standards of","of today","Funded by","by the","the South","South Dakota","Dakota Artist","Artist Council","Council and","and Kick","Kick starter","starter this","this film","film has","has been","been in","in the","the making","making for","for over","over three","three years","My hope","hope is","is that","that it","it will","will expose","expose people","people to","to a","a world","world they","they did","did not","not know","know existed","existed ,",", and","and inspire","inspire them","them to","to create","create their","their own","own adventure","adventure 's"]}

{"title":"Kalavani","plot":"Vimalraj (the grubby Meenakshi Sundaram from Pasanga) is the ill-behaved son of the gullible Saranya and her husband Ilavarasu. Vimalraj's financial needs are met by his susceptible mother, whom he either hoodwinks or intimidates to fulfill his frequent needs to gamble or hang out with his friends. He pushes the boat out and spends his time whiling away, aided by his friends. In the course of the time, he also spots a girl and falls in love with her - much to the despair of her brother who nurses a rivalry against him. What happens next forms the climax.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Vimalraj","(","the","grubbi","Meenakshi","Sundaram","from","Pasanga",")","is","the","ill-behav","son","of","the","gullibl","Saranya","and","her","husband","Ilavarasu",".","Vimalraj","'s","financi","need","are","met","by","his","suscept","mother",",","whom","he","either","hoodwink","or","intimid","to","fulfil","his","frequent","need","to","gambl","or","hang","out","with","his","friend",".","He","push","the","boat","out","and","spend","his","time","while","away",",","aid","by","his","friend",".","In","the","cours","of","the","time",",","he","also","spot","a","girl","and","fall","in","love","with","her","-","much","to","the","despair","of","her","brother","who","nurs","a","rivalri","against","him",".","What","happen","next","form","the","climax","."],"lemmas":["vimalraj","-lrb-","the","grubby","Meenakshi","Sundaram","from","Pasanga","-rrb-","be","the","ill-behaved","son","of","the","gullible","Saranya","and","she","husband","Ilavarasu",".","Vimalraj","'s","financial","need","be","meet","by","he","susceptible","mother",",","whom","he","either","hoodwink","or","intimidate","to","fulfill","he","frequent","need","to","gamble","or","hang","out","with","he","friend",".","he","push","the","boat","out","and","spend","he","time","while","away",",","aid","by","he","friend",".","in","the","course","of","the","time",",","he","also","spot","a","girl","and","fall","in","love","with","she","-","much","to","the","despair","of","she","brother","who","nurse","a","rivalry","against","he",".","what","happen","next","form","the","climax","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Vimalraj ( the","( the grubby","the grubby Meenakshi","grubby Meenakshi Sundaram","Meenakshi Sundaram from","Sundaram from Pasanga","from Pasanga )","Pasanga ) is",") is the","is the ill-behaved","the ill-behaved son","ill-behaved son of","son of the","of the gullible","the gullible Saranya","gullible Saranya and","Saranya and her","and her husband","her husband Ilavarasu","Vimalraj 's financial","'s financial needs","financial needs are","needs are met","are met by","met by his","by his susceptible","his susceptible mother","susceptible mother ,","mother , whom",", whom he","whom he either","he either hoodwinks","either hoodwinks or","hoodwinks or intimidates","or intimidates to","intimidates to fulfill","to fulfill his","fulfill his frequent","his frequent needs","frequent needs to","needs to gamble","to gamble or","gamble or hang","or hang out","hang out with","out with his","with his friends","He pushes the","pushes the boat","the boat out","boat out and","out and spends","and spends his","spends his time","his time whiling","time whiling away","whiling away ,","away , aided",", aided by","aided by his","by his friends","In the course","the course of","course of the","of the time","the time ,","time , he",", he also","he also spots","also spots a","spots a girl","a girl and","girl and falls","and falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with her","with her -","her - much","- much to","much to the","to the despair","the despair of","despair of her","of her brother","her brother who","brother who nurses","who nurses a","nurses a rivalry","a rivalry against","rivalry against him","What happens next","happens next forms","next forms the","forms the climax"],"2grams":["Vimalraj (","( the","the grubby","grubby Meenakshi","Meenakshi Sundaram","Sundaram from","from Pasanga","Pasanga )",") is","is the","the ill-behaved","ill-behaved son","son of","of the","the gullible","gullible Saranya","Saranya and","and her","her husband","husband Ilavarasu","Vimalraj 's","'s financial","financial needs","needs are","are met","met by","by his","his susceptible","susceptible mother","mother ,",", whom","whom he","he either","either hoodwinks","hoodwinks or","or intimidates","intimidates to","to fulfill","fulfill his","his frequent","frequent needs","needs to","to gamble","gamble or","or hang","hang out","out with","with his","his friends","He pushes","pushes the","the boat","boat out","out and","and spends","spends his","his time","time whiling","whiling away","away ,",", aided","aided by","by his","his friends","In the","the course","course of","of the","the time","time ,",", he","he also","also spots","spots a","a girl","girl and","and falls","falls in","in love","love with","with her","her -","- much","much to","to the","the despair","despair of","of her","her brother","brother who","who nurses","nurses a","a rivalry","rivalry against","against him","What happens","happens next","next forms","forms the","the climax"]}

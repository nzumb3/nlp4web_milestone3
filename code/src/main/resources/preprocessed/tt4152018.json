{"title":"Lets Block","plot":"Miroslav Broz's quixotic struggle to improve the status of the Roma in the Czech Republic has found expression in protests for the removal of a pig farm. The lack of participants in the planned blockade leads to frustration and lost hope for fulfilling the vision of a more active civil society. The diffidence from the protest's outcome is contrasted with the terseness of Broz's voiceover commentary and his activities on social networks, which are subtly edited onto the screen.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Miroslav","Broz","'s","quixot","struggl","to","improv","the","status","of","the","Roma","in","the","Czech","Republ","has","found","express","in","protest","for","the","remov","of","a","pig","farm",".","The","lack","of","particip","in","the","plan","blockad","lead","to","frustrat","and","lost","hope","for","fulfil","the","vision","of","a","more","activ","civil","societi",".","The","diffid","from","the","protest","'s","outcom","is","contrast","with","the","ters","of","Broz","'s","voiceov","commentari","and","his","activ","on","social","network",",","which","are","subt","edit","onto","the","screen","."],"lemmas":["Miroslav","Broz","'s","quixotic","struggle","to","improve","the","status","of","the","Roma","in","the","Czech","Republic","have","find","expression","in","protest","for","the","removal","of","a","pig","farm",".","the","lack","of","participant","in","the","plan","blockade","lead","to","frustration","and","lose","hope","for","fulfil","the","vision","of","a","more","active","civil","society",".","the","diffidence","from","the","protest","'s","outcome","be","contrast","with","the","terseness","of","Broz","'s","voiceover","commentary","and","he","activity","on","social","network",",","which","be","subtly","edit","onto","the","screen","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Miroslav Broz 's","Broz 's quixotic","'s quixotic struggle","quixotic struggle to","struggle to improve","to improve the","improve the status","the status of","status of the","of the Roma","the Roma in","Roma in the","in the Czech","the Czech Republic","Czech Republic has","Republic has found","has found expression","found expression in","expression in protests","in protests for","protests for the","for the removal","the removal of","removal of a","of a pig","a pig farm","The lack of","lack of participants","of participants in","participants in the","in the planned","the planned blockade","planned blockade leads","blockade leads to","leads to frustration","to frustration and","frustration and lost","and lost hope","lost hope for","hope for fulfilling","for fulfilling the","fulfilling the vision","the vision of","vision of a","of a more","a more active","more active civil","active civil society","The diffidence from","diffidence from the","from the protest","the protest 's","protest 's outcome","'s outcome is","outcome is contrasted","is contrasted with","contrasted with the","with the terseness","the terseness of","terseness of Broz","of Broz 's","Broz 's voiceover","'s voiceover commentary","voiceover commentary and","commentary and his","and his activities","his activities on","activities on social","on social networks","social networks ,","networks , which",", which are","which are subtly","are subtly edited","subtly edited onto","edited onto the","onto the screen"],"2grams":["Miroslav Broz","Broz 's","'s quixotic","quixotic struggle","struggle to","to improve","improve the","the status","status of","of the","the Roma","Roma in","in the","the Czech","Czech Republic","Republic has","has found","found expression","expression in","in protests","protests for","for the","the removal","removal of","of a","a pig","pig farm","The lack","lack of","of participants","participants in","in the","the planned","planned blockade","blockade leads","leads to","to frustration","frustration and","and lost","lost hope","hope for","for fulfilling","fulfilling the","the vision","vision of","of a","a more","more active","active civil","civil society","The diffidence","diffidence from","from the","the protest","protest 's","'s outcome","outcome is","is contrasted","contrasted with","with the","the terseness","terseness of","of Broz","Broz 's","'s voiceover","voiceover commentary","commentary and","and his","his activities","activities on","on social","social networks","networks ,",", which","which are","are subtly","subtly edited","edited onto","onto the","the screen"]}

{"title":"Inercija proslosti","plot":"INERTIA OF THE PAST A Film about March 27th 1941 \"Inertia of the Past\" is a full-length documentary film about the event that is probably the single most important event in the XX century history of Serbia and Belgrade. Also, this is one of the rare dates of the XX century of Europe that Serbia can claim. On that March 27th 1941, the people of Belgrade said \"NO\" to Hitler - an act unthinkable in the conquered Europe of that time. On that day, the army performed a coup against Yugoslavia joining the Tripartite Pact with Nazi Germany and fascist Italy. The film deals with the genesis of events that led to such a Serbian reaction.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["INERTIA","OF","THE","PAST","A","Film","about","March","27th","1941","\"","Inertia","of","the","Past","\"","is","a","full-length","documentari","film","about","the","event","that","is","probabl","the","singl","most","import","event","in","the","XX","centuri","histori","of","Serbia","and","Belgrad",".","Also",",","this","is","one","of","the","rare","date","of","the","XX","centuri","of","Europ","that","Serbia","can","claim",".","On","that","March","27th","1941",",","the","peopl","of","Belgrad","said","\"","NO","\"","to","Hitler","-","an","act","unthink","in","the","conquer","Europ","of","that","time",".","On","that","day",",","the","armi","perform","a","coup","against","Yugoslavia","join","the","Tripartit","Pact","with","Nazi","Germani","and","fascist","Itali",".","The","film","deal","with","the","genesi","of","event","that","led","to","such","a","Serbian","reaction","."],"lemmas":["inertia","of","the","PAST","A","Film","about","March","27th","1941","``","inertia","of","the","Past","''","be","a","full-length","documentary","film","about","the","event","that","be","probably","the","single","most","important","event","in","the","xx","century","history","of","Serbia","and","Belgrade",".","also",",","this","be","one","of","the","rare","date","of","the","XX","century","of","Europe","that","Serbia","can","claim",".","on","that","March","27th","1941",",","the","people","of","Belgrade","say","``","no","''","to","Hitler","-","a","act","unthinkable","in","the","conquer","Europe","of","that","time",".","on","that","day",",","the","army","perform","a","coup","against","Yugoslavia","join","the","Tripartite","Pact","with","Nazi","Germany","and","fascist","Italy",".","the","film","deal","with","the","genesis","of","event","that","lead","to","such","a","serbian","reaction","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["INERTIA OF THE","OF THE PAST","THE PAST A","PAST A Film","A Film about","Film about March","about March 27th","March 27th 1941","27th 1941 \"","1941 \" Inertia","\" Inertia of","Inertia of the","of the Past","the Past \"","Past \" is","\" is a","is a full-length","a full-length documentary","full-length documentary film","documentary film about","film about the","about the event","the event that","event that is","that is probably","is probably the","probably the single","the single most","single most important","most important event","important event in","event in the","in the XX","the XX century","XX century history","century history of","history of Serbia","of Serbia and","Serbia and Belgrade","Also , this",", this is","this is one","is one of","one of the","of the rare","the rare dates","rare dates of","dates of the","of the XX","the XX century","XX century of","century of Europe","of Europe that","Europe that Serbia","that Serbia can","Serbia can claim","On that March","that March 27th","March 27th 1941","27th 1941 ,","1941 , the",", the people","the people of","people of Belgrade","of Belgrade said","Belgrade said \"","said \" NO","\" NO \"","NO \" to","\" to Hitler","to Hitler -","Hitler -

{"title":"Mystery Mardi Gras Shipwreck","plot":"A mysterious sinking, a group of dedicated scientists and technicians and a 200 year old shipwreck have all collided in the Gulf of Mexico. Four thousand feet below the choppy seas the remains of a 19th century shipwreck lie in wait and a month long expedition has been mounted to uncover her secrets. This is the deepest underwater archaeological project ever attempted in the Gulf of Mexico. And it's a race against time to uncover the Mardi Gras shipwreck and solve the mystery. The Department of Oceanography at Texas A&M University has assembled a world class team of underwater archaeologists from A&M and the Minerals Management Service and submersible pilots from Veolia ES Special Service to tease the secrets from a buried hulk lying deep in the Gulf of Mexico. The 4.8 million dollar expedition has been over 2 years in the making and the team has less than three weeks to recover as many artifacts as possible from the site. Using a state of the art remotely operated vehicle the pilots will retrieve items as small as Spanish coins and as large as a 950 pound cannon. All in hopes of putting a name to this shipwreck and writing a new chapter in the maritime history of the Gulf of Mexico.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","mysteri","sink",",","a","group","of","dedic","scientist","and","technician","and","a","200","year","old","shipwreck","have","all","collid","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","Four","thousand","feet","below","the","choppi","sea","the","remain","of","a","19th","centuri","shipwreck","lie","in","wait","and","a","month","long","expedit","has","been","mount","to","uncov","her","secret",".","This","is","the","deepest","underwat","archaeolog","project","ever","attempt","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","And","it","'s","a","race","against","time","to","uncov","the","Mardi","Gras","shipwreck","and","solv","the","mysteri",".","The","Depart","of","Oceanographi","at","Texa","A&M","Univers","has","assembl","a","world","class","team","of","underwat","archaeologist","from","A&M","and","the","Miner","Manag","Servic","and","submers","pilot","from","Veolia","ES","Special","Servic","to","teas","the","secret","from","a","buri","hulk","lie","deep","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","The","4.8","million","dollar","expedit","has","been","over","2","year","in","the","make","and","the","team","has","less","than","three","week","to","recov","as","mani","artifact","as","possibl","from","the","site",".","Using","a","state","of","the","art","remot","oper","vehicl","the","pilot","will","retriev","item","as","small","as","Spanish","coin","and","as","larg","as","a","950","pound","cannon",".","All","in","hope","of","put","a","name","to","this","shipwreck","and","write","a","new","chapter","in","the","maritim","histori","of","the","Gulf","of","Mexico","."],"lemmas":["a","mysterious","sinking",",","a","group","of","dedicated","scientist","and","technician","and","a","200","year","old","shipwreck","have","all","collide","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","four","thousand","foot","below","the","choppy","sea","the","remains","of","a","19th","century","shipwreck","lie","in","wait","and","a","month","long","expedition","have","be","mount","to","uncover","she","secret",".","this","be","the","deepest","underwater","archaeological","project","ever","attempt","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","and","it","be","a","race","against","time","to","uncover","the","Mardi","Gras","shipwreck","and","solve","the","mystery",".","the","Department","of","Oceanography","at","Texas","A&M","University","have","assemble","a","world","class","team","of","underwater","archaeologist","from","A&M","and","the","Minerals","Management","Service","and","submersible","pilot","from","Veolia","es","special","Service","to","tease","the","secret","from","a","bury","hulk","lie","deep","in","the","Gulf","of","Mexico",".","the","4.8","million","dollar","expedition","have","be","over","2","year","in","the","making","and","the","team","have","less","than","three","week","to","recover","as","many","artifact","as","possible","from","the","site",".","use","a","state","of","the","art","remotely","operate","vehicle","the","pilot","will","retrieve","item","as","small","as","spanish","coin","and","as","large","as","a","950","pound","cannon",".","all","in","hope","of","put","a","name","to","this","shipwreck","and","write","a","new","chapter","in","the","maritime","history","of","the","Gulf","of","Mexico","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A

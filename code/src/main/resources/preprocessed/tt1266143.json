{"title":"The Orange Chronicles","plot":"The 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine was a massive civil demonstration for democracy and against electoral fraud. Millions of empassioned citizens braved freezing weather conditions to fight against stolen elections and to protest the poisoning of their candidate, Victor Yushchenko. From Kyiv to Donetsk, from Odessa, to Lviv, the filmmaker personally engaged with Ukrainians on all sides of the debate to compile \"The Orange Chronicles\", a personal account of three months spent in the midst of this unique, peaceful uprising. The film explored what motivated the people to activate, as well as the emotional conflicts among a bitterly divided populace, as highlighted in \"The Train of Friendship\" caravan to censored \"Blue\" regions of Ukraine. The film is a tribute to the human spirit, whose yearning for freedom, justice and the pursuit of happiness will not be denied. In the process of documenting the Orange Revolution, Kolodiy rediscovers his own modern Ukrainian identity and comes to understand the personal imperatives behind one nation's fight for justice.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","2004","Orang","Revolut","in","Ukrain","was","a","massiv","civil","demonstr","for","democraci","and","against","elector","fraud",".","Million","of","empass","citizen","brave","freez","weather","condit","to","fight","against","stolen","elect","and","to","protest","the","poison","of","their","candid",",","Victor","Yushchenko",".","From","Kyiv","to","Donetsk",",","from","Odessa",",","to","Lviv",",","the","filmmak","person","engag","with","Ukrainian","on","all","side","of","the","debat","to","compil","\"","The","Orang","Chronicl","\"",",","a","person","account","of","three","month","spent","in","the","midst","of","this","uniqu",",","peac","upris",".","The","film","explor","what","motiv","the","peopl","to","activ",",","as","well","as","the","emot","conflict","among","a","bitter","divid","populac",",","as","highlight","in","\"","The","Train","of","Friendship","\"","caravan","to","censor","\"","Blue","\"","region","of","Ukrain",".","The","film","is","a","tribut","to","the","human","spirit",",","whose","yearn","for","freedom",",","justic","and","the","pursuit","of","happi","will","not","be","deni",".","In","the","process","of","document","the","Orang","Revolut",",","Kolodiy","rediscov","his","own","modern","Ukrainian","ident","and","come","to","understand","the","person","imper","behind","one","nation","'s","fight","for","justic","."],"lemmas":["the","2004","Orange","Revolution","in","Ukraine","be","a","massive","civil","demonstration","for","democracy","and","against","electoral","fraud",".","million","of","empassioned","citizen","brave","freezing","weather","condition","to","fight","against","steal","election","and","to","protest","the","poisoning","of","they","candidate",",","Victor","Yushchenko",".","from","Kyiv","to","Donetsk",",","from","Odessa",",","to","Lviv",",","the","filmmaker","personally","engage","with","Ukrainians","on","all","side","of","the","debate","to","compile","``","the","Orange","chronicle","''",",","a","personal","account","of","three","month","spend","in","the","midst","of","this","unique",",","peaceful","uprising",".","the","film","explore","what","motivate","the","people","to","activate",",","as","well","as","the","emotional","conflict","among","a","bitterly","divide","populace",",","as","highlight","in","``","the","train","of","friendship","''","caravan","to","censor","``","Blue","''","region","of","Ukraine",".","the","film","be","a","tribute","to","the","human","spirit",",","whose","yearning","for","freedom",",","justice","and","the","pursuit","of","happiness","will","not","be","deny",".","in","the","process","of","document","the","Orange","Revolution",",","Kolodiy","rediscover","he","own","modern","ukrainian","identity","and","come","to","understand","the","personal","imperative","behind","one","nation","'s","fight","for","justice","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

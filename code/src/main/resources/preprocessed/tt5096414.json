{"title":"The March of the White Elephants","plot":"\"How FIFA prowls the globe, pocketing billions and leaving host countries with a legacy of empty stadiums and social distress.\" The March of the White Elephants debunks the conventional wisdom that staging a World Cup in compliance with the FIFA model delivers sustainable benefits to the population of the host country. It reveals the real legacy of the FIFA World Cup - state of the art stadiums that were built to stage a four-week tournament will stand idle for decades to come, soaking up funds needed for health, housing and education. Filmed primarily during the high energy protests against the FIFA 2104 WC in Brazil, the story tracks a left wing journalist who is upset about how his country has been abused, and through his eyes we move between the streets and the commentary of those close to the inner workings of the FIFA machine. We also go back to Durban South Africa to get direct testimony from social activists who make it clear that from their perspective that FIFA is a modern day parasite abusing both South Africa, Brazils and many other countries love of Football","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["\"","How","FIFA","prowl","the","globe",",","pocket","billion","and","leav","host","countri","with","a","legaci","of","empti","stadium","and","social","distress",".","\"","The","March","of","the","White","Elephant","debunk","the","convent","wisdom","that","stage","a","World","Cup","in","complianc","with","the","FIFA","model","deliv","sustain","benefit","to","the","popul","of","the","host","countri",".","It","reveal","the","real","legaci","of","the","FIFA","World","Cup","-","state","of","the","art","stadium","that","were","built","to","stage","a","four-week","tournament","will","stand","idl","for","decad","to","come",",","soak","up","fund","need","for","health",",","hous","and","educ",".","Film","primarili","dure","the","high","energi","protest","against","the","FIFA","2104","WC","in","Brazil",",","the","stori","track","a","left","wing","journalist","who","is","upset","about","how","his","countri","has","been","abus",",","and","through","his","eye","we","move","between","the","street","and","the","commentari","of","those","close","to","the","inner","work","of","the","FIFA","machin",".","We","also","go","back","to","Durban","South","Africa","to","get","direct","testimoni","from","social","activist","who","make","it","clear","that","from","their","perspect","that","FIFA","is","a","modern","day","parasit","abus","both","South","Africa",",","Brazil","and","mani","other","countri","love","of","Footbal"],"lemmas":["``","how","FIFA","prowl","the","globe",",","pocket","billion","and","leave","host","country","with","a","legacy","of","empty","stadium","and","social","distress",".","''","the","March","of","the","White","Elephants","debunk","the","conventional","wisdom","that","stage","a","World","Cup","in","compliance","with","the","FIFA","model","deliver","sustainable","benefit","to","the","population","of","the","host","country",".","it","reveal","the","real","legacy","of","the","FIFA","World","Cup","-","state","of","the","art","stadium","that","be","build","to","stage","a","four-week","tournament","will","stand","idle","for","decade","to","come",",","soak","up","fund","need","for","health",",","housing","and","education",".","film","primarily","during","the","high","energy","protest","against","the","FIFA","2104","WC","in","Brazil",",","the","story","track","a","left","wing","journalist","who","be","upset","about","how","he","country","have","be","abuse",",","and","through","he","eye","we","move","between","the","street","and","the","commentary","of","those","close","to","the","inner","workings","of","the","FIFA","machine",".","we","also","go","back","to","Durban","South","Africa","to","get","direct","testimony","from","social","activist","who","make","it","clear","that","from","they","perspective","that","FIFA","be","a","modern","day","parasite","abuse","both","South","Africa",",","Brazils","and","many","other","country","love","of","Football"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" How FIFA","How FIFA prowls","FIFA prowls the","prowls the globe","the globe ,","globe , pocketing",", pocketing billions","pocketing billions and","billions and leaving","and leaving host","leaving host countries","host countries with","countries with a","with a legacy","a legacy of","legacy of empty","of empty stadiums","empty stadiums and","stadiums and social","and social distress","social distress .","distress . \"","The March of","March of the","of the White","the White Elephants","White Elephants debunks","Elephants debunks the","debunks the conventional","the conventional wisdom","conventional wisdom that","wisdom that staging","that staging a","staging a World","a World Cup","World Cup in","Cup in compliance","in compliance with","compliance with the","with the FIFA","the FIFA model","FIFA model delivers","model delivers sustainable","delivers sustainable benefits","sustainable benefits to","benefits to the","to the population","the population of","population of the","of the host","the host country","It reveals the","reveals the real","the real legacy","real legacy of","legacy of the","of the FIFA","the FIFA World","FIFA World Cup","World Cup -","Cup -

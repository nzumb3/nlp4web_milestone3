{"title":"The Heiner Affair: A Play","plot":"This film poses a simple question: If a 14-year-old black girl is pack-raped by four older youths, should the police always investigate and seek justice on her behalf? On the one hand, in Queensland, in the case of Anna, the powers of government effectively answered no. In Anna's case, Queensland government officials refused to act - and even destroyed the evidence. The police, crime commissions, and even the Queensland governor declined to get involved. On the other hand, a few ordinary people in a small country town believe that the rule of law should be the same for all, that Anna deserves justice, and that it is past time to answer the above question with a resounding 'Yes'.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","film","pose","a","simpl","question",":","If","a","14-year-old","black","girl","is","pack-rap","by","four","older","youth",",","should","the","polic","alway","investig","and","seek","justic","on","her","behalf","?","On","the","one","hand",",","in","Queensland",",","in","the","case","of","Anna",",","the","power","of","govern","effect","answer","no",".","In","Anna","'s","case",",","Queensland","govern","offici","refus","to","act","-","and","even","destroy","the","evid",".","The","polic",",","crime","commiss",",","and","even","the","Queensland","governor","declin","to","get","involv",".","On","the","other","hand",",","a","few","ordinari","peopl","in","a","small","countri","town","believ","that","the","rule","of","law","should","be","the","same","for","all",",","that","Anna","deserv","justic",",","and","that","it","is","past","time","to","answer","the","abov","question","with","a","resound","'","Yes","'","."],"lemmas":["this","film","pose","a","simple","question",":","if","a","14-year-old","black","girl","be","pack-raped","by","four","older","youth",",","should","the","police","always","investigate","and","seek","justice","on","she","behalf","?","on","the","one","hand",",","in","Queensland",",","in","the","case","of","Anna",",","the","power","of","government","effectively","answer","no",".","in","Anna","'s","case",",","Queensland","government","official","refuse","to","act","-","and","even","destroy","the","evidence",".","the","police",",","crime","commission",",","and","even","the","Queensland","governor","decline","to","get","involve",".","on","the","other","hand",",","a","few","ordinary","people","in","a","small","country","town","believe","that","the","rule","of","law","should","be","the","same","for","all",",","that","Anna","deserve","justice",",","and","that","it","be","past","time","to","answer","the","above","question","with","a","resounding","'","Yes","'","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This film poses","film poses a","poses a simple","a simple question","simple question :","question : If",": If a","If a 14-year-old","a 14-year-old black","14-year-old black girl","black girl is","girl is pack-raped","is pack-raped by","pack-raped by four","by four older","four older youths","older youths ,","youths , should",", should the","should the police","the police always","police always investigate","always investigate and","investigate and seek","and seek justice","seek justice on","justice on her","on her behalf","On the one","the one hand","one hand ,","hand , in",", in Queensland","in Queensland ,","Queensland , in",", in the","in the case","the case of","case of Anna","of Anna ,","Anna , the",", the powers","the powers of","powers of government","of government effectively","government effectively answered","effectively answered no","In Anna 's","Anna 's case","'s case ,","case , Queensland",", Queensland government","Queensland government officials","government officials refused","officials refused to","refused to act","to act -","act -

{"title":"The Lazarus Effect","plot":"THE LAZARUS EFFECT follows a group of researchers led by Frank and his fiancé Zoe who've achieved the unimaginable - bringing the dead back to life. After a successful, yet unsanctioned, trial on a newly deceased animal, the team is ready to unveil their breakthrough to the world. When the dean of their university learns of their underground experiments, their project is unexpectedly shut down and their materials confiscated. Frank, Zoe and their team take matters into their own hands, launching a rogue attempt to recreate their experiment, during which things go terribly wrong and one of their own, Zoe, is horrifically killed. Fueled by terror and grief, Frank pushes them to do the unthinkable: attempt to resurrect their first human test subject. Initially, the procedure appears a success, but the team soon realizes something is wrong with Zoe. As her strange new persona reveals itself, the team quickly becomes stuck in a gruesome reality. They are no longer faced with the question of whether they can bring someone back to life- but rather, the wrath of her return.","genres":["Horror"," Sci-Fi"," Mystery"],"stems":["THE","LAZARUS","EFFECT","follow","a","group","of","research","led","by","Frank","and","his","fiancé","Zoe","who","ve","achiev","the","unimagin","-","bring","the","dead","back","to","life",".","After","a","success",",","yet","unsanct",",","trial","on","a","newli","deceas","anim",",","the","team","is","readi","to","unveil","their","breakthrough","to","the","world",".","When","the","dean","of","their","univers","learn","of","their","underground","experi",",","their","project","is","unexpect","shut","down","and","their","materi","confisc",".","Frank",",","Zoe","and","their","team","take","matter","into","their","own","hand",",","launch","a","rogu","attempt","to","recreat","their","experi",",","dure","which","thing","go","terribl","wrong","and","one","of","their","own",",","Zoe",",","is","horrif","kill",".","Fuel","by","terror","and","grief",",","Frank","push","them","to","do","the","unthink",":","attempt","to","resurrect","their","first","human","test","subject",".","Initial",",","the","procedur","appear","a","success",",","but","the","team","soon","realiz","someth","is","wrong","with","Zoe",".","As","her","strang","new","persona","reveal","itself",",","the","team","quick","becom","stuck","in","a","gruesom","realiti",".","They","are","no","longer","face","with","the","question","of","whether","they","can","bring","someon","back","to","life","-","but","rather",",","the","wrath","of","her","return","."],"lemmas":["the","LAZARUS","EFFECT","follow","a","group","of","researcher","lead","by","Frank","and","he","fiancé","Zoe","who","have","achieve","the","unimaginable","-","bring","the","dead","back","to","life",".","after","a","successful",",","yet","unsanctioned",",","trial","on","a","newly","decease","animal",",","the","team","be","ready","to","unveil","they","breakthrough","to","the","world",".","when","the","dean","of","they","university","learn","of","they","underground","experiment",",","they","project","be","unexpectedly","shut","down","and","they","material","confiscate",".","Frank",",","Zoe","and","they","team","take","matter","into","they","own","hand",",","launch","a","rogue","attempt","to","recreate","they","experiment",",","during","which","thing","go","terribly","wrong","and","one","of","they","own",",","zoe",",","be","horrifically","kill",".","fuel","by","terror","and","grief",",","Frank","push","they","to","do","the","unthinkable",":","attempt","to","resurrect","they","first","human","test","subject",".","initially",",","the","procedure","appear","a","success",",","but","the","team","soon","realize","something","be","wrong","with","zoe",".","as","she","strange","new","persona","reveal","itself",",","the","team","quickly","become","stick","in","a","gruesome","reality",".","they","be","no","longer","face","with","the","question","of","whether","they","can","bring","someone","back","to","life","-","but","rather",",","the","wrath","of","she","return","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["THE LAZARUS EFFECT","LAZARUS EFFECT follows","EFFECT follows a","follows a group","a group of","group of researchers","of researchers led","researchers led by","led by Frank","by Frank and","Frank and his","and his fiancé","his fiancé Zoe","fiancé Zoe who","Zoe who 've","who 've achieved","'ve achieved the","achieved the unimaginable","the unimaginable -","unimaginable -

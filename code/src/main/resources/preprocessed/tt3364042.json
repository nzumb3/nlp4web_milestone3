{"title":"Battling Darkness","plot":"Prior to 1973, Satan seemed all but dead and gone, the causality of a modernist mindset. But with Linda Blair's disturbing performance in The Exorcist, Satan returned with a vengeance and since then films about demonic possession have fascinated viewers worldwide. However, was the visage of Satan that returned Biblical or distorted? And how have these images influenced society's view of the demonic and spiritual warfare? In this thought provoking documentary, these questions are examined with objectivity and insight from psychologists, modern-day exorcists and leading voices in Christianity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Prior","to","1973",",","Satan","seem","all","but","dead","and","gone",",","the","causal","of","a","modernist","mindset",".","But","with","Linda","Blair","'s","disturb","perform","in","The","Exorcist",",","Satan","return","with","a","vengeanc","and","sinc","then","film","about","demon","possess","have","fascin","viewer","worldwid",".","Howev",",","was","the","visag","of","Satan","that","return","Biblic","or","distort","?","And","how","have","these","imag","influenc","societi","'s","view","of","the","demon","and","spiritu","warfar","?","In","this","thought","provok","documentari",",","these","question","are","examin","with","object","and","insight","from","psychologist",",","modern-day","exorcist","and","lead","voic","in","Christian","."],"lemmas":["prior","to","1973",",","Satan","seem","all","but","dead","and","go",",","the","causality","of","a","modernist","mindset",".","but","with","Linda","Blair","'s","disturbing","performance","in","the","Exorcist",",","Satan","return","with","a","vengeance","and","since","then","film","about","demonic","possession","have","fascinate","viewer","worldwide",".","however",",","be","the","visage","of","Satan","that","return","biblical","or","distorted","?","and","how","have","these","image","influence","society","'s","view","of","the","demonic","and","spiritual","warfare","?","in","this","thought","provoke","documentary",",","these","question","be","examine","with","objectivity","and","insight","from","psychologist",",","modern-day","exorcist","and","lead","voice","in","Christianity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Prior to 1973","to 1973 ,","1973 , Satan",", Satan seemed","Satan seemed all","seemed all but","all but dead","but dead and","dead and gone","and gone ,","gone , the",", the causality","the causality of","causality of a","of a modernist","a modernist mindset","But with Linda","with Linda Blair","Linda Blair 's","Blair 's disturbing","'s disturbing performance","disturbing performance in","performance in The","in The Exorcist","The Exorcist ,","Exorcist , Satan",", Satan returned","Satan returned with","returned with a","with a vengeance","a vengeance and","vengeance and since","and since then","since then films","then films about","films about demonic","about demonic possession","demonic possession have","possession have fascinated","have fascinated viewers","fascinated viewers worldwide","However , was",", was the","was the visage","the visage of","visage of Satan","of Satan that","Satan that returned","that returned Biblical","returned Biblical or","Biblical or distorted","And how have","how have these","have these images","these images influenced","images influenced society","influenced society 's","society 's view","'s view of","view of the","of the demonic","the demonic and","demonic and spiritual","and spiritual warfare","In this thought","this thought provoking","thought provoking documentary","provoking documentary ,","documentary , these",", these questions","these questions are","questions are examined","are examined with","examined with objectivity","with objectivity and","objectivity and insight","and insight from","insight from psychologists","from psychologists ,","psychologists , modern-day",", modern-day exorcists","modern-day exorcists and","exorcists and leading","and leading voices","leading voices in","voices in Christianity"],"2grams":["Prior to","to 1973","1973 ,",", Satan","Satan seemed","seemed all","all but","but dead","dead and","and gone","gone ,",", the","the causality","causality of","of a","a modernist","modernist mindset","But with","with Linda","Linda Blair","Blair 's","'s disturbing","disturbing performance","performance in","in The","The Exorcist","Exorcist ,",", Satan","Satan returned","returned with","with a","a vengeance","vengeance and","and since","since then","then films","films about","about demonic","demonic possession","possession have","have fascinated","fascinated viewers","viewers worldwide","However ,",", was","was the","the visage","visage of","of Satan","Satan that","that returned","returned Biblical","Biblical or","or distorted","And how","how have","have these","these images","images influenced","influenced society","society 's","'s view","view of","of the","the demonic","demonic and","and spiritual","spiritual warfare","In this","this thought","thought provoking","provoking documentary","documentary ,",", these","these questions","questions are","are examined","examined with","with objectivity","objectivity and","and insight","insight from","from psychologists","psychologists ,",", modern-day","modern-day exorcists","exorcists and","and leading","leading voices","voices in","in Christianity"]}

{"title":"0s & 1s","plot":"Los Angeles, 2006. Life is Easy 2.0 for James Pongo (Morgan Krantz). He has a cushy job, a busy social life and an alluring love interest all through the click of a mouse. But when he wakes up after a night of reckless partying to discover that his computer is missing, James' hyper-connected reality takes a nosedive. This sends him on a picaresque journey of interrogations and humiliations with the suburban losers he left behind. Told entirely through the websites, programs, games and social networks that make up our daily lives, 0s & 1s uses James Pongo's nihilistic adventure to question our growing dependency on these alternate digital realities.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Los","Angele",",","2006",".","Life","is","Easi","2.0","for","Jame","Pongo","(","Morgan","Krantz",")",".","He","has","a","cushi","job",",","a","busi","social","life","and","an","allur","love","interest","all","through","the","click","of","a","mous",".","But","when","he","wake","up","after","a","night","of","reckless","parti","to","discov","that","his","comput","is","miss",",","Jame","'","hyper-connect","realiti","take","a","nosed",".","This","send","him","on","a","picaresqu","journey","of","interrog","and","humili","with","the","suburban","loser","he","left","behind",".","Told","entir","through","the","websit",",","program",",","game","and","social","network","that","make","up","our","daili","live",",","0s","&","1s","use","Jame","Pongo","'s","nihilist","adventur","to","question","our","grow","depend","on","these","altern","digit","realiti","."],"lemmas":["Los","Angeles",",","2006",".","Life","be","Easy","2.0","for","James","Pongo","-lrb-","Morgan","Krantz","-rrb-",".","he","have","a","cushy","job",",","a","busy","social","life","and","a","alluring","love","interest","all","through","the","click","of","a","mouse",".","but","when","he","wake","up","after","a","night","of","reckless","partying","to","discover","that","he","computer","be","miss",",","James","'","hyper-connected","reality","take","a","nosedive",".","this","send","he","on","a","picaresque","journey","of","interrogation","and","humiliation","with","the","suburban","loser","he","leave","behind",".","tell","entirely","through","the","website",",","program",",","game","and","social","network","that","make","up","we","daily","life",",","0","&","1","use","James","Pongo","'s","nihilistic","adventure","to","question","we","grow","dependency","on","these","alternate","digital","reality","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Los

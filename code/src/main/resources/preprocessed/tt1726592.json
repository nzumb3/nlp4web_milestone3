{"title":"Before I Go to Sleep","plot":"Forty-year-old Christine Lucas wakes up in bed with a man she does not know, in an unfamiliar house. The man explains that he is her husband, Ben, and that she suffered brain damage from a car accident ten years earlier. Christine wakes up every morning with no memory of her life from her early twenties onwards. Christine receives treatment from Dr. Nasch, a neurologist at a local hospital who provides her a camera to record her thoughts and progress each day, and calls her every morning to remind her to watch the video in the camera. Soon, she starts to discover the truth around her.","genres":["Drama"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["Forty-year-old","Christin","Luca","wake","up","in","bed","with","a","man","she","doe","not","know",",","in","an","unfamiliar","hous",".","The","man","explain","that","he","is","her","husband",",","Ben",",","and","that","she","suffer","brain","damag","from","a","car","accid","ten","year","earlier",".","Christin","wake","up","everi","morn","with","no","memori","of","her","life","from","her","earli","twenti","onward",".","Christin","receiv","treatment","from","Dr.","Nasch",",","a","neurologist","at","a","local","hospit","who","provid","her","a","camera","to","record","her","thought","and","progress","each","day",",","and","call","her","everi","morn","to","remind","her","to","watch","the","video","in","the","camera",".","Soon",",","she","start","to","discov","the","truth","around","her","."],"lemmas":["forty-year-old","Christine","Lucas","wake","up","in","bed","with","a","man","she","do","not","know",",","in","a","unfamiliar","house",".","the","man","explain","that","he","be","she","husband",",","Ben",",","and","that","she","suffer","brain","damage","from","a","car","accident","ten","year","earlier",".","Christine","wake","up","every","morning","with","no","memory","of","she","life","from","she","early","twenty","onward",".","Christine","receive","treatment","from","Dr.","Nasch",",","a","neurologist","at","a","local","hospital","who","provide","she","a","camera","to","record","she","thought","and","progress","each","day",",","and","call","she","every","morning","to","remind","she","to","watch","the","video","in","the","camera",".","soon",",","she","start","to","discover","the","truth","around","she","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Forty-year-old Christine Lucas","Christine Lucas wakes","Lucas wakes up","wakes up in","up in bed","in bed with","bed with a","with a man","a man she","man she does","she does not","does not know","not know ,","know , in",", in an","in an unfamiliar","an unfamiliar house","The man explains","man explains that","explains that he","that he is","he is her","is her husband","her husband ,","husband , Ben",", Ben ,","Ben , and",", and that","and that she","that she suffered","she suffered brain","suffered brain damage","brain damage from","damage from a","from a car","a car accident","car accident ten","accident ten years","ten years earlier","Christine wakes up","wakes up every","up every morning","every morning with","morning with no","with no memory","no memory of","memory of her","of her life","her life from","life from her","from her early","her early twenties","early twenties onwards","Christine receives treatment","receives treatment from","treatment from Dr.","from Dr. Nasch","Dr. Nasch ,","Nasch , a",", a neurologist","a neurologist at","neurologist at a","at a local","a local hospital","local hospital who","hospital who provides","who provides her","provides her a","her a camera","a camera to","camera to record","to record her","record her thoughts","her thoughts and","thoughts and progress","and progress each","progress each day","each day ,","day , and",", and calls","and calls her","calls her every","her every morning","every morning to","morning to remind","to remind her","remind her to","her to watch","to watch the","watch the video","the video in","video in the","in the camera","Soon , she",", she starts","she starts to","starts to discover","to discover the","discover the truth","the truth around","truth around her"],"2grams":["Forty-year-old Christine","Christine Lucas","Lucas wakes","wakes up","up in","in bed","bed with","with a","a man","man she","she does","does not","not know","know ,",", in","in an","an unfamiliar","unfamiliar house","The man","man explains","explains that","that he","he is","is her","her husband","husband ,",", Ben","Ben ,",", and","and that","that she","she suffered","suffered brain","brain damage","damage from","from a","a car","car accident","accident ten","ten years","years earlier","Christine wakes","wakes up","up every","every morning","morning with","with no","no memory","memory of","of her","her life","life from","from her","her early","early twenties","twenties onwards","Christine receives","receives treatment","treatment from","from Dr.","Dr. Nasch","Nasch ,",", a","a neurologist","neurologist at","at a","a local","local hospital","hospital who","who provides","provides her","her a","a camera","camera to","to record","record her","her thoughts","thoughts and","and progress","progress each","each day","day ,",", and","and calls","calls her","her every","every morning","morning to","to remind","remind her","her to","to watch","watch the","the video","video in","in the","the camera","Soon ,",", she","she starts","starts to","to discover","discover the","the truth","truth around","around her"]}

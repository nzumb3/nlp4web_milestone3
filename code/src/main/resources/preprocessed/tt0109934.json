{"title":"A Great Day in Harlem","plot":"Art Kane, now deceased, coordinated a group photograph of all the top jazz musicians in NYC in the year 1958, for a piece in Esquire magazine. Just about every jazz musician at the time showed up for the photo shoot which took place in front of a brownstone near the 125th street station. The documentary compiles interviews of many of the musicians in the photograph to talk about the day of the photograph, and it shows film footage taken that day by Milt Hinton and his wife.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["Art","Kane",",","now","deceas",",","coordin","a","group","photograph","of","all","the","top","jazz","musician","in","NYC","in","the","year","1958",",","for","a","piec","in","Esquir","magazin",".","Just","about","everi","jazz","musician","at","the","time","show","up","for","the","photo","shoot","which","took","place","in","front","of","a","brownston","near","the","125th","street","station",".","The","documentari","compil","interview","of","mani","of","the","musician","in","the","photograph","to","talk","about","the","day","of","the","photograph",",","and","it","show","film","footag","taken","that","day","by","Milt","Hinton","and","his","wife","."],"lemmas":["Art","Kane",",","now","decease",",","coordinate","a","group","photograph","of","all","the","top","jazz","musician","in","NYC","in","the","year","1958",",","for","a","piece","in","Esquire","magazine",".","just","about","every","jazz","musician","at","the","time","show","up","for","the","photo","shoot","which","take","place","in","front","of","a","brownstone","near","the","125th","street","station",".","the","documentary","compile","interview","of","many","of","the","musician","in","the","photograph","to","talk","about","the","day","of","the","photograph",",","and","it","show","film","footage","take","that","day","by","Milt","Hinton","and","he","wife","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Art Kane ,","Kane , now",", now deceased","now deceased ,","deceased , coordinated",", coordinated a","coordinated a group","a group photograph","group photograph of","photograph of all","of all the","all the top","the top jazz","top jazz musicians","jazz musicians in","musicians in NYC","in NYC in","NYC in the","in the year","the year 1958","year 1958 ,","1958 , for",", for a","for a piece","a piece in","piece in Esquire","in Esquire magazine","Just about every","about every jazz","every jazz musician","jazz musician at","musician at the","at the time","the time showed","time showed up","showed up for","up for the","for the photo","the photo shoot","photo shoot which","shoot which took","which took place","took place in","place in front","in front of","front of a","of a brownstone","a brownstone near","brownstone near the","near the 125th","the 125th street","125th street station","The documentary compiles","documentary compiles interviews","compiles interviews of","interviews of many","of many of","many of the","of the musicians","the musicians in","musicians in the","in the photograph","the photograph to","photograph to talk","to talk about","talk about the","about the day","the day of","day of the","of the photograph","the photograph ,","photograph , and",", and it","and it shows","it shows film","shows film footage","film footage taken","footage taken that","taken that day","that day by","day by Milt","by Milt Hinton","Milt Hinton and","Hinton and his","and his wife"],"2grams":["Art Kane","Kane ,",", now","now deceased","deceased ,",", coordinated","coordinated a","a group","group photograph","photograph of","of all","all the","the top","top jazz","jazz musicians","musicians in","in NYC","NYC in","in the","the year","year 1958","1958 ,",", for","for a","a piece","piece in","in Esquire","Esquire magazine","Just about","about every","every jazz","jazz musician","musician at","at the","the time","time showed","showed up","up for","for the","the photo","photo shoot","shoot which","which took","took place","place in","in front","front of","of a","a brownstone","brownstone near","near the","the 125th","125th street","street station","The documentary","documentary compiles","compiles interviews","interviews of","of many","many of","of the","the musicians","musicians in","in the","the photograph","photograph to","to talk","talk about","about the","the day","day of","of the","the photograph","photograph ,",", and","and it","it shows","shows film","film footage","footage taken","taken that","that day","day by","by Milt","Milt Hinton","Hinton and","and his","his wife"]}

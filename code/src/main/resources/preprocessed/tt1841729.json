{"title":"Luz Teimosa","plot":"Fernando Lemo's world is fiercely stripped of any external logics, as Jorge de Sena once said. His artistic gesture blends with his own existence, where the poetic principle comes first. And with the light that insists to come through the half-closed door, the fear of life is vanquished in the battle fought with death. Thus, each word is born within another word and each image within another image. Of how many knives is love made of? the poet wonders.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Fernando","Lemo","'s","world","is","fierc","strip","of","ani","extern","logic",",","as","Jorg","de","Sena","onc","said",".","His","artist","gestur","blend","with","his","own","exist",",","where","the","poetic","principl","come","first",".","And","with","the","light","that","insist","to","come","through","the","half-clos","door",",","the","fear","of","life","is","vanquish","in","the","battl","fought","with","death",".","Thus",",","each","word","is","born","within","anoth","word","and","each","imag","within","anoth","imag",".","Of","how","mani","knive","is","love","made","of","?","the","poet","wonder","."],"lemmas":["Fernando","Lemo","'s","world","be","fiercely","strip","of","any","external","logic",",","as","Jorge","de","Sena","once","say",".","he","artistic","gesture","blend","with","he","own","existence",",","where","the","poetic","principle","come","first",".","and","with","the","light","that","insist","to","come","through","the","half-closed","door",",","the","fear","of","life","be","vanquish","in","the","battle","fight","with","death",".","thus",",","each","word","be","bear","within","another","word","and","each","image","within","another","image",".","of","how","many","knife","be","love","make","of","?","the","poet","wonder","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Fernando Lemo 's","Lemo 's world","'s world is","world is fiercely","is fiercely stripped","fiercely stripped of","stripped of any","of any external","any external logics","external logics ,","logics , as",", as Jorge","as Jorge de","Jorge de Sena","de Sena once","Sena once said","His artistic gesture","artistic gesture blends","gesture blends with","blends with his","with his own","his own existence","own existence ,","existence , where",", where the","where the poetic","the poetic principle","poetic principle comes","principle comes first","And with the","with the light","the light that","light that insists","that insists to","insists to come","to come through","come through the","through the half-closed","the half-closed door","half-closed door ,","door , the",", the fear","the fear of","fear of life","of life is","life is vanquished","is vanquished in","vanquished in the","in the battle","the battle fought","battle fought with","fought with death","Thus , each",", each word","each word is","word is born","is born within","born within another","within another word","another word and","word and each","and each image","each image within","image within another","within another image","Of how many","how many knives","many knives is","knives is love","is love made","love made of","the poet wonders"],"2grams":["Fernando Lemo","Lemo 's","'s world","world is","is fiercely","fiercely stripped","stripped of","of any","any external","external logics","logics ,",", as","as Jorge","Jorge de","de Sena","Sena once","once said","His artistic","artistic gesture","gesture blends","blends with","with his","his own","own existence","existence ,",", where","where the","the poetic","poetic principle","principle comes","comes first","And with","with the","the light","light that","that insists","insists to","to come","come through","through the","the half-closed","half-closed door","door ,",", the","the fear","fear of","of life","life is","is vanquished","vanquished in","in the","the battle","battle fought","fought with","with death","Thus ,",", each","each word","word is","is born","born within","within another","another word","word and","and each","each image","image within","within another","another image","Of how","how many","many knives","knives is","is love","love made","made of","the poet","poet wonders"]}

{"title":"Animal Black Ops: Kenya","plot":"The US Fish and Wildlife Services has a special unit; The Office of Law Enforcement. It boasts 261 special agents. It even has its own Forensic Laboratory which supports international investigations of wildlife crimes. The unit exists because, over the last five years, it has become apparent to the West that many of the world's terrorist attacks are funded by the cash generated from animal poaching. This series is the story of some of their investigations as the Office of Law Enforcement battles the richest and most determined wildlife criminals in the world. What's more - President Barack Obama has now extended this fight to territories outside the USA. In a Presidential Order last year he committed the USA to financing and arming teams across the world to hit back against the animal poachers. This series is the story of that battle.","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["The","US","Fish","and","Wildlif","Servic","has","a","special","unit",";","The","Office","of","Law","Enforcement",".","It","boast","261","special","agent",".","It","even","has","it","own","Forens","Laboratori","which","support","intern","investig","of","wildlif","crime",".","The","unit","exist","becaus",",","over","the","last","five","year",",","it","has","becom","appar","to","the","West","that","mani","of","the","world","'s","terrorist","attack","are","fund","by","the","cash","generat","from","anim","poach",".","This","seri","is","the","stori","of","some","of","their","investig","as","the","Office","of","Law","Enforcement","battl","the","richest","and","most","determin","wildlif","crimin","in","the","world",".","What","'s","more","-","Presid","Barack","Obama","has","now","extend","this","fight","to","territori","outsid","the","USA",".","In","a","Presidenti","Order","last","year","he","commit","the","USA","to","financ","and","arm","team","across","the","world","to","hit","back","against","the","anim","poacher",".","This","seri","is","the","stori","of","that","battl","."],"lemmas":["the","US","fish","and","Wildlife","Services","have","a","special","unit",";","the","Office","of","Law","Enforcement",".","it","boast","261","special","agent",".","it","even","have","its","own","Forensic","Laboratory","which","support","international","investigation","of","wildlife","crime",".","the","unit","exist","because",",","over","the","last","five","year",",","it","have","become","apparent","to","the","West","that","many","of","the","world","'s","terrorist","attack","be","fund","by","the","cash","generate","from","animal","poach",".","this","series","be","the","story","of","some","of","they","investigation","as","the","Office","of","Law","Enforcement","battle","the","richest","and","most","determined","wildlife","criminal","in","the","world",".","what","be","more","-","President","Barack","Obama","have","now","extend","this","fight","to","territory","outside","the","USA",".","in","a","Presidential","Order","last","year","he","commit","the","usa","to","financing","and","arm","team","across","the","world","to","hit","back","against","the","animal","poacher",".","this","series","be","the","story","of","that","battle","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The US Fish","US Fish and","Fish and Wildlife","and Wildlife Services","Wildlife Services has","Services has a","has a special","a special unit","special unit ;","unit ;

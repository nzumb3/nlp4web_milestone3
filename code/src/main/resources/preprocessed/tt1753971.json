{"title":"Jan Mesdag zingt Brel","plot":"In the mid-eighties, Dutch singer Jan Mesdag starred in musicals and variety acts in both Amsterdam and New York. He performed with notable artists and received critical acclaim for his voice. His star was rising, but his career came to a sudden end. Jan found out he was HIV-positive. Facing death, Jan decided to make a longtime dream come true. Recording an album with songs of Jacques Brel had always been on his mind. The album \"Jan Mesdag sings Brel\" was released just two months before his death in 1988.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["In","the","mid-eighti",",","Dutch","singer","Jan","Mesdag","star","in","music","and","varieti","act","in","both","Amsterdam","and","New","York",".","He","perform","with","notabl","artist","and","receiv","critic","acclaim","for","his","voic",".","His","star","was","rise",",","but","his","career","came","to","a","sudden","end",".","Jan","found","out","he","was","HIV-posit",".","Face","death",",","Jan","decid","to","make","a","longtim","dream","come","true",".","Record","an","album","with","song","of","Jacqu","Brel","had","alway","been","on","his","mind",".","The","album","\"","Jan","Mesdag","sing","Brel","\"","was","releas","just","two","month","befor","his","death","in","1988","."],"lemmas":["in","the","mid-eighty",",","dutch","singer","Jan","Mesdag","star","in","musical","and","variety","act","in","both","Amsterdam","and","New","York",".","he","perform","with","notable","artist","and","receive","critical","acclaim","for","he","voice",".","he","star","be","rise",",","but","he","career","come","to","a","sudden","end",".","Jan","find","out","he","be","hiv-positive",".","face","death",",","Jan","decide","to","make","a","longtime","dream","come","true",".","Recording","a","album","with","song","of","Jacques","Brel","have","always","be","on","he","mind",".","the","album","``","Jan","Mesdag","sing","Brel","''","be","release","just","two","month","before","he","death","in","1988","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the mid-eighties","the mid-eighties ,","mid-eighties , Dutch",", Dutch singer","Dutch singer Jan","singer Jan Mesdag","Jan Mesdag starred","Mesdag starred in","starred in musicals","in musicals and","musicals and variety","and variety acts","variety acts in","acts in both","in both Amsterdam","both Amsterdam and","Amsterdam and New","and New York","He performed with","performed with notable","with notable artists","notable artists and","artists and received","and received critical","received critical acclaim","critical acclaim for","acclaim for his","for his voice","His star was","star was rising","was rising ,","rising , but",", but his","but his career","his career came","career came to","came to a","to a sudden","a sudden end","Jan found out","found out he","out he was","he was HIV-positive","Facing death ,","death , Jan",", Jan decided","Jan decided to","decided to make","to make a","make a longtime","a longtime dream","longtime dream come","dream come true","Recording an album","an album with","album with songs","with songs of","songs of Jacques","of Jacques Brel","Jacques Brel had","Brel had always","had always been","always been on","been on his","on his mind","The album \"","album \" Jan","\" Jan Mesdag","Jan Mesdag sings","Mesdag sings Brel","sings Brel \"","Brel \" was","\" was released","was released just","released just two","just two months","two months before","months before his","before his death","his death in","death in 1988"],"2grams":["In the","the mid-eighties","mid-eighties ,",", Dutch","Dutch singer","singer Jan","Jan Mesdag","Mesdag starred","starred in","in musicals","musicals and","and variety","variety acts","acts in","in both","both Amsterdam","Amsterdam and","and New","New York","He performed","performed with","with notable","notable artists","artists and","and received","received critical","critical acclaim","acclaim for","for his","his voice","His star","star was","was rising","rising ,",", but","but his","his career","career came","came to","to a","a sudden","sudden end","Jan found","found out","out he","he was","was HIV-positive","Facing death","death ,",", Jan","Jan decided","decided to","to make","make a","a longtime","longtime dream","dream come","come true","Recording an","an album","album with","with songs","songs of","of Jacques","Jacques Brel","Brel had","had always","always been","been on","on his","his mind","The album","album \"","\" Jan","Jan Mesdag","Mesdag sings","sings Brel","Brel \"","\" was","was released","released just","just two","two months","months before","before his","his death","death in","in 1988"]}

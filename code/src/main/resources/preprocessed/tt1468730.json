{"title":"The Screen at Kamchanod","plot":"In 1987, four movie screeners stumbled upon a chilling event as they were hired to screen a movie in the forest of Kamchanod, Udon Thani Province. The screeners were wondering why they had no audience at all. Yet, as the movie was about to end, a group of people emerged from the forest and lined up in front of the screen. To the screener's surprise, the audience also began to disappear as mysteriously as they had appeared out of nowhere.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["In","1987",",","four","movi","screener","stumbl","upon","a","chill","event","as","they","were","hire","to","screen","a","movi","in","the","forest","of","Kamchanod",",","Udon","Thani","Provinc",".","The","screener","were","wonder","whi","they","had","no","audienc","at","all",".","Yet",",","as","the","movi","was","about","to","end",",","a","group","of","peopl","emerg","from","the","forest","and","line","up","in","front","of","the","screen",".","To","the","screener","'s","surpris",",","the","audienc","also","began","to","disappear","as","mysteri","as","they","had","appear","out","of","nowher","."],"lemmas":["in","1987",",","four","movie","screener","stumble","upon","a","chilling","event","as","they","be","hire","to","screen","a","movie","in","the","forest","of","Kamchanod",",","Udon","Thani","Province",".","the","screener","be","wonder","why","they","have","no","audience","at","all",".","yet",",","as","the","movie","be","about","to","end",",","a","group","of","people","emerge","from","the","forest","and","line","up","in","front","of","the","screen",".","to","the","screener","'s","surprise",",","the","audience","also","begin","to","disappear","as","mysteriously","as","they","have","appear","out","of","nowhere","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 1987 ,","1987 , four",", four movie","four movie screeners","movie screeners stumbled","screeners stumbled upon","stumbled upon a","upon a chilling","a chilling event","chilling event as","event as they","as they were","they were hired","were hired to","hired to screen","to screen a","screen a movie","a movie in","movie in the","in the forest","the forest of","forest of Kamchanod","of Kamchanod ,","Kamchanod , Udon",", Udon Thani","Udon Thani Province","The screeners were","screeners were wondering","were wondering why","wondering why they","why they had","they had no","had no audience","no audience at","audience at all","Yet , as",", as the","as the movie","the movie was","movie was about","was about to","about to end","to end ,","end , a",", a group","a group of","group of people","of people emerged","people emerged from","emerged from the","from the forest","the forest and","forest and lined","and lined up","lined up in","up in front","in front of","front of the","of the screen","To the screener","the screener 's","screener 's surprise","'s surprise ,","surprise , the",", the audience","the audience also","audience also began","also began to","began to disappear","to disappear as","disappear as mysteriously","as mysteriously as","mysteriously as they","as they had","they had appeared","had appeared out","appeared out of","out of nowhere"],"2grams":["In 1987","1987 ,",", four","four movie","movie screeners","screeners stumbled","stumbled upon","upon a","a chilling","chilling event","event as","as they","they were","were hired","hired to","to screen","screen a","a movie","movie in","in the","the forest","forest of","of Kamchanod","Kamchanod ,",", Udon","Udon Thani","Thani Province","The screeners","screeners were","were wondering","wondering why","why they","they had","had no","no audience","audience at","at all","Yet ,",", as","as the","the movie","movie was","was about","about to","to end","end ,",", a","a group","group of","of people","people emerged","emerged from","from the","the forest","forest and","and lined","lined up","up in","in front","front of","of the","the screen","To the","the screener","screener 's","'s surprise","surprise ,",", the","the audience","audience also","also began","began to","to disappear","disappear as","as mysteriously","mysteriously as","as they","they had","had appeared","appeared out","out of","of nowhere"]}

{"title":"The Middle of Nowhere","plot":"After escaping from youth-prison during a fire-alarm, young MAREK hitch-hikes into an unknown future. Suddenly there's a new chance: He 'gets' a car, a passport, a ticket to Australia and switches into a new identity. After the car breaks down, he is stuck at a filling station close to a very small village in former East Germany where he meets Margot. There are many problems to solve if he wants to continue his trip - maybe with his new love.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Crime"],"stems":["After","escap","from","youth-prison","dure","a","fire-alarm",",","young","MAREK","hitch-hik","into","an","unknown","futur",".","Sudden","there","'s","a","new","chanc",":","He","'","get","'","a","car",",","a","passport",",","a","ticket","to","Australia","and","switch","into","a","new","ident",".","After","the","car","break","down",",","he","is","stuck","at","a","fill","station","close","to","a","veri","small","villag","in","former","East","Germani","where","he","meet","Margot",".","There","are","mani","problem","to","solv","if","he","want","to","continu","his","trip","-","mayb","with","his","new","love","."],"lemmas":["after","escape","from","youth-prison","during","a","fire-alarm",",","young","MAREK","hitch-hike","into","a","unknown","future",".","suddenly","there","be","a","new","chance",":","he","'","get","'","a","car",",","a","passport",",","a","ticket","to","Australia","and","switch","into","a","new","identity",".","after","the","car","break","down",",","he","be","stick","at","a","filling","station","close","to","a","very","small","village","in","former","East","Germany","where","he","meet","Margot",".","there","be","many","problem","to","solve","if","he","want","to","continue","he","trip","-","maybe","with","he","new","love","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["After escaping from","escaping from youth-prison","from youth-prison during","youth-prison during a","during a fire-alarm","a fire-alarm ,","fire-alarm , young",", young MAREK","young MAREK hitch-hikes","MAREK hitch-hikes into","hitch-hikes into an","into an unknown","an unknown future","Suddenly there 's","there 's a","'s a new","a new chance","new chance :","chance : He",": He '","He ' gets","' gets '","gets ' a","' a car","a car ,","car , a",", a passport","a passport ,","passport , a",", a ticket","a ticket to","ticket to Australia","to Australia and","Australia and switches","and switches into","switches into a","into a new","a new identity","After the car","the car breaks","car breaks down","breaks down ,","down , he",", he is","he is stuck","is stuck at","stuck at a","at a filling","a filling station","filling station close","station close to","close to a","to a very","a very small","very small village","small village in","village in former","in former East","former East Germany","East Germany where","Germany where he","where he meets","he meets Margot","There are many","are many problems","many problems to","problems to solve","to solve if","solve if he","if he wants","he wants to","wants to continue","to continue his","continue his trip","his trip -","trip - maybe","- maybe with","maybe with his","with his new","his new love"],"2grams":["After escaping","escaping from","from youth-prison","youth-prison during","during a","a fire-alarm","fire-alarm ,",", young","young MAREK","MAREK hitch-hikes","hitch-hikes into","into an","an unknown","unknown future","Suddenly there","there 's","'s a","a new","new chance","chance :",": He","He '","' gets","gets '","' a","a car","car ,",", a","a passport","passport ,",", a","a ticket","ticket to","to Australia","Australia and","and switches","switches into","into a","a new","new identity","After the","the car","car breaks","breaks down","down ,",", he","he is","is stuck","stuck at","at a","a filling","filling station","station close","close to","to a","a very","very small","small village","village in","in former","former East","East Germany","Germany where","where he","he meets","meets Margot","There are","are many","many problems","problems to","to solve","solve if","if he","he wants","wants to","to continue","continue his","his trip","trip -","- maybe","maybe with","with his","his new","new love"]}

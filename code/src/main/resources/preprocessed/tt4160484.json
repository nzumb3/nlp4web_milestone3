{"title":"Sugar Blues","plot":"Sugar can kill! The director, Andrea, is diagnosed with gestational diabetes. She must avoid any form of refined sugar. That soon proves impossible though, because she finds sugar everywhere and in everything. Why is sugar so ubiquitous? Fear for her unborn baby changes the eating habits in Andrea's family and motivates her investigation of the sugar industry. Confronting doctors and scientists, Andrea explores the influence of sugar on human physical and mental functions. With the obsession of a detective, she identifies the ties between multinational corporations, politicians and health care. The quest begins at Andrea's kitchen table and continues worldwide over nearly five years. But her family needs a mum at home, especially her youngest son. Could sugar really be the cause of his health problems? A tragicomic, vibrant and emotional story that is informative and inspiring...

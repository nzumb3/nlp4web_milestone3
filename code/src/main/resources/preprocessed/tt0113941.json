{"title":"La nave de los locos","plot":"In a small town in Patagonia (Southern Argentina), a Mapuche Indian chief sets a tourist complex under construction on fire. He denies all attempts to defend himself. Locked up, he waits for the arrival of \"Caleuche,\" the Ship (Nave) of Fools (de los locos), a mythical figure of his ancestral strength which \"made\" him start the fire. An appointed lawyer (a white woman) comes to the chief's defence, alleging the chief had acted in self-defense as the white man was building commercial structures on the sacred burial grounds of his ancestors, and continued doing so even after heated protests.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","a","small","town","in","Patagonia","(","Southern","Argentina",")",",","a","Mapuch","Indian","chief","set","a","tourist","complex","under","construct","on","fire",".","He","deni","all","attempt","to","defend","himself",".","Lock","up",",","he","wait","for","the","arriv","of","\"","Caleuch",",","\"","the","Ship","(","Nave",")","of","Fool","(","de","los","loco",")",",","a","mythic","figur","of","his","ancestr","strength","which","\"","made","\"","him","start","the","fire",".","An","appoint","lawyer","(","a","white","woman",")","come","to","the","chief","'s","defenc",",","alleg","the","chief","had","act","in","self-defens","as","the","white","man","was","build","commerci","structur","on","the","sacr","burial","ground","of","his","ancestor",",","and","continu","do","so","even","after","heat","protest","."],"lemmas":["in","a","small","town","in","Patagonia","-lrb-","Southern","Argentina","-rrb-",",","a","Mapuche","Indian","chief","set","a","tourist","complex","under","construction","on","fire",".","he","deny","all","attempt","to","defend","himself",".","lock","up",",","he","wait","for","the","arrival","of","``","Caleuche",",","''","the","Ship","-lrb-","Nave","-rrb-","of","fool","-lrb-","de","los","locos","-rrb-",",","a","mythical","figure","of","he","ancestral","strength","which","``","make","''","he","start","the","fire",".","a","appointed","lawyer","-lrb-","a","white","woman","-rrb-","come","to","the","chief","'s","defence",",","allege","the","chief","have","act","in","self-defense","as","the","white","man","be","build","commercial","structure","on","the","sacred","burial","grounds","of","he","ancestor",",","and","continue","do","so","even","after","heated","protest","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

{"title":"Held Up","plot":"While they're on vacation in the Southwest, Rae finds out her man Michael spent their house money on a classic car, so she dumps him, hitching a ride to Vegas for a flight home. A kid promptly steals Michael's car, leaving him at the Zip & Sip, a convenience store. Three bumbling robbers promptly stage a hold up. Two take off with the cash stranding the third, with a mysterious crate, just as the cops arrive. The robber takes the store hostage. As incompetent cops bring in a SWAT team and try a by-the-book rescue, Michael has to keep the robber calm, find out what's in the crate, aid the negotiations, and get back to Rae. The Stockholm Syndrome asserts its effect.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["While","they","re","on","vacat","in","the","Southwest",",","Rae","find","out","her","man","Michael","spent","their","hous","money","on","a","classic","car",",","so","she","dump","him",",","hitch","a","ride","to","Vega","for","a","flight","home",".","A","kid","prompt","steal","Michael","'s","car",",","leav","him","at","the","Zip","&","Sip",",","a","conveni","store",".","Three","bumbl","robber","prompt","stage","a","hold","up",".","Two","take","off","with","the","cash","strand","the","third",",","with","a","mysteri","crate",",","just","as","the","cop","arriv",".","The","robber","take","the","store","hostag",".","As","incompet","cop","bring","in","a","SWAT","team","and","tri","a","by-the-book","rescu",",","Michael","has","to","keep","the","robber","calm",",","find","out","what","'s","in","the","crate",",","aid","the","negoti",",","and","get","back","to","Rae",".","The","Stockholm","Syndrom","assert","it","effect","."],"lemmas":["while","they","be","on","vacation","in","the","Southwest",",","Rae","find","out","she","man","Michael","spend","they","house","money","on","a","classic","car",",","so","she","dump","he",",","hitch","a","ride","to","Vegas","for","a","flight","home",".","a","kid","promptly","steal","Michael","'s","car",",","leave","he","at","the","Zip","&","Sip",",","a","convenience","store",".","three","bumble","robber","promptly","stage","a","hold","up",".","two","take","off","with","the","cash","strand","the","third",",","with","a","mysterious","crate",",","just","as","the","cop","arrive",".","the","robber","take","the","store","hostage",".","as","incompetent","cop","bring","in","a","SWAT","team","and","try","a","by-the-book","rescue",",","Michael","have","to","keep","the","robber","calm",",","find","out","what","be","in","the","crate",",","aid","the","negotiation",",","and","get","back","to","Rae",".","the","Stockholm","syndrome","assert","its","effect","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["While

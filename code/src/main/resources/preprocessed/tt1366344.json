{"title":"The Sitter","plot":"Noah is not your typical entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is kind of sitter. He's reluctant to take a sitting gig; he'd rather, well, be doing anything else, especially if it involves slacking. When Noah is watching the neighbor's kid he gets a booty call from his girlfriend in the city. To hook up with her, Noah takes to the streets, but his urban adventure spins out of control as he finds himself on the run from a maniacal drug lord.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Noah","is","not","your","typic","entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-i","kind","of","sitter",".","He","'s","reluct","to","take","a","sit","gig",";","he","'d","rather",",","well",",","be","do","anyth","els",",","especi","if","it","involv","slack",".","When","Noah","is","watch","the","neighbor","'s","kid","he","get","a","booti","call","from","his","girlfriend","in","the","citi",".","To","hook","up","with","her",",","Noah","take","to","the","street",",","but","his","urban","adventur","spin","out","of","control","as","he","find","himself","on","the","run","from","a","maniac","drug","lord","."],"lemmas":["Noah","be","not","you","typical","entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is","kind","of","sitter",".","he","be","reluctant","to","take","a","sit","gig",";","he","would","rather",",","well",",","be","do","anything","else",",","especially","if","it","involve","slack",".","when","Noah","be","watch","the","neighbor","'s","kid","he","get","a","booty","call","from","he","girlfriend","in","the","city",".","to","hook","up","with","she",",","Noah","take","to","the","street",",","but","he","urban","adventure","spin","out","of","control","as","he","find","himself","on","the","run","from","a","maniacal","drug","lord","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Noah is not","is not your","not your typical","your typical entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is","typical entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is kind","entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is kind of","kind of sitter","He 's reluctant","'s reluctant to","reluctant to take","to take a","take a sitting","a sitting gig","sitting gig ;","gig ; he","; he 'd","he 'd rather","'d rather ,","rather , well",", well ,","well , be",", be doing","be doing anything","doing anything else","anything else ,","else , especially",", especially if","especially if it","if it involves","it involves slacking","When Noah is","Noah is watching","is watching the","watching the neighbor","the neighbor 's","neighbor 's kid","'s kid he","kid he gets","he gets a","gets a booty","a booty call","booty call from","call from his","from his girlfriend","his girlfriend in","girlfriend in the","in the city","To hook up","hook up with","up with her","with her ,","her , Noah",", Noah takes","Noah takes to","takes to the","to the streets","the streets ,","streets , but",", but his","but his urban","his urban adventure","urban adventure spins","adventure spins out","spins out of","out of control","of control as","control as he","as he finds","he finds himself","finds himself on","himself on the","on the run","the run from","run from a","from a maniacal","a maniacal drug","maniacal drug lord"],"2grams":["Noah is","is not","not your","your typical","typical entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is","entertain-the-kids-no-matter-how-boring-it-is kind","kind of","of sitter","He 's","'s reluctant","reluctant to","to take","take a","a sitting","sitting gig","gig ;","; he","he 'd","'d rather","rather ,",", well","well ,",", be","be doing","doing anything","anything else","else ,",", especially","especially if","if it","it involves","involves slacking","When Noah","Noah is","is watching","watching the","the neighbor","neighbor 's","'s kid","kid he","he gets","gets a","a booty","booty call","call from","from his","his girlfriend","girlfriend in","in the","the city","To hook","hook up","up with","with her","her ,",", Noah","Noah takes","takes to","to the","the streets","streets ,",", but","but his","his urban","urban adventure","adventure spins","spins out","out of","of control","control as","as he","he finds","finds himself","himself on","on the","the run","run from","from a","a maniacal","maniacal drug","drug lord"]}

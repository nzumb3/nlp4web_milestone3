{"title":"Occasional Monsters","plot":"'Occasional Monsters' is a comedy documentary that follows two friends, Duane and Wolfgang, as they attempt to establish their own monster-hunting business. Despite their enthusiasm, the pair know next to nothing about running a business and have a severe lack of funds. Their attempts at obtaining advice and financial support fall flat and bring them into conflict with local businessman Ronnie Caird. On top of that, their misguided monster-hunting activities start to draw some negative attention their way... Aided by their disturbed and unreliable van driver, Ben, and hindered by Duane's unbalanced female entourage, the pair are forced to confront their fears and learn that their chosen career path might not be all fun and games after all.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["'","Occasion","Monster","'","is","a","comedi","documentari","that","follow","two","friend",",","Duan","and","Wolfgang",",","as","they","attempt","to","establish","their","own","monster-hunt","busi",".","Despit","their","enthusiasm",",","the","pair","know","next","to","noth","about","run","a","busi","and","have","a","sever","lack","of","fund",".","Their","attempt","at","obtain","advic","and","financi","support","fall","flat","and","bring","them","into","conflict","with","local","businessman","Ronni","Caird",".","On","top","of","that",",","their","misguid","monster-hunt","activ","start","to","draw","some","negat","attent","their","way","...","Aide","by","their","disturb","and","unreli","van","driver",",","Ben",",","and","hinder","by","Duan","'s","unbalanc","femal","entourag",",","the","pair","are","forc","to","confront","their","fear","and","learn","that","their","chosen","career","path","might","not","be","all","fun","and","game","after","all","."],"lemmas":["'","occasional","monster","'","be","a","comedy","documentary","that","follow","two","friend",",","Duane","and","Wolfgang",",","as","they","attempt","to","establish","they","own","monster-hunting","business",".","despite","they","enthusiasm",",","the","pair","know","next","to","nothing","about","run","a","business","and","have","a","severe","lack","of","fund",".","they","attempt","at","obtain","advice","and","financial","support","fall","flat","and","bring","they","into","conflict","with","local","businessman","Ronnie","Caird",".","on","top","of","that",",","they","misguided","monster-hunting","activity","start","to","draw","some","negative","attention","they","way","...","aid","by","they","disturbed","and","unreliable","van","driver",",","Ben",",","and","hinder","by","Duane","'s","unbalanced","female","entourage",",","the","pair","be","force","to","confront","they","fear","and","learn","that","they","chosen","career","path","might","not","be","all","fun","and","game","after","all","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["' Occasional Monsters","Occasional Monsters '","Monsters ' is","' is a","is a comedy","a comedy documentary","comedy documentary that","documentary that follows","that follows two","follows two friends","two friends ,","friends , Duane",", Duane and","Duane and Wolfgang","and Wolfgang ,","Wolfgang , as",", as they","as they attempt","they attempt to","attempt to establish","to establish their","establish their own","their own monster-hunting","own monster-hunting business","Despite their enthusiasm","their enthusiasm ,","enthusiasm , the",", the pair","the pair know","pair know next","know next to","next to nothing","to nothing about","nothing about running","about running a","running a business","a business and","business and have","and have a","have a severe","a severe lack","severe lack of","lack of funds","Their attempts at","attempts at obtaining","at obtaining advice","obtaining advice and","advice and financial","and financial support","financial support fall","support fall flat","fall flat and","flat and bring","and bring them","bring them into","them into conflict","into conflict with","conflict with local","with local businessman","local businessman Ronnie","businessman Ronnie Caird","On top of","top of that","of that ,","that , their",", their misguided","their misguided monster-hunting","misguided monster-hunting activities","monster-hunting activities start","activities start to","start to draw","to draw some","draw some negative","some negative attention","negative attention their","attention their way","their way ...","way ...

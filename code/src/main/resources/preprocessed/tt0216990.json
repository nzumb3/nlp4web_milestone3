{"title":"Leaving No Trace","plot":"Aurelia, a Norteña who's a high-school dropout with two sons, ditches her life as a sweatshop seamstress by stealing her boyfriend's dope, selling it, and heading for Cancún in her station wagon. At a truck stop, she's approached by Marilú, who deals in Mayan art forgeries, speaks with a Castilian accent, and wears Gucci. Marilú's also on the lamb, trying to avoid prison and escape a corrupt federal investigator. On the road, it's soon apparent they're being followed, but by whom? At least six people are in pursuit of the women. Can the women trust each other enough to work as a team; is there honor among thieves?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Aurelia",",","a","Norteña","who","'s","a","high-school","dropout","with","two","son",",","ditch","her","life","as","a","sweatshop","seamstress","by","steal","her","boyfriend","'s","dope",",","sell","it",",","and","head","for","Cancún","in","her","station","wagon",".","At","a","truck","stop",",","she","'s","approach","by","Marilú",",","who","deal","in","Mayan","art","forgeri",",","speak","with","a","Castilian","accent",",","and","wear","Gucci",".","Marilú","'s","also","on","the","lamb",",","tri","to","avoid","prison","and","escap","a","corrupt","feder","investig",".","On","the","road",",","it","'s","soon","appar","they","re","be","follow",",","but","by","whom","?","At","least","six","peopl","are","in","pursuit","of","the","women",".","Can","the","women","trust","each","other","enough","to","work","as","a","team",";","is","there","honor","among","thiev","?"],"lemmas":["Aurelia",",","a","Norteña","who","be","a","high-school","dropout","with","two","son",",","ditch","she","life","as","a","sweatshop","seamstress","by","steal","she","boyfriend","'s","dope",",","sell","it",",","and","head","for","Cancún","in","she","station","wagon",".","at","a","truck","stop",",","she","be","approach","by","Marilú",",","who","deal","in","mayan","art","forgery",",","speak","with","a","castilian","accent",",","and","wear","Gucci",".","Marilú","'s","also","on","the","lamb",",","try","to","avoid","prison","and","escape","a","corrupt","federal","investigator",".","on","the","road",",","it","be","soon","apparent","they","be","be","follow",",","but","by","whom","?","at","least","six","people","be","in","pursuit","of","the","woman",".","can","the","woman","trust","each","other","enough","to","work","as","a","team",";","be","there","honor","among","thief","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Aurelia , a",", a Norteña","a Norteña who","Norteña who 's","who 's a","'s a high-school","a high-school dropout","high-school dropout with","dropout with two","with two sons","two sons ,","sons , ditches",", ditches her","ditches her life","her life as","life as a","as a sweatshop","a sweatshop seamstress","sweatshop seamstress by","seamstress by stealing","by stealing her","stealing her boyfriend","her boyfriend 's","boyfriend 's dope","'s dope ,","dope , selling",", selling it","selling it ,","it , and",", and heading","and heading for","heading for Cancún","for Cancún in","Cancún in her","in her station","her station wagon","At a truck","a truck stop","truck stop ,","stop , she",", she 's","she 's approached","'s approached by","approached by Marilú","by Marilú ,","Marilú , who",", who deals","who deals in","deals in Mayan","in Mayan art","Mayan art forgeries","art forgeries ,","forgeries , speaks",", speaks with","speaks with a","with a Castilian","a Castilian accent","Castilian accent ,","accent , and",", and wears","and wears Gucci","Marilú 's also","'s also on","also on the","on the lamb","the lamb ,","lamb , trying",", trying to","trying to avoid","to avoid prison","avoid prison and","prison and escape","and escape a","escape a corrupt","a corrupt federal","corrupt federal investigator","On the road","the road ,","road , it",", it 's","it 's soon","'s soon apparent","soon apparent they","apparent they 're","they 're being","'re being followed","being followed ,","followed , but",", but by","but by whom","At least six","least six people","six people are","people are in","are in pursuit","in pursuit of","pursuit of the","of the women","Can the women","the women trust","women trust each","trust each other","each other enough","other enough to","enough to work","to work as","work as a","as a team","a team ;","team ;

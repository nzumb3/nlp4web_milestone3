{"title":"Toque de Queda","plot":"In Guatemala, violence is contagious. The neighbors of Villas de La Esperanza, in fear of an eventual invasion of those infected by violence, arm themselves and patrol nights, risking their lives for the safety of their families. But battling violence with violence only spreads the contagion, and the neighbors will soon realize that the greatest danger is not what lurks outside their secure gated community. The real danger lies within. In Guatemala, violence is contagious, and we are all infected.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["In","Guatemala",",","violenc","is","contagi",".","The","neighbor","of","Villa","de","La","Esperanza",",","in","fear","of","an","eventu","invas","of","those","infect","by","violenc",",","arm","themselv","and","patrol","night",",","risk","their","live","for","the","safeti","of","their","famili",".","But","battl","violenc","with","violenc","onli","spread","the","contagion",",","and","the","neighbor","will","soon","realiz","that","the","greatest","danger","is","not","what","lurk","outsid","their","secur","gate","communiti",".","The","real","danger","lie","within",".","In","Guatemala",",","violenc","is","contagi",",","and","we","are","all","infect","."],"lemmas":["in","Guatemala",",","violence","be","contagious",".","the","neighbor","of","Villas","de","La","Esperanza",",","in","fear","of","a","eventual","invasion","of","those","infect","by","violence",",","arm","themselves","and","patrol","night",",","risk","they","life","for","the","safety","of","they","family",".","but","battle","violence","with","violence","only","spread","the","contagion",",","and","the","neighbor","will","soon","realize","that","the","greatest","danger","be","not","what","lurk","outside","they","secure","gated","community",".","the","real","danger","lie","within",".","in","Guatemala",",","violence","be","contagious",",","and","we","be","all","infected","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In Guatemala ,","Guatemala , violence",", violence is","violence is contagious","The neighbors of","neighbors of Villas","of Villas de","Villas de La","de La Esperanza","La Esperanza ,","Esperanza , in",", in fear","in fear of","fear of an","of an eventual","an eventual invasion","eventual invasion of","invasion of those","of those infected","those infected by","infected by violence","by violence ,","violence , arm",", arm themselves","arm themselves and","themselves and patrol","and patrol nights","patrol nights ,","nights , risking",", risking their","risking their lives","their lives for","lives for the","for the safety","the safety of","safety of their","of their families","But battling violence","battling violence with","violence with violence","with violence only","violence only spreads","only spreads the","spreads the contagion","the contagion ,","contagion , and",", and the","and the neighbors","the neighbors will","neighbors will soon","will soon realize","soon realize that","realize that the","that the greatest","the greatest danger","greatest danger is","danger is not","is not what","not what lurks","what lurks outside","lurks outside their","outside their secure","their secure gated","secure gated community","The real danger","real danger lies","danger lies within","In Guatemala ,","Guatemala , violence",", violence is","violence is contagious","is contagious ,","contagious , and",", and we","and we are","we are all","are all infected"],"2grams":["In Guatemala","Guatemala ,",", violence","violence is","is contagious","The neighbors","neighbors of","of Villas","Villas de","de La","La Esperanza","Esperanza ,",", in","in fear","fear of","of an","an eventual","eventual invasion","invasion of","of those","those infected","infected by","by violence","violence ,",", arm","arm themselves","themselves and","and patrol","patrol nights","nights ,",", risking","risking their","their lives","lives for","for the","the safety","safety of","of their","their families","But battling","battling violence","violence with","with violence","violence only","only spreads","spreads the","the contagion","contagion ,",", and","and the","the neighbors","neighbors will","will soon","soon realize","realize that","that the","the greatest","greatest danger","danger is","is not","not what","what lurks","lurks outside","outside their","their secure","secure gated","gated community","The real","real danger","danger lies","lies within","In Guatemala","Guatemala ,",", violence","violence is","is contagious","contagious ,",", and","and we","we are","are all","all infected"]}

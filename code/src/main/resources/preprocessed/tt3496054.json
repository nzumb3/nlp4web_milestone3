{"title":"Chandamama Kathalu","plot":"Is someone's Belief in VIRTUE more important than VIRTUE itself? Do rational thoughts destroy your soul? The depth of these questions cannot be scaled. The Interpretation of these facts seem normal, But it is going to be visible only to those who wish to see it. Experience will only teach us, 'what not to do', But 'not what to do'. Chandamama Kathalu is a paradox of a writer's point of view about life and his journey towards the path of enlightenment that we humans are mire particles in the greater aspect of the universe and forces beyond our imagination. The Real treasure of the movie is the apodictic situations and Philosophical Facts, which hide behind a mask of casual conversation and Real life Actions. 8 threads/plots/stories, interwoven and inter-cut, take you on a journey through Poverty, Deception, Glamour, Greed, Affluence, Conjugality, Hope and Bard, traveling from the slums to the affluent hills, from adolescence to retirement and from ignorance to arrogance in contemporary Hyderabad. These are the characters we see, meet, experience in daily life but never pay attention to, and seldom realize that one of these characters is us and what we are today is the result of our own actions from yesterday. If you observe the poster, the eight blocks in the poster are pictorial representation of each character and it also hints at each story line as well. But, don't get fooled by what you see. There is a lot more than what meets the eye. This is a compelling story that deals with multiple layers and with equally compelling characters and a near perfect casting, it penetrates through the average mind. Foot Note: People spend a lot of time trying to organize the world by building clocks and Calendars and trying to predict the weather. But what part of life is truly under once control? We are just common people living in an uncertain world.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Is","someon","'s","Belief","in","VIRTUE","more","import","than","VIRTUE","itself","?","Do","ration","thought","destroy","your","soul","?","The","depth","of","these","question","can","not","be","scale",".","The","Interpret","of","these","fact","seem","normal",",","But","it","is","go","to","be","visibl","onli","to","those","who","wish","to","see","it",".","Experienc","will","onli","teach","us",",","'","what","not","to","do","'",",","But","'","not","what","to","do","'",".","Chandamama","Kathalu","is","a","paradox","of","a","writer","'s","point","of","view","about","life","and","his","journey","toward","the","path","of","enlighten","that","we","human","are","mire","particl","in","the","greater","aspect","of","the","univers","and","forc","beyond","our","imagin",".","The","Real","treasur","of","the","movi","is","the","apodict","situat","and","Philosoph","Fact",",","which","hide","behind","a","mask","of","casual","convers","and","Real","life","Action",".","8","threads/plots/stori",",","interwoven","and","inter-cut",",","take","you","on","a","journey","through","Poverti",",","Decept",",","Glamour",",","Greed",",","Affluenc",",","Conjug",",","Hope","and","Bard",",","travel","from","the","slum","to","the","affluent","hill",",","from","adolesc","to","retir","and","from","ignor","to","arrog","in","contemporari","Hyderabad",".","These","are","the","charact","we","see",",","meet",",","experi","in","daili","life","but","never","pay","attent","to",",","and","seldom","realiz","that","one","of","these","charact","is","us","and","what","we","are","today","is","the","result","of","our","own","action","from","yesterday",".","If","you","observ","the","poster",",","the","eight","block","in","the","poster","are","pictori","represent","of","each","charact","and","it","also","hint","at","each","stori","line","as","well",".","But",",","do","n't","get","fool","by","what","you","see",".","There","is","a","lot","more","than","what","meet","the","eye",".","This","is","a","compel","stori","that","deal","with","multipl","layer","and","with","equal","compel","charact","and","a","near","perfect","cast",",","it","penetr","through","the","averag","mind",".","Foot","Note",":","Peopl","spend","a","lot","of","time","tri","to","organ","the","world","by","build","clock","and","Calendar","and","tri","to","predict","the","weather",".","But","what","part","of","life","is","truli","under","onc","control","?","We","are","just","common","peopl","live","in","an","uncertain","world","."],"lemmas":["be","someone","'s","Belief","in","VIRTUE","more","important","than","VIRTUE","itself","?","do","rational","thought","destroy","you","soul","?","the","depth","of","these","question","can","not","be","scale",".","the","interpretation","of","these","fact","seem","normal",",","but","it","be","go","to","be","visible","only","to","those","who","wish","to","see","it",".","experience","will","only","teach","we",",","'","what","not","to","do","'",",","but","'","not","what","to","do","'",".","Chandamama","Kathalu","be","a","paradox","of","a","writer","'s","point","of","view","about","life","and","he","journey","towards","the","path","of","enlightenment","that","we","human","be","mire","particle","in","the","greater","aspect","of","the","universe","and","force","beyond","we","imagination",".","the","real","treasure","of","the","movie","be","the","apodictic","situation","and","philosophical","fact",",","which","hide","behind","a","mask","of","casual","conversation","and","real","life","action",".","8","threads/plots/stories",",","interwoven","and","inter-cut",",","take","you","on","a","journey","through","Poverty",",","Deception",",","Glamour",",","Greed",",","Affluence",",","Conjugality",",","Hope","and","Bard",",","travel","from","the","slum","to","the","affluent","hill",",","from","adolescence","to","retirement","and","from","ignorance","to","arrogance","in","contemporary","Hyderabad",".","these","be","the","character","we","see",",","meet",",","experience","in","daily","life","but","never","pay","attention","to",",","and","seldom","realize","that","one","of","these","character","be","we","and","what","we","be","today","be","the","result","of","we","own","action","from","yesterday",".","if","you","observe","the","poster",",","the","eight","block","in","the","poster","be","pictorial","representation","of","each","character","and","it","also","hint","at","each","story","line","as","well",".","but",",","do","not","get","fool","by","what","you","see",".","there","be","a","lot","more","than","what","meet","the","eye",".","this","be","a","compelling","story","that","deal","with","multiple","layer","and","with","equally","compelling","character","and","a","near","perfect","casting",",","it","penetrate","through","the","average","mind",".","Foot","note",":","people","spend","a","lot","of","time","try","to","organize","the","world","by","building","clock","and","Calendars","and","try","to","predict","the","weather",".","but","what","part","of"

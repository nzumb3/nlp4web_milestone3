{"title":"Broadcast: A Man and His Dream","plot":"This engaging documentary tells the story of Ralph Epperson, a tobacco farmer's son who grew up in the foothills of southwestern Virginia in the 1920s and 30s. Discovering radio as a young boy, he was fascinated by this new technology and driven to learn all he could about transmitting sound through airwaves. With a strong faith in God and his community, and a passion for regional music, he dreamed of having a radio station of his own. That dream came true in 1948 when WPAQ 740AM, Mt. Airy, NC went on the air and \"the voice of the Blue Ridge\" was born. His efforts inspired most of his family to follow him out of the tobacco fields and into the emerging field of radio broadcasting. Today more than 150 radio stations around the nation owe their beginnings to Ralph and his dream. His broadcasts enabled generations of musicians to develop and pass along the ages-old tradition of Blue Ridge style string music that still endures and entertains today.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","engag","documentari","tell","the","stori","of","Ralph","Epperson",",","a","tobacco","farmer","'s","son","who","grew","up","in","the","foothil","of","southwestern","Virginia","in","the","1920s","and","30s",".","Discov","radio","as","a","young","boy",",","he","was","fascin","by","this","new","technolog","and","driven","to","learn","all","he","could","about","transmit","sound","through","airwav",".","With","a","strong","faith","in","God","and","his","communiti",",","and","a","passion","for","region","music",",","he","dream","of","have","a","radio","station","of","his","own",".","That","dream","came","true","in","1948","when","WPAQ","740AM",",","Mt.","Airi",",","NC","went","on","the","air","and","\"","the","voic","of","the","Blue","Ridg","\"","was","born",".","His","effort","inspir","most","of","his","famili","to","follow","him","out","of","the","tobacco","field","and","into","the","emerg","field","of","radio","broadcast",".","Today","more","than","150","radio","station","around","the","nation","owe","their","begin","to","Ralph","and","his","dream",".","His","broadcast","enabl","generat","of","musician","to","develop","and","pass","along","the","ages-old","tradit","of","Blue","Ridg","style","string","music","that","still","endur","and","entertain","today","."],"lemmas":["this","engaging","documentary","tell","the","story","of","Ralph","Epperson",",","a","tobacco","farmer","'s","son","who","grow","up","in","the","foothill","of","southwestern","Virginia","in","the","1920","and","30",".","discover","radio","as","a","young","boy",",","he","be","fascinate","by","this","new","technology","and","drive","to","learn","all","he","could","about","transmit","sound","through","airwave",".","with","a","strong","faith","in","God","and","he","community",",","and","a","passion","for","regional","music",",","he","dream","of","have","a","radio","station","of","he","own",".","that","dream","come","true","in","1948","when","WPAQ","740AM",",","Mt.","Airy",",","NC","go","on","the","air","and","``","the","voice","of","the","Blue","Ridge","''","be","bear",".","he","effort","inspire","most","of","he","family","to","follow","he","out","of","the","tobacco","field","and","into","the","emerge","field","of","radio","broadcasting",".","today","more","than","150","radio","station","around","the","nation","owe","they","beginning","to","Ralph","and","he","dream",".","he","broadcast","enable","generation","of","musician","to","develop","and","pass","along","the","ages-old","tradition","of","Blue","Ridge","style","string","music","that","still","endure","and","entertain","today","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["This engaging documentary","engaging documentary tells","documentary tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of Ralph","of Ralph Epperson","Ralph Epperson ,","Epperson , a",", a tobacco","a tobacco farmer","tobacco farmer 's","farmer 's son","'s son who","son who grew","who grew up","grew up in","up in the","in the foothills","the foothills of","foothills of southwestern","of southwestern Virginia","southwestern Virginia in","Virginia in the","in the 1920s","the 1920s and","1920s and 30s","Discovering radio as","radio as a","as a young","a young boy","young boy ,","boy , he",", he was","he was fascinated","was fascinated by","fascinated by this","by this new","this new technology","new technology and","technology and driven","and driven to","driven to learn","to learn all","learn all he","all he could","he could about","could about transmitting","about transmitting sound","transmitting sound through","sound through airwaves","With a strong","a strong faith","strong faith in","faith in God","in God and","God and his","and his community","his community ,","community , and",", and a","and a passion","a passion for","passion for regional","for regional music","regional music ,","music , he",", he dreamed","he dreamed of","dreamed of having","of having a","having a radio","a radio station","radio station of","station of his","of his own","That dream came","dream came true","came true in","true in 1948","in 1948 when","1948 when WPAQ","when WPAQ 740AM","WPAQ 740AM ,","740AM , Mt.",", Mt.

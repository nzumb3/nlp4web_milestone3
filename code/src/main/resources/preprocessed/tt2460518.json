{"title":"The Paladins","plot":"The Paladins chronicles the success of six companies in the United States and the United Kingdom. While the individual businesses may be very different, they share one notable trait, the organizations each had a champion, a Paladin, who inspired the change which elevated the business to another level, allowing them to flourish in these trying economic times. \"With The Paladins, we wanted to put a face on corporate success,\" said Dena Hysell, writer and director of the film. \"As we explored the story behind each of these businesses, it was clear that there was always an individual who was the catalyst for change. We wanted to tell that story and show how strong organizations embrace change by encouraging innovation.'","genres":["Biography"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Paladin","chronicl","the","success","of","six","compani","in","the","Unite","State","and","the","Unite","Kingdom",".","While","the","individu","busi","may","be","veri","differ",",","they","share","one","notabl","trait",",","the","organ","each","had","a","champion",",","a","Paladin",",","who","inspir","the","chang","which","elev","the","busi","to","anoth","level",",","allow","them","to","flourish","in","these","tri","econom","time",".","\"","With","The","Paladin",",","we","want","to","put","a","face","on","corpor","success",",","\"","said","Dena","Hysel",",","writer","and","director","of","the","film",".","\"","As","we","explor","the","stori","behind","each","of","these","busi",",","it","was","clear","that","there","was","alway","an","individu","who","was","the","catalyst","for","chang",".","We","want","to","tell","that","stori","and","show","how","strong","organ","embrac","chang","by","encourag","innov",".","'"],"lemmas":["the","Paladins","chronicle","the","success","of","six","company","in","the","United","States","and","the","United","Kingdom",".","while","the","individual","business","may","be","very","different",",","they","share","one","notable","trait",",","the","organization","each","have","a","champion",",","a","Paladin",",","who","inspire","the","change","which","elevate","the","business","to","another","level",",","allow","they","to","flourish","in","these","try","economic","time",".","``","with","the","Paladins",",","we","want","to","put","a","face","on","corporate","success",",","''","say","Dena","Hysell",",","writer","and","director","of","the","film",".","``","as","we","explore","the","story","behind","each","of","these","business",",","it","be","clear","that","there","be","always","a","individual","who","be","the","catalyst","for","change",".","we","want","to","tell","that","story","and","show","how","strong","organization","embrace","change","by","encourage","innovation",".","'"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Paladins chronicles","Paladins chronicles the","chronicles the success","the success of","success of six","of six companies","six companies in","companies in the","in the United","the United States","United States and","States and the","and the United","the United Kingdom","While the individual","the individual businesses","individual businesses may","businesses may be","may be very","be very different","very different ,","different , they",", they share","they share one","share one notable","one notable trait","notable trait ,","trait , the",", the organizations","the organizations each","organizations each had","each had a","had a champion","a champion ,","champion , a",", a Paladin","a Paladin ,","Paladin , who",", who inspired","who inspired the","inspired the change","the change which","change which elevated","which elevated the","elevated the business","the business to","business to another","to another level","another level ,","level , allowing",", allowing them","allowing them to","them to flourish","to flourish in","flourish in these","in these trying","these trying economic","trying economic times","\" With The","With The Paladins","The Paladins ,","Paladins , we",", we wanted","we wanted to","wanted to put","to put a","put a face","a face on","face on corporate","on corporate success","corporate success ,","success , \"",", \" said","\" said Dena","said Dena Hysell","Dena Hysell ,","Hysell , writer",", writer and","writer and director","and director of","director of the","of the film","\" As we","As we explored","we explored the","explored the story","the story behind","story behind each","behind each of","each of these","of these businesses","these businesses ,","businesses , it",", it was","it was clear","was clear that","clear that there","that there was","there was always","was always an","always an individual","an individual who","individual who was","who was the","was the catalyst","the catalyst for","catalyst for change","We wanted to","wanted to tell","to tell that","tell that story","that story and","story and show","and show how","show how strong","how strong organizations","strong organizations embrace","organizations embrace change","embrace change by","change by encouraging","by encouraging innovation","encouraging innovation .","innovation .

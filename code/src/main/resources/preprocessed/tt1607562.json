{"title":"In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee","plot":"In the 1960s just before being adopted from a Korean orphanage by an American family, my identity was switched with another girl named Cha Jung Hee. I was told to keep the switch a secret, then sent to America. In the Matter of Cha Jung Hee is a personal essay that chronicles my journey to find my double, while exploring the ethical and social dimensions of international transracial adoption. The film is a poignant reflection on memory, identity and what it means to walk in someone else's shoes.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["In","the","1960s","just","befor","be","adopt","from","a","Korean","orphanag","by","an","American","famili",",","my","ident","was","switch","with","anoth","girl","name","Cha","Jung","Hee",".","I","was","told","to","keep","the","switch","a","secret",",","then","sent","to","America",".","In","the","Matter","of","Cha","Jung","Hee","is","a","person","essay","that","chronicl","my","journey","to","find","my","doubl",",","while","explor","the","ethic","and","social","dimens","of","intern","transraci","adopt",".","The","film","is","a","poignant","reflect","on","memori",",","ident","and","what","it","mean","to","walk","in","someon","els","'s","shoe","."],"lemmas":["in","the","1960","just","before","be","adopt","from","a","korean","orphanage","by","a","american","family",",","my","identity","be","switch","with","another","girl","name","Cha","Jung","Hee",".","I","be","tell","to","keep","the","switch","a","secret",",","then","send","to","America",".","in","the","matter","of","cha","jung","hee","be","a","personal","essay","that","chronicle","my","journey","to","find","my","double",",","while","explore","the","ethical","and","social","dimension","of","international","transracial","adoption",".","the","film","be","a","poignant","reflection","on","memory",",","identity","and","what","it","mean","to","walk","in","someone","else","'s","shoe","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the 1960s","the 1960s just","1960s just before","just before being","before being adopted","being adopted from","adopted from a","from a Korean","a Korean orphanage","Korean orphanage by","orphanage by an","by an American","an American family","American family ,","family , my",", my identity","my identity was","identity was switched","was switched with","switched with another","with another girl","another girl named","girl named Cha","named Cha Jung","Cha Jung Hee","I was told","was told to","told to keep","to keep the","keep the switch","the switch a","switch a secret","a secret ,","secret , then",", then sent","then sent to","sent to America","In the Matter","the Matter of","Matter of Cha","of Cha Jung","Cha Jung Hee","Jung Hee is","Hee is a","is a personal","a personal essay","personal essay that","essay that chronicles","that chronicles my","chronicles my journey","my journey to","journey to find","to find my","find my double","my double ,","double , while",", while exploring","while exploring the","exploring the ethical","the ethical and","ethical and social","and social dimensions","social dimensions of","dimensions of international","of international transracial","international transracial adoption","The film is","film is a","is a poignant","a poignant reflection","poignant reflection on","reflection on memory","on memory ,","memory , identity",", identity and","identity and what","and what it","what it means","it means to","means to walk","to walk in","walk in someone","in someone else","someone else 's","else 's shoes"],"2grams":["In the","the 1960s","1960s just","just before","before being","being adopted","adopted from","from a","a Korean","Korean orphanage","orphanage by","by an","an American","American family","family ,",", my","my identity","identity was","was switched","switched with","with another","another girl","girl named","named Cha","Cha Jung","Jung Hee","I was","was told","told to","to keep","keep the","the switch","switch a","a secret","secret ,",", then","then sent","sent to","to America","In the","the Matter","Matter of","of Cha","Cha Jung","Jung Hee","Hee is","is a","a personal","personal essay","essay that","that chronicles","chronicles my","my journey","journey to","to find","find my","my double","double ,",", while","while exploring","exploring the","the ethical","ethical and","and social","social dimensions","dimensions of","of international","international transracial","transracial adoption","The film","film is","is a","a poignant","poignant reflection","reflection on","on memory","memory ,",", identity","identity and","and what","what it","it means","means to","to walk","walk in","in someone","someone else","else 's","'s shoes"]}

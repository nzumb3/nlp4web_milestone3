{"title":"Broken Windows","plot":"Sara is a photographer who is constantly being offered high paying commercial work, but is losing sight of her artistic nature that made her a success in the first place. Her best friend not only challenges her to go back to her roots, but he might very well be in love with her. AMY suffers a loss that has changed her life. Her mother tries to help, her brother doesn't know what to do, and her father gets her to throw a party for her dead grandfather. KATIE is an actress in an unpredictable relationship with a more successful, but less talented actor. She is trying to decide which path to follow with her career, and her boyfriend is only making things worse. BETH is a psychiatrist who keeps her secrets hidden deep inside. By coincidence she ends up at a patient's party, and it causes her to open up in a new way. The stories come together and each show us a little bit about the human struggle we all deal with.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Sara","is","a","photograph","who","is","constant","be","offer","high","pay","commerci","work",",","but","is","lose","sight","of","her","artist","natur","that","made","her","a","success","in","the","first","place",".","Her","best","friend","not","onli","challeng","her","to","go","back","to","her","root",",","but","he","might","veri","well","be","in","love","with","her",".","AMi","suffer","a","loss","that","has","chang","her","life",".","Her","mother","tri","to","help",",","her","brother","doe","n't","know","what","to","do",",","and","her","father","get","her","to","throw","a","parti","for","her","dead","grandfath",".","KATIE","is","an","actress","in","an","unpredict","relationship","with","a","more","success",",","but","less","talent","actor",".","She","is","tri","to","decid","which","path","to","follow","with","her","career",",","and","her","boyfriend","is","onli","make","thing","wors",".","BETH","is","a","psychiatrist","who","keep","her","secret","hidden","deep","insid",".","By","coincid","she","end","up","at","a","patient","'s","parti",",","and","it","caus","her","to","open","up","in","a","new","way",".","The","stori","come","togeth","and","each","show","us","a","littl","bit","about","the","human","struggl","we","all","deal","with","."],"lemmas":["Sara","be","a","photographer","who","be","constantly","be","offer","high","pay","commercial","work",",","but","be","lose","sight","of","she","artistic","nature","that","make","she","a","success","in","the","first","place",".","she","best","friend","not","only","challenge","she","to","go","back","to","she","root",",","but","he","might","very","well","be","in","love","with","she",".","AMY","suffer","a","loss","that","have","change","she","life",".","she","mother","try","to","help",",","she","brother","do","not","know","what","to","do",",","and","she","father","get","she","to","throw","a","party","for","she","dead","grandfather",".","KATIE","be","a","actress","in","a","unpredictable","relationship","with","a","more","successful",",","but","less","talented","actor",".","she","be","try","to","decide","which","path","to","follow","with","she","career",",","and","she","boyfriend","be","only","make","thing","worse",".","beth","be","a","psychiatrist","who","keep","she","secret","hide","deep","inside",".","by","coincidence","she","end","up","at","a","patient","'s","party",",","and","it","cause","she","to","open","up","in","a","new","way",".","the","story","come","together","and","each","show","we","a","little","bit","about","the","human","struggle","we","all","deal","with","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sara

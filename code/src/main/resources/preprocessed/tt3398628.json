{"title":"The Closer We Get","plot":"The Closer We Get is a multi-award winning autobiographical portrait of broken dreams, loyalty and redemption that follows its director Karen Guthrie from Scotland to Ethiopia and back again. Karen's mother Ann suffers a devastating stroke that draws her daughter back to her Scottish hometown when she least expects it. But Karen isn't the only one who returns in the crisis. Her prodigal father Ian - endearing but unfathomable - also reappears after years of separation from Ann. Reunited so unexpectedly, Karen seizes her camera to go under the skin of the family story before it's too late, to come to terms with the aftermath of the secret her father had tried - and failed - to keep from them all, and to f ind that Ann's stroke has in fact thrown them a lifeline. With candor, warmth and humor, Karen's role as confidante, busybody, therapist and spy illuminates an extraordinary and uplifting story of family survival.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["The","Closer","We","Get","is","a","multi-award","win","autobiograph","portrait","of","broken","dream",",","loyalti","and","redempt","that","follow","it","director","Karen","Guthri","from","Scotland","to","Ethiopia","and","back","again",".","Karen","'s","mother","Ann","suffer","a","devast","stroke","that","draw","her","daughter","back","to","her","Scottish","hometown","when","she","least","expect","it",".","But","Karen","is","n't","the","onli","one","who","return","in","the","crisi",".","Her","prodig","father","Ian","-","endear","but","unfathom","-","also","reappear","after","year","of","separ","from","Ann",".","Reunit","so","unexpect",",","Karen","seiz","her","camera","to","go","under","the","skin","of","the","famili","stori","befor","it","'s","too","late",",","to","come","to","term","with","the","aftermath","of","the","secret","her","father","had","tri","-","and","fail","-","to","keep","from","them","all",",","and","to","f","ind","that","Ann","'s","stroke","has","in","fact","thrown","them","a","lifelin",".","With","candor",",","warmth","and","humor",",","Karen","'s","role","as","confidant",",","busybodi",",","therapist","and","spi","illumin","an","extraordinari","and","uplift","stori","of","famili","surviv","."],"lemmas":["the","closer","we","get","be","a","multi-award","winning","autobiographical","portrait","of","broken","dream",",","loyalty","and","redemption","that","follow","its","director","Karen","Guthrie","from","Scotland","to","Ethiopia","and","back","again",".","Karen","'s","mother","Ann","suffer","a","devastating","stroke","that","draw","she","daughter","back","to","she","Scottish","hometown","when","she","least","expect","it",".","but","Karen","be","not","the","only","one","who","return","in","the","crisis",".","she","prodigal","father","Ian","-","endearing","but","unfathomable","-","also","reappear","after","year","of","separation","from","Ann",".","reunite","so","unexpectedly",",","Karen","seize","she","camera","to","go","under","the","skin","of","the","family","story","before","it","be","too","late",",","to","come","to","term","with","the","aftermath","of","the","secret","she","father","have","try","-","and","fail","-","to","keep","from","they","all",",","and","to","f","ind","that","Ann","'s","stroke","have","in","fact","throw","they","a","lifeline",".","with","candor",",","warmth","and","humor",",","Karen","'s","role","as","confidante",",","busybody",",","therapist","and","spy","illuminate","a","extraordinary","and","uplifting","story","of","family","survival","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Closer We","Closer We Get","We Get is","Get is a","is a multi-award","a multi-award winning","multi-award winning autobiographical","winning autobiographical portrait","autobiographical portrait of","portrait of broken","of broken dreams","broken dreams ,","dreams , loyalty",", loyalty and","loyalty and redemption","and redemption that","redemption that follows","that follows its","follows its director","its director Karen","director Karen Guthrie","Karen Guthrie from","Guthrie from Scotland","from Scotland to","Scotland to Ethiopia","to Ethiopia and","Ethiopia and back","and back again","Karen 's mother","'s mother Ann","mother Ann suffers","Ann suffers a","suffers a devastating","a devastating stroke","devastating stroke that","stroke that draws","that draws her","draws her daughter","her daughter back","daughter back to","back to her","to her Scottish","her Scottish hometown","Scottish hometown when","hometown when she","when she least","she least expects","least expects it","But Karen is","Karen is n't","is n't the","n't the only","the only one","only one who","one who returns","who returns in","returns in the","in the crisis","Her prodigal father","prodigal father Ian","father Ian -","Ian -

{"title":"Apartment Hunting","plot":"Ben Reddick is a writer for Boomer magazine in Toronto. His fledgling career gets a boost when his boss Victor gives him a cover story article to write. He has mixed feelings about it because of the topic: telephone dating. Victor gave him the assignment if only because the job wouldn't threaten his stable marriage to his wife Sarah, despite Victor stipulating that Ben is not to meet any of the female date seekers face-to-face. Beyond the daunting task of finding a larger apartment for themselves, Ben does state that his and Sarah's marriage is perfect, so much so that they are thinking about starting a family, complete with a dog. However, their marriage truly is based primarily on sexual attraction - as all his past relationships have been - and not a true emotional connectedness. Ben's personal and profession lives get intertwined when his apartment hunting duties start to overlap with his telephone dates. But they overlap in a more meaningful way when he truly does make an emotional connection with one of the telephone dates, a woman who calls herself Celine. Despite vowing never to cheat on Sarah, Ben has to decide what he's going to do about his feelings for Celine, which seem to be reciprocated, and if he does decide to meet her whether those feelings will change if he isn't sexually attracted to her, which has been the basis for all his relationships up to this point.","genres":["Comedy","

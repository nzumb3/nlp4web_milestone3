{"title":"Hepta: The Last Lecture","plot":"Dr. Shukri Mokhtar is a renowned social psychology specialist who decides to give one last lecture before his departure from the world. Best known for his ability to answer the simplest questions, Dr. Mokhtar in his last lecture answers the very simple question: \"how do we love?\". He gives a full description of the different stages of love by recounting four different love stories going through curves and various crises. Although the four stories do not seem to be connected, they share one essential element that connects them all to each others and even to the seemingly sick lecturer.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Dr.","Shukri","Mokhtar","is","a","renown","social","psycholog","specialist","who","decid","to","give","one","last","lectur","befor","his","departur","from","the","world",".","Best","known","for","his","abil","to","answer","the","simplest","question",",","Dr.","Mokhtar","in","his","last","lectur","answer","the","veri","simpl","question",":","\"","how","do","we","love","?","\"",".","He","give","a","full","descript","of","the","differ","stage","of","love","by","recount","four","differ","love","stori","go","through","curv","and","various","crise",".","Although","the","four","stori","do","not","seem","to","be","connect",",","they","share","one","essenti","element","that","connect","them","all","to","each","other","and","even","to","the","seem","sick","lectur","."],"lemmas":["Dr.","Shukri","Mokhtar","be","a","renowned","social","psychology","specialist","who","decide","to","give","one","last","lecture","before","he","departure","from","the","world",".","best","know","for","he","ability","to","answer","the","simplest","question",",","Dr.","Mokhtar","in","he","last","lecture","answer","the","very","simple","question",":","``","how","do","we","love","?","''",".","he","give","a","full","description","of","the","different","stage","of","love","by","recount","four","different","love","story","go","through","curve","and","various","crisis",".","although","the","four","story","do","not","seem","to","be","connect",",","they","share","one","essential","element","that","connect","they","all","to","each","other","and","even","to","the","seemingly","sick","lecturer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Dr. Shukri Mokhtar","Shukri Mokhtar is","Mokhtar is a","is a renowned","a renowned social","renowned social psychology","social psychology specialist","psychology specialist who","specialist who decides","who decides to","decides to give","to give one","give one last","one last lecture","last lecture before","lecture before his","before his departure","his departure from","departure from the","from the world","Best known for","known for his","for his ability","his ability to","ability to answer","to answer the","answer the simplest","the simplest questions","simplest questions ,","questions , Dr.",", Dr. Mokhtar","Dr. Mokhtar in","Mokhtar in his","in his last","his last lecture","last lecture answers","lecture answers the","answers the very","the very simple","very simple question","simple question :","question : \"",": \" how","\" how do","how do we","do we love","we love ?","love ?

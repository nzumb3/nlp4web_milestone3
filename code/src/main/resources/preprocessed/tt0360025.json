{"title":"Stella Street","plot":"A satirical glimpse at the early 21st century in which impressionists Phil Cornwell and John Sessions send up celebrity culture, including: Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who run a corner shop; Jack Nicholson and Al Pacino, who rub shoulders in a leafy lane in suburbia; and David Bowie, who has his underpants starched and ironed by an uptight cockney charlady named Mrs. Huggett. Megastars come and go, but nothing escapes the watchful eye of their long-suffering neighbor, Michael Caine.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","satir","glimps","at","the","earli","21st","centuri","in","which","impressionist","Phil","Cornwel","and","John","Session","send","up","celebr","cultur",",","includ",":","Keith","Richard","and","Mick","Jagger",",","who","run","a","corner","shop",";","Jack","Nicholson","and","Al","Pacino",",","who","rub","shoulder","in","a","leafi","lane","in","suburbia",";","and","David","Bowi",",","who","has","his","underp","starch","and","iron","by","an","uptight","cockney","charladi","name","Mrs.","Huggett",".","Megastar","come","and","go",",","but","noth","escap","the","watch","eye","of","their","long-suff","neighbor",",","Michael","Cain","."],"lemmas":["a","satirical","glimpse","at","the","early","21st","century","in","which","impressionist","Phil","Cornwell","and","John","Sessions","send","up","celebrity","culture",",","include",":","Keith","Richards","and","Mick","Jagger",",","who","run","a","corner","shop",";","Jack","Nicholson","and","Al","Pacino",",","who","rub","shoulder","in","a","leafy","lane","in","suburbia",";","and","David","Bowie",",","who","have","he","underpants","starch","and","iron","by","a","uptight","cockney","charlady","name","Mrs.","Huggett",".","megastar","come","and","go",",","but","nothing","escape","the","watchful","eye","of","they","long-suffering","neighbor",",","Michael","Caine","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A satirical glimpse","satirical glimpse at","glimpse at the","at the early","the early 21st","early 21st century","21st century in","century in which","in which impressionists","which impressionists Phil","impressionists Phil Cornwell","Phil Cornwell and","Cornwell and John","and John Sessions","John Sessions send","Sessions send up","send up celebrity","up celebrity culture","celebrity culture ,","culture , including",", including :","including : Keith",": Keith Richards","Keith Richards and","Richards and Mick","and Mick Jagger","Mick Jagger ,","Jagger , who",", who run","who run a","run a corner","a corner shop","corner shop ;","shop ; Jack","; Jack Nicholson","Jack Nicholson and","Nicholson and Al","and Al Pacino","Al Pacino ,","Pacino , who",", who rub","who rub shoulders","rub shoulders in","shoulders in a","in a leafy","a leafy lane","leafy lane in","lane in suburbia","in suburbia ;","suburbia ; and","; and David","and David Bowie","David Bowie ,","Bowie , who",", who has","who has his","has his underpants","his underpants starched","underpants starched and","starched and ironed","and ironed by","ironed by an","by an uptight","an uptight cockney","uptight cockney charlady","cockney charlady named","charlady named Mrs.","named Mrs. Huggett","Megastars come and","come and go","and go ,","go , but",", but nothing","but nothing escapes","nothing escapes the","escapes the watchful","the watchful eye","watchful eye of","eye of their","of their long-suffering","their long-suffering neighbor","long-suffering neighbor ,","neighbor , Michael",", Michael Caine"],"2grams":["A satirical","satirical glimpse","glimpse at","at the","the early","early 21st","21st century","century in","in which","which impressionists","impressionists Phil","Phil Cornwell","Cornwell and","and John","John Sessions","Sessions send","send up","up celebrity","celebrity culture","culture ,",", including","including :",": Keith","Keith Richards","Richards and","and Mick","Mick Jagger","Jagger ,",", who","who run","run a","a corner","corner shop","shop ;","; Jack","Jack Nicholson","Nicholson and","and Al","Al Pacino","Pacino ,",", who","who rub","rub shoulders","shoulders in","in a","a leafy","leafy lane","lane in","in suburbia","suburbia ;","; and","and David","David Bowie","Bowie ,",", who","who has","has his","his underpants","underpants starched","starched and","and ironed","ironed by","by an","an uptight","uptight cockney","cockney charlady","charlady named","named Mrs.","Mrs. Huggett","Megastars come","come and","and go","go ,",", but","but nothing","nothing escapes","escapes the","the watchful","watchful eye","eye of","of their","their long-suffering","long-suffering neighbor","neighbor ,",", Michael","Michael Caine"]}

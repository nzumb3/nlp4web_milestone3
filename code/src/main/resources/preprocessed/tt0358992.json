Vijay meets with fellow collegian, Honey, and after a few altercations both fall in love with each other. Vijay is introduced to Honey's maternal uncle, Bhagwandas, and he approves instantly. Honey's long-estranged brother, Kanhaiya, re-enters her life and asks her not to see Vijay anymore. Then the lives of the entire Saxena family change drastically when money alloted for Suman's marriage is stolen, and Vijay accepts a contract to kill a man named Gulla - not knowing that he is being set-up to kill none other than Nirbhay himself.","genres":["Action"," Crime"],"stems":["Mumbai-bas","Saxena","famili","consist","of","Professor","Nirbhay",",","his","wife",",","Preeti",",","their","school-go","daughter",",","Ritu",";","Nirbhay","'s","college-go","brother","and","sister",",","Vijay","and","Suman","respect",".","Vijay","meet","with","fellow","collegian",",","Honey",",","and","after","a","few","alterc","both","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","Vijay","is","introduc","to","Honey","'s","matern","uncl",",","Bhagwanda",",","and","he","approv","instant",".","Honey","'s","long-estrang","brother",",","Kanhaiya",",","re-ent","her","life","and","ask","her","not","to","see","Vijay","anymor",".","Then","the","live","of","the","entir","Saxena","famili","chang","drastic","when","money","allot","for","Suman","'s","marriag","is","stolen",",","and","Vijay","accept","a","contract","to","kill","a","man","name","Gulla","-","not","know","that","he","is","be","set-up","to","kill","none","other","than","Nirbhay","himself","."],"lemmas":["mumbai-based","Saxena","family","consist","of","Professor","Nirbhay",",","he","wife",",","Preeti",",","they","school-going","daughter",",","Ritu",";","Nirbhay","'s","college-going","brother","and","sister",",","Vijay","and","Suman","respectively",".","Vijay","meet","with","fellow","collegian",",","Honey",",","and","after","a","few","altercation","both","fall","in","love","with","each","other",".","Vijay","be","introduce","to","Honey","'s","maternal","uncle",",","Bhagwandas",",","and","he","approve","instantly",".","Honey","'s","long-estranged","brother",",","Kanhaiya",",","re-enter","she","life","and","ask","she","not","to","see","Vijay","anymore",".","then","the","life","of","the","entire","Saxena","family","change","drastically","when","money","allote","for","Suman","'s","marriage","be","steal",",","and","Vijay","accept","a","contract","to","kill","a","man","name","Gulla","-","not","know","that","he","be","be","set-up","to","kill","none","other","than","Nirbhay","himself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Mumbai-based Saxena family","Saxena family consists","family consists of","consists of Professor","of Professor Nirbhay","Professor Nirbhay ,","Nirbhay , his",", his wife","his wife ,","wife , Preeti",", Preeti ,","Preeti , their",", their school-going","their school-going daughter","school-going daughter ,","daughter , Ritu",", Ritu ;","Ritu ;

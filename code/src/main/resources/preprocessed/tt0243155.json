{"title":"Bridget Jones's Diary","plot":"Bridget Jones is an average woman struggling against her age, her weight, her job, her lack of a man, and her many imperfections. As a New Year's Resolution, Bridget decides to take control of her life, starting by keeping a diary in which she will always tell the complete truth. The fireworks begin when her charming though disreputable boss takes an interest in the quirky Miss Jones. Thrown into the mix are Bridget's band of slightly eccentric friends and a rather disagreeable acquaintance who Bridget cannot seem to stop running into or help finding quietly attractive.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Bridget","Jone","is","an","averag","woman","struggl","against","her","age",",","her","weight",",","her","job",",","her","lack","of","a","man",",","and","her","mani","imperfect",".","As","a","New","Year","'s","Resolut",",","Bridget","decid","to","take","control","of","her","life",",","start","by","keep","a","diari","in","which","she","will","alway","tell","the","complet","truth",".","The","firework","begin","when","her","charm","though","disreput","boss","take","an","interest","in","the","quirki","Miss","Jone",".","Thrown","into","the","mix","are","Bridget","'s","band","of","slight","eccentr","friend","and","a","rather","disagre","acquaint","who","Bridget","can","not","seem","to","stop","run","into","or","help","find","quiet","attract","."],"lemmas":["Bridget","Jones","be","a","average","woman","struggle","against","she","age",",","she","weight",",","she","job",",","she","lack","of","a","man",",","and","she","many","imperfection",".","as","a","New","Year","'s","Resolution",",","Bridget","decide","to","take","control","of","she","life",",","start","by","keep","a","diary","in","which","she","will","always","tell","the","complete","truth",".","the","firework","begin","when","she","charming","though","disreputable","boss","take","a","interest","in","the","quirky","Miss","Jones",".","throw","into","the","mix","be","Bridget","'s","band","of","slightly","eccentric","friend","and","a","rather","disagreeable","acquaintance","who","Bridget","can","not","seem","to","stop","run","into","or","help","find","quietly","attractive","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bridget Jones is","Jones is an","is an average","an average woman","average woman struggling","woman struggling against","struggling against her","against her age","her age ,","age , her",", her weight","her weight ,","weight , her",", her job","her job ,","job , her",", her lack","her lack of","lack of a","of a man","a man ,","man , and",", and her","and her many","her many imperfections","As a New","a New Year","New Year 's","Year 's Resolution","'s Resolution ,","Resolution , Bridget",", Bridget decides","Bridget decides to","decides to take","to take control","take control of","control of her","of her life","her life ,","life , starting",", starting by","starting by keeping","by keeping a","keeping a diary","a diary in","diary in which","in which she","which she will","she will always","will always tell","always tell the","tell the complete","the complete truth","The fireworks begin","fireworks begin when","begin when her","when her charming","her charming though","charming though disreputable","though disreputable boss","disreputable boss takes","boss takes an","takes an interest","an interest in","interest in the","in the quirky","the quirky Miss","quirky Miss Jones","Thrown into the","into the mix","the mix are","mix are Bridget","are Bridget 's","Bridget 's band","'s band of","band of slightly","of slightly eccentric","slightly eccentric friends","eccentric friends and","friends and a","and a rather","a rather disagreeable","rather disagreeable acquaintance","disagreeable acquaintance who","acquaintance who Bridget","who Bridget can","Bridget can not","can not seem","not seem to","seem to stop","to stop running","stop running into","running into or","into or help","or help finding","help finding quietly","finding quietly attractive"],"2grams":["Bridget Jones","Jones is","is an","an average","average woman","woman struggling","struggling against","against her","her age","age ,",", her","her weight","weight ,",", her","her job","job ,",", her","her lack","lack of","of a","a man","man ,",", and","and her","her many","many imperfections","As a","a New","New Year","Year 's","'s Resolution","Resolution ,",", Bridget","Bridget decides","decides to","to take","take control","control of","of her","her life","life ,",", starting","starting by","by keeping","keeping a","a diary","diary in","in which","which she","she will","will always","always tell","tell the","the complete","complete truth","The fireworks","fireworks begin","begin when","when her","her charming","charming though","though disreputable","disreputable boss","boss takes","takes an","an interest","interest in","in the","the quirky","quirky Miss","Miss Jones","Thrown into","into the","the mix","mix are","are Bridget","Bridget 's","'s band","band of","of slightly","slightly eccentric","eccentric friends","friends and","and a","a rather","rather disagreeable","disagreeable acquaintance","acquaintance who","who Bridget","Bridget can","can not","not seem","seem to","to stop","stop running","running into","into or","or help","help finding","finding quietly","quietly attractive"]}

{"title":"39 Days Of Jack","plot":"When Jack was sent to prison in 1994, his daughter was two years-old. Since then, he's dreamed of the day he would be released. He's dreamed of the day he could be a father again. Seventeen years later, today is that day, and we're there to see it. We aim to follow Jack for the first 90 days after his release as he attempts to rekindle his relationship with his daughter and reintegrate into society. But things don't go as planned, and the documentary comes to an abrupt halt on day 39.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["When","Jack","was","sent","to","prison","in","1994",",","his","daughter","was","two","years-old",".","Sinc","then",",","he","'s","dream","of","the","day","he","would","be","releas",".","He","'s","dream","of","the","day","he","could","be","a","father","again",".","Seventeen","year","later",",","today","is","that","day",",","and","we","re","there","to","see","it",".","We","aim","to","follow","Jack","for","the","first","90","day","after","his","releas","as","he","attempt","to","rekindl","his","relationship","with","his","daughter","and","reintegr","into","societi",".","But","thing","do","n't","go","as","plan",",","and","the","documentari","come","to","an","abrupt","halt","on","day","39","."],"lemmas":["when","Jack","be","send","to","prison","in","1994",",","he","daughter","be","two","years-old",".","since","then",",","he","be","dream","of","the","day","he","would","be","release",".","he","be","dream","of","the","day","he","could","be","a","father","again",".","seventeen","year","later",",","today","be","that","day",",","and","we","be","there","to","see","it",".","we","aim","to","follow","Jack","for","the","first","90","day","after","he","release","as","he","attempt","to","rekindle","he","relationship","with","he","daughter","and","reintegrate","into","society",".","but","thing","do","not","go","as","plan",",","and","the","documentary","come","to","a","abrupt","halt","on","day","39","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Jack was","Jack was sent","was sent to","sent to prison","to prison in","prison in 1994","in 1994 ,","1994 , his",", his daughter","his daughter was","daughter was two","was two years-old","Since then ,","then , he",", he 's","he 's dreamed","'s dreamed of","dreamed of the","of the day","the day he","day he would","he would be","would be released","He 's dreamed","'s dreamed of","dreamed of the","of the day","the day he","day he could","he could be","could be a","be a father","a father again","Seventeen years later","years later ,","later , today",", today is","today is that","is that day","that day ,","day , and",", and we","and we 're","we 're there","'re there to","there to see","to see it","We aim to","aim to follow","to follow Jack","follow Jack for","Jack for the","for the first","the first 90","first 90 days","90 days after","days after his","after his release","his release as","release as he","as he attempts","he attempts to","attempts to rekindle","to rekindle his","rekindle his relationship","his relationship with","relationship with his","with his daughter","his daughter and","daughter and reintegrate","and reintegrate into","reintegrate into society","But things do","things do n't","do n't go","n't go as","go as planned","as planned ,","planned , and",", and the","and the documentary","the documentary comes","documentary comes to","comes to an","to an abrupt","an abrupt halt","abrupt halt on","halt on day","on day 39"],"2grams":["When Jack","Jack was","was sent","sent to","to prison","prison in","in 1994","1994 ,",", his","his daughter","daughter was","was two","two years-old","Since then","then ,",", he","he 's","'s dreamed","dreamed of","of the","the day","day he","he would","would be","be released","He 's","'s dreamed","dreamed of","of the","the day","day he","he could","could be","be a","a father","father again","Seventeen years","years later","later ,",", today","today is","is that","that day","day ,",", and","and we","we 're","'re there","there to","to see","see it","We aim","aim to","to follow","follow Jack","Jack for","for the","the first","first 90","90 days","days after","after his","his release","release as","as he","he attempts","attempts to","to rekindle","rekindle his","his relationship","relationship with","with his","his daughter","daughter and","and reintegrate","reintegrate into","into society","But things","things do","do n't","n't go","go as","as planned","planned ,",", and","and the","the documentary","documentary comes","comes to","to an","an abrupt","abrupt halt","halt on","on day","day 39"]}

Once again, they put growing up temporarily on-hold, and embark on a backpacking holiday of a lifetime in an awful car, inspired by Peter Andre's 'Mysterious Girl'.

travelers.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Neil",",","Will","and","Simon","receiv","an","invit","from","Jay","to","join","him","in","Australia","whilst","on","his","gap","year",",","who","promis","them","it","'s","''","the","sex","capit","of","the","world","''",".","With","their","live","now","rather","dull","compar","to","their","hedonist","school","day","and","legendari","lad","holiday",",","it","'s","an","offer","they","ca","n't","refus",".","Once","again",",","they","put","grow","up","temporarili","on-hold",",","and","embark","on","a","backpack","holiday","of","a","lifetim","in","an","aw","car",",","inspir","by","Peter","Andre","'s","'","Mysteri","Girl","'",".","Will","soon","find","himself","battl","with","the","lad","to","do","someth","cultur",",","whilst","they","focus","their","attent","on","drink",",","girl",",","and","annoy","fellow","travel","."],"lemmas":["Neil",",","Will","and","Simon","receive","a","invite","from","Jay","to","join","he","in","Australia","whilst","on","he","gap","year",",","who","promise","they","it","be","''","the","sex","capital","of","the","world","''",".","with","they","life","now","rather","dull","compare","to","they","hedonistic","school","day","and","legendary","lad","holiday",",","it","be","a","offer","they","can","not","refuse",".","once","again",",","they","put","grow","up","temporarily","on-hold",",","and","embark","on","a","backpacking","holiday","of","a","lifetime","in","a","awful","car",",","inspire","by","Peter","Andre","'s","'","mysterious","Girl","'",".","will","soon","find","himself","battle","with","the","lad","to","do","something","cultural",",","whilst","they","focus","they","attention","on","drinking",",","girl",",","and","annoy","fellow","traveler","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Neil

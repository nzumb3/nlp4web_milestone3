{"title":"Narcissus","plot":"Narcissus (from Greek Narkissos) shares the root nark- with narcosis and narcotic. All these words have the same origin in the verb narkao - to intoxicate through a strong smell. In the modern interpretation of the ancient myth Teodore is a handsome and multiply gifted string quartet cello player who knows his own value. He draws people in, but ends up hurting them, yet he is impossible to resist. Teodore abandons his family, career, and friends in his quest for a true challenge. He has yet to find out that his greatest confrontation will be with himself.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Narcissus","(","from","Greek","Narkisso",")","share","the","root","nark","-","with","narcosi","and","narcot",".","All","these","word","have","the","same","origin","in","the","verb","narkao","-","to","intox","through","a","strong","smell",".","In","the","modern","interpret","of","the","ancient","myth","Teodor","is","a","handsom","and","multipli","gift","string","quartet","cello","player","who","know","his","own","valu",".","He","draw","peopl","in",",","but","end","up","hurt","them",",","yet","he","is","imposs","to","resist",".","Teodor","abandon","his","famili",",","career",",","and","friend","in","his","quest","for","a","true","challeng",".","He","has","yet","to","find","out","that","his","greatest","confront","will","be","with","himself","."],"lemmas":["narcissus","-lrb-","from","greek","Narkissos","-rrb-","share","the","root","nark","-","with","narcosis","and","narcotic",".","all","these","word","have","the","same","origin","in","the","verb","narkao","-","to","intoxicate","through","a","strong","smell",".","in","the","modern","interpretation","of","the","ancient","myth","Teodore","be","a","handsome","and","multiply","gifted","string","quartet","cello","player","who","know","he","own","value",".","he","draw","people","in",",","but","end","up","hurt","they",",","yet","he","be","impossible","to","resist",".","Teodore","abandon","he","family",",","career",",","and","friend","in","he","quest","for","a","true","challenge",".","he","have","yet","to","find","out","that","he","greatest","confrontation","will","be","with","himself","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Narcissus ( from","( from Greek","from Greek Narkissos","Greek Narkissos )","Narkissos ) shares",") shares the","shares the root","the root nark","root nark -","nark - with","- with narcosis","with narcosis and","narcosis and narcotic","All these words","these words have","words have the","have the same","the same origin","same origin in","origin in the","in the verb","the verb narkao","verb narkao -","narkao - to","- to intoxicate","to intoxicate through","intoxicate through a","through a strong","a strong smell","In the modern","the modern interpretation","modern interpretation of","interpretation of the","of the ancient","the ancient myth","ancient myth Teodore","myth Teodore is","Teodore is a","is a handsome","a handsome and","handsome and multiply","and multiply gifted","multiply gifted string","gifted string quartet","string quartet cello","quartet cello player","cello player who","player who knows","who knows his","knows his own","his own value","He draws people","draws people in","people in ,","in , but",", but ends","but ends up","ends up hurting","up hurting them","hurting them ,","them , yet",", yet he","yet he is","he is impossible","is impossible to","impossible to resist","Teodore abandons his","abandons his family","his family ,","family , career",", career ,","career , and",", and friends","and friends in","friends in his","in his quest","his quest for","quest for a","for a true","a true challenge","He has yet","has yet to","yet to find","to find out","find out that","out that his","that his greatest","his greatest confrontation","greatest confrontation will","confrontation will be","will be with","be with himself"],"2grams":["Narcissus (","( from","from Greek","Greek Narkissos","Narkissos )",") shares","shares the","the root","root nark","nark -","- with","with narcosis","narcosis and","and narcotic","All these","these words","words have","have the","the same","same origin","origin in","in the","the verb","verb narkao","narkao -","- to","to intoxicate","intoxicate through","through a","a strong","strong smell","In the","the modern","modern interpretation","interpretation of","of the","the ancient","ancient myth","myth Teodore","Teodore is","is a","a handsome","handsome and","and multiply","multiply gifted","gifted string","string quartet","quartet cello","cello player","player who","who knows","knows his","his own","own value","He draws","draws people","people in","in ,",", but","but ends","ends up","up hurting","hurting them","them ,",", yet","yet he","he is","is impossible","impossible to","to resist","Teodore abandons","abandons his","his family","family ,",", career","career ,",", and","and friends","friends in","in his","his quest","quest for","for a","a true","true challenge","He has","has yet","yet to","to find","find out","out that","that his","his greatest","greatest confrontation","confrontation will","will be","be with","with himself"]}

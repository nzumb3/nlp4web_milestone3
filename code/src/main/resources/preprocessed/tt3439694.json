{"title":"Revival!","plot":"REVIVAL is hybrid of every film idiom: Broadway musical, Hollywood musical, animation, green screen technology, and sound stage. In its meta-theatrical stylized bridging of the theater and the audience's everyday experiences, REVIVAL is a mixed media virtual experience of the gospel according to John the Apostle. The presentation of this timeless story is told by dramatizing supremely constructed gospel music that helps recount the mission, ministry and miracles of Jesus. REVIVAL is a concert film. Nothing close since JESUS CHRIST SUPERSTAR. ...and served up with a splash of THE WIZ. It is a gospel/funk fantasia that speaks to all throughout the world; either as a film or as a live-action musical. Every element is designed to deliver a clear, comprehensive, and compelling entertainment experience-from the vibrant wardrobe to the irresistible music; from the craft of acting and the gift of song and dance. An amazing an uniquely modern and authentic approach to the Christian narrative. Leading a world-class ensemble of excellent performers is Mali Music, who plays the central figure of Jesus in REVIVAL. Mali is a bona fide music star and verifiable musical genius. He is also one the chief composers of the film's score, and will amaze a new generation with his refreshing and profound interpretation of The Scriptures. Collaborating in this effort with Mali is Abdul Hamid Royal, an exhaustively accomplished musician and Broadway music director.","genres":["Musical"],"stems":["REVIVAL","is","hybrid","of","everi","film","idiom",":","Broadway","music",",","Hollywood","music",",","anim",",","green","screen","technolog",",","and","sound","stage",".","In","it","meta-theatr","styliz","bridg","of","the","theater","and","the","audienc","'s","everyday","experi",",","REVIVAL","is","a","mix","media","virtual","experi","of","the","gospel","accord","to","John","the","Apostl",".","The","present","of","this","timeless","stori","is","told","by","dramat","suprem","construct","gospel","music","that","help","recount","the","mission",",","ministri","and","miracl","of","Jesus",".","REVIVAL","is","a","concert","film",".","Noth","close","sinc","JESUS","CHRIST","SUPERSTAR",".","...","and","serv","up","with","a","splash","of","THE","WIZ",".","It","is","a","gospel/funk","fantasia","that","speak","to","all","throughout","the","world",";","either","as","a","film","or","as","a","live-act","music",".","Everi","element","is","design","to","deliv","a","clear",",","comprehens",",","and","compel","entertain","experience-from","the","vibrant","wardrob","to","the","irresist","music",";","from","the","craft","of","act","and","the","gift","of","song","and","danc",".","An","amaz","an","uniqu","modern","and","authent","approach","to","the","Christian","narrat",".","Lead","a","world-class","ensembl","of","excel","perform","is","Mali","Music",",","who","play","the","central","figur","of","Jesus","in","REVIVAL",".","Mali","is","a","bona","fide","music","star","and","verifi","music","genius",".","He","is","also","one","the","chief","compos","of","the","film","'s","score",",","and","will","amaz","a","new","generat","with","his","refresh","and","profound","interpret","of","The","Scriptur",".","Collabor","in","this","effort","with","Mali","is","Abdul","Hamid","Royal",",","an","exhaust","accomplish","musician","and","Broadway","music","director","."],"lemmas":["revival","be","hybrid","of","every","film","idiom",":","Broadway","musical",",","Hollywood","musical",",","animation",",","green","screen","technology",",","and","sound","stage",".","in","its","meta-theatrical","stylized","bridge","of","the","theater","and","the","audience","'s","everyday","experience",",","revival","be","a","mixed","media","virtual","experience","of","the","gospel","accord","to","John","the","Apostle",".","the","presentation","of","this","timeless","story","be","tell","by","dramatize","supremely","construct","gospel","music","that","help","recount","the","mission",",","ministry","and","miracle","of","Jesus",".","revival","be","a","concert","film",".","nothing","close","since","jesus","christ","superstar",".","...","and","serve","up","with","a","splash","of","the","wiz",".","it","be","a","gospel/funk","fantasia","that","speak","to","all","throughout","the","world",";","either","as","a","film","or","as","a","live-action","musical",".","every","element","be","design","to","deliver","a","clear",",","comprehensive",",","and","compelling","entertainment","experience-from","the","vibrant","wardrobe","to","the","irresistible","music",";","from","the","craft","of","acting","and","the","gift","of","song","and","dance",".","a","amazing","a","uniquely","modern","and","authentic","approach","to","the","christian","narrative",".","lead","a","world-class","ensemble","of","excellent","performer","be","Mali","Music",",","who","play","the","central","figure","of","Jesus","in","REVIVAL",".","Mali","be","a","bona","fide","music","star","and","verifiable","musical","genius",".","he","be","also","one","the","chief","composer","of","the","film","'s","score",",","and","will","amaze","a","new","generation","with","he","refreshing","and","profound","interpretation","of","the","Scriptures",".","collaborate","in","this","effort","with","Mali","be","Abdul","Hamid","Royal",",","a","exhaustively","accomplished","musician","and","Broadway","music","director","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["REVIVAL

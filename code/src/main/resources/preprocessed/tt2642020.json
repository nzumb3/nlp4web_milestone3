{"title":"Domestic Life","plot":"Juliette was simply not sure about coming to live in this residential suburb of the greater Paris metropolitan area. All the women here are in their forties, have children to raise, houses to keep and husbands who return home late at night. Today she has an appointment in Paris that is important for her career, but she also has to run errands and pick up the kids from school. During the course of her day, monopolized by petty, everyday tasks, Juliette can feel the noose of domestic obligations and household chores slowly tightening around her neck.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Juliett","was","simpli","not","sure","about","come","to","live","in","this","residenti","suburb","of","the","greater","Pari","metropolitan","area",".","All","the","women","here","are","in","their","forti",",","have","children","to","rais",",","hous","to","keep","and","husband","who","return","home","late","at","night",".","Today","she","has","an","appoint","in","Pari","that","is","import","for","her","career",",","but","she","also","has","to","run","errand","and","pick","up","the","kid","from","school",".","Dure","the","cours","of","her","day",",","monopol","by","petti",",","everyday","task",",","Juliett","can","feel","the","noos","of","domest","oblig","and","household","chore","slowli","tighten","around","her","neck","."],"lemmas":["Juliette","be","simply","not","sure","about","come","to","live","in","this","residential","suburb","of","the","greater","Paris","metropolitan","area",".","all","the","woman","here","be","in","they","forty",",","have","child","to","raise",",","house","to","keep","and","husband","who","return","home","late","at","night",".","today","she","have","a","appointment","in","Paris","that","be","important","for","she","career",",","but","she","also","have","to","run","errand","and","pick","up","the","kid","from","school",".","during","the","course","of","she","day",",","monopolize","by","petty",",","everyday","task",",","Juliette","can","feel","the","noose","of","domestic","obligation","and","household","chore","slowly","tighten","around","she","neck","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Juliette was simply","was simply not","simply not sure","not sure about","sure about coming","about coming to","coming to live","to live in","live in this","in this residential","this residential suburb","residential suburb of","suburb of the","of the greater","the greater Paris","greater Paris metropolitan","Paris metropolitan area","All the women","the women here","women here are","here are in","are in their","in their forties","their forties ,","forties , have",", have children","have children to","children to raise","to raise ,","raise , houses",", houses to","houses to keep","to keep and","keep and husbands","and husbands who","husbands who return","who return home","return home late","home late at","late at night","Today she has","she has an","has an appointment","an appointment in","appointment in Paris","in Paris that","Paris that is","that is important","is important for","important for her","for her career","her career ,","career , but",", but she","but she also","she also has","also has to","has to run","to run errands","run errands and","errands and pick","and pick up","pick up the","up the kids","the kids from","kids from school","During the course","the course of","course of her","of her day","her day ,","day , monopolized",", monopolized by","monopolized by petty","by petty ,","petty , everyday",", everyday tasks","everyday tasks ,","tasks , Juliette",", Juliette can","Juliette can feel","can feel the","feel the noose","the noose of","noose of domestic","of domestic obligations","domestic obligations and","obligations and household","and household chores","household chores slowly","chores slowly tightening","slowly tightening around","tightening around her","around her neck"],"2grams":["Juliette was","was simply","simply not","not sure","sure about","about coming","coming to","to live","live in","in this","this residential","residential suburb","suburb of","of the","the greater","greater Paris","Paris metropolitan","metropolitan area","All the","the women","women here","here are","are in","in their","their forties","forties ,",", have","have children","children to","to raise","raise ,",", houses","houses to","to keep","keep and","and husbands","husbands who","who return","return home","home late","late at","at night","Today she","she has","has an","an appointment","appointment in","in Paris","Paris that","that is","is important","important for","for her","her career","career ,",", but","but she","she also","also has","has to","to run","run errands","errands and","and pick","pick up","up the","the kids","kids from","from school","During the","the course","course of","of her","her day","day ,",", monopolized","monopolized by","by petty","petty ,",", everyday","everyday tasks","tasks ,",", Juliette","Juliette can","can feel","feel the","the noose","noose of","of domestic","domestic obligations","obligations and","and household","household chores","chores slowly","slowly tightening","tightening around","around her","her neck"]}

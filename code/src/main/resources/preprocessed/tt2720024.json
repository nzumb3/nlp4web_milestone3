{"title":"Journey 4 Artists","plot":"In this documentary, world music serves as a catalyst for four artists: Oscar nominated actor/activist/folksinger Theodore Bikel, Shura Lipovsky, Merima Kljuco, Tamara Brooks, who come from Jewish and Muslim cultures to share their extraordinary passion and purpose which is to make music that transcends the discordance of the ordinary world. It is an authentic, poignant and sometimes difficult exploration of the human spirit through an artful blend of music, personal narrative and visual history, all of which demonstrates how far we all have come while encouraging us to continue our movement forward.","genres":["Biography"," History","

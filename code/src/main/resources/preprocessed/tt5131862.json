{"title":"Sculpting in Colour","plot":"A film about Phillip King one of Britain's greatest though not necessarily best known sculptors as he creates new works in his ramshackle studio in West Hampstead, London and then exhibits them at Tate Britain, The Royal Academy and Kistefos sculpture park in Norway. It also looks back at his iconic sculptures from the sixties and beyond in private gallery shows in London and at the Tate and observes him as he reflects upon sculpture and life from the viewpoint of an eighty year old man suddenly facing cancer but also determined to carry on working to the fullest of his abilities. This is a moving and powerful film about an ageing artist of great repute fighting to stay relevant in the contemporary era and create powerful, colourful sculptures on an industrial scale.","genres":["Biography","

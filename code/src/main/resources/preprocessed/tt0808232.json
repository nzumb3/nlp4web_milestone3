{"title":"A Dog Year","plot":"Jon Katz is close to burnout. He's a writer with writer's block; his wife has left for her sister's because he's emotionally distant; he rarely answers his phone. A kennel sends him a border collie that's undisciplined because of abuse. Despite a series of mishaps, Jon decides to keep trying with the dog, and he rents a dilapidated farm house to give the dog room to run. A local handyman refers Jon to a woman who might be able to help him train the dog. Reluctantly, Jon gives her a try. Is the dog the problem, or the owner?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Jon","Katz","is","close","to","burnout",".","He","'s","a","writer","with","writer","'s","block",";","his","wife","has","left","for","her","sister","'s","becaus","he","'s","emot","distant",";","he","rare","answer","his","phone",".","A","kennel","send","him","a","border","colli","that","'s","undisciplin","becaus","of","abus",".","Despit","a","seri","of","mishap",",","Jon","decid","to","keep","tri","with","the","dog",",","and","he","rent","a","dilapid","farm","hous","to","give","the","dog","room","to","run",".","A","local","handyman","refer","Jon","to","a","woman","who","might","be","abl","to","help","him","train","the","dog",".","Reluct",",","Jon","give","her","a","tri",".","Is","the","dog","the","problem",",","or","the","owner","?"],"lemmas":["Jon","Katz","be","close","to","burnout",".","he","be","a","writer","with","writer","'s","block",";","he","wife","have","leave","for","she","sister","'s","because","he","be","emotionally","distant",";","he","rarely","answer","he","phone",".","a","kennel","send","he","a","border","collie","that","be","undisciplined","because","of","abuse",".","despite","a","series","of","mishap",",","Jon","decide","to","keep","try","with","the","dog",",","and","he","rent","a","dilapidated","farm","house","to","give","the","dog","room","to","run",".","a","local","handyman","refer","Jon","to","a","woman","who","might","be","able","to","help","he","train","the","dog",".","reluctantly",",","Jon","give","she","a","try",".","be","the","dog","the","problem",",","or","the","owner","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jon Katz is","Katz is close","is close to","close to burnout","He 's a","'s a writer","a writer with","writer with writer","with writer 's","writer 's block","'s block ;","block ; his","; his wife","his wife has","wife has left","has left for","left for her","for her sister","her sister 's","sister 's because","'s because he","because he 's","he 's emotionally","'s emotionally distant","emotionally distant ;","distant ; he","; he rarely","he rarely answers","rarely answers his","answers his phone","A kennel sends","kennel sends him","sends him a","him a border","a border collie","border collie that","collie that 's","that 's undisciplined","'s undisciplined because","undisciplined because of","because of abuse","Despite a series","a series of","series of mishaps","of mishaps ,","mishaps , Jon",", Jon decides","Jon decides to","decides to keep","to keep trying","keep trying with","trying with the","with the dog","the dog ,","dog , and",", and he","and he rents","he rents a","rents a dilapidated","a dilapidated farm","dilapidated farm house","farm house to","house to give","to give the","give the dog","the dog room","dog room to","room to run","A local handyman","local handyman refers","handyman refers Jon","refers Jon to","Jon to a","to a woman","a woman who","woman who might","who might be","might be able","be able to","able to help","to help him","help him train","him train the","train the dog","Reluctantly , Jon",", Jon gives","Jon gives her","gives her a","her a try","Is the dog","the dog the","dog the problem","the problem ,","problem , or",", or the","or the owner"],"2grams":["Jon Katz","Katz is","is close","close to","to burnout","He 's","'s a","a writer","writer with","with writer","writer 's","'s block","block ;","; his","his wife","wife has","has left","left for","for her","her sister","sister 's","'s because","because he","he 's","'s emotionally","emotionally distant","distant ;","; he","he rarely","rarely answers","answers his","his phone","A kennel","kennel sends","sends him","him a","a border","border collie","collie that","that 's","'s undisciplined","undisciplined because","because of","of abuse","Despite a","a series","series of","of mishaps","mishaps ,",", Jon","Jon decides","decides to","to keep","keep trying","trying with","with the","the dog","dog ,",", and","and he","he rents","rents a","a dilapidated","dilapidated farm","farm house","house to","to give","give the","the dog","dog room","room to","to run","A local","local handyman","handyman refers","refers Jon","Jon to","to a","a woman","woman who","who might","might be","be able","able to","to help","help him","him train","train the","the dog","Reluctantly ,",", Jon","Jon gives","gives her","her a","a try","Is the","the dog","dog the","the problem","problem ,",", or","or the","the owner"]}

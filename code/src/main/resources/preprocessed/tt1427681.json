{"title":"Duhovi Zagreba","plot":"This documentary is a parallel journey through the streets of modern Zagreb and a generation's memories of its citizens whose faith and lives was determined by World War II. Five people, who grew up in Zagreb before the World War II, were for different reasons led to become members of illegal anti-fascist movement. Walking through the streets of Zagreb they talk about their youthful experiences in Zagreb before the war, emotionally and with no ideological platitude. They describe that period as horrifying, terrible - but in the same time the most romantic period of their life. They face depression and disappointment, relive fears and review and summarize decisions they made. While listening to their stories, you can feel the presence of a hidden world of spirits that still remains in foyers and yards, on the stairs and in the passages of the now modern city. This documentary becomes a travelogue through old Zagreb, witch, just like the men who witnessed his history, disappears every day. In the world of actual historical controversy, we leave five people to tell you a story of their lives, without authors comment.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","is","a","parallel","journey","through","the","street","of","modern","Zagreb","and","a","generat","'s","memori","of","it","citizen","whose","faith","and","live","was","determin","by","World","War","II",".","Five","peopl",",","who","grew","up","in","Zagreb","befor","the","World","War","II",",","were","for","differ","reason","led","to","becom","member","of","illeg","anti-fascist","movement",".","Walk","through","the","street","of","Zagreb","they","talk","about","their","youth","experi","in","Zagreb","befor","the","war",",","emot","and","with","no","ideolog","platitud",".","They","describ","that","period","as","horrifi",",","terribl","-","but","in","the","same","time","the","most","romant","period","of","their","life",".","They","face","depress","and","disappoint",",","reliv","fear","and","review","and","summar","decis","they","made",".","While","listen","to","their","stori",",","you","can","feel","the","presenc","of","a","hidden","world","of","spirit","that","still","remain","in","foyer","and","yard",",","on","the","stair","and","in","the","passag","of","the","now","modern","citi",".","This","documentari","becom","a","travelogu","through","old","Zagreb",",","witch",",","just","like","the","men","who","wit","his","histori",",","disappear","everi","day",".","In","the","world","of","actual","histor","controversi",",","we","leav","five","peopl","to","tell","you","a","stori","of","their","live",",","without","author","comment","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","be","a","parallel","journey","through","the","street","of","modern","Zagreb","and","a","generation","'s","memory","of","its","citizen","whose","faith","and","life","be","determine","by","World","War","II",".","five","people",",","who","grow","up","in","Zagreb","before","the","World","War","II",",","be","for","different","reason","lead","to","become","member","of","illegal","anti-fascist","movement",".","walk","through","the","street","of","Zagreb","they","talk","about","they","youthful","experience","in","Zagreb","before","the","war",",","emotionally","and","with","no","ideological","platitude",".","they","describe","that","period","as","horrifying",",","terrible","-","but","in","the","same","time","the","most","romantic","period","of","they","life",".","they","face","depression","and","disappointment",",","relive","fear","and","review","and","summarize","decision","they","make",".","while","listen","to","they","story",",","you","can","feel","the","presence","of","a","hidden","world","of","spirit","that","still","remain","in","foyer","and","yard",",","on","the","stair","and","in","the","passage","of","the","now","modern","city",".","this","documentary","become","a","travelogue","through","old","Zagreb",",","witch",",","just","like","the","man","who","witness","he","history",",","disappear","every","day",".","in","the","world","of","actual","historical","controversy",",","we","leave","five","people","to","tell","you","a","story","of","they","life",",","without","author","comment","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary is","documentary is a","is a parallel","a parallel journey","parallel journey through","journey through the","through the streets","the streets of","streets of modern","of modern Zagreb","modern Zagreb and","Zagreb and a","and a generation","a generation 's","generation 's memories","'s memories of","memories of its","of its citizens","its citizens whose","citizens whose faith","whose faith and","faith and lives","and lives was","lives was determined","was determined by","determined by World","by World War","World War II","Five people ,","people , who",", who grew","who grew up","grew up in","up in Zagreb","in Zagreb before","Zagreb before the","before the World","the World War","World War II","War II ,","II , were",", were for","were for different","for different reasons","different reasons led","reasons led to","led to become","to become members","become members of","members of illegal","of illegal anti-fascist","illegal anti-fascist movement","Walking through the","through the streets","the streets of","streets of Zagreb","of Zagreb they","Zagreb they talk","they talk about","talk about their","about their youthful","their youthful experiences","youthful experiences in","experiences in Zagreb","in Zagreb before","Zagreb before the","before the war","the war ,","war , emotionally",", emotionally and","emotionally and with","and with no","with no ideological","no ideological platitude","They describe that","describe that period","that period as","period as horrifying","as horrifying ,","horrifying , terrible",", terrible -","terrible -

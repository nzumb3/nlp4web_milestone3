{"title":"Rome Remembers: World War II","plot":"It's been more than 60 years since the United States sent millions of its sons to fight the Nazis and the Japanese in World War II. The war impacted this nation in many ways, but so many of the stories of those who fought or helped fight it are being lost. Some were told to family and friends, some were told only once or twice and some may never have been told at all. In May 2009, the Rome News-Tribune and rn-t.com launched a seven-part series chronicling our local veterans' time in World War II, from when they entered the service and the fighting to when they left it and what happened to them after the war. Rome Remembers: World War II is the seven chapters of that story packaged into one thrilling and dramatic documentary. Archival film from the National Archives and photos pulled from the digital vaults of the Associated Press help to tell the veterans' stories of friendship, triumph and tribulation. Their enemy was daunting, their challenge seemingly insurmountable and the lessons they learned along the way are timeless. With veterans of the Greatest War dying at a rate of over 1,000 a day, there is no better time then now to hear their story.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","'s","been","more","than","60","year","sinc","the","Unite","State","sent","million","of","it","son","to","fight","the","Nazi","and","the","Japanes","in","World","War","II",".","The","war","impact","this","nation","in","mani","way",",","but","so","mani","of","the","stori","of","those","who","fought","or","help","fight","it","are","be","lost",".","Some","were","told","to","famili","and","friend",",","some","were","told","onli","onc","or","twice","and","some","may","never","have","been","told","at","all",".","In","May","2009",",","the","Rome","News-Tribun","and","rn-t",".","com","launch","a","seven-part","seri","chronicl","our","local","veteran","'","time","in","World","War","II",",","from","when","they","enter","the","servic","and","the","fight","to","when","they","left","it","and","what","happen","to","them","after","the","war",".","Rome","Rememb",":","World","War","II","is","the","seven","chapter","of","that","stori","packag","into","one","thrill","and","dramat","documentari",".","Archival","film","from","the","Nation","Archive","and","photo","pull","from","the","digit","vault","of","the","Associat","Press","help","to","tell","the","veteran","'","stori","of","friendship",",","triumph","and","tribul",".","Their","enemi","was","daunt",",","their","challeng","seem","insurmount","and","the","lesson","they","learn","along","the","way","are","timeless",".","With","veteran","of","the","Greatest","War","die","at","a","rate","of","over","1,000","a","day",",","there","is","no","better","time","then","now","to","hear","their","stori","."],"lemmas":["it","be","be","more","than","60","year","since","the","United","States","send","million","of","its","son","to","fight","the","Nazis","and","the","Japanese","in","World","War","II",".","the","war","impact","this","nation","in","many","way",",","but","so","many","of","the","story","of","those","who","fight","or","help","fight","it","be","be","lose",".","some","be","tell","to","family","and","friend",",","some","be","tell","only","once","or","twice","and","some","may","never","have","be","tell","at","all",".","in","May","2009",",","the","Rome","News-Tribune","and","rn-t",".","com","launch","a","seven-part","series","chronicle","we","local","veteran","'","time","in","World","War","II",",","from","when","they","enter","the","service","and","the","fighting","to","when","they","leave","it","and","what","happen","to","they","after","the","war",".","Rome","Remembers",":","World","War","II","be","the","seven","chapter","of","that","story","package","into","one","thrilling","and","dramatic","documentary",".","archival","film","from","the","National","Archives","and","photo","pull","from","the","digital","vault","of","the","Associated","Press","help","to","tell","the","veteran","'","story","of","friendship",",","triumph","and","tribulation",".","they","enemy","be","daunting",",","they","challenge","seemingly","insurmountable","and","the","lesson","they","learn","along","the","way","be","timeless",".","with","veteran","of","the","Greatest","War","die","at","a","rate","of","over","1,000","a","day",",","there","be","no","better","time","then","now","to","hear","they","story","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["It

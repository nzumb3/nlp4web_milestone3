{"title":"Tar-San","plot":"Taking their being fallen from the sky as the gods' omen, the babies christened as Tar (Redford White) and San (Carding Castro) are declared heir to the chieftainship of the Agatao tribe. The tribe looks forward to Tar and San's succession, for both are amiable and magnanimous to them; but since the chieftain's evil nephew Sabukot (Sammy Lagmay) also stakes his claim on the throne, the Agatao chieftainship becomes a prize the claimants have to win. Adventuress Jessie (Bernadette Allyson) and her team enter the scene, declaring Tar and San to be the long-estranged grandsons of rich philanthropist Gerardo Elizondo (Jaime Fabregas). Tar and San are taken to the city to learn the ways of the place they are meant to belong, but no matter how hard they try to adapt, the two cannot resist the call of the wild. It turns out the Agataos are actually calling out to them, however, for an unforeseen misfortune is threatening to wipe the entire tribe out.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Take","their","be","fallen","from","the","sky","as","the","god","'","omen",",","the","babi","christen","as","Tar","(","Redford","White",")","and","San","(","Card","Castro",")","are","declar","heir","to","the","chieftainship","of","the","Agatao","tribe",".","The","tribe","look","forward","to","Tar","and","San","'s","success",",","for","both","are","amiabl","and","magnanim","to","them",";","but","sinc","the","chieftain","'s","evil","nephew","Sabukot","(","Sammi","Lagmay",")","also","stake","his","claim","on","the","throne",",","the","Agatao","chieftainship","becom","a","prize","the","claimant","have","to","win",".","Adventuress","Jessi","(","Bernadett","Allyson",")","and","her","team","enter","the","scene",",","declar","Tar","and","San","to","be","the","long-estrang","grandson","of","rich","philanthropist","Gerardo","Elizondo","(","Jaim","Fabrega",")",".","Tar","and","San","are","taken","to","the","citi","to","learn","the","way","of","the","place","they","are","meant","to","belong",",","but","no","matter","how","hard","they","tri","to","adapt",",","the","two","can","not","resist","the","call","of","the","wild",".","It","turn","out","the","Agatao","are","actual","call","out","to","them",",","howev",",","for","an","unforeseen","misfortun","is","threaten","to","wipe","the","entir","tribe","out","."],"lemmas":["take","they","be","fall","from","the","sky","as","the","god","'","omen",",","the","baby","christen","as","tar","-lrb-","Redford","White","-rrb-","and","San","-lrb-","Carding","Castro","-rrb-","be","declare","heir","to","the","chieftainship","of","the","Agatao","tribe",".","the","tribe","look","forward","to","Tar","and","San","'s","succession",",","for","both","be","amiable","and","magnanimous","to","they",";","but","since","the","chieftain","'s","evil","nephew","Sabukot","-lrb-","Sammy","Lagmay","-rrb-","also","stake","he","claim","on","the","throne",",","the","Agatao","chieftainship","become","a","prize","the","claimant","have","to","win",".","Adventuress","Jessie","-lrb-","Bernadette","Allyson","-rrb-","and","she","team","enter","the","scene",",","declare","Tar","and","San","to","be","the","long-estranged","grandson","of","rich","philanthropist","Gerardo","Elizondo","-lrb-","Jaime","Fabregas","-rrb-",".","tar","and","San","be","take","to","the","city","to","learn","the","way","of","the","place","they","be","mean","to","belong",",","but","no","matter","how","hard","they","try","to","adapt",",","the","two","can","not","resist","the","call","of","the","wild",".","it","turn","out","the","Agataos","be","actually","call","out","to","they",",","however",",","for","a","unforeseen","misfortune","be","threaten","to","wipe","the","entire","tribe","out","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Taking their being","their being fallen","being fallen from","fallen from the","from the sky","the sky as","sky as the","as the gods","the gods '","gods ' omen","' omen ,","omen , the",", the babies","the babies christened","babies christened as","christened as Tar","as Tar (","Tar ( Redford","( Redford White","Redford White )","White ) and",") and San","and San (","San ( Carding","( Carding Castro","Carding Castro )","Castro ) are",") are declared","are declared heir","declared heir to","heir to the","to the chieftainship","the chieftainship of","chieftainship of the","of the Agatao","the Agatao tribe","The tribe looks","tribe looks forward","looks forward to","forward to Tar","to Tar and","Tar and San","and San 's","San 's succession","'s succession ,","succession , for",", for both","for both are","both are amiable","are amiable and","amiable and magnanimous","and magnanimous to","magnanimous to them","to them ;","them ;

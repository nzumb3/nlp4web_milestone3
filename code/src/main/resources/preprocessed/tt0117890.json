{"title":"They Teach Us How to Be Happy","plot":"It starts with insults, discrimination at work, harassment by the police. When stalkers sent by the government go from threats to assault, one must seek safety in a faraway country. The film documents the experiences of several Sudanese refugees arriving in Switzerland during the 1990s: fastidious transfers from one shelter to another; repetitive hearings with the commissions in charge of asylum seekers; account settlements with the social services that are as incomprehensible as they are meticulous; and the laborious integration in a different society, even when all parties go about it with a lot of goodwill. The refugees are just asking for safety; but the Swiss authorities demand a weighty counterpart to that plea.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","start","with","insult",",","discrimin","at","work",",","harass","by","the","polic",".","When","stalker","sent","by","the","govern","go","from","threat","to","assault",",","one","must","seek","safeti","in","a","faraway","countri",".","The","film","document","the","experi","of","sever","Sudanes","refuge","arriv","in","Switzerland","dure","the","1990s",":","fastidi","transfer","from","one","shelter","to","anoth",";","repetit","hear","with","the","commiss","in","charg","of","asylum","seeker",";","account","settlement","with","the","social","servic","that","are","as","incomprehens","as","they","are","meticul",";","and","the","labori","integr","in","a","differ","societi",",","even","when","all","parti","go","about","it","with","a","lot","of","goodwil",".","The","refuge","are","just","ask","for","safeti",";","but","the","Swiss","author","demand","a","weighti","counterpart","to","that","plea","."],"lemmas":["it","start","with","insult",",","discrimination","at","work",",","harassment","by","the","police",".","when","stalker","send","by","the","government","go","from","threat","to","assault",",","one","must","seek","safety","in","a","faraway","country",".","the","film","document","the","experience","of","several","sudanese","refugee","arrive","in","Switzerland","during","the","1990s",":","fastidious","transfer","from","one","shelter","to","another",";","repetitive","hearing","with","the","commission","in","charge","of","asylum","seeker",";","account","settlement","with","the","social","service","that","be","as","incomprehensible","as","they","be","meticulous",";","and","the","laborious","integration","in","a","different","society",",","even","when","all","party","go","about","it","with","a","lot","of","goodwill",".","the","refugee","be","just","ask","for","safety",";","but","the","swiss","authority","demand","a","weighty","counterpart","to","that","plea","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["It starts with","starts with insults","with insults ,","insults , discrimination",", discrimination at","discrimination at work","at work ,","work , harassment",", harassment by","harassment by the","by the police","When stalkers sent","stalkers sent by","sent by the","by the government","the government go","government go from","go from threats","from threats to","threats to assault","to assault ,","assault , one",", one must","one must seek","must seek safety","seek safety in","safety in a","in a faraway","a faraway country","The film documents","film documents the","documents the experiences","the experiences of","experiences of several","of several Sudanese","several Sudanese refugees","Sudanese refugees arriving","refugees arriving in","arriving in Switzerland","in Switzerland during","Switzerland during the","during the 1990s","the 1990s :","1990s : fastidious",": fastidious transfers","fastidious transfers from","transfers from one","from one shelter","one shelter to","shelter to another","to another ;","another ;

{"title":"Habap Fountains: The Story of a Restoration","plot":"This documentary follows the story of the restoration of two fountains in eastern Anatolia (Turkey) built by Armenians hundreds of years ago. After the local Armenians residing in the area were mostly sent away at the beginning of 20th century, these fountains were destroyed by the new residents of the area in time due to the gold digging and certain state policies. In the framework of a social responsibility project, Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish people work together to renovate the fountains and make the water run again. This project started by Fethiye Çetin, who tells the story of her Armenian Grandmother in her famous book My Grandmother, and the film follows her narration and conversation with people from the village in parallel to the process of renovation.","genres":["Biography","

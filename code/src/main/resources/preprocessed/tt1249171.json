{"title":"Global Metal","plot":"In GLOBAL METAL, directors Scot McFadyen and Sam Dunn set out to discover how the West's most maligned musical genre - heavy metal - has impacted the world's cultures beyond Europe and North America. The film follows metal fan and anthropologist Sam Dunn on a whirlwind journey through Asia, South America and the Middle East as he explores the underbelly of the world's emerging extreme music scenes; from Indonesian death metal to Chinese black metal to Iranian thrash metal. GLOBAL METAL reveals a worldwide community of metalheads who aren't just absorbing metal from the West - they're transforming it - creating a new form of cultural expression in societies dominated by conflict, corruption and mass-consumerism.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["In","GLOBAL","METAL",",","director","Scot","McFadyen","and","Sam","Dunn","set","out","to","discov","how","the","West","'s","most","malign","music","genr","-","heavi","metal","-","has","impact","the","world","'s","cultur","beyond","Europ","and","North","America",".","The","film","follow","metal","fan","and","anthropologist","Sam","Dunn","on","a","whirlwind","journey","through","Asia",",","South","America","and","the","Middl","East","as","he","explor","the","underbelli","of","the","world","'s","emerg","extrem","music","scene",";","from","Indonesian","death","metal","to","Chines","black","metal","to","Iranian","thrash","metal",".","GLOBAL","METAL","reveal","a","worldwid","communiti","of","metalhead","who","are","n't","just","absorb","metal","from","the","West","-","they","re","transform","it","-","creat","a","new","form","of","cultur","express","in","societi","domin","by","conflict",",","corrupt","and","mass-consumer","."],"lemmas":["in","GLOBAL","METAL",",","director","Scot","McFadyen","and","Sam","Dunn","set","out","to","discover","how","the","West","'s","most","maligned","musical","genre","-","heavy","metal","-","have","impact","the","world","'s","culture","beyond","Europe","and","North","America",".","the","film","follow","metal","fan","and","anthropologist","Sam","Dunn","on","a","whirlwind","journey","through","Asia",",","South","America","and","the","Middle","East","as","he","explore","the","underbelly","of","the","world","'s","emerge","extreme","music","scene",";","from","indonesian","death","metal","to","chinese","black","metal","to","Iranian","thrash","metal",".","global","metal","reveal","a","worldwide","community","of","metalhead","who","be","not","just","absorb","metal","from","the","West","-","they","be","transform","it","-","create","a","new","form","of","cultural","expression","in","society","dominate","by","conflict",",","corruption","and","mass-consumerism","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In GLOBAL METAL","GLOBAL METAL ,","METAL , directors",", directors Scot","directors Scot McFadyen","Scot McFadyen and","McFadyen and Sam","and Sam Dunn","Sam Dunn set","Dunn set out","set out to","out to discover","to discover how","discover how the","how the West","the West 's","West 's most","'s most maligned","most maligned musical","maligned musical genre","musical genre -","genre - heavy","- heavy metal","heavy metal -","metal - has","- has impacted","has impacted the","impacted the world","the world 's","world 's cultures","'s cultures beyond","cultures beyond Europe","beyond Europe and","Europe and North","and North America","The film follows","film follows metal","follows metal fan","metal fan and","fan and anthropologist","and anthropologist Sam","anthropologist Sam Dunn","Sam Dunn on","Dunn on a","on a whirlwind","a whirlwind journey","whirlwind journey through","journey through Asia","through Asia ,","Asia , South",", South America","South America and","America and the","and the Middle","the Middle East","Middle East as","East as he","as he explores","he explores the","explores the underbelly","the underbelly of","underbelly of the","of the world","the world 's","world 's emerging","'s emerging extreme","emerging extreme music","extreme music scenes","music scenes ;","scenes ;

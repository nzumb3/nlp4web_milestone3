{"title":"Hey Monster, Hands Off My City","plot":"SFPD homicide detectives find half eaten bodies turning up all over San Francisco. The Monster, (Jorge Scott), pursued by a mute gunman on a unicycle (Meehan), causes panic in the city, but well armed seniors,(Valerie Meehan, Roberta Borgonovo, Pat Hunter, Jeannie McMillan ) lock and load to nail this menace. The mayor,(Kevin Meaney) and the police chief(Michael Pritchard) don't seem too concerned, as they have been paid off by nefarious Krazy Kola executives, Dan Spencer & James Svatko), and aided by murderous fixer Nakamura (James Van Harper), who are marketing a dangerous new beverage that causes people to \"sell their eyes for it\". 13 year old Urban Ranger,(James Schmalz) sent out by his troop leader,(Christopher Meehan) to get his \"Golden Scat\" badge, finds and befriends the Monster after he is wounded by the mute hunter. The hunter is then distracted by the luscious acrobat(Dwoira Galilea), who questions his motives.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror","

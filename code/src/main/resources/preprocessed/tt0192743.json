{"title":"O Viajante","plot":"Fortune takes four human beings to the last frontier of passion. There, where love becomes almost inhuman and divine. As if he was a comet, Rafael, the traveler, appears at the party for the cities patron saint, in a small town in the interior of Minas Gerais. He is the one who brings passion and crime, vanishing afterwards, leaving a poetic feeling in the air, which is always deadly to the ones who stay. Mrs. Ana de Lara, the proud rich widow, and Missy, still a child, whose beauty and innocence are like the Tiê-Sangue, a red bird, are the travelers victims. There is also Master Juca do Vale, a criminal, whose passion turns him incredibly human, in this story of love, death, forgiveness and resurrection.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Fortun","take","four","human","be","to","the","last","frontier","of","passion",".","There",",","where","love","becom","almost","inhuman","and","divin",".","As","if","he","was","a","comet",",","Rafael",",","the","travel",",","appear","at","the","parti","for","the","citi","patron","saint",",","in","a","small","town","in","the","interior","of","Mina","Gerai",".","He","is","the","one","who","bring","passion","and","crime",",","vanish","afterward",",","leav","a","poetic","feel","in","the","air",",","which","is","alway","dead","to","the","one","who","stay",".","Mrs.","Ana","de","Lara",",","the","proud","rich","widow",",","and","Missi",",","still","a","child",",","whose","beauti","and","innoc","are","like","the","Tiê-Sangu",",","a","red","bird",",","are","the","travel","victim",".","There","is","also","Master","Juca","do","Vale",",","a","crimin",",","whose","passion","turn","him","incred","human",",","in","this","stori","of","love",",","death",",","forgiv","and","resurrect","."],"lemmas":["fortune","take","four","human","being","to","the","last","frontier","of","passion",".","there",",","where","love","become","almost","inhuman","and","divine",".","as","if","he","be","a","comet",",","Rafael",",","the","traveler",",","appear","at","the","party","for","the","city","patron","saint",",","in","a","small","town","in","the","interior","of","Minas","Gerais",".","he","be","the","one","who","bring","passion","and","crime",",","vanish","afterwards",",","leave","a","poetic","feeling","in","the","air",",","which","be","always","deadly","to","the","one","who","stay",".","Mrs.","Ana","de","Lara",",","the","proud","rich","widow",",","and","Missy",",","still","a","child",",","whose","beauty","and","innocence","be","like","the","Tiê-Sangue",",","a","red","bird",",","be","the","traveler","victim",".","there","be","also","master","juca","do","Vale",",","a","criminal",",","whose","passion","turn","he","incredibly","human",",","in","this","story","of","love",",","death",",","forgiveness","and","resurrection","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Fortune

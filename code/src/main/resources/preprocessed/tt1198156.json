{"title":"You're Not You","plot":"Kate is a classical pianist just diagnosed with ALS. Bec is a brash college student and would-be rock singer who can barely keep her wildly chaotic affairs, romantic and otherwise, together. Yet, when Bec takes a job assisting Kate, just as Kate's marriage to Evan hits the skids, both women come to rely on what becomes an unconventional, sometimes confrontational and fiercely honest bond. As meticulous, willful Kate begins to rub off on whirlwind, spontaneous Bec - and vice versa - both women find themselves facing down regrets, exploring new territory and expanding their ideas of who they want to be.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Kate","is","a","classic","pianist","just","diagnos","with","ALS",".","Bec","is","a","brash","colleg","student","and","would-b","rock","singer","who","can","bare","keep","her","wild","chaotic","affair",",","romant","and","otherwis",",","togeth",".","Yet",",","when","Bec","take","a","job","assist","Kate",",","just","as","Kate","'s","marriag","to","Evan","hit","the","skid",",","both","women","come","to","reli","on","what","becom","an","unconvent",",","sometim","confront","and","fierc","honest","bond",".","As","meticul",",","will","Kate","begin","to","rub","off","on","whirlwind",",","spontan","Bec","-","and","vice","versa","-","both","women","find","themselv","face","down","regret",",","explor","new","territori","and","expand","their","idea","of","who","they","want","to","be","."],"lemmas":["Kate","be","a","classical","pianist","just","diagnose","with","als",".","Bec","be","a","brash","college","student","and","would-be","rock","singer","who","can","barely","keep","she","wildly","chaotic","affair",",","romantic","and","otherwise",",","together",".","yet",",","when","Bec","take","a","job","assist","Kate",",","just","as","Kate","'s","marriage","to","Evan","hit","the","skid",",","both","woman","come","to","rely","on","what","become","a","unconventional",",","sometimes","confrontational","and","fiercely","honest","bond",".","as","meticulous",",","willful","Kate","begin","to","rub","off","on","whirlwind",",","spontaneous","Bec","-","and","vice","versa","-","both","woman","find","themselves","face","down","regret",",","explore","new","territory","and","expand","they","idea","of","who","they","want","to","be","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Kate is a","is a classical","a classical pianist","classical pianist just","pianist just diagnosed","just diagnosed with","diagnosed with ALS","Bec is a","is a brash","a brash college","brash college student","college student and","student and would-be","and would-be rock","would-be rock singer","rock singer who","singer who can","who can barely","can barely keep","barely keep her","keep her wildly","her wildly chaotic","wildly chaotic affairs","chaotic affairs ,","affairs , romantic",", romantic and","romantic and otherwise","and otherwise ,","otherwise , together","Yet , when",", when Bec","when Bec takes","Bec takes a","takes a job","a job assisting","job assisting Kate","assisting Kate ,","Kate , just",", just as","just as Kate","as Kate 's","Kate 's marriage","'s marriage to","marriage to Evan","to Evan hits","Evan hits the","hits the skids","the skids ,","skids , both",", both women","both women come","women come to","come to rely","to rely on","rely on what","on what becomes","what becomes an","becomes an unconventional","an unconventional ,","unconventional , sometimes",", sometimes confrontational","sometimes confrontational and","confrontational and fiercely","and fiercely honest","fiercely honest bond","As meticulous ,","meticulous , willful",", willful Kate","willful Kate begins","Kate begins to","begins to rub","to rub off","rub off on","off on whirlwind","on whirlwind ,","whirlwind , spontaneous",", spontaneous Bec","spontaneous Bec -","Bec -

{"title":"The Voice of a Condor","plot":"Christian population in the Holy Land is now down to only 2%. Due to political instability and poverty, Christian Palestinians have been immigrating since the 19 century to the Americas and especially to Chile. Today, Chile has the largest Palestinian diaspora outside of the Middle East. This documentary features the voice of the Christian Palestinian diaspora in Chile. It is a voice which strongly brings the Palestinian Christian population back to the political map of Palestine/Israel.","genres":["History"],"stems":["Christian","popul","in","the","Holi","Land","is","now","down","to","onli","2","%",".","Due","to","polit","instabl","and","poverti",",","Christian","Palestinian","have","been","immigr","sinc","the","19","centuri","to","the","America","and","especi","to","Chile",".","Today",",","Chile","has","the","largest","Palestinian","diaspora","outsid","of","the","Middl","East",".","This","documentari","featur","the","voic","of","the","Christian","Palestinian","diaspora","in","Chile",".","It","is","a","voic","which","strong","bring","the","Palestinian","Christian","popul","back","to","the","polit","map","of","Palestine/Israel","."],"lemmas":["christian","population","in","the","Holy","Land","be","now","down","to","only","2","%",".","due","to","political","instability","and","poverty",",","Christian","Palestinians","have","be","immigrate","since","the","19","century","to","the","Americas","and","especially","to","Chile",".","today",",","Chile","have","the","largest","palestinian","diaspora","outside","of","the","Middle","East",".","this","documentary","feature","the","voice","of","the","christian","palestinian","diaspora","in","Chile",".","it","be","a","voice","which","strongly","bring","the","Palestinian","Christian","population","back","to","the","political","map","of","palestine/israel","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Christian population in","population in the","in the Holy","the Holy Land","Holy Land is","Land is now","is now down","now down to","down to only","to only 2","only 2 %","Due to political","to political instability","political instability and","instability and poverty","and poverty ,","poverty , Christian",", Christian Palestinians","Christian Palestinians have","Palestinians have been","have been immigrating","been immigrating since","immigrating since the","since the 19","the 19 century","19 century to","century to the","to the Americas","the Americas and","Americas and especially","and especially to","especially to Chile","Today , Chile",", Chile has","Chile has the","has the largest","the largest Palestinian","largest Palestinian diaspora","Palestinian diaspora outside","diaspora outside of","outside of the","of the Middle","the Middle East","This documentary features","documentary features the","features the voice","the voice of","voice of the","of the Christian","the Christian Palestinian","Christian Palestinian diaspora","Palestinian diaspora in","diaspora in Chile","It is a","is a voice","a voice which","voice which strongly","which strongly brings","strongly brings the","brings the Palestinian","the Palestinian Christian","Palestinian Christian population","Christian population back","population back to","back to the","to the political","the political map","political map of","map of Palestine/Israel"],"2grams":["Christian population","population in","in the","the Holy","Holy Land","Land is","is now","now down","down to","to only","only 2","2 %","Due to","to political","political instability","instability and","and poverty","poverty ,",", Christian","Christian Palestinians","Palestinians have","have been","been immigrating","immigrating since","since the","the 19","19 century","century to","to the","the Americas","Americas and","and especially","especially to","to Chile","Today ,",", Chile","Chile has","has the","the largest","largest Palestinian","Palestinian diaspora","diaspora outside","outside of","of the","the Middle","Middle East","This documentary","documentary features","features the","the voice","voice of","of the","the Christian","Christian Palestinian","Palestinian diaspora","diaspora in","in Chile","It is","is a","a voice","voice which","which strongly","strongly brings","brings the","the Palestinian","Palestinian Christian","Christian population","population back","back to","to the","the political","political map","map of","of Palestine/Israel"]}

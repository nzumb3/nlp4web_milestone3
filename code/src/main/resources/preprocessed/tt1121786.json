{"title":"Formosa Betrayed","plot":"In the early 1980s, an FBI Agent is assigned to investigate the murder of a respected professor. Through his investigation, he unearths a spider web of international secrets that has been thriving within college campuses across America for decades. His investigation takes him across the Pacific to the island nation of Taiwan, where with the help of the outspoken widow and an unlikely spy, he learns that the Professor's killing was not a random act, but a desperate move by a scandalous government intent on keeping its nefarious activities under wraps. Our detective soon finds himself on a collision course against the U.S. State Department, the Chinese Mafia, and the Nationalist Chinese Government - in a land where the truth is not what it seems and the only people he can trust, cannot be trusted at all. Inspired by actual events.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["In","the","earli","1980s",",","an","FBI","Agent","is","assign","to","investig","the","murder","of","a","respect","professor",".","Through","his","investig",",","he","unearth","a","spider","web","of","intern","secret","that","has","been","thrive","within","colleg","campus","across","America","for","decad",".","His","investig","take","him","across","the","Pacif","to","the","island","nation","of","Taiwan",",","where","with","the","help","of","the","outspoken","widow","and","an","unlik","spi",",","he","learn","that","the","Professor","'s","kill","was","not","a","random","act",",","but","a","desper","move","by","a","scandal","govern","intent","on","keep","it","nefari","activ","under","wrap",".","Our","detect","soon","find","himself","on","a","collis","cours","against","the","U.S.","State","Depart",",","the","Chines","Mafia",",","and","the","Nationalist","Chines","Govern","-","in","a","land","where","the","truth","is","not","what","it","seem","and","the","onli","peopl","he","can","trust",",","can","not","be","trust","at","all",".","Inspire","by","actual","event","."],"lemmas":["in","the","early","1980",",","a","FBI","Agent","be","assign","to","investigate","the","murder","of","a","respected","professor",".","through","he","investigation",",","he","unearth","a","spider","web","of","international","secret","that","have","be","thrive","within","college","campus","across","America","for","decade",".","he","investigation","take","he","across","the","Pacific","to","the","island","nation","of","Taiwan",",","where","with","the","help","of","the","outspoken","widow","and","a","unlikely","spy",",","he","learn","that","the","Professor","'s","killing","be","not","a","random","act",",","but","a","desperate","move","by","a","scandalous","government","intent","on","keep","its","nefarious","activity","under","wrap",".","we","detective","soon","find","himself","on","a","collision","course","against","the","U.S.","State","Department",",","the","Chinese","Mafia",",","and","the","nationalist","Chinese","Government","-","in","a","land","where","the","truth","be","not","what","it","seem","and","the","only","people","he","can","trust",",","can","not","be","trust","at","all",".","inspire","by","actual","event","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In the early","the early 1980s","early 1980s ,","1980s , an",", an FBI","an FBI Agent","FBI Agent is","Agent is assigned","is assigned to","assigned to investigate","to investigate the","investigate the murder","the murder of","murder of a","of a respected","a respected professor","Through his investigation","his investigation ,","investigation , he",", he unearths","he unearths a","unearths a spider","a spider web","spider web of","web of international","of international secrets","international secrets that","secrets that has","that has been","has been thriving","been thriving within","thriving within college","within college campuses","college campuses across","campuses across America","across America for","America for decades","His investigation takes","investigation takes him","takes him across","him across the","across the Pacific","the Pacific to","Pacific to the","to the island","the island nation","island nation of","nation of Taiwan","of Taiwan ,","Taiwan , where",", where with","where with the","with the help","the help of","help of the","of the outspoken","the outspoken widow","outspoken widow and","widow and an","and an unlikely","an unlikely spy","unlikely spy ,","spy , he",", he learns","he learns that","learns that the","that the Professor","the Professor 's","Professor 's killing","'s killing was","killing was not","was not a","not a random","a random act","random act ,","act , but",", but a","but a desperate","a desperate move","desperate move by","move by a","by a scandalous","a scandalous government","scandalous government intent","government intent on","intent on keeping","on keeping its","keeping its nefarious","its nefarious activities","nefarious activities under","activities under wraps","Our detective soon","detective soon finds","soon finds himself","finds himself on","himself on a","on a collision","a collision course","collision course against","course against the","against the U.S.","the U.S. State","U.S. State Department","State Department ,","Department , the",", the Chinese","the Chinese Mafia","Chinese Mafia ,","Mafia , and",", and the","and the Nationalist","the Nationalist Chinese","Nationalist Chinese Government","Chinese Government -","Government -

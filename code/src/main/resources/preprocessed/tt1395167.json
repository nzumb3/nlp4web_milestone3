{"title":"I cercatori di miraggi","plot":"This documentary explores two geographic and human trails going in opposite directions: the outward journey of some Italian independent volunteers to Africa, and the flow of African clandestine immigrants running in the reverse direction. Both paths are quests for hope. But, are they such different tracks? In both cases there is a search for hope. The formers follow the urge of enriching their lives making themselves useful to the most unfortunate; the latter are pushed by a compelling demand for survival, by the need to guarantee a minimum outliving to their families, by the pursuit of freedom or the necessity of medical assistance. The paradox is that to achieve a status in this 'artificial paradise' the Africans are requested to get rid of the 'peculiarity of their roots', which is exactly what the Italian volunteers went searching for in the ancient unspoilt 'old paradise'.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","explor","two","geograph","and","human","trail","go","in","opposit","direct",":","the","outward","journey","of","some","Italian","independ","volunt","to","Africa",",","and","the","flow","of","African","clandestin","immigr","run","in","the","revers","direct",".","Both","path","are","quest","for","hope",".","But",",","are","they","such","differ","track","?","In","both","case","there","is","a","search","for","hope",".","The","former","follow","the","urg","of","enrich","their","live","make","themselv","use","to","the","most","unfortun",";","the","latter","are","push","by","a","compel","demand","for","surviv",",","by","the","need","to","guarante","a","minimum","outliv","to","their","famili",",","by","the","pursuit","of","freedom","or","the","necess","of","medic","assist",".","The","paradox","is","that","to","achiev","a","status","in","this","'","artifici","paradis","'","the","African","are","request","to","get","rid","of","the","'","peculiar","of","their","root","'",",","which","is","exact","what","the","Italian","volunt","went","search","for","in","the","ancient","unspoilt","'","old","paradis","'","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","explore","two","geographic","and","human","trail","go","in","opposite","direction",":","the","outward","journey","of","some","italian","independent","volunteer","to","Africa",",","and","the","flow","of","african","clandestine","immigrant","run","in","the","reverse","direction",".","both","path","be","quest","for","hope",".","but",",","be","they","such","different","track","?","in","both","case","there","be","a","search","for","hope",".","the","former","follow","the","urge","of","enrich","they","life","make","themselves","useful","to","the","most","unfortunate",";","the","latter","be","push","by","a","compelling","demand","for","survival",",","by","the","need","to","guarantee","a","minimum","outlive","to","they","family",",","by","the","pursuit","of","freedom","or","the","necessity","of","medical","assistance",".","the","paradox","be","that","to","achieve","a","status","in","this","'","artificial","paradise","'","the","Africans","be","request","to","get","rid","of","the","'","peculiarity","of","they","root","'",",","which","be","exactly","what","the","italian","volunteer","go","search","for","in","the","ancient","unspoilt","'","old","paradise","'","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary explores","documentary explores two","explores two geographic","two geographic and","geographic and human","and human trails","human trails going","trails going in","going in opposite","in opposite directions","opposite directions :","directions : the",": the outward","the outward journey","outward journey of","journey of some","of some Italian","some Italian independent","Italian independent volunteers","independent volunteers to","volunteers to Africa","to Africa ,","Africa , and",", and the","and the flow","the flow of","flow of African","of African clandestine","African clandestine immigrants","clandestine immigrants running","immigrants running in","running in the","in the reverse","the reverse direction","Both paths are","paths are quests","are quests for","quests for hope","But , are",", are they","are they such","they such different","such different tracks","In both cases","both cases there","cases there is","there is a","is a search","a search for","search for hope","The formers follow","formers follow the","follow the urge","the urge of","urge of enriching","of enriching their","enriching their lives","their lives making","lives making themselves","making themselves useful","themselves useful to","useful to the","to the most","the most unfortunate","most unfortunate ;","unfortunate ;

{"title":"Oxygen","plot":"Professor Duhamel takes great but heartless interest in the rare case of a mutated, yet congenital long disease of shy 'good boy' Lucas, father Karl's pride, and his rebellious brother Tom, who decides to enjoy as much as possible his short-cut life with dubious buddy Jimmy. Lucas dies in a promising transplant, Tom finds an apparent soul-mate in older Xavier, on the same donor list. Over a few years, doomed passion with two girls, one of which is in a bubble on account of an uncontrolled infection, messes up their relationships and even Tom's will to live, while Jimmy spares no effort or victim for his buddy's chances.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Professor","Duhamel","take","great","but","heartless","interest","in","the","rare","case","of","a","mutat",",","yet","congenit","long","diseas","of","shi","'","good","boy","'","Luca",",","father","Karl","'s","pride",",","and","his","rebelli","brother","Tom",",","who","decid","to","enjoy","as","much","as","possibl","his","short-cut","life","with","dubious","buddi","Jimmi",".","Luca","die","in","a","promis","transplant",",","Tom","find","an","appar","soul-mat","in","older","Xavier",",","on","the","same","donor","list",".","Over","a","few","year",",","doom","passion","with","two","girl",",","one","of","which","is","in","a","bubbl","on","account","of","an","uncontrol","infect",",","mess","up","their","relationship","and","even","Tom","'s","will","to","live",",","while","Jimmi","spare","no","effort","or","victim","for","his","buddi","'s","chanc","."],"lemmas":["Professor","Duhamel","take","great","but","heartless","interest","in","the","rare","case","of","a","mutate",",","yet","congenital","long","disease","of","shy","'","good","boy","'","Lucas",",","father","Karl","'s","pride",",","and","he","rebellious","brother","Tom",",","who","decide","to","enjoy","as","much","as","possible","he","short-cut","life","with","dubious","buddy","Jimmy",".","Lucas","die","in","a","promising","transplant",",","Tom","find","a","apparent","soul-mate","in","older","Xavier",",","on","the","same","donor","list",".","over","a","few","year",",","doomed","passion","with","two","girl",",","one","of","which","be","in","a","bubble","on","account","of","a","uncontrolled","infection",",","mess","up","they","relationship","and","even","Tom","'s","will","to","live",",","while","Jimmy","spare","no","effort","or","victim","for","he","buddy","'s","chance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Professor

{"title":"Mile... Mile & a Half","plot":"In an epic snow year, five friends leave their daily lives behind to hike California's historic John Muir Trail, a 211-mile stretch from Yosemite to Mt. Whitney (the highest peak in the contiguous U.S.). Their goal - complete the journey in 25 days while capturing the amazing sights & sounds they encounter along the way. Inspired by their bond, humor, artistry & dedication, the group continues to grow: to include other artists, musicians & adventure seekers. Before they all reach the summit, hikers and viewers alike affirm the old adage - it's about the journey, not the destination. Mile... Mile & A Half is the feature-length documentary of that journey...","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","an","epic","snow","year",",","five","friend","leav","their","daili","live","behind","to","hike","California","'s","histor","John","Muir","Trail",",","a","211-mile","stretch","from","Yosemit","to","Mt.","Whitney","(","the","highest","peak","in","the","contigu","U.S.",")",".","Their","goal","-","complet","the","journey","in","25","day","while","captur","the","amaz","sight","&","sound","they","encount","along","the","way",".","Inspire","by","their","bond",",","humor",",","artistri","&","dedic",",","the","group","continu","to","grow",":","to","includ","other","artist",",","musician","&","adventur","seeker",".","Befor","they","all","reach","the","summit",",","hiker","and","viewer","alik","affirm","the","old","adag","-","it","'s","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destin",".","Mile","...","Mile","&","A","Half","is","the","feature-length","documentari","of","that","journey","..."],"lemmas":["in","a","epic","snow","year",",","five","friend","leave","they","daily","life","behind","to","hike","California","'s","historic","John","Muir","trail",",","a","211-mile","stretch","from","Yosemite","to","Mt.","Whitney","-lrb-","the","highest","peak","in","the","contiguous","U.S.","-rrb-",".","they","goal","-","complete","the","journey","in","25","day","while","capture","the","amazing","sight","&","sound","they","encounter","along","the","way",".","inspire","by","they","bond",",","humor",",","artistry","&","dedication",",","the","group","continue","to","grow",":","to","include","other","artist",",","musician","&","adventure","seeker",".","before","they","all","reach","the","summit",",","hiker","and","viewer","alike","affirm","the","old","adage","-","it","be","about","the","journey",",","not","the","destination",".","Mile","...","Mile","&","a","half","be","the","feature-length","documentary","of","that","journey","..."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In an epic","an epic snow","epic snow year","snow year ,","year , five",", five friends","five friends leave","friends leave their","leave their daily","their daily lives","daily lives behind","lives behind to","behind to hike","to hike California","hike California 's","California 's historic","'s historic John","historic John Muir","John Muir Trail","Muir Trail ,","Trail , a",", a 211-mile","a 211-mile stretch","211-mile stretch from","stretch from Yosemite","from Yosemite to","Yosemite to Mt.","to Mt.

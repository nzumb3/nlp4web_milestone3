{"title":"An Exile's Home in the Bronx","plot":"'An Exile's Home in the Bronx' documents the trials of Irish immigrants in New York as they cling to their only connection with their homeland, playing Gaelic Football - the national sport of Ireland - while in New York. They participate in the All-Ireland Championship for the 32 county teams in Ireland but also includes London and New York due to their strong Irish immigrants. While the documentary has sport at it's core, the focus is on these Irish immigrants, who are trying to make a life for themselves in New York, but they try to retain their connection with their homeland through sport.","genres":["Documentary"," Sport"],"stems":["'","An","Exile","'s","Home","in","the","Bronx","'","document","the","trial","of","Irish","immigr","in","New","York","as","they","cling","to","their","onli","connect","with","their","homeland",",","play","Gaelic","Footbal","-","the","nation","sport","of","Ireland","-","while","in","New","York",".","They","particip","in","the","All-Ireland","Championship","for","the","32","counti","team","in","Ireland","but","also","includ","London","and","New","York","due","to","their","strong","Irish","immigr",".","While","the","documentari","has","sport","at","it","'s","core",",","the","focus","is","on","these","Irish","immigr",",","who","are","tri","to","make","a","life","for","themselv","in","New","York",",","but","they","tri","to","retain","their","connect","with","their","homeland","through","sport","."],"lemmas":["'","a","exile","'s","home","in","the","Bronx","'","document","the","trial","of","irish","immigrant","in","New","York","as","they","cling","to","they","only","connection","with","they","homeland",",","play","gaelic","football","-","the","national","sport","of","Ireland","-","while","in","New","York",".","they","participate","in","the","All-Ireland","Championship","for","the","32","county","team","in","Ireland","but","also","include","London","and","New","York","due","to","they","strong","Irish","immigrant",".","while","the","documentary","have","sport","at","it","be","core",",","the","focus","be","on","these","irish","immigrant",",","who","be","try","to","make","a","life","for","themselves","in","New","York",",","but","they","try","to","retain","they","connection","with","they","homeland","through","sport","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' An Exile","An Exile 's","Exile 's Home","'s Home in","Home in the","in the Bronx","the Bronx '","Bronx ' documents","' documents the","documents the trials","the trials of","trials of Irish","of Irish immigrants","Irish immigrants in","immigrants in New","in New York","New York as","York as they","as they cling","they cling to","cling to their","to their only","their only connection","only connection with","connection with their","with their homeland","their homeland ,","homeland , playing",", playing Gaelic","playing Gaelic Football","Gaelic Football -","Football -

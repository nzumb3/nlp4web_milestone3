{"title":"Celluloid","plot":"Lloyd takes us straight into the heart of dysfunctional family life. Mum Dawn's (Janet Banford) struggle with her past is played out not only upon the counsellors couch during regression therapy but also within the family home. With the help of Josh's (played by Daniel Booth) method of escapism; a penchant for viewing life through a lens, we learn from his footage the extent and impact this situation has had over the years. Vulnerable and unable to articulate their worries, teenagers Josh & Nicola struggle with their Mum's more recent bout of outbursts and her increasing instability. They forge relationships outside of the family unit; to escape in Nicola's case and for support whilst they try to maintain some sense of a 'normal' existence. As relationships at home become frayed suspicions about her counsellor's integrity & motivations arise.Dawn is sectioned and social services are informed. Are Dawn's recollections true or have they been encouraged? Is the family strong enough to get through it?","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Lloyd","take","us","straight","into","the","heart","of","dysfunct","famili","life",".","Mum","Dawn","'s","(","Janet","Banford",")","struggl","with","her","past","is","play","out","not","onli","upon","the","counsellor","couch","dure","regress","therapi","but","also","within","the","famili","home",".","With","the","help","of","Josh","'s","(","play","by","Daniel","Booth",")","method","of","escap",";","a","penchant","for","view","life","through","a","len",",","we","learn","from","his","footag","the","extent","and","impact","this","situat","has","had","over","the","year",".","Vulner","and","unabl","to","articul","their","worri",",","teenag","Josh","&","Nicola","struggl","with","their","Mum","'s","more","recent","bout","of","outburst","and","her","increas","instabl",".","They","forg","relationship","outsid","of","the","famili","unit",";","to","escap","in","Nicola","'s","case","and","for","support","whilst","they","tri","to","maintain","some","sens","of","a","'","normal","'","exist",".","As","relationship","at","home","becom","fray","suspicion","about","her","counsellor","'s","integr","&","motiv","arise.Dawn","is","section","and","social","servic","are","inform",".","Are","Dawn","'s","recollect","true","or","have","they","been","encourag","?","Is","the","famili","strong","enough","to","get","through","it","?"],"lemmas":["Lloyd","take","we","straight","into","the","heart","of","dysfunctional","family","life",".","Mum","Dawn","'s","-lrb-","Janet","Banford","-rrb-","struggle","with","she","past","be","play","out","not","only","upon","the","counsellor","couch","during","regression","therapy","but","also","within","the","family","home",".","with","the","help","of","Josh","'s","-lrb-","play","by","Daniel","Booth","-rrb-","method","of","escapism",";","a","penchant","for","view","life","through","a","lens",",","we","learn","from","he","footage","the","extent","and","impact","this","situation","have","have","over","the","year",".","vulnerable","and","unable","to","articulate","they","worry",",","teenager","Josh","&","Nicola","struggle","with","they","Mum","'s","more","recent","bout","of","outburst","and","she","increase","instability",".","they","forge","relationship","outside","of","the","family","unit",";","to","escape","in","Nicola","'s","case","and","for","support","whilst","they","try","to","maintain","some","sense","of","a","'","normal","'","existence",".","as","relationship","at","home","become","fray","suspicion","about","she","counsellor","'s","integrity","&","motivation","arise.dawn","be","section","and","social","service","be","inform",".","be","Dawn","'s","recollection","true","or","have","they","be","encourage","?","be","the","family","strong","enough","to","get","through","it","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Lloyd takes us","takes us straight","us straight into","straight into the","into the heart","the heart of","heart of dysfunctional","of dysfunctional family","dysfunctional family life","Mum Dawn 's","Dawn 's (","'s ( Janet","( Janet Banford","Janet Banford )","Banford ) struggle",") struggle with","struggle with her","with her past","her past is","past is played","is played out","played out not","out not only","not only upon","only upon the","upon the counsellors","the counsellors couch","counsellors couch during","couch during regression","during regression therapy","regression therapy but","therapy but also","but also within","also within the","within the family","the family home","With the help","the help of","help of Josh","of Josh 's","Josh 's (","'s ( played","( played by","played by Daniel","by Daniel Booth","Daniel Booth )","Booth ) method",") method of","method of escapism","of escapism ;","escapism ;

{"title":"Periphery","plot":"Periphery: Videos 1-3 are the first installments in an ongoing documentary project chronicling the personal experiences of Americans - New Yorkers mostly - and their specific responses to world events. The first part was filmed 5 weeks after September 11, 2001 and part two was filmed in July of 2002. The project evolved as a response to what can be described as media complicity in creating a seemingly endless war, a war that is inextricably linked to private interests but is couched in patriotic fervor. The video explores how ordinary people - not WTC workers, widows or firemen - cope with the new, immediate aspects of a changed world.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Peripheri",":","Video","1-3","are","the","first","instal","in","an","ongo","documentari","project","chronicl","the","person","experi","of","American","-","New","Yorker","most","-","and","their","specif","respons","to","world","event",".","The","first","part","was","film","5","week","after","Septemb","11",",","2001","and","part","two","was","film","in","Juli","of","2002",".","The","project","evolv","as","a","respons","to","what","can","be","describ","as","media","complic","in","creat","a","seem","endless","war",",","a","war","that","is","inextric","link","to","privat","interest","but","is","couch","in","patriot","fervor",".","The","video","explor","how","ordinari","peopl","-","not","WTC","worker",",","widow","or","firemen","-","cope","with","the","new",",","immedi","aspect","of","a","chang","world","."],"lemmas":["periphery",":","video","1-3","be","the","first","installment","in","a","ongoing","documentary","project","chronicle","the","personal","experience","of","Americans","-","new","Yorkers","mostly","-","and","they","specific","response","to","world","event",".","the","first","part","be","film","5","week","after","September","11",",","2001","and","part","two","be","film","in","July","of","2002",".","the","project","evolve","as","a","response","to","what","can","be","describe","as","media","complicity","in","create","a","seemingly","endless","war",",","a","war","that","be","inextricably","link","to","private","interest","but","be","couch","in","patriotic","fervor",".","the","video","explore","how","ordinary","people","-","not","WTC","worker",",","widow","or","fireman","-","cope","with","the","new",",","immediate","aspect","of","a","changed","world","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Periphery : Videos",": Videos 1-3","Videos 1-3 are","1-3 are the","are the first","the first installments","first installments in","installments in an","in an ongoing","an ongoing documentary","ongoing documentary project","documentary project chronicling","project chronicling the","chronicling the personal","the personal experiences","personal experiences of","experiences of Americans","of Americans -","Americans -

{"title":"A Tale of Two Isles","plot":"The world's first production electric vehicle, introduced in the early '70s -40 years before the auto industry rediscovered the benefits of electric mobility-, was manufactured on a Greek island. Enfield Automotive, a British firm based on the Isle of Wight, managed to win the Electricity Council contract for an initial production of about 100 electric vehicles, over the Ford and Leyland propositions. However, as production was about to start, the famous Greek ship owner John Goulandris, owner of Enfield Automotive, transferred the factory to the Greek island of Syros - a decision probably fatal to the car's future at a time when the rise of the petrol price, due to the energy crisis, could make E8000 the ideal solution for urban mobility.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","world","'s","first","product","electr","vehicl",",","introduc","in","the","earli","70s","-40","year","befor","the","auto","industri","rediscov","the","benefit","of","electr","mobil","-",",","was","manufactur","on","a","Greek","island",".","Enfield","Automot",",","a","British","firm","base","on","the","Isle","of","Wight",",","manag","to","win","the","Electric","Council","contract","for","an","initi","product","of","about","100","electr","vehicl",",","over","the","Ford","and","Leyland","proposit",".","Howev",",","as","product","was","about","to","start",",","the","famous","Greek","ship","owner","John","Goulandri",",","owner","of","Enfield","Automot",",","transfer","the","factori","to","the","Greek","island","of","Syro","-","a","decis","probabl","fatal","to","the","car","'s","futur","at","a","time","when","the","rise","of","the","petrol","price",",","due","to","the","energi","crisi",",","could","make","E8000","the","ideal","solut","for","urban","mobil","."],"lemmas":["the","world","'s","first","production","electric","vehicle",",","introduce","in","the","early","'70s","-40","year","before","the","auto","industry","rediscover","the","benefit","of","electric","mobility","-",",","be","manufacture","on","a","greek","island",".","Enfield","Automotive",",","a","british","firm","base","on","the","Isle","of","Wight",",","manage","to","win","the","Electricity","Council","contract","for","a","initial","production","of","about","100","electric","vehicle",",","over","the","Ford","and","Leyland","proposition",".","however",",","as","production","be","about","to","start",",","the","famous","greek","ship","owner","John","Goulandris",",","owner","of","Enfield","Automotive",",","transfer","the","factory","to","the","greek","island","of","Syros","-","a","decision","probably","fatal","to","the","car","'s","future","at","a","time","when","the","rise","of","the","petrol","price",",","due","to","the","energy","crisis",",","could","make","e8000","the","ideal","solution","for","urban","mobility","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The world 's","world 's first","'s first production","first production electric","production electric vehicle","electric vehicle ,","vehicle , introduced",", introduced in","introduced in the","in the early","the early '70s","early '70s -40","'70s -40 years","-40 years before","years before the","before the auto","the auto industry","auto industry rediscovered","industry rediscovered the","rediscovered the benefits","the benefits of","benefits of electric","of electric mobility","electric mobility -","mobility -

{"title":"Une journée de merde!","plot":"This is an important day for Marc Chanois, an insurance advisor heading toward middle age: it's his fiancée Sabine's birthday, her parents arrive in Paris and Marc will meet them for dinner to announce the engagement (her father can't stand him), he's bought Sabine a Spitfire, and his most important client is to sign a policy. But, as the day wears on, he's vexed by an incompetent secretary, the unexpected return of a girlfriend he hasn't seen in five years, squatters who use his office at night, the jealous former lover of a flight attendant who lives in the building, and his boss's unexpected return from a Swiss clinic. Will he reach Sabine in one piece?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["This","is","an","import","day","for","Marc","Chanoi",",","an","insur","advisor","head","toward","middl","age",":","it","'s","his","fiancé","Sabin","'s","birthday",",","her","parent","arriv","in","Pari","and","Marc","will","meet","them","for","dinner","to","announc","the","engag","(","her","father","ca","n't","stand","him",")",",","he","'s","bought","Sabin","a","Spitfir",",","and","his","most","import","client","is","to","sign","a","polici",".","But",",","as","the","day","wear","on",",","he","'s","vex","by","an","incompet","secretari",",","the","unexpect","return","of","a","girlfriend","he","has","n't","seen","in","five","year",",","squatter","who","use","his","offic","at","night",",","the","jealous","former","lover","of","a","flight","attend","who","live","in","the","build",",","and","his","boss","'s","unexpect","return","from","a","Swiss","clinic",".","Will","he","reach","Sabin","in","one","piec","?"],"lemmas":["this","be","a","important","day","for","Marc","Chanois",",","a","insurance","advisor","head","toward","middle","age",":","it","be","he","fiancée","Sabine","'s","birthday",",","she","parent","arrive","in","Paris","and","Marc","will","meet","they","for","dinner","to","announce","the","engagement","-lrb-","she","father","can","not","stand","he","-rrb-",",","he","be","buy","Sabine","a","Spitfire",",","and","he","most","important","client","be","to","sign","a","policy",".","but",",","as","the","day","wear","on",",","he","be","vex","by","a","incompetent","secretary",",","the","unexpected","return","of","a","girlfriend","he","have","not","see","in","five","year",",","squatter","who","use","he","office","at","night",",","the","jealous","former","lover","of","a","flight","attendant","who","live","in","the","building",",","and","he","boss","'s","unexpected","return","from","a","swiss","clinic",".","will","he","reach","Sabine","in","one","piece","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

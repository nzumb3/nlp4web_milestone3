{"title":"Snowwalkers","plot":"Snow walkers is a documentary about nine intrepid adventurers who travel 100km by toboggan from one Canadian rail line to the other down the Missinaibi river system throughout the arctic water shed. This traditional form of travel is thousands of years old and recently made popular by people like Garrett Conover and a Northern Ontario adventure company called Lure of the North. The group was beaten, battered and besieged by winter storms, endless slush and record snowfall. They had only ten days to travel from one rail line to the other in order to catch the train out of the wilderness. Will they make it? Can they make it? Can they even survive? Snow walkers.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama","

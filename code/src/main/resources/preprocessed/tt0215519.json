{"title":"Annas Sommer","plot":"Anna is the Jewish daughter of a Spanish mother and a Greek father. She has returned to her family's house in Greece after many of her friends and family members have died over the years. Although she came back to the house in order to sell it, things begin to take a different direction: The house itself, the furniture and other equipment in it seem to become alive for Anna, recalling images of her past, her beloved parents and her friend Max, who once gave her shelter from the raging policemen when she took part as a photo journalist in a political demonstration in Berlin. Anna changes her mind: When some rich, ignorant American couple wondering about if they should buy the house asks for the swimming pool (while the Mediterranean is half a mile away), she simply doubles the charge, and finally puts the \"For sale\" plate into the garbage can. In the meantime, she has had a little love affair with a young man from the village, found a girlfriend from her childhood days, swum in the sea, and found a way to live in peace with her melancholic memories.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Anna","is","the","Jewish","daughter","of","a","Spanish","mother","and","a","Greek","father",".","She","has","return","to","her","famili","'s","hous","in","Greec","after","mani","of","her","friend","and","famili","member","have","die","over","the","year",".","Although","she","came","back","to","the","hous","in","order","to","sell","it",",","thing","begin","to","take","a","differ","direct",":","The","hous","itself",",","the","furnitur","and","other","equip","in","it","seem","to","becom","aliv","for","Anna",",","recal","imag","of","her","past",",","her","belov","parent","and","her","friend","Max",",","who","onc","gave","her","shelter","from","the","rage","policemen","when","she","took","part","as","a","photo","journalist","in","a","polit","demonstr","in","Berlin",".","Anna","chang","her","mind",":","When","some","rich",",","ignor","American","coupl","wonder","about","if","they","should","buy","the","hous","ask","for","the","swim","pool","(","while","the","Mediterranean","is","half","a","mile","away",")",",","she","simpli","doubl","the","charg",",","and","final","put","the","\"","For","sale","\"","plate","into","the","garbag","can",".","In","the","meantim",",","she","has","had","a","littl","love","affair","with","a","young","man","from","the","villag",",","found","a","girlfriend","from","her","childhood","day",",","swum","in","the","sea",",","and","found","a","way","to","live","in","peac","with","her","melanchol","memori","."],"lemmas":["Anna","be","the","jewish","daughter","of","a","spanish","mother","and","a","greek","father",".","she","have","return","to","she","family","'s","house","in","Greece","after","many","of","she","friend","and","family","member","have","die","over","the","year",".","although","she","come","back","to","the","house","in","order","to","sell","it",",","thing","begin","to","take","a","different","direction",":","the","house","itself",",","the","furniture","and","other","equipment","in","it","seem","to","become","alive","for","Anna",",","recall","image","of","she","past",",","she","beloved","parent","and","she","friend","max",",","who","once","give","she","shelter","from","the","rage","policeman","when","she","take","part","as","a","photo","journalist","in","a","political","demonstration","in","Berlin",".","Anna","change","she","mind",":","when","some","rich",",","ignorant","american","couple","wonder","about","if","they","should","buy","the","house","ask","for","the","swimming","pool","-lrb-","while","the","Mediterranean","be","half","a","mile","away","-rrb-",",","she","simply","double","the","charge",",","and","finally","put","the","``","for","sale","''","plate","into","the","garbage","can",".","in","the","meantime",",","she","have","have","a","little","love","affair","with","a","young","man","from","the","village",",","find","a","girlfriend","from","she","childhood","day",",","swum","in","the","sea",",","and","find","a","way","to","live","in","peace","with","she","melancholic","memory","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Anna

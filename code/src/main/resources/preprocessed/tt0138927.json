{"title":"Waterproof","plot":"Eli Zeal is a bitter Jewish shopkeeper who is shot during a hold-up attempt by the 11-year-old son of a single mother in Washington, DC. Distraught and with nowhere else to turn, the boy's mother Tyree Battle kidnaps the wounded Zeal and along with her son, flees to her small hometown of Waterproof, Louisiana - and a family she hasn't seen in years. Thrust into the unfamiliar world of the deep south, Zeal finds himself surrounded by Tyree's brothers - one battling a severe brain injury, the other an angry alcoholic - her hundred year old grandfather and a mother of irrepressible faith. But, as they work to nurse Zeal back to health, dark shadows begin to emerge from the family's past - forcing them to confront a dreadful secret that has torn them apart.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Eli","Zeal","is","a","bitter","Jewish","shopkeep","who","is","shot","dure","a","hold-up","attempt","by","the","11-year-old","son","of","a","singl","mother","in","Washington",",","DC",".","Distraught","and","with","nowher","els","to","turn",",","the","boy","'s","mother","Tyre","Battl","kidnap","the","wound","Zeal","and","along","with","her","son",",","flee","to","her","small","hometown","of","Waterproof",",","Louisiana","-","and","a","famili","she","has","n't","seen","in","year",".","Thrust","into","the","unfamiliar","world","of","the","deep","south",",","Zeal","find","himself","surround","by","Tyre","'s","brother","-","one","battl","a","sever","brain","injuri",",","the","other","an","angri","alcohol","-","her","hundr","year","old","grandfath","and","a","mother","of","irrepress","faith",".","But",",","as","they","work","to","nurs","Zeal","back","to","health",",","dark","shadow","begin","to","emerg","from","the","famili","'s","past","-","forc","them","to","confront","a","dread","secret","that","has","torn","them","apart","."],"lemmas":["Eli","Zeal","be","a","bitter","jewish","shopkeeper","who","be","shoot","during","a","hold-up","attempt","by","the","11-year-old","son","of","a","single","mother","in","Washington",",","DC",".","Distraught","and","with","nowhere","else","to","turn",",","the","boy","'s","mother","Tyree","Battle","kidnap","the","wounded","Zeal","and","along","with","she","son",",","flee","to","she","small","hometown","of","Waterproof",",","Louisiana","-","and","a","family","she","have","not","see","in","year",".","thrust","into","the","unfamiliar","world","of","the","deep","south",",","Zeal","find","himself","surround","by","Tyree","'s","brother","-","one","battle","a","severe","brain","injury",",","the","other","a","angry","alcoholic","-","she","hundred","year","old","grandfather","and","a","mother","of","irrepressible","faith",".","but",",","as","they","work","to","nurse","Zeal","back","to","health",",","dark","shadow","begin","to","emerge","from","the","family","'s","past","-","force","they","to","confront","a","dreadful","secret","that","have","tear","they","apart","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Eli Zeal is","Zeal is a","is a bitter","a bitter Jewish","bitter Jewish shopkeeper","Jewish shopkeeper who","shopkeeper who is","who is shot","is shot during","shot during a","during a hold-up","a hold-up attempt","hold-up attempt by","attempt by the","by the 11-year-old","the 11-year-old son","11-year-old son of","son of a","of a single","a single mother","single mother in","mother in Washington","in Washington ,","Washington , DC","Distraught and with","and with nowhere","with nowhere else","nowhere else to","else to turn","to turn ,","turn , the",", the boy","the boy 's","boy 's mother","'s mother Tyree","mother Tyree Battle","Tyree Battle kidnaps","Battle kidnaps the","kidnaps the wounded","the wounded Zeal","wounded Zeal and","Zeal and along","and along with","along with her","with her son","her son ,","son , flees",", flees to","flees to her","to her small","her small hometown","small hometown of","hometown of Waterproof","of Waterproof ,","Waterproof , Louisiana",", Louisiana -","Louisiana -

{"title":"Drawing with Chalk","plot":"Jay and Matt were once wide-eyed, would-be rock stars, eager to leave their hometown and head for the big city and never look back. After 15 years of struggling to get a record deal in NYC, they find themselves back in their small working class hometown, dreaming of what might have been. Now, at 40 years old, they're out to give it one more shot. While Matt struggles with personal demons and a fear of being too old, Jay is ultimately faced with having to make a choice between his artistic dreams and his responsibility to his wife and 5 year old son.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Jay","and","Matt","were","onc","wide-ey",",","would-b","rock","star",",","eager","to","leav","their","hometown","and","head","for","the","big","citi","and","never","look","back",".","After","15","year","of","struggl","to","get","a","record","deal","in","NYC",",","they","find","themselv","back","in","their","small","work","class","hometown",",","dream","of","what","might","have","been",".","Now",",","at","40","year","old",",","they","re","out","to","give","it","one","more","shot",".","While","Matt","struggl","with","person","demon","and","a","fear","of","be","too","old",",","Jay","is","ultim","face","with","have","to","make","a","choic","between","his","artist","dream","and","his","respons","to","his","wife","and","5","year","old","son","."],"lemmas":["Jay","and","Matt","be","once","wide-eyed",",","would-be","rock","star",",","eager","to","leave","they","hometown","and","head","for","the","big","city","and","never","look","back",".","after","15","year","of","struggle","to","get","a","record","deal","in","NYC",",","they","find","themselves","back","in","they","small","work","class","hometown",",","dream","of","what","might","have","be",".","now",",","at","40","year","old",",","they","be","out","to","give","it","one","more","shot",".","while","Matt","struggle","with","personal","demon","and","a","fear","of","be","too","old",",","Jay","be","ultimately","face","with","have","to","make","a","choice","between","he","artistic","dream","and","he","responsibility","to","he","wife","and","5","year","old","son","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jay and Matt","and Matt were","Matt were once","were once wide-eyed","once wide-eyed ,","wide-eyed , would-be",", would-be rock","would-be rock stars","rock stars ,","stars , eager",", eager to","eager to leave","to leave their","leave their hometown","their hometown and","hometown and head","and head for","head for the","for the big","the big city","big city and","city and never","and never look","never look back","After 15 years","15 years of","years of struggling","of struggling to","struggling to get","to get a","get a record","a record deal","record deal in","deal in NYC","in NYC ,","NYC , they",", they find","they find themselves","find themselves back","themselves back in","back in their","in their small","their small working","small working class","working class hometown","class hometown ,","hometown , dreaming",", dreaming of","dreaming of what","of what might","what might have","might have been","Now , at",", at 40","at 40 years","40 years old","years old ,","old , they",", they 're","they 're out","'re out to","out to give","to give it","give it one","it one more","one more shot","While Matt struggles","Matt struggles with","struggles with personal","with personal demons","personal demons and","demons and a","and a fear","a fear of","fear of being","of being too","being too old","too old ,","old , Jay",", Jay is","Jay is ultimately","is ultimately faced","ultimately faced with","faced with having","with having to","having to make","to make a","make a choice","a choice between","choice between his","between his artistic","his artistic dreams","artistic dreams and","dreams and his","and his responsibility","his responsibility to","responsibility to his","to his wife","his wife and","wife and 5","and 5 year","5 year old","year old son"],"2grams":["Jay and","and Matt","Matt were","were once","once wide-eyed","wide-eyed ,",", would-be","would-be rock","rock stars","stars ,",", eager","eager to","to leave","leave their","their hometown","hometown and","and head","head for","for the","the big","big city","city and","and never","never look","look back","After 15","15 years","years of","of struggling","struggling to","to get","get a","a record","record deal","deal in","in NYC","NYC ,",", they","they find","find themselves","themselves back","back in","in their","their small","small working","working class","class hometown","hometown ,",", dreaming","dreaming of","of what","what might","might have","have been","Now ,",", at","at 40","40 years","years old","old ,",", they","they 're","'re out","out to","to give","give it","it one","one more","more shot","While Matt","Matt struggles","struggles with","with personal","personal demons","demons and","and a","a fear","fear of","of being","being too","too old","old ,",", Jay","Jay is","is ultimately","ultimately faced","faced with","with having","having to","to make","make a","a choice","choice between","between his","his artistic","artistic dreams","dreams and","and his","his responsibility","responsibility to","to his","his wife","wife and","and 5","5 year","year old","old son"]}

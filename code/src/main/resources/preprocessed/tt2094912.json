{"title":"Paper Drama","plot":"Almost everyone knows Japanese anime and its impact on the entertainment industry. Many people are also familiar with manga or Japanese comics and how that art form has affected American comic books and popular culture. However, very few people outside of Japan know that both manga and anime were spawned by the Japanese oral storytelling tradition called kamishibai - a uniquely Japanese art form. The term kamishibai literally translates to \"paper drama.\" In the 1950s as many as 3,000 kamishibai performers roamed the streets of Tokyo performing folktales of morality to young audiences. However, with the advent of mass publishing and television, the art form almost disappeared. There are only a handful of street kamishibai performers today. Kamishibai has evolved into an educational tool for use in the classroom. This film introduces two practitioners of kamishibai, together who have been performing the art for over 70 years and an instructor who currently teaches this dying art form at a community center to aspiring practitioners in Tokyo.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Almost","everyon","know","Japanes","anim","and","it","impact","on","the","entertain","industri",".","Mani","peopl","are","also","familiar","with","manga","or","Japanes","comic","and","how","that","art","form","has","affect","American","comic","book","and","popular","cultur",".","Howev",",","veri","few","peopl","outsid","of","Japan","know","that","both","manga","and","anim","were","spawn","by","the","Japanes","oral","storytel","tradit","call","kamishibai","-","a","uniqu","Japanes","art","form",".","The","term","kamishibai","liter","translat","to","\"","paper","drama",".","\"","In","the","1950s","as","mani","as","3,000","kamishibai","perform","roam","the","street","of","Tokyo","perform","folktal","of","moral","to","young","audienc",".","Howev",",","with","the","advent","of","mass","publish","and","televis",",","the","art","form","almost","disappear",".","There","are","onli","a","hand","of","street","kamishibai","perform","today",".","Kamishibai","has","evolv","into","an","educ","tool","for","use","in","the","classroom",".","This","film","introduc","two","practition","of","kamishibai",",","togeth","who","have","been","perform","the","art","for","over","70","year","and","an","instructor","who","current","teach","this","die","art","form","at","a","communiti","center","to","aspir","practition","in","Tokyo","."],"lemmas":["almost","everyone","know","japanese","anime","and","its","impact","on","the","entertainment","industry",".","many","people","be","also","familiar","with","manga","or","japanese","comic","and","how","that","art","form","have","affect","american","comic","book","and","popular","culture",".","however",",","very","few","people","outside","of","Japan","know","that","both","manga","and","anime","be","spawn","by","the","japanese","oral","storytelling","tradition","call","kamishibaus","-","a","uniquely","japanese","art","form",".","the","term","kamishibai","literally","translate","to","``","paper","drama",".","''","in","the","1950s","as","many","as","3,000","kamishibai","performer","roam","the","street","of","Tokyo","perform","folktale","of","morality","to","young","audience",".","however",",","with","the","advent","of","mass","publishing","and","television",",","the","art","form","almost","disappear",".","there","be","only","a","handful","of","street","kamishibai","performer","today",".","Kamishibai","have","evolve","into","a","educational","tool","for","use","in","the","classroom",".","this","film","introduce","two","practitioner","of","kamishibaus",",","together","who","have","be","perform","the","art","for","over","70","year","and","a","instructor","who","currently","teach","this","die","art","form","at","a","community","center","to","aspire","practitioner","in","Tokyo","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Almost everyone knows","everyone knows Japanese","knows Japanese anime","Japanese anime and","anime and its","and its impact","its impact on","impact on the","on the entertainment","the entertainment industry","Many people are","people are also","are also familiar","also familiar with","familiar with manga","with manga or","manga or Japanese","or Japanese comics","Japanese comics and","comics and how","and how that","how that art","that art form","art form has","form has affected","has affected American","affected American comic","American comic books","comic books and","books and popular","and popular culture","However , very",", very few","very few people","few people outside","people outside of","outside of Japan","of Japan know","Japan know that","know that both","that both manga","both manga and","manga and anime","and anime were","anime were spawned","were spawned by","spawned by the","by the Japanese","the Japanese oral","Japanese oral storytelling","oral storytelling tradition","storytelling tradition called","tradition called kamishibai","called kamishibai -","kamishibai -

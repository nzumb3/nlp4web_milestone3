{"title":"Le favole Iniziano a Cabras","plot":"\"Cabras, Where Fables are Born\" is a documentary, but also a metaphor. It is the story of a journey into the heart of one of the most famous and at the same time mysterious islands in the Mediterranean: Sardinia. This fascinating island is described by some of its most important artists, and others who have made the art of living not only their profession, but also their purpose in this life. On this journey we will meet poets, musicians, a solo sailor, a famous sculptor, actors in an experimental theatre, as well as a famous fashion designer and a nature photographer. Through their eyes we will not only discover Sardinia, but also what is perhaps the origin of art itself: beauty, passion and the desire to live.","genres":["Biography"," History","

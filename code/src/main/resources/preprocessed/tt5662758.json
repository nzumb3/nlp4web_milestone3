{"title":"Mute","plot":"Verbal communication has been outlawed by the rich elite, in an attempt to stop people speaking out against the conditions they live in. The new laws are enforced by the security department of the Spectrum corporation, a huge conglomerate of the five biggest companies in the world. A voyeuristic filmmaker falls in love with an underground spoken word artist. As they find themselves unable to talk to one another, they start to make small films and write letters to one another. As the poet speaks out against Spectrum, and its owners, their lives become in danger. Will they be able to save each other in time?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Verbal","communic","has","been","outlaw","by","the","rich","elit",",","in","an","attempt","to","stop","peopl","speak","out","against","the","condit","they","live","in",".","The","new","law","are","enforc","by","the","secur","depart","of","the","Spectrum","corpor",",","a","huge","conglomer","of","the","five","biggest","compani","in","the","world",".","A","voyeurist","filmmak","fall","in","love","with","an","underground","spoken","word","artist",".","As","they","find","themselv","unabl","to","talk","to","one","anoth",",","they","start","to","make","small","film","and","write","letter","to","one","anoth",".","As","the","poet","speak","out","against","Spectrum",",","and","it","owner",",","their","live","becom","in","danger",".","Will","they","be","abl","to","save","each","other","in","time","?"],"lemmas":["verbal","communication","have","be","outlaw","by","the","rich","elite",",","in","a","attempt","to","stop","people","speak","out","against","the","condition","they","live","in",".","the","new","law","be","enforce","by","the","security","department","of","the","spectrum","corporation",",","a","huge","conglomerate","of","the","five","biggest","company","in","the","world",".","a","voyeuristic","filmmaker","fall","in","love","with","a","underground","speak","word","artist",".","as","they","find","themselves","unable","to","talk","to","one","another",",","they","start","to","make","small","film","and","write","letter","to","one","another",".","as","the","poet","speak","out","against","Spectrum",",","and","its","owner",",","they","life","become","in","danger",".","will","they","be","able","to","save","each","other","in","time","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Verbal communication has","communication has been","has been outlawed","been outlawed by","outlawed by the","by the rich","the rich elite","rich elite ,","elite , in",", in an","in an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to stop","to stop people","stop people speaking","people speaking out","speaking out against","out against the","against the conditions","the conditions they","conditions they live","they live in","The new laws","new laws are","laws are enforced","are enforced by","enforced by the","by the security","the security department","security department of","department of the","of the Spectrum","the Spectrum corporation","Spectrum corporation ,","corporation , a",", a huge","a huge conglomerate","huge conglomerate of","conglomerate of the","of the five","the five biggest","five biggest companies","biggest companies in","companies in the","in the world","A voyeuristic filmmaker","voyeuristic filmmaker falls","filmmaker falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with an","with an underground","an underground spoken","underground spoken word","spoken word artist","As they find","they find themselves","find themselves unable","themselves unable to","unable to talk","to talk to","talk to one","to one another","one another ,","another , they",", they start","they start to","start to make","to make small","make small films","small films and","films and write","and write letters","write letters to","letters to one","to one another","As the poet","the poet speaks","poet speaks out","speaks out against","out against Spectrum","against Spectrum ,","Spectrum , and",", and its","and its owners","its owners ,","owners , their",", their lives","their lives become","lives become in","become in danger","Will they be","they be able","be able to","able to save","to save each","save each other","each other in","other in time"],"2grams":["Verbal communication","communication has","has been","been outlawed","outlawed by","by the","the rich","rich elite","elite ,",", in","in an","an attempt","attempt to","to stop","stop people","people speaking","speaking out","out against","against the","the conditions","conditions they","they live","live in","The new","new laws","laws are","are enforced","enforced by","by the","the security","security department","department of","of the","the Spectrum","Spectrum corporation","corporation ,",", a","a huge","huge conglomerate","conglomerate of","of the","the five","five biggest","biggest companies","companies in","in the","the world","A voyeuristic","voyeuristic filmmaker","filmmaker falls","falls in","in love","love with","with an","an underground","underground spoken","spoken word","word artist","As they","they find","find themselves","themselves unable","unable to","to talk","talk to","to one","one another","another ,",", they","they start","start to","to make","make small","small films","films and","and write","write letters","letters to","to one","one another","As the","the poet","poet speaks","speaks out","out against","against Spectrum","Spectrum ,",", and","and its","its owners","owners ,",", their","their lives","lives become","become in","in danger","Will they","they be","be able","able to","to save","save each","each other","other in","in time"]}

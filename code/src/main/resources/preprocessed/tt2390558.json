{"title":"Something More Than Sound","plot":"'Something more than Sound' explores the process of making music as well as the space required by the artist to make it. The documentary takes an in-depth look into how and why a musician creates art and how external environmental factors effect both the creative process and the artist's psyche. In a cathartic manner, the performative compulsion to share these sounds with a community draws the musician out from the isolated, individualized home while still allowing for the creator to maintain the levels of comfort and safety achieved within the home, but now on display in a public arena. 'Something more than Sound' portrays the many varied homes in which the musician lives: physical, mental, communal, and transcendent.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["'","Someth","more","than","Sound","'","explor","the","process","of","make","music","as","well","as","the","space","requir","by","the","artist","to","make","it",".","The","documentari","take","an","in-depth","look","into","how","and","whi","a","musician","creat","art","and","how","extern","environment","factor","effect","both","the","creativ","process","and","the","artist","'s","psych",".","In","a","cathart","manner",",","the","perform","compuls","to","share","these","sound","with","a","communiti","draw","the","musician","out","from","the","isol",",","individu","home","while","still","allow","for","the","creator","to","maintain","the","level","of","comfort","and","safeti","achiev","within","the","home",",","but","now","on","display","in","a","public","arena",".","'","Someth","more","than","Sound","'","portray","the","mani","vari","home","in","which","the","musician","live",":","physic",",","mental",",","communal",",","and","transcend","."],"lemmas":["'","something","more","than","Sound","'","explore","the","process","of","make","music","as","well","as","the","space","require","by","the","artist","to","make","it",".","the","documentary","take","a","in-depth","look","into","how","and","why","a","musician","create","art","and","how","external","environmental","factor","effect","both","the","creative","process","and","the","artist","'s","psyche",".","in","a","cathartic","manner",",","the","performative","compulsion","to","share","these","sound","with","a","community","draw","the","musician","out","from","the","isolated",",","individualized","home","while","still","allow","for","the","creator","to","maintain","the","level","of","comfort","and","safety","achieve","within","the","home",",","but","now","on","display","in","a","public","arena",".","'","something","more","than","Sound","'","portray","the","many","varied","home","in","which","the","musician","life",":","physical",",","mental",",","communal",",","and","transcendent","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["' Something more","Something more than","more than Sound","than Sound '","Sound ' explores","' explores the","explores the process","the process of","process of making","of making music","making music as","music as well","as well as","well as the","as the space","the space required","space required by","required by the","by the artist","the artist to","artist to make","to make it","The documentary takes","documentary takes an","takes an in-depth","an in-depth look","in-depth look into","look into how","into how and","how and why","and why a","why a musician","a musician creates","musician creates art","creates art and","art and how","and how external","how external environmental","external environmental factors","environmental factors effect","factors effect both","effect both the","both the creative","the creative process","creative process and","process and the","and the artist","the artist 's","artist 's psyche","In a cathartic","a cathartic manner","cathartic manner ,","manner , the",", the performative","the performative compulsion","performative compulsion to","compulsion to share","to share these","share these sounds","these sounds with","sounds with a","with a community","a community draws","community draws the","draws the musician","the musician out","musician out from","out from the","from the isolated","the isolated ,","isolated , individualized",", individualized home","individualized home while","home while still","while still allowing","still allowing for","allowing for the","for the creator","the creator to","creator to maintain","to maintain the","maintain the levels","the levels of","levels of comfort","of comfort and","comfort and safety","and safety achieved","safety achieved within","achieved within the","within the home","the home ,","home , but",", but now","but now on","now on display","on display in","display in a","in a public","a public arena","public arena .","arena .

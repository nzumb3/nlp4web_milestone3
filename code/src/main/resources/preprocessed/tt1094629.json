{"title":"Contre toute espérance","plot":"Covered in blood, Réjeanne Poulin is in a near comatose state as she, a suspect, is being questioned by the police into the death of her husband, Gilles Dubuc, whose gunshot dead body was found in their home. After she is transferred to a psychiatric hospital and as the police investigate the death, Réjeanne and Gilles' story is told in flashback starting approximately two years earlier when they, then a telephone operator and a long haul trucker respectively both who were making a decent living, bought their modest dream house in idyllic Beloeil, Québec, just outside of Montréal. Their world as they know it starts to disintegrate first when Gilles suffers a stroke. Although Réjeanne can handle the additional work during his recuperation, it's his despondent nature that is more difficult with which to deal. Her already resulting fragile mental state takes a further hit due to some corporate restructuring in her company. These events in combination lead to Réjeanne and Gilles dealing with their lives, both individually and in combination, the only way they know how.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Cover","in","blood",",","Réjeann","Poulin","is","in","a","near","comatos","state","as","she",",","a","suspect",",","is","be","question","by","the","polic","into","the","death","of","her","husband",",","Gill","Dubuc",",","whose","gunshot","dead","bodi","was","found","in","their","home",".","After","she","is","transfer","to","a","psychiatr","hospit","and","as","the","polic","investig","the","death",",","Réjeann","and","Gill","'","stori","is","told","in","flashback","start","approxim","two","year","earlier","when","they",",","then","a","telephon","oper","and","a","long","haul","trucker","respect","both","who","were","make","a","decent","live",",","bought","their","modest","dream","hous","in","idyl","Beloeil",",","Québec",",","just","outsid","of","Montréal",".","Their","world","as","they","know","it","start","to","disintegr","first","when","Gill","suffer","a","stroke",".","Although","Réjeann","can","handl","the","addit","work","dure","his","recuper",",","it","'s","his","despond","natur","that","is","more","difficult","with","which","to","deal",".","Her","alreadi","result","fragil","mental","state","take","a","further","hit","due","to","some","corpor","restructur","in","her","compani",".","These","event","in","combin","lead","to","Réjeann","and","Gill","deal","with","their","live",",","both","individu","and","in","combin",",","the","onli","way","they","know","how","."],"lemmas":["cover","in","blood",",","Réjeanne","Poulin","be","in","a","near","comatose","state","as","she",",","a","suspect",",","be","be","question","by","the","police","into","the","death","of","she","husband",",","Gilles","Dubuc",",","whose","gunshot","dead","body","be","find","in","they","home",".","after","she","be","transfer","to","a","psychiatric","hospital","and","as","the","police","investigate","the","death",",","Réjeanne","and","Gilles","'","story","be","tell","in","flashback","start","approximately","two","year","earlier","when","they",",","then","a","telephone","operator","and","a","long","haul","trucker","respectively","both","who","be","make","a","decent","living",",","buy","they","modest","dream","house","in","idyllic","Beloeil",",","Québec",",","just","outside","of","Montréal",".","they","world","as","they","know","it","start","to","disintegrate","first","when","Gilles","suffer","a","stroke",".","although","Réjeanne","can","handle","the","additional","work","during","he","recuperation",",","it","be","he","despondent","nature","that","be","more","difficult","with","which","to","deal",".","she","already","result","fragile","mental","state","take","a","further","hit","due","to","some","corporate","restructuring","in","she","company",".","these","event","in","combination","lead","to","Réjeanne","and","Gilles","deal","with","they","life",",","both","individually","and","in","combination",",","the","only","way","they","know","how","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Covered

{"title":"Urbania","plot":"Charlie takes an odyssey through grief during a fall weekend in New York City. His encounters are planned and chance: with a homeless man who sleeps by his building, with a friend who's dying, with the couple who lives (and noisily loves) in the flat above him, with a bartender and a one-night-stand he follows home, and with a tattooed stranger whom he seeks out and befriends. Along the way, Charlie inhabits a city full of moments of violence and of stories and legends: a kidney thief, a microwaved poodle, a rat in a hot dog bun, a baby left on a car top, a tourist's toothbrush, needles in public-phone change slots. Charlie lives and tells his own stories. What caused his melancholy?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Charli","take","an","odyssey","through","grief","dure","a","fall","weekend","in","New","York","Citi",".","His","encount","are","plan","and","chanc",":","with","a","homeless","man","who","sleep","by","his","build",",","with","a","friend","who","'s","die",",","with","the","coupl","who","live","(","and","noisili","love",")","in","the","flat","abov","him",",","with","a","bartend","and","a","one-night-stand","he","follow","home",",","and","with","a","tattoo","stranger","whom","he","seek","out","and","befriend",".","Along","the","way",",","Charli","inhabit","a","citi","full","of","moment","of","violenc","and","of","stori","and","legend",":","a","kidney","thief",",","a","microwav","poodl",",","a","rat","in","a","hot","dog","bun",",","a","babi","left","on","a","car","top",",","a","tourist","'s","toothbrush",",","needl","in","public-phon","chang","slot",".","Charli","live","and","tell","his","own","stori",".","What","caus","his","melancholi","?"],"lemmas":["Charlie","take","a","odyssey","through","grief","during","a","fall","weekend","in","New","York","City",".","he","encounter","be","plan","and","chance",":","with","a","homeless","man","who","sleep","by","he","building",",","with","a","friend","who","be","die",",","with","the","couple","who","live","-lrb-","and","noisily","love","-rrb-","in","the","flat","above","he",",","with","a","bartender","and","a","one-night-stand","he","follow","home",",","and","with","a","tattooed","stranger","whom","he","seek","out","and","befriend",".","along","the","way",",","Charlie","inhabit","a","city","full","of","moment","of","violence","and","of","story","and","legend",":","a","kidney","thief",",","a","microwaved","poodle",",","a","rat","in","a","hot","dog","bun",",","a","baby","leave","on","a","car","top",",","a","tourist","'s","toothbrush",",","needle","in","public-phone","change","slot",".","Charlie","live","and","tell","he","own","story",".","what","cause","he","melancholy","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Charlie

{"title":"Harvest","plot":"Hank Colby moves slow and automatic. A new fence needs digging, wood needs splitting, and wild ginseng grows in the mountains around his home. Harvest shows Hank as he confronts the relentless flow of change. Daily rituals begin to falter when old age, the elusiveness of ginseng, and the specter of faded youth interrupt his day-to-day. Harvest is a film that explores the anti-narrative attributes of cinema and invites the viewer to let their mind wander through the world of this Appalachian mountain man as he arrives at a point in life that we all must face.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Hank","Colbi","move","slow","and","automat",".","A","new","fenc","need","dig",",","wood","need","split",",","and","wild","ginseng","grow","in","the","mountain","around","his","home",".","Harvest","show","Hank","as","he","confront","the","relentless","flow","of","chang",".","Daili","ritual","begin","to","falter","when","old","age",",","the","elus","of","ginseng",",","and","the","specter","of","fade","youth","interrupt","his","day-to-day",".","Harvest","is","a","film","that","explor","the","anti-narr","attribut","of","cinema","and","invit","the","viewer","to","let","their","mind","wander","through","the","world","of","this","Appalachian","mountain","man","as","he","arriv","at","a","point","in","life","that","we","all","must","face","."],"lemmas":["Hank","Colby","move","slow","and","automatic",".","a","new","fence","need","digging",",","wood","need","splitting",",","and","wild","ginseng","grow","in","the","mountain","around","he","home",".","harvest","show","Hank","as","he","confront","the","relentless","flow","of","change",".","daily","ritual","begin","to","falter","when","old","age",",","the","elusiveness","of","ginseng",",","and","the","specter","of","fade","youth","interrupt","he","day-to-day",".","harvest","be","a","film","that","explore","the","anti-narrative","attribute","of","cinema","and","invite","the","viewer","to","let","they","mind","wander","through","the","world","of","this","Appalachian","mountain","man","as","he","arrive","at","a","point","in","life","that","we","all","must","face","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Hank Colby moves","Colby moves slow","moves slow and","slow and automatic","A new fence","new fence needs","fence needs digging","needs digging ,","digging , wood",", wood needs","wood needs splitting","needs splitting ,","splitting , and",", and wild","and wild ginseng","wild ginseng grows","ginseng grows in","grows in the","in the mountains","the mountains around","mountains around his","around his home","Harvest shows Hank","shows Hank as","Hank as he","as he confronts","he confronts the","confronts the relentless","the relentless flow","relentless flow of","flow of change","Daily rituals begin","rituals begin to","begin to falter","to falter when","falter when old","when old age","old age ,","age , the",", the elusiveness","the elusiveness of","elusiveness of ginseng","of ginseng ,","ginseng , and",", and the","and the specter","the specter of","specter of faded","of faded youth","faded youth interrupt","youth interrupt his","interrupt his day-to-day","Harvest is a","is a film","a film that","film that explores","that explores the","explores the anti-narrative","the anti-narrative attributes","anti-narrative attributes of","attributes of cinema","of cinema and","cinema and invites","and invites the","invites the viewer","the viewer to","viewer to let","to let their","let their mind","their mind wander","mind wander through","wander through the","through the world","the world of","world of this","of this Appalachian","this Appalachian mountain","Appalachian mountain man","mountain man as","man as he","as he arrives","he arrives at","arrives at a","at a point","a point in","point in life","in life that","life that we","that we all","we all must","all must face"],"2grams":["Hank Colby","Colby moves","moves slow","slow and","and automatic","A new","new fence","fence needs","needs digging","digging ,",", wood","wood needs","needs splitting","splitting ,",", and","and wild","wild ginseng","ginseng grows","grows in","in the","the mountains","mountains around","around his","his home","Harvest shows","shows Hank","Hank as","as he","he confronts","confronts the","the relentless","relentless flow","flow of","of change","Daily rituals","rituals begin","begin to","to falter","falter when","when old","old age","age ,",", the","the elusiveness","elusiveness of","of ginseng","ginseng ,",", and","and the","the specter","specter of","of faded","faded youth","youth interrupt","interrupt his","his day-to-day","Harvest is","is a","a film","film that","that explores","explores the","the anti-narrative","anti-narrative attributes","attributes of","of cinema","cinema and","and invites","invites the","the viewer","viewer to","to let","let their","their mind","mind wander","wander through","through the","the world","world of","of this","this Appalachian","Appalachian mountain","mountain man","man as","as he","he arrives","arrives at","at a","a point","point in","in life","life that","that we","we all","all must","must face"]}

{"title":"Pseudo","plot":"In a city where streets are overrun by drug dealers, those who have sworn to uphold the law are breaking it to better suit their own needs. Naresh K plays a detective (Sleaze), a veteran officer whose methods of enforcing the law are questionable, if not corrupt. 'PSEUDO' follows Sleaze as he takes the law in his own hands and co-ordinates a series of raids with his gang of friends. Ethical dilemmas arise when things go wrong and friends turn on each other as a game of cat and mouse ensues.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"],"stems":["In","a","citi","where","street","are","overrun","by","drug","dealer",",","those","who","have","sworn","to","uphold","the","law","are","break","it","to","better","suit","their","own","need",".","Naresh","K","play","a","detect","(","Sleaz",")",",","a","veteran","offic","whose","method","of","enforc","the","law","are","question",",","if","not","corrupt",".","'","PSEUDO","'","follow","Sleaz","as","he","take","the","law","in","his","own","hand","and","co-ordin","a","seri","of","raid","with","his","gang","of","friend",".","Ethical","dilemma","aris","when","thing","go","wrong","and","friend","turn","on","each","other","as","a","game","of","cat","and","mous","ensu","."],"lemmas":["in","a","city","where","street","be","overrun","by","drug","dealer",",","those","who","have","swear","to","uphold","the","law","be","break","it","to","better","suit","they","own","need",".","Naresh","K","play","a","detective","-lrb-","sleaze","-rrb-",",","a","veteran","officer","whose","method","of","enforce","the","law","be","questionable",",","if","not","corrupt",".","'","pseudo","'","follow","Sleaze","as","he","take","the","law","in","he","own","hand","and","co-ordinate","a","series","of","raid","with","he","gang","of","friend",".","ethical","dilemma","arise","when","thing","go","wrong","and","friend","turn","on","each","other","as","a","game","of","cat","and","mouse","ensue","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["In a city","a city where","city where streets","where streets are","streets are overrun","are overrun by","overrun by drug","by drug dealers","drug dealers ,","dealers , those",", those who","those who have","who have sworn","have sworn to","sworn to uphold","to uphold the","uphold the law","the law are","law are breaking","are breaking it","breaking it to","it to better","to better suit","better suit their","suit their own","their own needs","Naresh K plays","K plays a","plays a detective","a detective (","detective ( Sleaze","( Sleaze )","Sleaze ) ,",") , a",", a veteran","a veteran officer","veteran officer whose","officer whose methods","whose methods of","methods of enforcing","of enforcing the","enforcing the law","the law are","law are questionable","are questionable ,","questionable , if",", if not","if not corrupt","not corrupt .","corrupt .

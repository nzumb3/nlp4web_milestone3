{"title":"Sieniawka","plot":"Stefan attempts to make his way through a post-industrial no-man's land. An encounter with a stranger forces the line between reality and imagination to become blurred. The future and the past become intertwined. Visions of another time emerge from Stefan's mind. The cold-blooded surgeon used to work in the dissecting room. There was a cinema where everyone would go on the weekend. A state of complete delirium caused a young man's heart to stop beating. In drifting through memory and the imaginary, Stefan witnesses death, mental illness and the margins of humanity in a passing world that resembles our own. All that remains are ruins - everything begins to dissolve. The concrete world no longer resembles the one that he was forced to leave. Internal chaos is mirrored by external chaos.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Stefan","attempt","to","make","his","way","through","a","post-industri","no-man","'s","land",".","An","encount","with","a","stranger","forc","the","line","between","realiti","and","imagin","to","becom","blur",".","The","futur","and","the","past","becom","intertwin",".","Vision","of","anoth","time","emerg","from","Stefan","'s","mind",".","The","cold-blood","surgeon","use","to","work","in","the","dissect","room",".","There","was","a","cinema","where","everyon","would","go","on","the","weekend",".","A","state","of","complet","delirium","caus","a","young","man","'s","heart","to","stop","beat",".","In","drift","through","memori","and","the","imaginari",",","Stefan","wit","death",",","mental","ill","and","the","margin","of","human","in","a","pass","world","that","resembl","our","own",".","All","that","remain","are","ruin","-","everyth","begin","to","dissolv",".","The","concret","world","no","longer","resembl","the","one","that","he","was","forc","to","leav",".","Internal","chao","is","mirror","by","extern","chao","."],"lemmas":["Stefan","attempt","to","make","he","way","through","a","post-industrial","no-man","'s","land",".","a","encounter","with","a","stranger","force","the","line","between","reality","and","imagination","to","become","blur",".","the","future","and","the","past","become","intertwine",".","vision","of","another","time","emerge","from","Stefan","'s","mind",".","the","cold-blooded","surgeon","use","to","work","in","the","dissect","room",".","there","be","a","cinema","where","everyone","would","go","on","the","weekend",".","a","state","of","complete","delirium","cause","a","young","man","'s","heart","to","stop","beating",".","in","drift","through","memory","and","the","imaginary",",","Stefan","witness","death",",","mental","illness","and","the","margin","of","humanity","in","a","passing","world","that","resemble","we","own",".","all","that","remains","be","ruin","-","everything","begin","to","dissolve",".","the","concrete","world","no","longer","resemble","the","one","that","he","be","force","to","leave",".","internal","chaos","be","mirror","by","external","chaos","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Stefan attempts to","attempts to make","to make his","make his way","his way through","way through a","through a post-industrial","a post-industrial no-man","post-industrial no-man 's","no-man 's land","An encounter with","encounter with a","with a stranger","a stranger forces","stranger forces the","forces the line","the line between","line between reality","between reality and","reality and imagination","and imagination to","imagination to become","to become blurred","The future and","future and the","and the past","the past become","past become intertwined","Visions of another","of another time","another time emerge","time emerge from","emerge from Stefan","from Stefan 's","Stefan 's mind","The cold-blooded surgeon","cold-blooded surgeon used","surgeon used to","used to work","to work in","work in the","in the dissecting","the dissecting room","There was a","was a cinema","a cinema where","cinema where everyone","where everyone would","everyone would go","would go on","go on the","on the weekend","A state of","state of complete","of complete delirium","complete delirium caused","delirium caused a","caused a young","a young man","young man 's","man 's heart","'s heart to","heart to stop","to stop beating","In drifting through","drifting through memory","through memory and","memory and the","and the imaginary","the imaginary ,","imaginary , Stefan",", Stefan witnesses","Stefan witnesses death","witnesses death ,","death , mental",", mental illness","mental illness and","illness and the","and the margins","the margins of","margins of humanity","of humanity in","humanity in a","in a passing","a passing world","passing world that","world that resembles","that resembles our","resembles our own","All that remains","that remains are","remains are ruins","are ruins -","ruins -

{"title":"When the Queen Came to Town","plot":"The Queen's maiden visit to Australia in 1954 marked the end of one era and the dawn of another. It was post-depression, post WWII, and pre TV, and Australians came in their millions to bask in the presence of a monarch. These memories and the footage captured are still vivid to this day. Drawing on the 35mm Technicolor cinemascope film footage and home movies shot by those who witnessed the pageantry and ceremony, we will recreate that time and reflect on how it touched the lives and fabric of Australian society. When Queen Came to Town- Coming soon to cinemas near YOU.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Queen","'s","maiden","visit","to","Australia","in","1954","mark","the","end","of","one","era","and","the","dawn","of","anoth",".","It","was","post-depress",",","post","WWII",",","and","pre","TV",",","and","Australian","came","in","their","million","to","bask","in","the","presenc","of","a","monarch",".","These","memori","and","the","footag","captur","are","still","vivid","to","this","day",".","Draw","on","the","35mm","Technicolor","cinemascop","film","footag","and","home","movi","shot","by","those","who","wit","the","pageantri","and","ceremoni",",","we","will","recreat","that","time","and","reflect","on","how","it","touch","the","live","and","fabric","of","Australian","societi",".","When","Queen","Came","to","Town","-","Come","soon","to","cinema","near","YOU","."],"lemmas":["the","Queen","'s","maiden","visit","to","Australia","in","1954","mark","the","end","of","one","era","and","the","dawn","of","another",".","it","be","post-depression",",","post","WWII",",","and","pre","tv",",","and","Australians","come","in","they","million","to","bask","in","the","presence","of","a","monarch",".","these","memory","and","the","footage","capture","be","still","vivid","to","this","day",".","draw","on","the","35mm","technicolor","cinemascope","film","footage","and","home","movie","shoot","by","those","who","witness","the","pageantry","and","ceremony",",","we","will","recreate","that","time","and","reflect","on","how","it","touch","the","life","and","fabric","of","australian","society",".","when","Queen","Came","to","Town","-","come","soon","to","cinema","near","you","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The Queen 's","Queen 's maiden","'s maiden visit","maiden visit to","visit to Australia","to Australia in","Australia in 1954","in 1954 marked","1954 marked the","marked the end","the end of","end of one","of one era","one era and","era and the","and the dawn","the dawn of","dawn of another","It was post-depression","was post-depression ,","post-depression , post",", post WWII","post WWII ,","WWII , and",", and pre","and pre TV","pre TV ,","TV , and",", and Australians","and Australians came","Australians came in","came in their","in their millions","their millions to","millions to bask","to bask in","bask in the","in the presence","the presence of","presence of a","of a monarch","These memories and","memories and the","and the footage","the footage captured","footage captured are","captured are still","are still vivid","still vivid to","vivid to this","to this day","Drawing on the","on the 35mm","the 35mm Technicolor","35mm Technicolor cinemascope","Technicolor cinemascope film","cinemascope film footage","film footage and","footage and home","and home movies","home movies shot","movies shot by","shot by those","by those who","those who witnessed","who witnessed the","witnessed the pageantry","the pageantry and","pageantry and ceremony","and ceremony ,","ceremony , we",", we will","we will recreate","will recreate that","recreate that time","that time and","time and reflect","and reflect on","reflect on how","on how it","how it touched","it touched the","touched the lives","the lives and","lives and fabric","and fabric of","fabric of Australian","of Australian society","When Queen Came","Queen Came to","Came to Town","to Town -","Town - Coming","- Coming soon","Coming soon to","soon to cinemas","to cinemas near","cinemas near YOU"],"2grams":["The Queen","Queen 's","'s maiden","maiden visit","visit to","to Australia","Australia in","in 1954","1954 marked","marked the","the end","end of","of one","one era","era and","and the","the dawn","dawn of","of another","It was","was post-depression","post-depression ,",", post","post WWII","WWII ,",", and","and pre","pre TV","TV ,",", and","and Australians","Australians came","came in","in their","their millions","millions to","to bask","bask in","in the","the presence","presence of","of a","a monarch","These memories","memories and","and the","the footage","footage captured","captured are","are still","still vivid","vivid to","to this","this day","Drawing on","on the","the 35mm","35mm Technicolor","Technicolor cinemascope","cinemascope film","film footage","footage and","and home","home movies","movies shot","shot by","by those","those who","who witnessed","witnessed the","the pageantry","pageantry and","and ceremony","ceremony ,",", we","we will","will recreate","recreate that","that time","time and","and reflect","reflect on","on how","how it","it touched","touched the","the lives","lives and","and fabric","fabric of","of Australian","Australian society","When Queen","Queen Came","Came to","to Town","Town -","- Coming","Coming soon","soon to","to cinemas","cinemas near","near YOU"]}

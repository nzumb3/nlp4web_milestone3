Among them is an obese and ugly man. He appears from nowhere and threatens Kai's life. Fighting with him day after day has pushed Kai's sanity to the verge of collapsing. Kai has finally completed the horror series. The book becomes an immediate hit. However, fame does not make Kai any happier. Every story in his book is inextricably intertwined with his own life.

{"title":"Losing It","plot":"'Losing It' follows Andy Fodor's quest to lose weight in the the three months leading up to his wedding. He eats only fast food for one month, only meat for one month, and only gas station food for one month. The effects of these 'bad' diets, not only on his weight but also on his overall health, are examined. While following Andy on the diet, a humorous perspective is given on the obesity problem in America. Are unhealthy foods to blame for the increasing obesity problem in America? Is the obesity problem as severe as we are told? How can this problem be solved?","genres":["Comedy"," Documentary"],"stems":["'","Lose","It","'","follow","Andi","Fodor","'s","quest","to","lose","weight","in","the","the","three","month","lead","up","to","his","wed",".","He","eat","onli","fast","food","for","one","month",",","onli","meat","for","one","month",",","and","onli","gas","station","food","for","one","month",".","The","effect","of","these","'","bad","'","diet",",","not","onli","on","his","weight","but","also","on","his","overal","health",",","are","examin",".","While","follow","Andi","on","the","diet",",","a","humor","perspect","is","given","on","the","obes","problem","in","America",".","Are","unhealthi","food","to","blame","for","the","increas","obes","problem","in","America","?","Is","the","obes","problem","as","sever","as","we","are","told","?","How","can","this","problem","be","solv","?"],"lemmas":["'","lose","it","'","follow","Andy","Fodor","'s","quest","to","lose","weight","in","the","the","three","month","lead","up","to","he","wedding",".","he","eat","only","fast","food","for","one","month",",","only","meat","for","one","month",",","and","only","gas","station","food","for","one","month",".","the","effect","of","these","'","bad","'","diet",",","not","only","on","he","weight","but","also","on","he","overall","health",",","be","examine",".","while","follow","Andy","on","the","diet",",","a","humorous","perspective","be","give","on","the","obesity","problem","in","America",".","be","unhealthy","food","to","blame","for","the","increase","obesity","problem","in","America","?","be","the","obesity","problem","as","severe","as","we","be","tell","?","how","can","this","problem","be","solve","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Losing It","Losing It '","It ' follows","' follows Andy","follows Andy Fodor","Andy Fodor 's","Fodor 's quest","'s quest to","quest to lose","to lose weight","lose weight in","weight in the","in the the","the the three","the three months","three months leading","months leading up","leading up to","up to his","to his wedding","He eats only","eats only fast","only fast food","fast food for","food for one","for one month","one month ,","month , only",", only meat","only meat for","meat for one","for one month","one month ,","month , and",", and only","and only gas","only gas station","gas station food","station food for","food for one","for one month","The effects of","effects of these","of these '","these ' bad","' bad '","bad ' diets","' diets ,","diets , not",", not only","not only on","only on his","on his weight","his weight but","weight but also","but also on","also on his","on his overall","his overall health","overall health ,","health , are",", are examined","While following Andy","following Andy on","Andy on the","on the diet","the diet ,","diet , a",", a humorous","a humorous perspective","humorous perspective is","perspective is given","is given on","given on the","on the obesity","the obesity problem","obesity problem in","problem in America","Are unhealthy foods","unhealthy foods to","foods to blame","to blame for","blame for the","for the increasing","the increasing obesity","increasing obesity problem","obesity problem in","problem in America","Is the obesity","the obesity problem","obesity problem as","problem as severe","as severe as","severe as we","as we are","we are told","How can this","can this problem","this problem be","problem be solved"],"2grams":["' Losing","Losing It","It '","' follows","follows Andy","Andy Fodor","Fodor 's","'s quest","quest to","to lose","lose weight","weight in","in the","the the","the three","three months","months leading","leading up","up to","to his","his wedding","He eats","eats only","only fast","fast food","food for","for one","one month","month ,",", only","only meat","meat for","for one","one month","month ,",", and","and only","only gas","gas station","station food","food for","for one","one month","The effects","effects of","of these","these '","' bad","bad '","' diets","diets ,",", not","not only","only on","on his","his weight","weight but","but also","also on","on his","his overall","overall health","health ,",", are","are examined","While following","following Andy","Andy on","on the","the diet","diet ,",", a","a humorous","humorous perspective","perspective is","is given","given on","on the","the obesity","obesity problem","problem in","in America","Are unhealthy","unhealthy foods","foods to","to blame","blame for","for the","the increasing","increasing obesity","obesity problem","problem in","in America","Is the","the obesity","obesity problem","problem as","as severe","severe as","as we","we are","are told","How can","can this","this problem","problem be","be solved"]}

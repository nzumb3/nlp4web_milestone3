{"title":"Hell in a Handbag","plot":"A video surfaces in the media that appears to show a local Parish priest (Martin Cummins) executing a defenseless man. The church brings in lawyer David Mallory (Lochlyn Munro) to defend the priest and protect its interests. As David gathers the information he needs for the defense, he sees that things are not entirely what they appear to be. Hell in a Handbag is the chronicles the adventures of Father Michael, an embittered gun-toting exorcist priest, his at times volatile partner, the leather-clad Sister Joan (Christine Wallace), and their band of misfits including rabbi Ratzenberger (Brian Markinson), Russian bodyguard Silver (Callum Keith Rennie), vampire pal Terrance (Ian Tracey) and cross-dressing techie Ellis (Jarod Joseph), as they fight a covert battle against Satan and his minions. On the surface, Hell in a Handbag is a straight up Horror Action but upon closer look one can see it is a comedy in disguise. The challenges and roadblocks take our characters and the audience down a path, which perhaps they did not expect; all the while charging relentlessly toward what could be an inescapable and tragic end.","genres":["Action"," Horror","

{"title":"Kupica","plot":"This is a film about a tiny pub called the Kupica, situated in the gloomy Eastern European city of Zagreb and run by a woman called Barbara. The story follows the pub's band that plays on Fridays. Anyone who can play is welcome to join the Kupica band. The players are not virtuosos, but nevertheless they enjoy playing, joking and having fun. There is a tram station in front of the pub and sometimes tram-passengers are unable to hide their surprise - more often then not, joining in with the players. This is a kind of the Eastern European Social Club in which the marginalized, the forgotten, the alcoholics, and the lonely scream with joy in the midst of depression.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["This","is","a","film","about","a","tini","pub","call","the","Kupica",",","situat","in","the","gloomi","Eastern","European","citi","of","Zagreb","and","run","by","a","woman","call","Barbara",".","The","stori","follow","the","pub","'s","band","that","play","on","Friday",".","Anyon","who","can","play","is","welcom","to","join","the","Kupica","band",".","The","player","are","not","virtuoso",",","but","nevertheless","they","enjoy","play",",","joke","and","have","fun",".","There","is","a","tram","station","in","front","of","the","pub","and","sometim","tram-passeng","are","unabl","to","hide","their","surpris","-","more","often","then","not",",","join","in","with","the","player",".","This","is","a","kind","of","the","Eastern","European","Social","Club","in","which","the","margin",",","the","forgotten",",","the","alcohol",",","and","the","lone","scream","with","joy","in","the","midst","of","depress","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","film","about","a","tiny","pub","call","the","Kupica",",","situate","in","the","gloomy","eastern","european","city","of","Zagreb","and","run","by","a","woman","call","Barbara",".","the","story","follow","the","pub","'s","band","that","play","on","Fridays",".","anyone","who","can","play","be","welcome","to","join","the","Kupica","band",".","the","player","be","not","virtuoso",",","but","nevertheless","they","enjoy","play",",","joke","and","have","fun",".","there","be","a","tram","station","in","front","of","the","pub","and","sometimes","tram-passenger","be","unable","to","hide","they","surprise","-","more","often","then","not",",","join","in","with","the","player",".","this","be","a","kind","of","the","Eastern","European","Social","Club","in","which","the","marginalize",",","the","forget",",","the","alcoholic",",","and","the","lonely","scream","with","joy","in","the","midst","of","depression","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This is a","is a film","a film about","film about a","about a tiny","a tiny pub","tiny pub called","pub called the","called the Kupica","the Kupica ,","Kupica , situated",", situated in","situated in the","in the gloomy","the gloomy Eastern","gloomy Eastern European","Eastern European city","European city of","city of Zagreb","of Zagreb and","Zagreb and run","and run by","run by a","by a woman","a woman called","woman called Barbara","The story follows","story follows the","follows the pub","the pub 's","pub 's band","'s band that","band that plays","that plays on","plays on Fridays","Anyone who can","who can play","can play is","play is welcome","is welcome to","welcome to join","to join the","join the Kupica","the Kupica band","The players are","players are not","are not virtuosos","not virtuosos ,","virtuosos , but",", but nevertheless","but nevertheless they","nevertheless they enjoy","they enjoy playing","enjoy playing ,","playing , joking",", joking and","joking and having","and having fun","There is a","is a tram","a tram station","tram station in","station in front","in front of","front of the","of the pub","the pub and","pub and sometimes","and sometimes tram-passengers","sometimes tram-passengers are","tram-passengers are unable","are unable to","unable to hide","to hide their","hide their surprise","their surprise -","surprise -

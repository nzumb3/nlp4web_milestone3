{"title":"The Door","plot":"Unemployed and broke, Owen is having a terrible week. It's not until he saves a wealthy Japanese businessman from a couple of thugs that Owen's luck begins to change. He's promised an easy job with very good pay. $500 a night. 5 nights a week. All Owen has to do is wear a uniform, sit in a chair and make sure that an ominous door is never opened. Following an unexpected late night visit, Owen soon finds himself stepping into the darkness, unsure if he will survive the night or escape the fate that waits for him behind The Door.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Unemploy","and","broke",",","Owen","is","have","a","terribl","week",".","It","'s","not","until","he","save","a","wealthi","Japanes","businessman","from","a","coupl","of","thug","that","Owen","'s","luck","begin","to","chang",".","He","'s","promis","an","easi","job","with","veri","good","pay",".","$","500","a","night",".","5","night","a","week",".","All","Owen","has","to","do","is","wear","a","uniform",",","sit","in","a","chair","and","make","sure","that","an","omin","door","is","never","open",".","Follow","an","unexpect","late","night","visit",",","Owen","soon","find","himself","step","into","the","dark",",","unsur","if","he","will","surviv","the","night","or","escap","the","fate","that","wait","for","him","behind","The","Door","."],"lemmas":["Unemployed","and","break",",","Owen","be","have","a","terrible","week",".","it","be","not","until","he","save","a","wealthy","japanese","businessman","from","a","couple","of","thug","that","Owen","'s","luck","begin","to","change",".","he","be","promise","a","easy","job","with","very","good","pay",".","$","500","a","night",".","5","night","a","week",".","all","Owen","have","to","do","be","wear","a","uniform",",","sit","in","a","chair","and","make","sure","that","a","ominous","door","be","never","open",".","follow","a","unexpected","late","night","visit",",","Owen","soon","find","himself","step","into","the","darkness",",","unsure","if","he","will","survive","the","night","or","escape","the","fate","that","wait","for","he","behind","the","Door","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Unemployed and broke","and broke ,","broke , Owen",", Owen is","Owen is having","is having a","having a terrible","a terrible week","It 's not","'s not until","not until he","until he saves","he saves a","saves a wealthy","a wealthy Japanese","wealthy Japanese businessman","Japanese businessman from","businessman from a","from a couple","a couple of","couple of thugs","of thugs that","thugs that Owen","that Owen 's","Owen 's luck","'s luck begins","luck begins to","begins to change","He 's promised","'s promised an","promised an easy","an easy job","easy job with","job with very","with very good","very good pay","$ 500 a","500 a night","5 nights a","nights a week","All Owen has","Owen has to","has to do","to do is","do is wear","is wear a","wear a uniform","a uniform ,","uniform , sit",", sit in","sit in a","in a chair","a chair and","chair and make","and make sure","make sure that","sure that an","that an ominous","an ominous door","ominous door is","door is never","is never opened","Following an unexpected","an unexpected late","unexpected late night","late night visit","night visit ,","visit , Owen",", Owen soon","Owen soon finds","soon finds himself","finds himself stepping","himself stepping into","stepping into the","into the darkness","the darkness ,","darkness , unsure",", unsure if","unsure if he","if he will","he will survive","will survive the","survive the night","the night or","night or escape","or escape the","escape the fate","the fate that","fate that waits","that waits for","waits for him","for him behind","him behind The","behind The Door"],"2grams":["Unemployed and","and broke","broke ,",", Owen","Owen is","is having","having a","a terrible","terrible week","It 's","'s not","not until","until he","he saves","saves a","a wealthy","wealthy Japanese","Japanese businessman","businessman from","from a","a couple","couple of","of thugs","thugs that","that Owen","Owen 's","'s luck","luck begins","begins to","to change","He 's","'s promised","promised an","an easy","easy job","job with","with very","very good","good pay","$ 500","500 a","a night","5 nights","nights a","a week","All Owen","Owen has","has to","to do","do is","is wear","wear a","a uniform","uniform ,",", sit","sit in","in a","a chair","chair and","and make","make sure","sure that","that an","an ominous","ominous door","door is","is never","never opened","Following an","an unexpected","unexpected late","late night","night visit","visit ,",", Owen","Owen soon","soon finds","finds himself","himself stepping","stepping into","into the","the darkness","darkness ,",", unsure","unsure if","if he","he will","will survive","survive the","the night","night or","or escape","escape the","the fate","fate that","that waits","waits for","for him","him behind","behind The","The Door"]}

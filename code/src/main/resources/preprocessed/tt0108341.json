Following the announcement of his impending marriage to his film-making partner Marilyn Levine - marriage something that he and his family never thought would happen for him - McElwee turns on the camera to film life as it happens in respect to this new phase in his life. Both in real terms (as it applies to himself and those around him) and philosophical terms, McElwee discusses, through self-narration, life, death, love, family and babies.","genres":["Biography"],"stems":["Forti","year","old","documentari","filmmak","Ross","McElwee","has","a","penchant","for","film","everyth","around","him",".","Follow","the","announc","of","his","impend","marriag","to","his","film-mak","partner","Marilyn","Levin","-","marriag","someth","that","he","and","his","famili","never","thought","would","happen","for","him","-","McElwee","turn","on","the","camera","to","film","life","as","it","happen","in","respect","to","this","new","phase","in","his","life",".","Both","in","real","term","(","as","it","appli","to","himself","and","those","around","him",")","and","philosoph","term",",","McElwee","discuss",",","through","self-narr",",","life",",","death",",","love",",","famili","and","babi","."],"lemmas":["forty","year","old","documentary","filmmaker","Ross","McElwee","have","a","penchant","for","film","everything","around","he",".","follow","the","announcement","of","he","impending","marriage","to","he","film-making","partner","Marilyn","Levine","-","marriage","something","that","he","and","he","family","never","think","would","happen","for","he","-","McElwee","turn","on","the","camera","to","film","life","as","it","happen","in","respect","to","this","new","phase","in","he","life",".","both","in","real","term","-lrb-","as","it","apply","to","himself","and","those","around","he","-rrb-","and","philosophical","term",",","McElwee","discuss",",","through","self-narration",",","life",",","death",",","love",",","family","and","baby","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Forty year old","year old documentary","old documentary filmmaker","documentary filmmaker Ross","filmmaker Ross McElwee","Ross McElwee has","McElwee has a","has a penchant","a penchant for","penchant for filming","for filming everything","filming everything around","everything around him","Following the announcement","the announcement of","announcement of his","of his impending","his impending marriage","impending marriage to","marriage to his","to his film-making","his film-making partner","film-making partner Marilyn","partner Marilyn Levine","Marilyn Levine -","Levine - marriage","- marriage something","marriage something that","something that he","that he and","he and his","and his family","his family never","family never thought","never thought would","thought would happen","would happen for","happen for him","for him -","him - McElwee","- McElwee turns","McElwee turns on","turns on the","on the camera","the camera to","camera to film","to film life","film life as","life as it","as it happens","it happens in","happens in respect","in respect to","respect to this","to this new","this new phase","new phase in","phase in his","in his life","Both in real","in real terms","real terms (","terms ( as","( as it","as it applies","it applies to","applies to himself","to himself and","himself and those","and those around","those around him","around him )","him ) and",") and philosophical","and philosophical terms","philosophical terms ,","terms , McElwee",", McElwee discusses","McElwee discusses ,","discusses , through",", through self-narration","through self-narration ,","self-narration , life",", life ,","life , death",", death ,","death , love",", love ,","love , family",", family and","family and babies"],"2grams":["Forty year","year old","old documentary","documentary filmmaker","filmmaker Ross","Ross McElwee","McElwee has","has a","a penchant","penchant for","for filming","filming everything","everything around","around him","Following the","the announcement","announcement of","of his","his impending","impending marriage","marriage to","to his","his film-making","film-making partner","partner Marilyn","Marilyn Levine","Levine -","- marriage","marriage something","something that","that he","he and","and his","his family","family never","never thought","thought would","would happen","happen for","for him","him -","- McElwee","McElwee turns","turns on","on the","the camera","camera to","to film","film life","life as","as it","it happens","happens in","in respect","respect to","to this","this new","new phase","phase in","in his","his life","Both in","in real","real terms","terms (","( as","as it","it applies","applies to","to himself","himself and","and those","those around","around him","him )",") and","and philosophical","philosophical terms","terms ,",", McElwee","McElwee discusses","discusses ,",", through","through self-narration","self-narration ,",", life","life ,",", death","death ,",", love","love ,",", family","family and","and babies"]}

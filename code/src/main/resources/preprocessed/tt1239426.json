{"title":"Hipsters","plot":"While the Cold War heats up on the world stage, rebellious youth in 1955 Moscow wage a cultural battle against dismal Soviet conformity, donning brightly colored black-market clothing, adopting American nicknames and reveling in forbidden jazz. Straight-laced 20-year-old Communist Mels finds these brazen 'hipsters' shocking until he falls under the spell of one, namely Polly, and joins the new revolution. Soon he's a peacock, cavorting in the latest flashy fashions, sporting an enormous pompadour and wailing on the saxophone.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Musical"],"stems":["While","the","Cold","War","heat","up","on","the","world","stage",",","rebelli","youth","in","1955","Moscow","wage","a","cultur","battl","against","dismal","Soviet","conform",",","don","bright","color","black-market","cloth",",","adopt","American","nicknam","and","revel","in","forbidden","jazz",".","Straight-lac","20-year-old","Communist","Mel","find","these","brazen","'","hipster","'","shock","until","he","fall","under","the","spell","of","one",",","name","Polli",",","and","join","the","new","revolut",".","Soon","he","'s","a","peacock",",","cavort","in","the","latest","flashi","fashion",",","sport","an","enorm","pompadour","and","wail","on","the","saxophon","."],"lemmas":["while","the","Cold","War","heat","up","on","the","world","stage",",","rebellious","youth","in","1955","Moscow","wage","a","cultural","battle","against","dismal","soviet","conformity",",","don","brightly","color","black-market","clothing",",","adopt","american","nickname","and","revel","in","forbid","jazz",".","straight-laced","20-year-old","Communist","Mels","find","these","brazen","'","hipster","'","shocking","until","he","fall","under","the","spell","of","one",",","namely","Polly",",","and","join","the","new","revolution",".","soon","he","be","a","peacock",",","cavort","in","the","latest","flashy","fashion",",","sport","a","enormous","pompadour","and","wail","on","the","saxophone","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["While the Cold","the Cold War","Cold War heats","War heats up","heats up on","up on the","on the world","the world stage","world stage ,","stage , rebellious",", rebellious youth","rebellious youth in","youth in 1955","in 1955 Moscow","1955 Moscow wage","Moscow wage a","wage a cultural","a cultural battle","cultural battle against","battle against dismal","against dismal Soviet","dismal Soviet conformity","Soviet conformity ,","conformity , donning",", donning brightly","donning brightly colored","brightly colored black-market","colored black-market clothing","black-market clothing ,","clothing , adopting",", adopting American","adopting American nicknames","American nicknames and","nicknames and reveling","and reveling in","reveling in forbidden","in forbidden jazz","Straight-laced 20-year-old Communist","20-year-old Communist Mels","Communist Mels finds","Mels finds these","finds these brazen","these brazen '","brazen ' hipsters","' hipsters '","hipsters ' shocking","' shocking until","shocking until he","until he falls","he falls under","falls under the","under the spell","the spell of","spell of one","of one ,","one , namely",", namely Polly","namely Polly ,","Polly , and",", and joins","and joins the","joins the new","the new revolution","Soon he 's","he 's a","'s a peacock","a peacock ,","peacock , cavorting",", cavorting in","cavorting in the","in the latest","the latest flashy","latest flashy fashions","flashy fashions ,","fashions , sporting",", sporting an","sporting an enormous","an enormous pompadour","enormous pompadour and","pompadour and wailing","and wailing on","wailing on the","on the saxophone"],"2grams":["While the","the Cold","Cold War","War heats","heats up","up on","on the","the world","world stage","stage ,",", rebellious","rebellious youth","youth in","in 1955","1955 Moscow","Moscow wage","wage a","a cultural","cultural battle","battle against","against dismal","dismal Soviet","Soviet conformity","conformity ,",", donning","donning brightly","brightly colored","colored black-market","black-market clothing","clothing ,",", adopting","adopting American","American nicknames","nicknames and","and reveling","reveling in","in forbidden","forbidden jazz","Straight-laced 20-year-old","20-year-old Communist","Communist Mels","Mels finds","finds these","these brazen","brazen '","' hipsters","hipsters '","' shocking","shocking until","until he","he falls","falls under","under the","the spell","spell of","of one","one ,",", namely","namely Polly","Polly ,",", and","and joins","joins the","the new","new revolution","Soon he","he 's","'s a","a peacock","peacock ,",", cavorting","cavorting in","in the","the latest","latest flashy","flashy fashions","fashions ,",", sporting","sporting an","an enormous","enormous pompadour","pompadour and","and wailing","wailing on","on the","the saxophone"]}

{"title":"Flower and Sword","plot":"How about conducting battle, but with flowers in lieu of weapons? There were monks who did ikebana, or Japanese flower arrangement, following a war. There was once an actually famous monk in Kyoto, Japan circa 1594 with exemplary ikebana skills. A shogun, or lord, invites him to do ikebana for him. Responding to the request the monk goes to Gifu castle, but a below average performance leads to shogun's wrath.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["How","about","conduct","battl",",","but","with","flower","in","lieu","of","weapon","?","There","were","monk","who","did","ikebana",",","or","Japanes","flower","arrang",",","follow","a","war",".","There","was","onc","an","actual","famous","monk","in","Kyoto",",","Japan","circa","1594","with","exemplari","ikebana","skill",".","A","shogun",",","or","lord",",","invit","him","to","do","ikebana","for","him",".","Respond","to","the","request","the","monk","goe","to","Gifu","castl",",","but","a","below","averag","perform","lead","to","shogun","'s","wrath","."],"lemmas":["how","about","conduct","battle",",","but","with","flower","in","lieu","of","weapon","?","there","be","monk","who","do","ikebana",",","or","japanese","flower","arrangement",",","follow","a","war",".","there","be","once","a","actually","famous","monk","in","Kyoto",",","Japan","circa","1594","with","exemplary","ikebana","skill",".","a","shogun",",","or","lord",",","invite","he","to","do","ikebana","for","he",".","respond","to","the","request","the","monk","go","to","Gifu","castle",",","but","a","below","average","performance","lead","to","shogun","'s","wrath","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["How about conducting","about conducting battle","conducting battle ,","battle , but",", but with","but with flowers","with flowers in","flowers in lieu","in lieu of","lieu of weapons","There were monks","were monks who","monks who did","who did ikebana","did ikebana ,","ikebana , or",", or Japanese","or Japanese flower","Japanese flower arrangement","flower arrangement ,","arrangement , following",", following a","following a war","There was once","was once an","once an actually","an actually famous","actually famous monk","famous monk in","monk in Kyoto","in Kyoto ,","Kyoto , Japan",", Japan circa","Japan circa 1594","circa 1594 with","1594 with exemplary","with exemplary ikebana","exemplary ikebana skills","A shogun ,","shogun , or",", or lord","or lord ,","lord , invites",", invites him","invites him to","him to do","to do ikebana","do ikebana for","ikebana for him","Responding to the","to the request","the request the","request the monk","the monk goes","monk goes to","goes to Gifu","to Gifu castle","Gifu castle ,","castle , but",", but a","but a below","a below average","below average performance","average performance leads","performance leads to","leads to shogun","to shogun 's","shogun 's wrath"],"2grams":["How about","about conducting","conducting battle","battle ,",", but","but with","with flowers","flowers in","in lieu","lieu of","of weapons","There were","were monks","monks who","who did","did ikebana","ikebana ,",", or","or Japanese","Japanese flower","flower arrangement","arrangement ,",", following","following a","a war","There was","was once","once an","an actually","actually famous","famous monk","monk in","in Kyoto","Kyoto ,",", Japan","Japan circa","circa 1594","1594 with","with exemplary","exemplary ikebana","ikebana skills","A shogun","shogun ,",", or","or lord","lord ,",", invites","invites him","him to","to do","do ikebana","ikebana for","for him","Responding to","to the","the request","request the","the monk","monk goes","goes to","to Gifu","Gifu castle","castle ,",", but","but a","a below","below average","average performance","performance leads","leads to","to shogun","shogun 's","'s wrath"]}

{"title":"For the Bible Tells Me So","plot":"We meet five Christian families, each with a gay or lesbian child. Parents talk about their marriages and church-going, their children's childhood and coming out, their reactions, and changes over time. The stories told by these nine parents and four adult children alternate with talking heads - Protestant and Jewish theologians - and with film clips of fundamentalist preachers and pundits and news clips of people in the street. They discuss scripture and biblical scholarship. A thesis of the film is that much of Christianity's homophobia represents a misreading of scripture, a denial of science, and an embrace of quack psychology. The families call for love.","genres":["Documentary"," Romance"],"stems":["We","meet","five","Christian","famili",",","each","with","a","gay","or","lesbian","child",".","Parent","talk","about","their","marriag","and","church-go",",","their","children","'s","childhood","and","come","out",",","their","reaction",",","and","chang","over","time",".","The","stori","told","by","these","nine","parent","and","four","adult","children","altern","with","talk","head","-","Protest","and","Jewish","theologian","-","and","with","film","clip","of","fundamentalist","preacher","and","pundit","and","news","clip","of","peopl","in","the","street",".","They","discuss","scriptur","and","biblic","scholarship",".","A","thesi","of","the","film","is","that","much","of","Christian","'s","homophobia","repres","a","misread","of","scriptur",",","a","denial","of","scienc",",","and","an","embrac","of","quack","psycholog",".","The","famili","call","for","love","."],"lemmas":["we","meet","five","Christian","family",",","each","with","a","gay","or","lesbian","child",".","parent","talk","about","they","marriage","and","church-going",",","they","child","'s","childhood","and","come","out",",","they","reaction",",","and","change","over","time",".","the","story","tell","by","these","nine","parent","and","four","adult","child","alternate","with","talk","head","-","protestant","and","jewish","theologian","-","and","with","film","clip","of","fundamentalist","preacher","and","pundit","and","news","clip","of","people","in","the","street",".","they","discuss","scripture","and","biblical","scholarship",".","a","thesis","of","the","film","be","that","much","of","Christianity","'s","homophobia","represent","a","misreading","of","scripture",",","a","denial","of","science",",","and","a","embrace","of","quack","psychology",".","the","family","call","for","love","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["We meet five","meet five Christian","five Christian families","Christian families ,","families , each",", each with","each with a","with a gay","a gay or","gay or lesbian","or lesbian child","Parents talk about","talk about their","about their marriages","their marriages and","marriages and church-going","and church-going ,","church-going , their",", their children","their children 's","children 's childhood","'s childhood and","childhood and coming","and coming out","coming out ,","out , their",", their reactions","their reactions ,","reactions , and",", and changes","and changes over","changes over time","The stories told","stories told by","told by these","by these nine","these nine parents","nine parents and","parents and four","and four adult","four adult children","adult children alternate","children alternate with","alternate with talking","with talking heads","talking heads -","heads -

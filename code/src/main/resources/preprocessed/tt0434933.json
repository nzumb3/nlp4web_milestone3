{"title":"Felicia and the Great Quebec","plot":"This film is a fully improvised account of actual events about a soap opera star who must record a banal song for her soon to be released single. Performers from the Upright Citizens Brigade, Mad T.V., Saturday Night Live, The Second City, and Late Night with Conan O'Brian whip up a storm with their improvisational skills in this utterly independent, horribly funny comedy. Filmmaker Jonathan Appel created this vision while pursuing the first ever Master's of Arts in Improvisational Theater from the Gallatin School of New York University. A result of years of study and over a decade of commitment to this ephemeral art, Felicia and the Great Quebec was shot in a single day in Chelsea, New York.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["This","film","is","a","fulli","improvis","account","of","actual","event","about","a","soap","opera","star","who","must","record","a","banal","song","for","her","soon","to","be","releas","singl",".","Perform","from","the","Upright","Citizen","Brigad",",","Mad","T.V.",",","Saturday","Night","Live",",","The","Second","Citi",",","and","Late","Night","with","Conan","O'Brian","whip","up","a","storm","with","their","improvis","skill","in","this","utter","independ",",","horribl","funni","comedi",".","Filmmak","Jonathan","Appel","creat","this","vision","while","pursu","the","first","ever","Master","'s","of","Arts","in","Improvis","Theater","from","the","Gallatin","School","of","New","York","Univers",".","A","result","of","year","of","studi","and","over","a","decad","of","commit","to","this","ephemer","art",",","Felicia","and","the","Great","Quebec","was","shot","in","a","singl","day","in","Chelsea",",","New","York","."],"lemmas":["this","film","be","a","fully","improvise","account","of","actual","event","about","a","soap","opera","star","who","must","record","a","banal","song","for","she","soon","to","be","release","single",".","performer","from","the","Upright","Citizens","brigade",",","Mad","T.V.",",","Saturday","Night","Live",",","The","Second","City",",","and","Late","Night","with","Conan","O'Brian","whip","up","a","storm","with","they","improvisational","skill","in","this","utterly","independent",",","horribly","funny","comedy",".","Filmmaker","Jonathan","Appel","create","this","vision","while","pursue","the","first","ever","Master","'s","of","Arts","in","Improvisational","Theater","from","the","Gallatin","School","of","New","York","University",".","a","result","of","year","of","study","and","over","a","decade","of","commitment","to","this","ephemeral","art",",","Felicia","and","the","Great","Quebec","be","shoot","in","a","single","day","in","Chelsea",",","New","York","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This

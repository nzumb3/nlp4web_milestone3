{"title":"Chosin","plot":"In the winter of 1950, 15,000 U.S. Soldiers and Marines were surrounded and trapped by an overwhelming force of communist Chinese soldiers in the frozen mountains of North Korea. Facing impossible odds, the men fought 78 miles to freedom and saved the lives of 98,000 civilian refugees. Chosin is the first-ever documentary on the Chosin Reservoir Campaign. Presented in full, immersive HD, the stories of our veterans are supplemented with rare black and white and color archival footage gathered from hundreds of hours of research. After 60 years of silence, the survivors of the campaign take us on an emotional and heart-pounding journey through one of the most savage battles in American history. These first-hand accounts, combined with footage never before seen by most Americans, create a visceral, emotionally charged experience unlike that provided by any other war documentary. As a fellow combat veteran, director Brian Iglesias forged a unique connection with the men he interviewed. Time and time again, these men shared stories that they have never told to anyone...not their wives, their children, or their closest friends. Chosin is not the first documentary to give a voice to America's veterans, but the depth of its emotional access is unlike anything previously brought to the screen.","genres":["Documentary"," War","

{"title":"Red Ant Dream","plot":"'Let us declare that the state of war does exist and shall exist', the revolutionary patriot had said almost a hundred years ago, and that forewarning travels into India's present, as armed insurrection simmers in Bastar, in the troubled heart of central India. To the east too, beleaguered adivasis from the mineral-rich hills of Odisha come forth bearing their axes, and their songs. And in the north the swelling protests by Punjabi peasants sees hope coagulate - once more - around that iconic figure of Bhagat Singh, revolutionary martyr of the anti-colonial struggle. But are revolutions even possible anymore? Or have those dreams been ground down into our nightmares? This is a chronicle of those who live the revolutionary ideal in India, a rare encounter with the invisible domain of those whose everyday is a fight for another ideal of the world. Red Ant Dream is the third in a cycle of films that interrogate the workings of Indian democracy, and follows Jashn-e-Azadi (2007) about the idea of freedom for Kashmir, and Words on Water (2002) about the people's movement against large dams in the Narmada valley.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Let","us","declar","that","the","state","of","war","doe","exist","and","shall","exist","'",",","the","revolutionari","patriot","had","said","almost","a","hundr","year","ago",",","and","that","forewarn","travel","into","India","'s","present",",","as","arm","insurrect","simmer","in","Bastar",",","in","the","troubl","heart","of","central","India",".","To","the","east","too",",","beleagu","adivasi","from","the","mineral-rich","hill","of","Odisha","come","forth","bear","their","axe",",","and","their","song",".","And","in","the","north","the","swell","protest","by","Punjabi","peasant","see","hope","coagul","-","onc","more","-","around","that","icon","figur","of","Bhagat","Singh",",","revolutionari","martyr","of","the","anti-coloni","struggl",".","But","are","revolut","even","possibl","anymor","?","Or","have","those","dream","been","ground","down","into","our","nightmar","?","This","is","a","chronicl","of","those","who","live","the","revolutionari","ideal","in","India",",","a","rare","encount","with","the","invis","domain","of","those","whose","everyday","is","a","fight","for","anoth","ideal","of","the","world",".","Red","Ant","Dream","is","the","third","in","a","cycl","of","film","that","interrog","the","work","of","Indian","democraci",",","and","follow","Jashn-e-Azadi","(","2007",")","about","the","idea","of","freedom","for","Kashmir",",","and","Word","on","Water","(","2002",")","about","the","peopl","'s","movement","against","larg","dam","in","the","Narmada","valley","."],"lemmas":["'","let","we","declare","that","the","state","of","war","do","exist","and","shall","exist","'",",","the","revolutionary","patriot","have","say","almost","a","hundred","year","ago",",","and","that","forewarn","travels","into","India","'s","present",",","as","armed","insurrection","simmer","in","Bastar",",","in","the","troubled","heart","of","central","India",".","to","the","east","too",",","beleaguered","adivasis","from","the","mineral-rich","hill","of","Odisha","come","forth","bear","they","axis",",","and","they","song",".","and","in","the","north","the","swell","protest","by","Punjabi","peasant","see","hope","coagulate","-","once","more","-","around","that","iconic","figure","of","Bhagat","Singh",",","revolutionary","martyr","of","the","anti-colonial","struggle",".","but","be","revolution","even","possible","anymore","?","or","have","those","dream","be","grind","down","into","we","nightmare","?","this","be","a","chronicle","of","those","who","live","the","revolutionary","ideal","in","India",",","a","rare","encounter","with","the","invisible","domain","of","those","whose","everyday","be","a","fight","for","another","ideal","of","the","world",".","red","ant","dream","be","the","third","in","a","cycle","of","film","that","interrogate","the","workings","of","indian","democracy",",","and","follow","Jashn-e-Azadi","-lrb-","2007","-rrb-","about","the","idea","of","freedom","for","Kashmir",",","and","word","on","Water","-lrb-","2002","-rrb-","about","the","people","'s","movement","against","large","dam","in","the","Narmada","valley","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Let us","Let us declare","us declare that","declare that the","that the state","the state of","state of war","of war does","war does exist","does exist and","exist and shall","and shall exist","shall exist '","exist ' ,","' , the",", the revolutionary","the revolutionary patriot","revolutionary patriot had","patriot had said","had said almost","said almost a","almost a hundred","a hundred years","hundred years ago","years ago ,","ago , and",", and that","and that forewarning","that forewarning travels","forewarning travels into","travels into India","into India 's","India 's present","'s present ,","present , as",", as armed","as armed insurrection","armed insurrection simmers","insurrection simmers in","simmers in Bastar","in Bastar ,","Bastar , in",", in the","in the troubled","the troubled heart","troubled heart of","heart of central","of central India","To the east","the east too","east too ,","too , beleaguered",", beleaguered adivasis","beleaguered adivasis from","adivasis from the","from the mineral-rich","the mineral-rich hills","mineral-rich hills of","hills of Odisha","of Odisha come","Odisha come forth","come forth bearing","forth bearing their","bearing their axes","their axes ,","axes , and",", and their","and their songs","And in the","in the north","the north the","north the swelling","the swelling protests","swelling protests by","protests by Punjabi","by Punjabi peasants","Punjabi peasants sees","peasants sees hope","sees hope coagulate","hope coagulate -","coagulate -

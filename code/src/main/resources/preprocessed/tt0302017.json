{"title":"Warrior Angels","plot":"In 1190, the knight Elizabeth leaves her young son Peter in England, battles, and is wounded in the Third Holy Crusade. She must return to her village, where she is informed by the local priest that Peter was abducted by the wicked tyrant Grekkor and his powerful knights. Elizabeth decides to build an army to fight against Grekkor, but all the local men are afraid to join. For her crusade of revenge, Elizabeth only counts with the support of three other women: Hunter and her bow and arrows; the prostitute Eve; and the gypsy Sybil and her powders and herbs. Later, the strong Luke also joins her desperate struggle against Grekkor.","genres":["Action"," Adventure"],"stems":["In","1190",",","the","knight","Elizabeth","leav","her","young","son","Peter","in","England",",","battl",",","and","is","wound","in","the","Third","Holi","Crusad",".","She","must","return","to","her","villag",",","where","she","is","inform","by","the","local","priest","that","Peter","was","abduct","by","the","wick","tyrant","Grekkor","and","his","power","knight",".","Elizabeth","decid","to","build","an","armi","to","fight","against","Grekkor",",","but","all","the","local","men","are","afraid","to","join",".","For","her","crusad","of","reveng",",","Elizabeth","onli","count","with","the","support","of","three","other","women",":","Hunter","and","her","bow","and","arrow",";","the","prostitut","Eve",";","and","the","gypsi","Sybil","and","her","powder","and","herb",".","Later",",","the","strong","Luke","also","join","her","desper","struggl","against","Grekkor","."],"lemmas":["in","1190",",","the","knight","Elizabeth","leave","she","young","son","Peter","in","England",",","battle",",","and","be","wound","in","the","Third","Holy","crusade",".","she","must","return","to","she","village",",","where","she","be","inform","by","the","local","priest","that","Peter","be","abducted","by","the","wicked","tyrant","Grekkor","and","he","powerful","knight",".","Elizabeth","decide","to","build","a","army","to","fight","against","Grekkor",",","but","all","the","local","man","be","afraid","to","join",".","for","she","crusade","of","revenge",",","Elizabeth","only","count","with","the","support","of","three","other","woman",":","Hunter","and","she","bow","and","arrow",";","the","prostitute","Eve",";","and","the","gypsy","Sybil","and","she","powder","and","herb",".","later",",","the","strong","Luke","also","join","she","desperate","struggle","against","Grekkor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1190 ,","1190 , the",", the knight","the knight Elizabeth","knight Elizabeth leaves","Elizabeth leaves her","leaves her young","her young son","young son Peter","son Peter in","Peter in England","in England ,","England , battles",", battles ,","battles , and",", and is","and is wounded","is wounded in","wounded in the","in the Third","the Third Holy","Third Holy Crusade","She must return","must return to","return to her","to her village","her village ,","village , where",", where she","where she is","she is informed","is informed by","informed by the","by the local","the local priest","local priest that","priest that Peter","that Peter was","Peter was abducted","was abducted by","abducted by the","by the wicked","the wicked tyrant","wicked tyrant Grekkor","tyrant Grekkor and","Grekkor and his","and his powerful","his powerful knights","Elizabeth decides to","decides to build","to build an","build an army","an army to","army to fight","to fight against","fight against Grekkor","against Grekkor ,","Grekkor , but",", but all","but all the","all the local","the local men","local men are","men are afraid","are afraid to","afraid to join","For her crusade","her crusade of","crusade of revenge","of revenge ,","revenge , Elizabeth",", Elizabeth only","Elizabeth only counts","only counts with","counts with the","with the support","the support of","support of three","of three other","three other women","other women :","women : Hunter",": Hunter and","Hunter and her","and her bow","her bow and","bow and arrows","and arrows ;","arrows ;

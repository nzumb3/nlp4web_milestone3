{"title":"Dove siete? Io sono qui","plot":"Fausto's mother refuses to accept the fact that her child is deaf, and refuse to send him to a special school where he can learn sign language. His aunt, though, teaches him to communicate, and helps him find a place among a group of deaf-mutes. He meets and falls in love with Elena, leaving the \"official\" girlfriend picked by his mother, and the two plan to go to Washington to study at a special university for deaf- mutes. The mother accuses Elena of being selfish, Elena is hit by a car and hospitalized, and Fausto ends up being shocked into hearing for the first time what is going on around him.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Fausto","'s","mother","refus","to","accept","the","fact","that","her","child","is","deaf",",","and","refus","to","send","him","to","a","special","school","where","he","can","learn","sign","languag",".","His","aunt",",","though",",","teach","him","to","communic",",","and","help","him","find","a","place","among","a","group","of","deaf-mut",".","He","meet","and","fall","in","love","with","Elena",",","leav","the","\"","offici","\"","girlfriend","pick","by","his","mother",",","and","the","two","plan","to","go","to","Washington","to","studi","at","a","special","univers","for","deaf","-","mute",".","The","mother","accus","Elena","of","be","selfish",",","Elena","is","hit","by","a","car","and","hospit",",","and","Fausto","end","up","be","shock","into","hear","for","the","first","time","what","is","go","on","around","him","."],"lemmas":["Fausto","'s","mother","refuse","to","accept","the","fact","that","she","child","be","deaf",",","and","refuse","to","send","he","to","a","special","school","where","he","can","learn","sign","language",".","he","aunt",",","though",",","teach","he","to","communicate",",","and","help","he","find","a","place","among","a","group","of","deaf-mute",".","he","meet","and","fall","in","love","with","Elena",",","leave","the","``","official","''","girlfriend","pick","by","he","mother",",","and","the","two","plan","to","go","to","Washington","to","study","at","a","special","university","for","deaf","-","mute",".","the","mother","accuse","Elena","of","be","selfish",",","Elena","be","hit","by","a","car","and","hospitalize",",","and","Fausto","end","up","be","shock","into","hearing","for","the","first","time","what","be","go","on","around","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Fausto 's mother","'s mother refuses","mother refuses to","refuses to accept","to accept the","accept the fact","the fact that","fact that her","that her child","her child is","child is deaf","is deaf ,","deaf , and",", and refuse","and refuse to","refuse to send","to send him","send him to","him to a","to a special","a special school","special school where","school where he","where he can","he can learn","can learn sign","learn sign language","His aunt ,","aunt , though",", though ,","though , teaches",", teaches him","teaches him to","him to communicate","to communicate ,","communicate , and",", and helps","and helps him","helps him find","him find a","find a place","a place among","place among a","among a group","a group of","group of deaf-mutes","He meets and","meets and falls","and falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with Elena","with Elena ,","Elena , leaving",", leaving the","leaving the \"","the \" official","\" official \"","official \" girlfriend","\" girlfriend picked","girlfriend picked by","picked by his","by his mother","his mother ,","mother , and",", and the","and the two","the two plan","two plan to","plan to go","to go to","go to Washington","to Washington to","Washington to study","to study at","study at a","at a special","a special university","special university for","university for deaf","for deaf -","deaf -

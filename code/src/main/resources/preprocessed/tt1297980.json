{"title":"The Laughing Policeman","plot":"Jo Sasaki's 2007 novel is the first in the so-called \"The Hokkaido Trilogy\" and was inspired by corruption in the police force governing Japan's northern island. Set in the capital, Sapporo, the pic begins with the discovery of a strangled policewoman's body in an apartment used by the force's big brass. Senior officials keep the investigation under wraps and, in short order, the dead cop's ex-lover, Sgt. Suguru Tsukui (Hiroyuki Miyasako) - due to give damning evidence in a corruption hearing in 18 hours' time - is declared the perp. Police are ordered to shoot him on sight. Disturbed by the hasty manner in which his squad was pushed off the case, Tsukui's former police partner, smooth saxophonist Sgt. Koichi Saeki (Nao Omori), summons his team to discuss an alternative plan to the sanctioned witch hunt.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["Jo","Sasaki","'s","2007","novel","is","the","first","in","the","so-cal","\"","The","Hokkaido","Trilog","\"","and","was","inspir","by","corrupt","in","the","polic","forc","govern","Japan","'s","northern","island",".","Set","in","the","capit",",","Sapporo",",","the","pic","begin","with","the","discoveri","of","a","strangl","policewoman","'s","bodi","in","an","apart","use","by","the","forc","'s","big","brass",".","Senior","offici","keep","the","investig","under","wrap","and",",","in","short","order",",","the","dead","cop","'s","ex-lov",",","Sgt.","Suguru","Tsukui","(","Hiroyuki","Miyasako",")","-","due","to","give","damn","evid","in","a","corrupt","hear","in","18","hour","'","time","-","is","declar","the","perp",".","Polic","are","order","to","shoot","him","on","sight",".","Disturb","by","the","hasti","manner","in","which","his","squad","was","push","off","the","case",",","Tsukui","'s","former","polic","partner",",","smooth","saxophonist","Sgt.","Koichi","Saeki","(","Nao","Omori",")",",","summon","his","team","to","discuss","an","altern","plan","to","the","sanction","witch","hunt","."],"lemmas":["Jo","Sasaki","'s","2007","novel","be","the","first","in","the","so-called","``","the","Hokkaido","Trilogy","''","and","be","inspire","by","corruption","in","the","police","force","govern","Japan","'s","northern","island",".","set","in","the","capital",",","Sapporo",",","the","pic","begin","with","the","discovery","of","a","strangle","policewoman","'s","body","in","a","apartment","use","by","the","force","'s","big","brass",".","Senior","official","keep","the","investigation","under","wrap","and",",","in","short","order",",","the","dead","cop","'s","ex-lover",",","Sgt.","Suguru","Tsukui","-lrb-","Hiroyuki","Miyasako","-rrb-","-","due","to","give","damning","evidence","in","a","corruption","hearing","in","18","hour","'","time","-","be","declare","the","perp",".","police","be","order","to","shoot","he","on","sight",".","disturb","by","the","hasty","manner","in","which","he","squad","be","push","off","the","case",",","Tsukui","'s","former","police","partner",",","smooth","saxophonist","Sgt.","Koichi","Saeki","-lrb-","Nao","Omori","-rrb-",",","summons","he","team","to","discuss","a","alternative","plan","to","the","sanction","witch","hunt","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jo Sasaki 's","Sasaki 's 2007","'s 2007 novel","2007 novel is","novel is the","is the first","the first in","first in the","in the so-called","the so-called \"","so-called \" The","\" The Hokkaido","The Hokkaido Trilogy","Hokkaido Trilogy \"","Trilogy \" and","\" and was","and was inspired","was inspired by","inspired by corruption","by corruption in","corruption in the","in the police","the police force","police force governing","force governing Japan","governing Japan 's","Japan 's northern","'s northern island","Set in the","in the capital","the capital ,","capital , Sapporo",", Sapporo ,","Sapporo , the",", the pic","the pic begins","pic begins with","begins with the","with the discovery","the discovery of","discovery of a","of a strangled","a strangled policewoman","strangled policewoman 's","policewoman 's body","'s body in","body in an","in an apartment","an apartment used","apartment used by","used by the","by the force","the force 's","force 's big","'s big brass","Senior officials keep","officials keep the","keep the investigation","the investigation under","investigation under wraps","under wraps and","wraps and ,","and , in",", in short","in short order","short order ,","order , the",", the dead","the dead cop","dead cop 's","cop 's ex-lover","'s ex-lover ,","ex-lover , Sgt.",", Sgt.

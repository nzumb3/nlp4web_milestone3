{"title":"Blip Festival: Reformat the Planet","plot":"'Blip Festival: Reformat the Planet' is a feature length documentary which delves into the movement known as ChipTunes, a vibrant underground scene based around creating new, original music using old video game hardware. Familiar devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System are pushed in new directions with startling results. Using New York as a microcosm for a larger global movement, 'Reformat the Planet' maps out the genesis of the first annual Blip Festival, a four day celebration of over 30 international artists exploring the untapped potential of low-bit video game consoles. With floor-stomping rhythms and fist-waving melodies, trailblazers of the ChipTune idiom descend upon Manhattan to pen a new chapter in the history of electronic music.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Blip","Festiv",":","Reformat","the","Planet","'","is","a","featur","length","documentari","which","delv","into","the","movement","known","as","ChipTun",",","a","vibrant","underground","scene","base","around","creat","new",",","origin","music","use","old","video","game","hardwar",".","Familiar","devic","such","as","the","Nintendo","Game","Boy","and","Nintendo","Entertain","System","are","push","in","new","direct","with","startl","result",".","Using","New","York","as","a","microcosm","for","a","larger","global","movement",",","'","Reformat","the","Planet","'","map","out","the","genesi","of","the","first","annual","Blip","Festiv",",","a","four","day","celebr","of","over","30","intern","artist","explor","the","untap","potenti","of","low-bit","video","game","consol",".","With","floor-stomp","rhythm","and","fist-wav","melodi",",","trailblaz","of","the","ChipTun","idiom","descend","upon","Manhattan","to","pen","a","new","chapter","in","the","histori","of","electron","music","."],"lemmas":["'","Blip","Festival",":","reformat","the","planet","'","be","a","feature","length","documentary","which","delve","into","the","movement","know","as","ChipTunes",",","a","vibrant","underground","scene","base","around","create","new",",","original","music","use","old","video","game","hardware",".","familiar","device","such","as","the","Nintendo","Game","Boy","and","Nintendo","Entertainment","System","be","push","in","new","direction","with","startling","result",".","use","New","York","as","a","microcosm","for","a","larger","global","movement",",","'","Reformat","the","planet","'","map","out","the","genesis","of","the","first","annual","Blip","Festival",",","a","four","day","celebration","of","over","30","international","artist","explore","the","untapped","potential","of","low-bit","video","game","console",".","with","floor-stomping","rhythm","and","fist-waving","melody",",","trailblazer","of","the","chiptune","idiom","descend","upon","Manhattan","to","pen","a","new","chapter","in","the","history","of","electronic","music","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["'

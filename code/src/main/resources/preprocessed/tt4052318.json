{"title":"Joan's Boys","plot":"Joan is a committed, warm-hearted social worker and psychotherapist who works with derailed teenagers. In the documentary 'Joan's Boys' we see her efforts to help two of these kids -15 year old Alaa and Adil from a Moroccan family- to get back on track. The twins drop out from school, play violent video games all day and fight among each other about who can hold the PlayStation controller. In the midst of the heat they incidentally hit their mother, who goes knock-out on the floor. The boys are placed in custody. Can Joan save her boys by playing on their conscience? Or is her 'soft' approach deemed to fail? And what about Joan herself? Does her work with these kids replace her own unfulfilled child-wish?","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Joan","is","a","commit",",","warm-heart","social","worker","and","psychotherapist","who","work","with","derail","teenag",".","In","the","documentari","'","Joan","'s","Boy","'","we","see","her","effort","to","help","two","of","these","kid","-15","year","old","Alaa","and","Adil","from","a","Moroccan","famili","-","to","get","back","on","track",".","The","twin","drop","out","from","school",",","play","violent","video","game","all","day","and","fight","among","each","other","about","who","can","hold","the","PlayStat","control",".","In","the","midst","of","the","heat","they","incident","hit","their","mother",",","who","goe","knock-out","on","the","floor",".","The","boy","are","place","in","custodi",".","Can","Joan","save","her","boy","by","play","on","their","conscienc","?","Or","is","her","'","soft","'","approach","deem","to","fail","?","And","what","about","Joan","herself","?","Doe","her","work","with","these","kid","replac","her","own","unfulfil","child-wish","?"],"lemmas":["Joan","be","a","committed",",","warm-hearted","social","worker","and","psychotherapist","who","work","with","derail","teenager",".","in","the","documentary","'","Joan","'s","boy","'","we","see","she","effort","to","help","two","of","these","kid","-15","year","old","Alaa","and","Adil","from","a","moroccan","family","-","to","get","back","on","track",".","the","twin","drop","out","from","school",",","play","violent","video","game","all","day","and","fight","among","each","other","about","who","can","hold","the","PlayStation","controller",".","in","the","midst","of","the","heat","they","incidentally","hit","they","mother",",","who","go","knock-out","on","the","floor",".","the","boy","be","place","in","custody",".","can","Joan","save","she","boy","by","play","on","they","conscience","?","or","be","she","'","soft","'","approach","deem","to","fail","?","and","what","about","Joan","herself","?","do","she","work","with","these","kid","replace","she","own","unfulfilled","child-wish","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Joan is a","is a committed","a committed ,","committed , warm-hearted",", warm-hearted social","warm-hearted social worker","social worker and","worker and psychotherapist","and psychotherapist who","psychotherapist who works","who works with","works with derailed","with derailed teenagers","In the documentary","the documentary '","documentary ' Joan","' Joan 's","Joan 's Boys","'s Boys '","Boys ' we","' we see","we see her","see her efforts","her efforts to","efforts to help","to help two","help two of","two of these","of these kids","these kids -15","kids -15 year","-15 year old","year old Alaa","old Alaa and","Alaa and Adil","and Adil from","Adil from a","from a Moroccan","a Moroccan family","Moroccan family -","family -

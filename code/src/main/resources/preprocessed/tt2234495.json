{"title":"The Mechanical Bride","plot":"The fantasy of creating the perfect woman is as old as Pygmalion, but how close is it to becoming a reality? This provocative documentary reveals the state of the art in artificial companions - from life-sized silicone sex dolls to humanoid robots - and offers a surprisingly human, at times humorous, look at the men who build, animate, and love them. Filmed in the U.S.A., U.K., Japan, and Germany. Narrated by Julie Newmar.","genres":["Documentary"," Sci-Fi"," Fantasy"],"stems":["The","fantasi","of","creat","the","perfect","woman","is","as","old","as","Pygmalion",",","but","how","close","is","it","to","becom","a","realiti","?","This","provoc","documentari","reveal","the","state","of","the","art","in","artifici","companion","-","from","life-s","silicon","sex","doll","to","humanoid","robot","-","and","offer","a","surpris","human",",","at","time","humor",",","look","at","the","men","who","build",",","anim",",","and","love","them",".","Film","in","the","U.S.A.",",","U.K.",",","Japan",",","and","Germani",".","Narrat","by","Juli","Newmar","."],"lemmas":["the","fantasy","of","create","the","perfect","woman","be","as","old","as","Pygmalion",",","but","how","close","be","it","to","become","a","reality","?","this","provocative","documentary","reveal","the","state","of","the","art","in","artificial","companion","-","from","life-sized","silicone","sex","doll","to","humanoid","robot","-","and","offer","a","surprisingly","human",",","at","time","humorous",",","look","at","the","man","who","build",",","animate",",","and","love","they",".","film","in","the","U.S.A.",",","U.K.",",","Japan",",","and","Germany",".","narrate","by","Julie","Newmar","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The fantasy of","fantasy of creating","of creating the","creating the perfect","the perfect woman","perfect woman is","woman is as","is as old","as old as","old as Pygmalion","as Pygmalion ,","Pygmalion , but",", but how","but how close","how close is","close is it","is it to","it to becoming","to becoming a","becoming a reality","This provocative documentary","provocative documentary reveals","documentary reveals the","reveals the state","the state of","state of the","of the art","the art in","art in artificial","in artificial companions","artificial companions -","companions - from","- from life-sized","from life-sized silicone","life-sized silicone sex","silicone sex dolls","sex dolls to","dolls to humanoid","to humanoid robots","humanoid robots -","robots - and","- and offers","and offers a","offers a surprisingly","a surprisingly human","surprisingly human ,","human , at",", at times","at times humorous","times humorous ,","humorous , look",", look at","look at the","at the men","the men who","men who build","who build ,","build , animate",", animate ,","animate , and",", and love","and love them","Filmed in the","in the U.S.A.","the U.S.A. ,","U.S.A. , U.K.",", U.K. ,","U.K. , Japan",", Japan ,","Japan , and",", and Germany","Narrated by Julie","by Julie Newmar"],"2grams":["The fantasy","fantasy of","of creating","creating the","the perfect","perfect woman","woman is","is as","as old","old as","as Pygmalion","Pygmalion ,",", but","but how","how close","close is","is it","it to","to becoming","becoming a","a reality","This provocative","provocative documentary","documentary reveals","reveals the","the state","state of","of the","the art","art in","in artificial","artificial companions","companions -","- from","from life-sized","life-sized silicone","silicone sex","sex dolls","dolls to","to humanoid","humanoid robots","robots -","- and","and offers","offers a","a surprisingly","surprisingly human","human ,",", at","at times","times humorous","humorous ,",", look","look at","at the","the men","men who","who build","build ,",", animate","animate ,",", and","and love","love them","Filmed in","in the","the U.S.A.","U.S.A. ,",", U.K.","U.K. ,",", Japan","Japan ,",", and","and Germany","Narrated by","by Julie","Julie Newmar"]}

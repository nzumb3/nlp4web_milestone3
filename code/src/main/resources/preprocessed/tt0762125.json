{"title":"Planet 51","plot":"Lem is just an average teenager working on getting the girl and furthering his career at the local planetarium - except that he's an alien. At least to U.S. astronaut Captain Charles T. Baker who lands on Lem's planet hoping for a quick flag plant and a hasty return to earth and his millions of screaming fans. But on this alien planet the media has tagged spacemen as brain-eating, zombie-creating monsters, causing Baker to run for his life and into Lem's house. Now it's up to the green native to get the clumsy astronaut back to his spaceship before military dictator General Grawl and mad scientist Professor Kipple manage to exterminate the Earthly visitor.","genres":["Adventure"," Comedy"," Animation"],"stems":["Lem","is","just","an","averag","teenag","work","on","get","the","girl","and","further","his","career","at","the","local","planetarium","-","except","that","he","'s","an","alien",".","At","least","to","U.S.","astronaut","Captain","Charl","T.","Baker","who","land","on","Lem","'s","planet","hope","for","a","quick","flag","plant","and","a","hasti","return","to","earth","and","his","million","of","scream","fan",".","But","on","this","alien","planet","the","media","has","tag","spacemen","as","brain-eat",",","zombie-cr","monster",",","caus","Baker","to","run","for","his","life","and","into","Lem","'s","hous",".","Now","it","'s","up","to","the","green","nativ","to","get","the","clumsi","astronaut","back","to","his","spaceship","befor","militari","dictat","Gener","Grawl","and","mad","scientist","Professor","Kippl","manag","to","extermin","the","Earth","visitor","."],"lemmas":["lem","be","just","a","average","teenager","work","on","get","the","girl","and","further","he","career","at","the","local","planetarium","-","except","that","he","be","a","alien",".","at","least","to","U.S.","astronaut","Captain","Charles","T.","Baker","who","land","on","Lem","'s","planet","hope","for","a","quick","flag","plant","and","a","hasty","return","to","earth","and","he","million","of","scream","fan",".","but","on","this","alien","planet","the","media","have","tag","spaceman","as","brain-eating",",","zombie-creating","monster",",","cause","Baker","to","run","for","he","life","and","into","Lem","'s","house",".","now","it","be","up","to","the","green","native","to","get","the","clumsy","astronaut","back","to","he","spaceship","before","military","dictator","General","Grawl","and","mad","scientist","Professor","Kipple","manage","to","exterminate","the","earthly","visitor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lem is just","is just an","just an average","an average teenager","average teenager working","teenager working on","working on getting","on getting the","getting the girl","the girl and","girl and furthering","and furthering his","furthering his career","his career at","career at the","at the local","the local planetarium","local planetarium -","planetarium - except","- except that","except that he","that he 's","he 's an","'s an alien","At least to","least to U.S.","to U.S. astronaut","U.S. astronaut Captain","astronaut Captain Charles","Captain Charles T.","Charles T.

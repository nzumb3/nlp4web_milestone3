{"title":"Love Is Hard (A Burlesque Fairytale)","plot":"Love is Hard is part romantic comedy, part burlesque concert film. It's the story of Sophie who is anxious to leave the world of burlesque behind her. She's rushing off to her graduation ceremony, after performing at a Shakespeare themed burlesque matinee. Her path is strikingly interrupted by Valentino, an attractive foreigner, whose first words to her are, 'Will you marry me?' The Shakespearean burlesque continues, touching on themes of love and dreams brought up by the plot. The scene switches between Valentino trying to woo Sophie and some of the top acts of New York City's lively burlesque scene. Blending influences from classical mythology and European literature with New York street smarts, it is a Beauty and the Beast tale for our times.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Love","is","Hard","is","part","romant","comedi",",","part","burlesqu","concert","film",".","It","'s","the","stori","of","Sophi","who","is","anxious","to","leav","the","world","of","burlesqu","behind","her",".","She","'s","rush","off","to","her","graduat","ceremoni",",","after","perform","at","a","Shakespear","theme","burlesqu","matine",".","Her","path","is","strike","interrupt","by","Valentino",",","an","attract","foreign",",","whose","first","word","to","her","are",",","'","Will","you","marri","me","?","'","The","Shakespearean","burlesqu","continu",",","touch","on","theme","of","love","and","dream","brought","up","by","the","plot",".","The","scene","switch","between","Valentino","tri","to","woo","Sophi","and","some","of","the","top","act","of","New","York","Citi","'s","live","burlesqu","scene",".","Blend","influenc","from","classic","mytholog","and","European","literatur","with","New","York","street","smart",",","it","is","a","Beauti","and","the","Beast","tale","for","our","time","."],"lemmas":["love","be","Hard","be","part","romantic","comedy",",","part","burlesque","concert","film",".","it","be","the","story","of","Sophie","who","be","anxious","to","leave","the","world","of","burlesque","behind","she",".","she","be","rush","off","to","she","graduation","ceremony",",","after","perform","at","a","Shakespeare","theme","burlesque","matinee",".","she","path","be","strikingly","interrupt","by","Valentino",",","a","attractive","foreigner",",","whose","first","word","to","she","be",",","'","will","you","marry","I","?","'","the","shakespearean","burlesque","continue",",","touch","on","theme","of","love","and","dream","bring","up","by","the","plot",".","the","scene","switch","between","Valentino","try","to","woo","Sophie","and","some","of","the","top","act","of","New","York","City","'s","lively","burlesque","scene",".","blending","influence","from","classical","mythology","and","european","literature","with","New","York","street","smart",",","it","be","a","beauty","and","the","beast","tale","for","we","time","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Love is Hard","is Hard is","Hard is part","is part romantic","part romantic comedy","romantic comedy ,","comedy , part",", part burlesque","part burlesque concert","burlesque concert film","It 's the","'s the story","the story of","story of Sophie","of Sophie who","Sophie who is","who is anxious","is anxious to","anxious to leave","to leave the","leave the world","the world of","world of burlesque","of burlesque behind","burlesque behind her","She 's rushing","'s rushing off","rushing off to","off to her","to her graduation","her graduation ceremony","graduation ceremony ,","ceremony , after",", after performing","after performing at","performing at a","at a Shakespeare","a Shakespeare themed","Shakespeare themed burlesque","themed burlesque matinee","Her path is","path is strikingly","is strikingly interrupted","strikingly interrupted by","interrupted by Valentino","by Valentino ,","Valentino , an",", an attractive","an attractive foreigner","attractive foreigner ,","foreigner , whose",", whose first","whose first words","first words to","words to her","to her are","her are ,","are , '",", ' Will","' Will you","Will you marry","you marry me","marry me ?","me ?

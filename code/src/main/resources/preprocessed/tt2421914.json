{"title":"Deepsouth","plot":"Beneath layers of history, poverty and now soaring HIV infections, four Americans redefine traditional Southern values to create their own solutions to survive. 'deepsouth' is a documentary about the new American South, and the people who inhabit its most quiet corners. Josh, a college student, seeks the support of an underground gay family hours away from his suffocating Mississippi Delta hometown. With no funds and few resources, Monica and Tammy try to unite reluctant participants at their annual HIV retreat in rural Louisiana. Kathie, an Alabama activist, spends 120 days a year on the road fighting a bureaucracy that continues to ignore the South.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["Beneath","layer","of","histori",",","poverti","and","now","soar","HIV","infect",",","four","American","redefin","tradit","Southern","valu","to","creat","their","own","solut","to","surviv",".","'","deepsouth","'","is","a","documentari","about","the","new","American","South",",","and","the","peopl","who","inhabit","it","most","quiet","corner",".","Josh",",","a","colleg","student",",","seek","the","support","of","an","underground","gay","famili","hour","away","from","his","suffoc","Mississippi","Delta","hometown",".","With","no","fund","and","few","resourc",",","Monica","and","Tammi","tri","to","unit","reluct","particip","at","their","annual","HIV","retreat","in","rural","Louisiana",".","Kathi",",","an","Alabama","activist",",","spend","120","day","a","year","on","the","road","fight","a","bureaucraci","that","continu","to","ignor","the","South","."],"lemmas":["beneath","layer","of","history",",","poverty","and","now","soar","hiv","infection",",","four","Americans","redefine","traditional","Southern","value","to","create","they","own","solution","to","survive",".","'","deepsouth","'","be","a","documentary","about","the","new","American","South",",","and","the","people","who","inhabit","its","most","quiet","corner",".","Josh",",","a","college","student",",","seek","the","support","of","a","underground","gay","family","hour","away","from","he","suffocating","Mississippi","Delta","hometown",".","with","no","fund","and","few","resource",",","Monica","and","Tammy","try","to","unite","reluctant","participant","at","they","annual","hiv","retreat","in","rural","Louisiana",".","Kathie",",","a","Alabama","activist",",","spend","120","day","a","year","on","the","road","fight","a","bureaucracy","that","continue","to","ignore","the","South","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Beneath layers of","layers of history","of history ,","history , poverty",", poverty and","poverty and now","and now soaring","now soaring HIV","soaring HIV infections","HIV infections ,","infections , four",", four Americans","four Americans redefine","Americans redefine traditional","redefine traditional Southern","traditional Southern values","Southern values to","values to create","to create their","create their own","their own solutions","own solutions to","solutions to survive","to survive .","survive .

{"title":"My Homework Ate My Dog","plot":"Lyle Licketti never ever does his homework. Whether it is an alien who stole it or a pet dinosaur...he'll weave a tall tale about how he couldn't do his homework. His third grad teacher, Mrs. Cee, tired of his lies, won't tolerate his shenanigans today. Today is test day. She wants him to take his quiz, quietly. Last night, Lyle's homework ate his dog. Now, the homework is after him and no one at school will listen to his story (performed in rhyme). Will Lyle be able to persuade his classmates and Mrs. Cee before it's too late?","genres":["Family"],"stems":["Lyle","Licketti","never","ever","doe","his","homework",".","Whether","it","is","an","alien","who","stole","it","or","a","pet","dinosaur","...","he","ll","weav","a","tall","tale","about","how","he","could","n't","do","his","homework",".","His","third","grad","teacher",",","Mrs.","Cee",",","tire","of","his","lie",",","wo","n't","toler","his","shenanigan","today",".","Today","is","test","day",".","She","want","him","to","take","his","quiz",",","quiet",".","Last","night",",","Lyle","'s","homework","ate","his","dog",".","Now",",","the","homework","is","after","him","and","no","one","at","school","will","listen","to","his","stori","(","perform","in","rhyme",")",".","Will","Lyle","be","abl","to","persuad","his","classmat","and","Mrs.","Cee","befor","it","'s","too","late","?"],"lemmas":["Lyle","Licketti","never","ever","do","he","homework",".","whether","it","be","a","alien","who","steal","it","or","a","pet","dinosaur","...","he","will","weave","a","tall","tale","about","how","he","could","not","do","he","homework",".","he","third","grad","teacher",",","Mrs.","Cee",",","tire","of","he","lie",",","will","not","tolerate","he","shenanigan","today",".","today","be","test","day",".","she","want","he","to","take","he","quiz",",","quietly",".","last","night",",","Lyle","'s","homework","eat","he","dog",".","now",",","the","homework","be","after","he","and","no","one","at","school","will","listen","to","he","story","-lrb-","perform","in","rhyme","-rrb-",".","will","Lyle","be","able","to","persuade","he","classmate","and","Mrs.","Cee","before","it","be","too","late","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lyle Licketti never","Licketti never ever","never ever does","ever does his","does his homework","Whether it is","it is an","is an alien","an alien who","alien who stole","who stole it","stole it or","it or a","or a pet","a pet dinosaur","pet dinosaur ...","dinosaur ... he","... he 'll","he 'll weave","'ll weave a","weave a tall","a tall tale","tall tale about","tale about how","about how he","how he could","he could n't","could n't do","n't do his","do his homework","His third grad","third grad teacher","grad teacher ,","teacher , Mrs.",", Mrs. Cee","Mrs. Cee ,","Cee , tired",", tired of","tired of his","of his lies","his lies ,","lies , wo",", wo n't","wo n't tolerate","n't tolerate his","tolerate his shenanigans","his shenanigans today","Today is test","is test day","She wants him","wants him to","him to take","to take his","take his quiz","his quiz ,","quiz , quietly","Last night ,","night , Lyle",", Lyle 's","Lyle 's homework","'s homework ate","homework ate his","ate his dog","Now , the",", the homework","the homework is","homework is after","is after him","after him and","him and no","and no one","no one at","one at school","at school will","school will listen","will listen to","listen to his","to his story","his story (","story ( performed","( performed in","performed in rhyme","in rhyme )","Will Lyle be","Lyle be able","be able to","able to persuade","to persuade his","persuade his classmates","his classmates and","classmates and Mrs.","and Mrs. Cee","Mrs. Cee before","Cee before it","before it 's","it 's too","'s too late"],"2grams":["Lyle Licketti","Licketti never","never ever","ever does","does his","his homework","Whether it","it is","is an","an alien","alien who","who stole","stole it","it or","or a","a pet","pet dinosaur","dinosaur ...","... he","he 'll","'ll weave","weave a","a tall","tall tale","tale about","about how","how he","he could","could n't","n't do","do his","his homework","His third","third grad","grad teacher","teacher ,",", Mrs.","Mrs. Cee","Cee ,",", tired","tired of","of his","his lies","lies ,",", wo","wo n't","n't tolerate","tolerate his","his shenanigans","shenanigans today","Today is","is test","test day","She wants","wants him","him to","to take","take his","his quiz","quiz ,",", quietly","Last night","night ,",", Lyle","Lyle 's","'s homework","homework ate","ate his","his dog","Now ,",", the","the homework","homework is","is after","after him","him and","and no","no one","one at","at school","school will","will listen","listen to","to his","his story","story (","( performed","performed in","in rhyme","rhyme )","Will Lyle","Lyle be","be able","able to","to persuade","persuade his","his classmates","classmates and","and Mrs.","Mrs. Cee","Cee before","before it","it 's","'s too","too late"]}

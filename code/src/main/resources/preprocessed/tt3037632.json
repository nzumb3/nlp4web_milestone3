{"title":"Field Freak","plot":"The story revolves around a family that moves into an abandoned cabin in Beaver Pelt Falls, Idaho. Charles (Dave Juehring) a former best selling writer, is desperately trying to pen his next book and needs a place free of distractions. Little does he know, his entire family is being watched. Strange bumps in the night escalate into a nerve wrecking encounter with the creature by Charles's wife Linda (Trena Penson). The story takes a wacky turn when they hire a psychotic, pest-control guy (Thomas Ely Sage) and are led to believe Rabid Beavers are to blame. It's not until they visit a road-side Root Beer Distillery and meet a man named Ned Perkins (Glenn Harston), that they learn what the bumps in the night really are. According to Ned, they're all going to die!","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller","

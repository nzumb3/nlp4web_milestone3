{"title":"The Weather Man","plot":"Dave Spritz is a local weatherman in his home town of Chicago, where his career is going well while his personal life -- his relationship with his perfectionist writer father, his neurotic ex-wife, and his now-separated children -- is spiraling downward. Despite being both loathed and loved by the local masses, Dave is a guy who doesn't seem to have it all together, and in this film, he begins to feel it. An attractive job offer presents Dave with a major question: to pursue his career in New York City, or to remain at home with his family.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Dave","Spritz","is","a","local","weatherman","in","his","home","town","of","Chicago",",","where","his","career","is","go","well","while","his","person","life","--","his","relationship","with","his","perfectionist","writer","father",",","his","neurot","ex-wif",",","and","his","now-separ","children","--","is","spiral","downward",".","Despit","be","both","loath","and","love","by","the","local","mass",",","Dave","is","a","guy","who","doe","n't","seem","to","have","it","all","togeth",",","and","in","this","film",",","he","begin","to","feel","it",".","An","attract","job","offer","present","Dave","with","a","major","question",":","to","pursu","his","career","in","New","York","Citi",",","or","to","remain","at","home","with","his","famili","."],"lemmas":["Dave","Spritz","be","a","local","weatherman","in","he","home","town","of","Chicago",",","where","he","career","be","go","well","while","he","personal","life","--","he","relationship","with","he","perfectionist","writer","father",",","he","neurotic","ex-wife",",","and","he","now-separated","child","--","be","spiral","downward",".","despite","be","both","loathe","and","love","by","the","local","mass",",","Dave","be","a","guy","who","do","not","seem","to","have","it","all","together",",","and","in","this","film",",","he","begin","to","feel","it",".","a","attractive","job","offer","present","Dave","with","a","major","question",":","to","pursue","he","career","in","New","York","City",",","or","to","remain","at","home","with","he","family","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Dave Spritz is","Spritz is a","is a local","a local weatherman","local weatherman in","weatherman in his","in his home","his home town","home town of","town of Chicago","of Chicago ,","Chicago , where",", where his","where his career","his career is","career is going","is going well","going well while","well while his","while his personal","his personal life","personal life --","life -- his","-- his relationship","his relationship with","relationship with his","with his perfectionist","his perfectionist writer","perfectionist writer father","writer father ,","father , his",", his neurotic","his neurotic ex-wife","neurotic ex-wife ,","ex-wife , and",", and his","and his now-separated","his now-separated children","now-separated children --","children -- is","-- is spiraling","is spiraling downward","Despite being both","being both loathed","both loathed and","loathed and loved","and loved by","loved by the","by the local","the local masses","local masses ,","masses , Dave",", Dave is","Dave is a","is a guy","a guy who","guy who does","who does n't","does n't seem","n't seem to","seem to have","to have it","have it all","it all together","all together ,","together , and",", and in","and in this","in this film","this film ,","film , he",", he begins","he begins to","begins to feel","to feel it","An attractive job","attractive job offer","job offer presents","offer presents Dave","presents Dave with","Dave with a","with a major","a major question","major question :","question : to",": to pursue","to pursue his","pursue his career","his career in","career in New","in New York","New York City","York City ,","City , or",", or to","or to remain","to remain at","remain at home","at home with","home with his","with his family"],"2grams":["Dave Spritz","Spritz is","is a","a local","local weatherman","weatherman in","in his","his home","home town","town of","of Chicago","Chicago ,",", where","where his","his career","career is","is going","going well","well while","while his","his personal","personal life","life --","-- his","his relationship","relationship with","with his","his perfectionist","perfectionist writer","writer father","father ,",", his","his neurotic","neurotic ex-wife","ex-wife ,",", and","and his","his now-separated","now-separated children","children --","-- is","is spiraling","spiraling downward","Despite being","being both","both loathed","loathed and","and loved","loved by","by the","the local","local masses","masses ,",", Dave","Dave is","is a","a guy","guy who","who does","does n't","n't seem","seem to","to have","have it","it all","all together","together ,",", and","and in","in this","this film","film ,",", he","he begins","begins to","to feel","feel it","An attractive","attractive job","job offer","offer presents","presents Dave","Dave with","with a","a major","major question","question :",": to","to pursue","pursue his","his career","career in","in New","New York","York City","City ,",", or","or to","to remain","remain at","at home","home with","with his","his family"]}

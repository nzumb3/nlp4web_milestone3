{"title":"Il ritorno di Cagliostro","plot":"In the Sicily of the late 40's, two brother sculptors, tired of selling madonnas to the local churches, finally realize their dream and set up a Sicilian production company, thanks to the help of a local bishop. They start producing one box-office failure Z-movie after the other, all with terribly bad local non-pros as actors. Covered in debts, they finally have their great chance when a local nobleman obsessed by magic decides to invest all his wealth in the making of a movie about Cagliostro, just one year after Welles' \"Black Magic\". They hire a famous American actor (Robert Englund) and start shooting \"The return of Cagliostro\"..","genres":["Comedy","

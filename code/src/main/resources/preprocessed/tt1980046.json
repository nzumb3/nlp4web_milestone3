{"title":"Beijing Besieged by Waste","plot":"While China's rise, and its immense challenges, commands world attention, less light has been shed upon the colossal problem of waste generated by a burgeoning population, expanding industry, and rapacious urban growth. Photographer Wang Jiuliang turns his lens upon the grim spectacle of garbage, excrement, refuse, and wreckage heaped upon the landscape that surrounds China's mega-metropolis, Beijing. Eking out a hazardous living within are the scavengers, mostly rural migrants, who struggle to maintain familial and cultural structures amid the bleakest of occupations. Wang shows the desecration of once-vital farmlands and rivers in the shadow of China's gleaming cities and planes and super-trains; the unholy cycle of construction's consumption and waste, and poignant images of the daily lives of scavengers who toil at their own peril.","genres":["Documentary"," News"],"stems":["While","China","'s","rise",",","and","it","immens","challeng",",","command","world","attent",",","less","light","has","been","shed","upon","the","coloss","problem","of","wast","generat","by","a","burgeon","popul",",","expand","industri",",","and","rapaci","urban","growth",".","Photograph","Wang","Jiuliang","turn","his","len","upon","the","grim","spectacl","of","garbag",",","excrement",",","refus",",","and","wreckag","heap","upon","the","landscap","that","surround","China","'s","mega-metropoli",",","Beij",".","Eking","out","a","hazard","live","within","are","the","scaveng",",","most","rural","migrant",",","who","struggl","to","maintain","famili","and","cultur","structur","amid","the","bleakest","of","occup",".","Wang","show","the","desecr","of","once-vit","farmland","and","river","in","the","shadow","of","China","'s","gleam","citi","and","plane","and","super-train",";","the","unholi","cycl","of","construct","'s","consumpt","and","wast",",","and","poignant","imag","of","the","daili","live","of","scaveng","who","toil","at","their","own","peril","."],"lemmas":["while","China","'s","rise",",","and","its","immense","challenge",",","command","world","attention",",","less","light","have","be","shed","upon","the","colossal","problem","of","waste","generate","by","a","burgeon","population",",","expand","industry",",","and","rapacious","urban","growth",".","Photographer","Wang","Jiuliang","turn","he","lens","upon","the","grim","spectacle","of","garbage",",","excrement",",","refuse",",","and","wreckage","heap","upon","the","landscape","that","surround","China","'s","mega-metropolis",",","Beijing",".","eke","out","a","hazardous","living","within","be","the","scavenger",",","mostly","rural","migrant",",","who","struggle","to","maintain","familial","and","cultural","structure","amid","the","bleakest","of","occupation",".","Wang","show","the","desecration","of","once-vital","farmland","and","river","in","the","shadow","of","China","'s","gleaming","city","and","plane","and","super-train",";","the","unholy","cycle","of","construction","'s","consumption","and","waste",",","and","poignant","image","of","the","daily","life","of","scavenger","who","toil","at","they","own","peril","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["While China 's","China 's rise","'s rise ,","rise , and",", and its","and its immense","its immense challenges","immense challenges ,","challenges , commands",", commands world","commands world attention","world attention ,","attention , less",", less light","less light has","light has been","has been shed","been shed upon","shed upon the","upon the colossal","the colossal problem","colossal problem of","problem of waste","of waste generated","waste generated by","generated by a","by a burgeoning","a burgeoning population","burgeoning population ,","population , expanding",", expanding industry","expanding industry ,","industry , and",", and rapacious","and rapacious urban","rapacious urban growth","Photographer Wang Jiuliang","Wang Jiuliang turns","Jiuliang turns his","turns his lens","his lens upon","lens upon the","upon the grim","the grim spectacle","grim spectacle of","spectacle of garbage","of garbage ,","garbage , excrement",", excrement ,","excrement , refuse",", refuse ,","refuse , and",", and wreckage","and wreckage heaped","wreckage heaped upon","heaped upon the","upon the landscape","the landscape that","landscape that surrounds","that surrounds China","surrounds China 's","China 's mega-metropolis","'s mega-metropolis ,","mega-metropolis , Beijing","Eking out a","out a hazardous","a hazardous living","hazardous living within","living within are","within are the","are the scavengers","the scavengers ,","scavengers , mostly",", mostly rural","mostly rural migrants","rural migrants ,","migrants , who",", who struggle","who struggle to","struggle to maintain","to maintain familial","maintain familial and","familial and cultural","and cultural structures","cultural structures amid","structures amid the","amid the bleakest","the bleakest of","bleakest of occupations","Wang shows the","shows the desecration","the desecration of","desecration of once-vital","of once-vital farmlands","once-vital farmlands and","farmlands and rivers","and rivers in","rivers in the","in the shadow","the shadow of","shadow of China","of China 's","China 's gleaming","'s gleaming cities","gleaming cities and","cities and planes","and planes and","planes and super-trains","and super-trains ;","super-trains ;

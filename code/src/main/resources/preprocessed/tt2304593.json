{"title":"Det forf√∏rte menneske","plot":"The Danish filmmaker Jorgen Leth has provoked audiences world wide for a lifetime. He is living his life as an observer, governed by his senses. After 40 documentaries, and 20 years in chaotic Haiti - until the earthquake destroyed his home in 2010 - what is the meaning of such a life? Jorgen Leth is existentially driven between desire and despair, being always ready to seduce or to be seduced. The Seduced Human is a moral inquiry about the modern aesthetical position. Is the film maker's life without ethics?","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","Danish","filmmak","Jorgen","Leth","has","provok","audienc","world","wide","for","a","lifetim",".","He","is","live","his","life","as","an","observ",",","govern","by","his","sens",".","After","40","documentari",",","and","20","year","in","chaotic","Haiti","-","until","the","earthquak","destroy","his","home","in","2010","-","what","is","the","mean","of","such","a","life","?","Jorgen","Leth","is","existenti","driven","between","desir","and","despair",",","be","alway","readi","to","seduc","or","to","be","seduc",".","The","Seduc","Human","is","a","moral","inquiri","about","the","modern","aesthet","posit",".","Is","the","film","maker","'s","life","without","ethic","?"],"lemmas":["the","danish","filmmaker","Jorgen","Leth","have","provoke","audience","world","wide","for","a","lifetime",".","he","be","live","he","life","as","a","observer",",","govern","by","he","sens",".","after","40","documentary",",","and","20","year","in","chaotic","Haiti","-","until","the","earthquake","destroy","he","home","in","2010","-","what","be","the","meaning","of","such","a","life","?","Jorgen","Leth","be","existentially","drive","between","desire","and","despair",",","be","always","ready","to","seduce","or","to","be","seduce",".","the","Seduced","Human","be","a","moral","inquiry","about","the","modern","aesthetical","position",".","be","the","film","maker","'s","life","without","ethic","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Danish filmmaker","Danish filmmaker Jorgen","filmmaker Jorgen Leth","Jorgen Leth has","Leth has provoked","has provoked audiences","provoked audiences world","audiences world wide","world wide for","wide for a","for a lifetime","He is living","is living his","living his life","his life as","life as an","as an observer","an observer ,","observer , governed",", governed by","governed by his","by his senses","After 40 documentaries","40 documentaries ,","documentaries , and",", and 20","and 20 years","20 years in","years in chaotic","in chaotic Haiti","chaotic Haiti -","Haiti - until","- until the","until the earthquake","the earthquake destroyed","earthquake destroyed his","destroyed his home","his home in","home in 2010","in 2010 -","2010 - what","- what is","what is the","is the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of such","of such a","such a life","Jorgen Leth is","Leth is existentially","is existentially driven","existentially driven between","driven between desire","between desire and","desire and despair","and despair ,","despair , being",", being always","being always ready","always ready to","ready to seduce","to seduce or","seduce or to","or to be","to be seduced","The Seduced Human","Seduced Human is","Human is a","is a moral","a moral inquiry","moral inquiry about","inquiry about the","about the modern","the modern aesthetical","modern aesthetical position","Is the film","the film maker","film maker 's","maker 's life","'s life without","life without ethics"],"2grams":["The Danish","Danish filmmaker","filmmaker Jorgen","Jorgen Leth","Leth has","has provoked","provoked audiences","audiences world","world wide","wide for","for a","a lifetime","He is","is living","living his","his life","life as","as an","an observer","observer ,",", governed","governed by","by his","his senses","After 40","40 documentaries","documentaries ,",", and","and 20","20 years","years in","in chaotic","chaotic Haiti","Haiti -","- until","until the","the earthquake","earthquake destroyed","destroyed his","his home","home in","in 2010","2010 -","- what","what is","is the","the meaning","meaning of","of such","such a","a life","Jorgen Leth","Leth is","is existentially","existentially driven","driven between","between desire","desire and","and despair","despair ,",", being","being always","always ready","ready to","to seduce","seduce or","or to","to be","be seduced","The Seduced","Seduced Human","Human is","is a","a moral","moral inquiry","inquiry about","about the","the modern","modern aesthetical","aesthetical position","Is the","the film","film maker","maker 's","'s life","life without","without ethics"]}

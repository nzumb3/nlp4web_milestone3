{"title":"Snap","plot":"This often-scathing Irish meller begins with a documentary crew invading the home of Sandra who has agreed to be interviewed despite her caustic tongue and what seems like a burning desire to antagonize the filmmakers. She is one angry woman: sometime in the very recent past, her teenage son kidnapped a toddler and created a national panic/sensation. Both Stephen and Sandra have become public enemies, with Sandra having been all but crucified, made into the kind of media scapegoat tabloid readers love to loathe.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["This","often-scath","Irish","meller","begin","with","a","documentari","crew","invad","the","home","of","Sandra","who","has","agre","to","be","interview","despit","her","caustic","tongu","and","what","seem","like","a","burn","desir","to","antagon","the","filmmak",".","She","is","one","angri","woman",":","sometim","in","the","veri","recent","past",",","her","teenag","son","kidnap","a","toddler","and","creat","a","nation","panic/sens",".","Both","Stephen","and","Sandra","have","becom","public","enemi",",","with","Sandra","have","been","all","but","crucifi",",","made","into","the","kind","of","media","scapegoat","tabloid","reader","love","to","loath","."],"lemmas":["this","often-scathing","irish","meller","begin","with","a","documentary","crew","invade","the","home","of","Sandra","who","have","agree","to","be","interview","despite","she","caustic","tongue","and","what","seem","like","a","burning","desire","to","antagonize","the","filmmaker",".","she","be","one","angry","woman",":","sometime","in","the","very","recent","past",",","she","teenage","son","kidnap","a","toddler","and","create","a","national","panic/sensation",".","both","Stephen","and","Sandra","have","become","public","enemy",",","with","Sandra","have","be","all","but","crucify",",","make","into","the","kind","of","media","scapegoat","tabloid","reader","love","to","loathe","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This often-scathing Irish","often-scathing Irish meller","Irish meller begins","meller begins with","begins with a","with a documentary","a documentary crew","documentary crew invading","crew invading the","invading the home","the home of","home of Sandra","of Sandra who","Sandra who has","who has agreed","has agreed to","agreed to be","to be interviewed","be interviewed despite","interviewed despite her","despite her caustic","her caustic tongue","caustic tongue and","tongue and what","and what seems","what seems like","seems like a","like a burning","a burning desire","burning desire to","desire to antagonize","to antagonize the","antagonize the filmmakers","She is one","is one angry","one angry woman","angry woman :","woman : sometime",": sometime in","sometime in the","in the very","the very recent","very recent past","recent past ,","past , her",", her teenage","her teenage son","teenage son kidnapped","son kidnapped a","kidnapped a toddler","a toddler and","toddler and created","and created a","created a national","a national panic/sensation","Both Stephen and","Stephen and Sandra","and Sandra have","Sandra have become","have become public","become public enemies","public enemies ,","enemies , with",", with Sandra","with Sandra having","Sandra having been","having been all","been all but","all but crucified","but crucified ,","crucified , made",", made into","made into the","into the kind","the kind of","kind of media","of media scapegoat","media scapegoat tabloid","scapegoat tabloid readers","tabloid readers love","readers love to","love to loathe"],"2grams":["This often-scathing","often-scathing Irish","Irish meller","meller begins","begins with","with a","a documentary","documentary crew","crew invading","invading the","the home","home of","of Sandra","Sandra who","who has","has agreed","agreed to","to be","be interviewed","interviewed despite","despite her","her caustic","caustic tongue","tongue and","and what","what seems","seems like","like a","a burning","burning desire","desire to","to antagonize","antagonize the","the filmmakers","She is","is one","one angry","angry woman","woman :",": sometime","sometime in","in the","the very","very recent","recent past","past ,",", her","her teenage","teenage son","son kidnapped","kidnapped a","a toddler","toddler and","and created","created a","a national","national panic/sensation","Both Stephen","Stephen and","and Sandra","Sandra have","have become","become public","public enemies","enemies ,",", with","with Sandra","Sandra having","having been","been all","all but","but crucified","crucified ,",", made","made into","into the","the kind","kind of","of media","media scapegoat","scapegoat tabloid","tabloid readers","readers love","love to","to loathe"]}

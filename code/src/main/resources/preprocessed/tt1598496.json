{"title":"Four More Years","plot":"Political party leader David Holst, one of Sweden's most popular politicians, is handsome, funny, popular and predicted as the country's next Prime Minister. But what at first appears to be an easy victory turns into a humbling defeat as another party wins the elections and four more years of leading the country, Then, when David suddenly falls in love, the problem is not that he's already married or that he's fallen in love with another man....but that the man he's fallen head over heels in love with, Martin, is the only man on earth he cannot love. He is an up-and-comer in the rivaling party that won the elections! David is risking everything - his family, his party and his own name. If they can't keep their relationship a secret, a public scandal could be a career destroyer. But David doesn't have the nerve to play this kind of game and eventually the mistakes and misunderstandings pile up and their love is threatened to be lost. Almost. \"Four More Years' is a funny, daring, clever and extremely romantic comedy, proving once again that love conquers all.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

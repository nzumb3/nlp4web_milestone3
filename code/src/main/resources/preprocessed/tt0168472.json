{"title":"Aujourd'hui ou jamais","plot":"Abel, a 55-year old pilot, has not flown a plane since the accidental death of his co-pilot and best friend 15 years ago despite his intense passion for aviation. He spends his days running his small aviation company called Arianair with Antoine, his business partner from France. On the fateful day when Abel is determined to fly his one-seater Tiger Moth airplane after his 15-year hiatus, he is interrupted by the arrival of two people: his father Napoleon from Brazil who abandoned him 50 years earlier, and Monique, the daughter of his deceased best friend. On top of that, he receives notice from the bank that they will seize control of his company if he does not pay off its debts. In light of all this, Abel's flight plans have to be put on

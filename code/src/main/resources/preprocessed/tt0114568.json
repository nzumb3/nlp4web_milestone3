{"title":"Stripteaser","plot":"As Zipper's Clown Palace (a strip bar) closes, Neil wanders in and decides to hold the dancers, bartender, and remaining customers hostage. He torments them with little tasks he wants performed, playing on their weaknesses and relying on his gun for intimidation. Eventually the hostages begin formulating plans to thwart his control. Meanwhile, two policemen are observing the outside of the strip joint, realizing that something's wrong and trying to decide if it's worth ruining their buzz to intervene.","genres":["Comedy"," Thriller"],"stems":["As","Zipper","'s","Clown","Palac","(","a","strip","bar",")","close",",","Neil","wander","in","and","decid","to","hold","the","dancer",",","bartend",",","and","remain","custom","hostag",".","He","torment","them","with","littl","task","he","want","perform",",","play","on","their","weak","and","reli","on","his","gun","for","intimid",".","Eventual","the","hostag","begin","formul","plan","to","thwart","his","control",".","Meanwhil",",","two","policemen","are","observ","the","outsid","of","the","strip","joint",",","realiz","that","someth","'s","wrong","and","tri","to","decid","if","it","'s","worth","ruin","their","buzz","to","interven","."],"lemmas":["as","Zipper","'s","Clown","Palace","-lrb-","a","strip","bar","-rrb-","close",",","Neil","wander","in","and","decide","to","hold","the","dancer",",","bartender",",","and","remain","customer","hostage",".","he","torment","they","with","little","task","he","want","perform",",","play","on","they","weakness","and","rely","on","he","gun","for","intimidation",".","eventually","the","hostage","begin","formulate","plan","to","thwart","he","control",".","meanwhile",",","two","policeman","be","observe","the","outside","of","the","strip","joint",",","realize","that","something","'s","wrong","and","try","to","decide","if","it","be","worth","ruin","they","buzz","to","intervene","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["As Zipper 's","Zipper 's Clown","'s Clown Palace","Clown Palace (","Palace ( a","( a strip","a strip bar","strip bar )","bar ) closes",") closes ,","closes , Neil",", Neil wanders","Neil wanders in","wanders in and","in and decides","and decides to","decides to hold","to hold the","hold the dancers","the dancers ,","dancers , bartender",", bartender ,","bartender , and",", and remaining","and remaining customers","remaining customers hostage","He torments them","torments them with","them with little","with little tasks","little tasks he","tasks he wants","he wants performed","wants performed ,","performed , playing",", playing on","playing on their","on their weaknesses","their weaknesses and","weaknesses and relying","and relying on","relying on his","on his gun","his gun for","gun for intimidation","Eventually the hostages","the hostages begin","hostages begin formulating","begin formulating plans","formulating plans to","plans to thwart","to thwart his","thwart his control","Meanwhile , two",", two policemen","two policemen are","policemen are observing","are observing the","observing the outside","the outside of","outside of the","of the strip","the strip joint","strip joint ,","joint , realizing",", realizing that","realizing that something","that something 's","something 's wrong","'s wrong and","wrong and trying","and trying to","trying to decide","to decide if","decide if it","if it 's","it 's worth","'s worth ruining","worth ruining their","ruining their buzz","their buzz to","buzz to intervene"],"2grams":["As Zipper","Zipper 's","'s Clown","Clown Palace","Palace (","( a","a strip","strip bar","bar )",") closes","closes ,",", Neil","Neil wanders","wanders in","in and","and decides","decides to","to hold","hold the","the dancers","dancers ,",", bartender","bartender ,",", and","and remaining","remaining customers","customers hostage","He torments","torments them","them with","with little","little tasks","tasks he","he wants","wants performed","performed ,",", playing","playing on","on their","their weaknesses","weaknesses and","and relying","relying on","on his","his gun","gun for","for intimidation","Eventually the","the hostages","hostages begin","begin formulating","formulating plans","plans to","to thwart","thwart his","his control","Meanwhile ,",", two","two policemen","policemen are","are observing","observing the","the outside","outside of","of the","the strip","strip joint","joint ,",", realizing","realizing that","that something","something 's","'s wrong","wrong and","and trying","trying to","to decide","decide if","if it","it 's","'s worth","worth ruining","ruining their","their buzz","buzz to","to intervene"]}

{"title":"Naga the Eternal Yogi","plot":"This documentary is a research on the origins of yoga. A journey that will bring a young ascetic, belonging to the oldest Indian monastic order, to the most important religious festival for Hindu: The Kumbh Mela. This event is the bigger gathering of men on Earth. It's estimated that during its celebration (20 days) more than 100 million people attended the ceremony. We travel with our young ascetic from his temple to the festival. A journey that lasted 3 month, during which he has found friends, gurus and devotees.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","documentari","is","a","research","on","the","origin","of","yoga",".","A","journey","that","will","bring","a","young","ascet",",","belong","to","the","oldest","Indian","monast","order",",","to","the","most","import","religi","festiv","for","Hindu",":","The","Kumbh","Mela",".","This","event","is","the","bigger","gather","of","men","on","Earth",".","It","'s","estim","that","dure","it","celebr","(","20","day",")","more","than","100","million","peopl","attend","the","ceremoni",".","We","travel","with","our","young","ascet","from","his","templ","to","the","festiv",".","A","journey","that","last","3","month",",","dure","which","he","has","found","friend",",","gurus","and","devote","."],"lemmas":["this","documentary","be","a","research","on","the","origin","of","yoga",".","a","journey","that","will","bring","a","young","ascetic",",","belong","to","the","oldest","indian","monastic","order",",","to","the","most","important","religious","festival","for","Hindu",":","the","kumbh","mela",".","this","event","be","the","bigger","gathering","of","man","on","Earth",".","it","be","estimate","that","during","its","celebration","-lrb-","20","day","-rrb-","more","than","100","million","people","attend","the","ceremony",".","we","travel","with","we","young","ascetic","from","he","temple","to","the","festival",".","a","journey","that","last","3","month",",","during","which","he","have","find","friend",",","guru","and","devotee","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This documentary is","documentary is a","is a research","a research on","research on the","on the origins","the origins of","origins of yoga","A journey that","journey that will","that will bring","will bring a","bring a young","a young ascetic","young ascetic ,","ascetic , belonging",", belonging to","belonging to the","to the oldest","the oldest Indian","oldest Indian monastic","Indian monastic order","monastic order ,","order , to",", to the","to the most","the most important","most important religious","important religious festival","religious festival for","festival for Hindu","for Hindu :","Hindu : The",": The Kumbh","The Kumbh Mela","This event is","event is the","is the bigger","the bigger gathering","bigger gathering of","gathering of men","of men on","men on Earth","It 's estimated","'s estimated that","estimated that during","that during its","during its celebration","its celebration (","celebration ( 20","( 20 days","20 days )","days ) more",") more than","more than 100","than 100 million","100 million people","million people attended","people attended the","attended the ceremony","We travel with","travel with our","with our young","our young ascetic","young ascetic from","ascetic from his","from his temple","his temple to","temple to the","to the festival","A journey that","journey that lasted","that lasted 3","lasted 3 month","3 month ,","month , during",", during which","during which he","which he has","he has found","has found friends","found friends ,","friends , gurus",", gurus and","gurus and devotees"],"2grams":["This documentary","documentary is","is a","a research","research on","on the","the origins","origins of","of yoga","A journey","journey that","that will","will bring","bring a","a young","young ascetic","ascetic ,",", belonging","belonging to","to the","the oldest","oldest Indian","Indian monastic","monastic order","order ,",", to","to the","the most","most important","important religious","religious festival","festival for","for Hindu","Hindu :",": The","The Kumbh","Kumbh Mela","This event","event is","is the","the bigger","bigger gathering","gathering of","of men","men on","on Earth","It 's","'s estimated","estimated that","that during","during its","its celebration","celebration (","( 20","20 days","days )",") more","more than","than 100","100 million","million people","people attended","attended the","the ceremony","We travel","travel with","with our","our young","young ascetic","ascetic from","from his","his temple","temple to","to the","the festival","A journey","journey that","that lasted","lasted 3","3 month","month ,",", during","during which","which he","he has","has found","found friends","friends ,",", gurus","gurus and","and devotees"]}

{"title":"Taxi 4","plot":"Unlucky, clumsy, charming Marseile PD detective Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec must assist worse-than-Clouseau commissioner Gibert guarding a Belgian criminal reputed as dangerous as - and caged like Hannibal Lector. Émilien's cool friend, taxi driver Daniel Morales, initially only agrees to babysit both their buddy-sons, as Émilien's wife Petra is away on top-secret mission. But soon the Belgian escapes, and while chasing him the mates stumble on a bank robbery and a drug king's palatial villa, where the grand finale reeks havoc.","genres":["Action"," Crime"," Comedy"],"stems":["Unlucki",",","clumsi",",","charm","Marseil","PD","detect","Émilien","Coutant-Kerbalec","must","assist","worse-than-Clouseau","commission","Gibert","guard","a","Belgian","crimin","reput","as","danger","as","-","and","cage","like","Hannib","Lector",".","Émilien","'s","cool","friend",",","taxi","driver","Daniel","Moral",",","initi","onli","agre","to","babysit","both","their","buddy-son",",","as","Émilien","'s","wife","Petra","is","away","on","top-secret","mission",".","But","soon","the","Belgian","escap",",","and","while","chase","him","the","mate","stumbl","on","a","bank","robberi","and","a","drug","king","'s","palati","villa",",","where","the","grand","final","reek","havoc","."],"lemmas":["unlucky",",","clumsy",",","charming","Marseile","pd","detective","Émilien","Coutant-Kerbalec","must","assist","worse-than-clouseau","commissioner","Gibert","guard","a","belgian","criminal","repute","as","dangerous","as","-","and","cage","like","Hannibal","Lector",".","Émilien","'s","cool","friend",",","taxi","driver","Daniel","Morales",",","initially","only","agree","to","babysit","both","they","buddy-son",",","as","Émilien","'s","wife","Petra","be","away","on","top-secret","mission",".","but","soon","the","belgian","escape",",","and","while","chase","he","the","mate","stumble","on","a","bank","robbery","and","a","drug","king","'s","palatial","villa",",","where","the","grand","finale","reeks","havoc","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Unlucky , clumsy",", clumsy ,","clumsy , charming",", charming Marseile","charming Marseile PD","Marseile PD detective","PD detective Émilien","detective Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec","Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec must","Coutant-Kerbalec must assist","must assist worse-than-Clouseau","assist worse-than-Clouseau commissioner","worse-than-Clouseau commissioner Gibert","commissioner Gibert guarding","Gibert guarding a","guarding a Belgian","a Belgian criminal","Belgian criminal reputed","criminal reputed as","reputed as dangerous","as dangerous as","dangerous as -","as - and","- and caged","and caged like","caged like Hannibal","like Hannibal Lector","Émilien 's cool","'s cool friend","cool friend ,","friend , taxi",", taxi driver","taxi driver Daniel","driver Daniel Morales","Daniel Morales ,","Morales , initially",", initially only","initially only agrees","only agrees to","agrees to babysit","to babysit both","babysit both their","both their buddy-sons","their buddy-sons ,","buddy-sons , as",", as Émilien","as Émilien 's","Émilien 's wife","'s wife Petra","wife Petra is","Petra is away","is away on","away on top-secret","on top-secret mission","But soon the","soon the Belgian","the Belgian escapes","Belgian escapes ,","escapes , and",", and while","and while chasing","while chasing him","chasing him the","him the mates","the mates stumble","mates stumble on","stumble on a","on a bank","a bank robbery","bank robbery and","robbery and a","and a drug","a drug king","drug king 's","king 's palatial","'s palatial villa","palatial villa ,","villa , where",", where the","where the grand","the grand finale","grand finale reeks","finale reeks havoc"],"2grams":["Unlucky ,",", clumsy","clumsy ,",", charming","charming Marseile","Marseile PD","PD detective","detective Émilien","Émilien Coutant-Kerbalec","Coutant-Kerbalec must","must assist","assist worse-than-Clouseau","worse-than-Clouseau commissioner","commissioner Gibert","Gibert guarding","guarding a","a Belgian","Belgian criminal","criminal reputed","reputed as","as dangerous","dangerous as","as -","- and","and caged","caged like","like Hannibal","Hannibal Lector","Émilien 's","'s cool","cool friend","friend ,",", taxi","taxi driver","driver Daniel","Daniel Morales","Morales ,",", initially","initially only","only agrees","agrees to","to babysit","babysit both","both their","their buddy-sons","buddy-sons ,",", as","as Émilien","Émilien 's","'s wife","wife Petra","Petra is","is away","away on","on top-secret","top-secret mission","But soon","soon the","the Belgian","Belgian escapes","escapes ,",", and","and while","while chasing","chasing him","him the","the mates","mates stumble","stumble on","on a","a bank","bank robbery","robbery and","and a","a drug","drug king","king 's","'s palatial","palatial villa","villa ,",", where","where the","the grand","grand finale","finale reeks","reeks havoc"]}

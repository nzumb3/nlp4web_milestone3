{"title":"Lacrau","plot":"The viper is deaf and the scorpion can't see, so it is and so shall be, the same way the countryside is peaceful and the city bustling and the human being impossible to satisfy. Lacrau demands the return 'to the curve where man got lost' in a journey from the city towards nature. The escape from chaos and emotional void we call progress; matter without spirit, without will. The search for the most ancient sensations and relationships of mankind. The amazement, the fear of the unknown, the loss of basic comforts, loneliness, the meeting with the other, the other animal, the other vegetable. A dive looking for a connection with the world. Where beginning and end are the same, but I am not.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","viper","is","deaf","and","the","scorpion","ca","n't","see",",","so","it","is","and","so","shall","be",",","the","same","way","the","countrysid","is","peac","and","the","citi","bustl","and","the","human","be","imposs","to","satisfi",".","Lacrau","demand","the","return","'","to","the","curv","where","man","got","lost","'","in","a","journey","from","the","citi","toward","natur",".","The","escap","from","chao","and","emot","void","we","call","progress",";","matter","without","spirit",",","without","will",".","The","search","for","the","most","ancient","sensat","and","relationship","of","mankind",".","The","amaz",",","the","fear","of","the","unknown",",","the","loss","of","basic","comfort",",","loneli",",","the","meet","with","the","other",",","the","other","anim",",","the","other","veget",".","A","dive","look","for","a","connect","with","the","world",".","Where","begin","and","end","are","the","same",",","but","I","am","not","."],"lemmas":["the","viper","be","deaf","and","the","scorpion","can","not","see",",","so","it","be","and","so","shall","be",",","the","same","way","the","countryside","be","peaceful","and","the","city","bustling","and","the","human","be","impossible","to","satisfy",".","Lacrau","demand","the","return","'","to","the","curve","where","man","get","lose","'","in","a","journey","from","the","city","towards","nature",".","the","escape","from","chaos","and","emotional","void","we","call","progress",";","matter","without","spirit",",","without","will",".","the","search","for","the","most","ancient","sensation","and","relationship","of","mankind",".","the","amazement",",","the","fear","of","the","unknown",",","the","loss","of","basic","comfort",",","loneliness",",","the","meeting","with","the","other",",","the","other","animal",",","the","other","vegetable",".","a","dive","look","for","a","connection","with","the","world",".","where","beginning","and","end","be","the","same",",","but","I","be","not","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The viper is","viper is deaf","is deaf and","deaf and the","and the scorpion","the scorpion ca","scorpion ca n't","ca n't see","n't see ,","see , so",", so it","so it is","it is and","is and so","and so shall","so shall be","shall be ,","be , the",", the same","the same way","same way the","way the countryside","the countryside is","countryside is peaceful","is peaceful and","peaceful and the","and the city","the city bustling","city bustling and","bustling and the","and the human","the human being","human being impossible","being impossible to","impossible to satisfy","Lacrau demands the","demands the return","the return '","return ' to","' to the","to the curve","the curve where","curve where man","where man got","man got lost","got lost '","lost ' in","' in a","in a journey","a journey from","journey from the","from the city","the city towards","city towards nature","The escape from","escape from chaos","from chaos and","chaos and emotional","and emotional void","emotional void we","void we call","we call progress","call progress ;","progress ;

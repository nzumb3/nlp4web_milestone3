{"title":"Charly 10th Anniversary Encore","plot":"Sam Roberts thinks he has all the answers: the purpose of life, the meaning of love, the plan for a perfect future; until Charly walks into his life. As opposite as New York and Salt Lake, Charly and Sam are thrown together by circumstance and repelled by differences. She's spontaneous and cynical. He's scheduled and idealistic. She's open and mischievous. He's guarded and practical. Differences lead to interest, however, as Charly finds depth in Sam's idealism and Sam seeks the vibrance of Charly's joie de vivre. But all is not smooth in the Rockies as their relationship accelerates - cultural differences, family issues, former loves and life-altering challenges threaten to shake things up. Adapted from Jack Weyland's best-selling novel Charly, the film is at times light-hearted, at times soul-searching, and above all a thoughtful journey of love, of laughter... and of hope.","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["Sam","Robert","think","he","has","all","the","answer",":","the","purpos","of","life",",","the","mean","of","love",",","the","plan","for","a","perfect","futur",";","until","Char","walk","into","his","life",".","As","opposit","as","New","York","and","Salt","Lake",",","Char","and","Sam","are","thrown","togeth","by","circumst","and","repel","by","differ",".","She","'s","spontan","and","cynic",".","He","'s","schedul","and","idealist",".","She","'s","open","and","mischiev",".","He","'s","guard","and","practic",".","Differ","lead","to","interest",",","howev",",","as","Char","find","depth","in","Sam","'s","ideal","and","Sam","seek","the","vibranc","of","Char","'s","joie","de","vivr",".","But","all","is","not","smooth","in","the","Rocki","as","their","relationship","acceler","-","cultur","differ",",","famili","issu",",","former","love","and","life-alt","challeng","threaten","to","shake","thing","up",".","Adapt","from","Jack","Weyland","'s","best-sel","novel","Char",",","the","film","is","at","time","light-heart",",","at","time","soul-search",",","and","abov","all","a","thought","journey","of","love",",","of","laughter","...","and","of","hope","."],"lemmas":["Sam","Roberts","think","he","have","all","the","answer",":","the","purpose","of","life",",","the","meaning","of","love",",","the","plan","for","a","perfect","future",";","until","Charly","walk","into","he","life",".","as","opposite","as","New","York","and","Salt","Lake",",","Charly","and","Sam","be","throw","together","by","circumstance","and","repel","by","difference",".","she","be","spontaneous","and","cynical",".","he","be","schedule","and","idealistic",".","she","be","open","and","mischievous",".","he","be","guard","and","practical",".","difference","lead","to","interest",",","however",",","as","Charly","find","depth","in","Sam","'s","idealism","and","Sam","seek","the","vibrance","of","Charly","'s","joie","de","vivre",".","but","all","be","not","smooth","in","the","Rockies","as","they","relationship","accelerate","-","cultural","difference",",","family","issue",",","former","love","and","life-altering","challenge","threaten","to","shake","thing","up",".","adapt","from","Jack","Weyland","'s","best-selling","novel","Charly",",","the","film","be","at","time","light-hearted",",","at","time","soul-searching",",","and","above","all","a","thoughtful","journey","of","love",",","of","laughter","...","and","of","hope","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sam Roberts thinks","Roberts thinks he","thinks he has","he has all","has all the","all the answers","the answers :","answers : the",": the purpose","the purpose of","purpose of life","of life ,","life , the",", the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of love","of love ,","love , the",", the plan","the plan for","plan for a","for a perfect","a perfect future","perfect future ;","future ;

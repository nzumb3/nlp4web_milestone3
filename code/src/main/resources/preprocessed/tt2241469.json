{"title":"The Resort","plot":"A documentary about one of the first concentration camps during World War II used by the Nazis as propaganda tool in order to dispel rumors about extermination camps . This film gives individual faces and personalities to the incomprehensible number of human beings who entered concentration camps and never came out, by narrowing in on one small internment camp, Theresienstadt, and a handful of its prisoners who were able to maintain their optimism and humanity through misery and death, and managed to save their own lives against all odds. Their stories are not only of personal survival; they also reveal how from 1941 to 1945 the small Czech city of Terezin, which had been turned into a transit camp for more then 150,000 Jews and was called the \"Little Zionist Experiment\" by Adolf Eichmann - played host to one of the strangest and most horrific perpetrations of inhumanity ever inflicted on the Jewish people, and how their willful and creative spirit rose above it all.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["A","documentari","about","one","of","the","first","concentr","camp","dure","World","War","II","use","by","the","Nazi","as","propaganda","tool","in","order","to","dispel","rumor","about","extermin","camp",".","This","film","give","individu","face","and","person","to","the","incomprehens","number","of","human","be","who","enter","concentr","camp","and","never","came","out",",","by","narrow","in","on","one","small","intern","camp",",","Theresienstadt",",","and","a","hand","of","it","prison","who","were","abl","to","maintain","their","optim","and","human","through","miseri","and","death",",","and","manag","to","save","their","own","live","against","all","odd",".","Their","stori","are","not","onli","of","person","surviv",";","they","also","reveal","how","from","1941","to","1945","the","small","Czech","citi","of","Terezin",",","which","had","been","turn","into","a","transit","camp","for","more","then","150,000","Jew","and","was","call","the","\"","Littl","Zionist","Experiment","\"","by","Adolf","Eichmann","-","play","host","to","one","of","the","strangest","and","most","horrif","perpetr","of","inhuman","ever","inflict","on","the","Jewish","peopl",",","and","how","their","will","and","creativ","spirit","rose","abov","it","all","."],"lemmas":["a","documentary","about","one","of","the","first","concentration","camp","during","World","War","II","use","by","the","Nazis","as","propaganda","tool","in","order","to","dispel","rumor","about","extermination","camp",".","this","film","give","individual","face","and","personality","to","the","incomprehensible","number","of","human","being","who","enter","concentration","camp","and","never","come","out",",","by","narrow","in","on","one","small","internment","camp",",","Theresienstadt",",","and","a","handful","of","its","prisoner","who","be","able","to","maintain","they","optimism","and","humanity","through","misery","and","death",",","and","manage","to","save","they","own","life","against","all","odds",".","they","story","be","not","only","of","personal","survival",";","they","also","reveal","how","from","1941","to","1945","the","small","czech","city","of","Terezin",",","which","have","be","turn","into","a","transit","camp","for","more","then","150,000","jew","and","be","call","the","``","Little","Zionist","Experiment","''","by","Adolf","Eichmann","-","play","host","to","one","of","the","strangest","and","most","horrific","perpetration","of","inhumanity","ever","inflict","on","the","jewish","people",",","and","how","they","willful","and","creative","spirit","rise","above","it","all","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A documentary about","documentary about one","about one of","one of the","of the first","the first concentration","first concentration camps","concentration camps during","camps during World","during World War","World War II","War II used","II used by","used by the","by the Nazis","the Nazis as","Nazis as propaganda","as propaganda tool","propaganda tool in","tool in order","in order to","order to dispel","to dispel rumors","dispel rumors about","rumors about extermination","about extermination camps","This film gives","film gives individual","gives individual faces","individual faces and","faces and personalities","and personalities to","personalities to the","to the incomprehensible","the incomprehensible number","incomprehensible number of","number of human","of human beings","human beings who","beings who entered","who entered concentration","entered concentration camps","concentration camps and","camps and never","and never came","never came out","came out ,","out , by",", by narrowing","by narrowing in","narrowing in on","in on one","on one small","one small internment","small internment camp","internment camp ,","camp , Theresienstadt",", Theresienstadt ,","Theresienstadt , and",", and a","and a handful","a handful of","handful of its","of its prisoners","its prisoners who","prisoners who were","who were able","were able to","able to maintain","to maintain their","maintain their optimism","their optimism and","optimism and humanity","and humanity through","humanity through misery","through misery and","misery and death","and death ,","death , and",", and managed","and managed to","managed to save","to save their","save their own","their own lives","own lives against","lives against all","against all odds","Their stories are","stories are not","are not only","not only of","only of personal","of personal survival","personal survival ;","survival ;

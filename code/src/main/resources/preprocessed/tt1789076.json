{"title":"Nicodemus","plot":"A 12 year old boy who has the ability to convert anyone into a Christian - criminals, Jews, homosexuals - asks God to give him a challenge. A real challenge. Two things occur. 1) The boy comes home from camping with his parents and notices strange footage that was recorded in his camera. Footage that suggests encounters with extraterrestrial life. 2) A bully appears at his school out of nowhere, terrorizing his friends and teachers. This boy claims he is a Christian and thus cannot be converted. The boy, for the first time, faces a person he cannot convert. 'The Sibling' follows the boy's journey as these two events dovetail to a terrifying conclusion about the boy's faith, deeply unforeseen.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Horror"],"stems":["A","12","year","old","boy","who","has","the","abil","to","convert","anyon","into","a","Christian","-","crimin",",","Jew",",","homosexu","-","ask","God","to","give","him","a","challeng",".","A","real","challeng",".","Two","thing","occur",".","1",")","The","boy","come","home","from","camp","with","his","parent","and","notic","strang","footag","that","was","record","in","his","camera",".","Footag","that","suggest","encount","with","extraterrestri","life",".","2",")","A","bulli","appear","at","his","school","out","of","nowher",",","terror","his","friend","and","teacher",".","This","boy","claim","he","is","a","Christian","and","thus","can","not","be","convert",".","The","boy",",","for","the","first","time",",","face","a","person","he","can","not","convert",".","'","The","Sibl","'","follow","the","boy","'s","journey","as","these","two","event","dovetail","to","a","terrifi","conclus","about","the","boy","'s","faith",",","deepli","unforeseen","."],"lemmas":["a","12","year","old","boy","who","have","the","ability","to","convert","anyone","into","a","Christian","-","criminal",",","jew",",","homosexual","-","ask","God","to","give","he","a","challenge",".","a","real","challenge",".","two","thing","occur",".","1","-rrb-","the","boy","come","home","from","camp","with","he","parent","and","notice","strange","footage","that","be","record","in","he","camera",".","footage","that","suggest","encounter","with","extraterrestrial","life",".","2","-rrb-","a","bully","appear","at","he","school","out","of","nowhere",",","terrorize","he","friend","and","teacher",".","this","boy","claim","he","be","a","Christian","and","thus","can","not","be","convert",".","the","boy",",","for","the","first","time",",","face","a","person","he","can","not","convert",".","'","the","sibling","'","follow","the","boy","'s","journey","as","these","two","event","dovetail","to","a","terrifying","conclusion","about","the","boy","'s","faith",",","deeply","unforeseen","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["A 12 year","12 year old","year old boy","old boy who","boy who has","who has the","has the ability","the ability to","ability to convert","to convert anyone","convert anyone into","anyone into a","into a Christian","a Christian -","Christian - criminals","- criminals ,","criminals , Jews",", Jews ,","Jews , homosexuals",", homosexuals -","homosexuals - asks","- asks God","asks God to","God to give","to give him","give him a","him a challenge","A real challenge","Two things occur","1 ) The",") The boy","The boy comes","boy comes home","comes home from","home from camping","from camping with","camping with his","with his parents","his parents and","parents and notices","and notices strange","notices strange footage","strange footage that","footage that was","that was recorded","was recorded in","recorded in his","in his camera","Footage that suggests","that suggests encounters","suggests encounters with","encounters with extraterrestrial","with extraterrestrial life","2 ) A",") A bully","A bully appears","bully appears at","appears at his","at his school","his school out","school out of","out of nowhere","of nowhere ,","nowhere , terrorizing",", terrorizing his","terrorizing his friends","his friends and","friends and teachers","This boy claims","boy claims he","claims he is","he is a","is a Christian","a Christian and","Christian and thus","and thus can","thus can not","can not be","not be converted","The boy ,","boy , for",", for the","for the first","the first time","first time ,","time , faces",", faces a","faces a person","a person he","person he can","he can not","can not convert","not convert .","convert .

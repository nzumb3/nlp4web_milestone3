{"title":"Life May Be","plot":"An epistolary feature film: a cinematic discourse between a British director, (Mark Cousins, the celebrated film maker and historian) and an Iranian actress and director (Mania Akbari, famed for her work with Abbas Kiarostami and in her own right as a director) which extends the concept of \"essay film\" with startling confrontations in the arenas of cultural issues, gender politics and differing artistic sensibilities. A unique journey into the minds of two exceptional filmmakers which becomes a love affair on film.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["An","epistolari","featur","film",":","a","cinemat","discours","between","a","British","director",",","(","Mark","Cousin",",","the","celebr","film","maker","and","historian",")","and","an","Iranian","actress","and","director","(","Mania","Akbari",",","fame","for","her","work","with","Abbas","Kiarostami","and","in","her","own","right","as","a","director",")","which","extend","the","concept","of","\"","essay","film","\"","with","startl","confront","in","the","arena","of","cultur","issu",",","gender","polit","and","differ","artist","sensibl",".","A","uniqu","journey","into","the","mind","of","two","except","filmmak","which","becom","a","love","affair","on","film","."],"lemmas":["a","epistolary","feature","film",":","a","cinematic","discourse","between","a","british","director",",","-lrb-","Mark","Cousins",",","the","celebrated","film","maker","and","historian","-rrb-","and","a","iranian","actress","and","director","-lrb-","Mania","Akbari",",","famed","for","she","work","with","Abbas","Kiarostami","and","in","she","own","right","as","a","director","-rrb-","which","extend","the","concept","of","``","essay","film","''","with","startling","confrontation","in","the","arena","of","cultural","issue",",","gender","politics","and","differ","artistic","sensibility",".","a","unique","journey","into","the","mind","of","two","exceptional","filmmaker","which","become","a","love","affair","on","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An epistolary feature","epistolary feature film","feature film :","film : a",": a cinematic","a cinematic discourse","cinematic discourse between","discourse between a","between a British","a British director","British director ,","director , (",", ( Mark","( Mark Cousins","Mark Cousins ,","Cousins , the",", the celebrated","the celebrated film","celebrated film maker","film maker and","maker and historian","and historian )","historian ) and",") and an","and an Iranian","an Iranian actress","Iranian actress and","actress and director","and director (","director ( Mania","( Mania Akbari","Mania Akbari ,","Akbari , famed",", famed for","famed for her","for her work","her work with","work with Abbas","with Abbas Kiarostami","Abbas Kiarostami and","Kiarostami and in","and in her","in her own","her own right","own right as","right as a","as a director","a director )","director ) which",") which extends","which extends the","extends the concept","the concept of","concept of \"","of \" essay","\" essay film","essay film \"","film \" with","\" with startling","with startling confrontations","startling confrontations in","confrontations in the","in the arenas","the arenas of","arenas of cultural","of cultural issues","cultural issues ,","issues , gender",", gender politics","gender politics and","politics and differing","and differing artistic","differing artistic sensibilities","A unique journey","unique journey into","journey into the","into the minds","the minds of","minds of two","of two exceptional","two exceptional filmmakers","exceptional filmmakers which","filmmakers which becomes","which becomes a","becomes a love","a love affair","love affair on","affair on film"],"2grams":["An epistolary","epistolary feature","feature film","film :",": a","a cinematic","cinematic discourse","discourse between","between a","a British","British director","director ,",", (","( Mark","Mark Cousins","Cousins ,",", the","the celebrated","celebrated film","film maker","maker and","and historian","historian )",") and","and an","an Iranian","Iranian actress","actress and","and director","director (","( Mania","Mania Akbari","Akbari ,",", famed","famed for","for her","her work","work with","with Abbas","Abbas Kiarostami","Kiarostami and","and in","in her","her own","own right","right as","as a","a director","director )",") which","which extends","extends the","the concept","concept of","of \"","\" essay","essay film","film \"","\" with","with startling","startling confrontations","confrontations in","in the","the arenas","arenas of","of cultural","cultural issues","issues ,",", gender","gender politics","politics and","and differing","differing artistic","artistic sensibilities","A unique","unique journey","journey into","into the","the minds","minds of","of two","two exceptional","exceptional filmmakers","filmmakers which","which becomes","becomes a","a love","love affair","affair on","on film"]}

{"title":"Born in Syria","plot":"Since civil war started in Syria in 2011, an estimated 9 million Syrians have fled their homes, half of them children. These children have fled unimaginable horror: the indiscriminate bombings of Bachar Al Assad's government, and ISIS' raping and beheading, only to find themselves trapped in makeshift camps or closed borders. We witness the journey of these refugees to the promised land of Europe.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sinc","civil","war","start","in","Syria","in","2011",",","an","estim","9","million","Syrian","have","fled","their","home",",","half","of","them","children",".","These","children","have","fled","unimagin","horror",":","the","indiscrimin","bomb","of","Bachar","Al","Assad","'s","govern",",","and","ISIS","'","rape","and","behead",",","onli","to","find","themselv","trap","in","makeshift","camp","or","close","border",".","We","wit","the","journey","of","these","refuge","to","the","promis","land","of","Europ","."],"lemmas":["since","civil","war","start","in","Syria","in","2011",",","a","estimate","9","million","Syrians","have","flee","they","home",",","half","of","they","child",".","these","child","have","flee","unimaginable","horror",":","the","indiscriminate","bombing","of","Bachar","Al","Assad","'s","government",",","and","ISIS","'","rape","and","beheading",",","only","to","find","themselves","trapped","in","makeshift","camp","or","close","border",".","we","witness","the","journey","of","these","refugee","to","the","promised","land","of","Europe","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Since civil war","civil war started","war started in","started in Syria","in Syria in","Syria in 2011","in 2011 ,","2011 , an",", an estimated","an estimated 9","estimated 9 million","9 million Syrians","million Syrians have","Syrians have fled","have fled their","fled their homes","their homes ,","homes , half",", half of","half of them","of them children","These children have","children have fled","have fled unimaginable","fled unimaginable horror","unimaginable horror :","horror : the",": the indiscriminate","the indiscriminate bombings","indiscriminate bombings of","bombings of Bachar","of Bachar Al","Bachar Al Assad","Al Assad 's","Assad 's government","'s government ,","government , and",", and ISIS","and ISIS '","ISIS ' raping","' raping and","raping and beheading","and beheading ,","beheading , only",", only to","only to find","to find themselves","find themselves trapped","themselves trapped in","trapped in makeshift","in makeshift camps","makeshift camps or","camps or closed","or closed borders","We witness the","witness the journey","the journey of","journey of these","of these refugees","these refugees to","refugees to the","to the promised","the promised land","promised land of","land of Europe"],"2grams":["Since civil","civil war","war started","started in","in Syria","Syria in","in 2011","2011 ,",", an","an estimated","estimated 9","9 million","million Syrians","Syrians have","have fled","fled their","their homes","homes ,",", half","half of","of them","them children","These children","children have","have fled","fled unimaginable","unimaginable horror","horror :",": the","the indiscriminate","indiscriminate bombings","bombings of","of Bachar","Bachar Al","Al Assad","Assad 's","'s government","government ,",", and","and ISIS","ISIS '","' raping","raping and","and beheading","beheading ,",", only","only to","to find","find themselves","themselves trapped","trapped in","in makeshift","makeshift camps","camps or","or closed","closed borders","We witness","witness the","the journey","journey of","of these","these refugees","refugees to","to the","the promised","promised land","land of","of Europe"]}

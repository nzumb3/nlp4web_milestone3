{"title":"La decisión de Julia","plot":"Julia goes to a hotel in the centre of Madrid with a single suitcase as baggage and chooses to stay at the same room where she lived a vital and unforgettable experience in the past. She hears a song by Leo Ferré coming from the room next door. The laughter and happiness that she hears through the walls bring her back memories of happy times. Someone knocks on the door and she calmly lets her expected visitors in with a smile, knowing that she is ready to carry out her thoughtful decision. While the rain strikes the windows on a gloomy night, the narrative of her passionate life story begins; a secret love, a sudden departure, a trip to an unknown place searching answers, a descent to hell - as if it were an emotionally charged thriller, a life fed by memories emerges.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Julia","goe","to","a","hotel","in","the","centr","of","Madrid","with","a","singl","suitcas","as","baggag","and","choos","to","stay","at","the","same","room","where","she","live","a","vital","and","unforgett","experi","in","the","past",".","She","hear","a","song","by","Leo","Ferré","come","from","the","room","next","door",".","The","laughter","and","happi","that","she","hear","through","the","wall","bring","her","back","memori","of","happi","time",".","Someon","knock","on","the","door","and","she","calm","let","her","expect","visitor","in","with","a","smile",",","know","that","she","is","readi","to","carri","out","her","thought","decis",".","While","the","rain","strike","the","window","on","a","gloomi","night",",","the","narrat","of","her","passion","life","stori","begin",";","a","secret","love",",","a","sudden","departur",",","a","trip","to","an","unknown","place","search","answer",",","a","descent","to","hell","-","as","if","it","were","an","emot","charg","thriller",",","a","life","fed","by","memori","emerg","."],"lemmas":["Julia","go","to","a","hotel","in","the","centre","of","Madrid","with","a","single","suitcase","as","baggage","and","choose","to","stay","at","the","same","room","where","she","live","a","vital","and","unforgettable","experience","in","the","past",".","she","hear","a","song","by","Leo","Ferré","come","from","the","room","next","door",".","the","laughter","and","happiness","that","she","hear","through","the","wall","bring","she","back","memory","of","happy","time",".","someone","knock","on","the","door","and","she","calmly","let","she","expect","visitor","in","with","a","smile",",","know","that","she","be","ready","to","carry","out","she","thoughtful","decision",".","while","the","rain","strike","the","window","on","a","gloomy","night",",","the","narrative","of","she","passionate","life","story","begin",";","a","secret","love",",","a","sudden","departure",",","a","trip","to","a","unknown","place","search","answer",",","a","descent","to","hell","-","as","if","it","be","a","emotionally","charged","thriller",",","a","life","feed","by","memory","emerge","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Julia goes to","goes to a","to a hotel","a hotel in","hotel in the","in the centre","the centre of","centre of Madrid","of Madrid with","Madrid with a","with a single","a single suitcase","single suitcase as","suitcase as baggage","as baggage and","baggage and chooses","and chooses to","chooses to stay","to stay at","stay at the","at the same","the same room","same room where","room where she","where she lived","she lived a","lived a vital","a vital and","vital and unforgettable","and unforgettable experience","unforgettable experience in","experience in the","in the past","She hears a","hears a song","a song by","song by Leo","by Leo Ferré","Leo Ferré coming","Ferré coming from","coming from the","from the room","the room next","room next door","The laughter and","laughter and happiness","and happiness that","happiness that she","that she hears","she hears through","hears through the","through the walls","the walls bring","walls bring her","bring her back","her back memories","back memories of","memories of happy","of happy times","Someone knocks on","knocks on the","on the door","the door and","door and she","and she calmly","she calmly lets","calmly lets her","lets her expected","her expected visitors","expected visitors in","visitors in with","in with a","with a smile","a smile ,","smile , knowing",", knowing that","knowing that she","that she is","she is ready","is ready to","ready to carry","to carry out","carry out her","out her thoughtful","her thoughtful decision","While the rain","the rain strikes","rain strikes the","strikes the windows","the windows on","windows on a","on a gloomy","a gloomy night","gloomy night ,","night , the",", the narrative","the narrative of","narrative of her","of her passionate","her passionate life","passionate life story","life story begins","story begins ;","begins ;

{"title":"Storm War","plot":"A series of freak weather occurrences around Washington D.C. reunites two estranged brothers who are the sons of a once prestigious climate scientist. One of them suspects their father is behind it and upon further investigation, they discover that all of their father's enemies are dead - victims of freak weather accidents. Soon their suspicions are confirmed as their father hijacks radio and TV transmissions to relay the message that unless a certain Senator whom canceled his Defense Department contracts is handed over, the city of Washington D.C will suffer the consequences. As the brothers race to form a plan that can defeat their father, he lets loose a variety of diabolical weather weapons on the Smithsonian, Jefferson and Lincoln Memorials, and National Mall!","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Drama"],"stems":["A","seri","of","freak","weather","occurr","around","Washington","D.C.","reunit","two","estrang","brother","who","are","the","son","of","a","onc","prestigi","climat","scientist",".","One","of","them","suspect","their","father","is","behind","it","and","upon","further","investig",",","they","discov","that","all","of","their","father","'s","enemi","are","dead","-","victim","of","freak","weather","accid",".","Soon","their","suspicion","are","confirm","as","their","father","hijack","radio","and","TV","transmiss","to","relay","the","messag","that","unless","a","certain","Senat","whom","cancel","his","Defens","Depart","contract","is","hand","over",",","the","citi","of","Washington","D.C","will","suffer","the","consequ",".","As","the","brother","race","to","form","a","plan","that","can","defeat","their","father",",","he","let","loos","a","varieti","of","diabol","weather","weapon","on","the","Smithsonian",",","Jefferson","and","Lincoln","Memori",",","and","Nation","Mall","!"],"lemmas":["a","series","of","freak","weather","occurrence","around","Washington","D.C.","reunite","two","estrange","brother","who","be","the","son","of","a","once","prestigious","climate","scientist",".","one","of","they","suspect","they","father","be","behind","it","and","upon","further","investigation",",","they","discover","that","all","of","they","father","'s","enemy","be","dead","-","victim","of","freak","weather","accident",".","soon","they","suspicion","be","confirm","as","they","father","hijack","radio","and","tv","transmission","to","relay","the","message","that","unless","a","certain","Senator","whom","cancel","he","Defense","Department","contract","be","hand","over",",","the","city","of","Washington","D.C","will","suffer","the","consequence",".","as","the","brother","race","to","form","a","plan","that","can","defeat","they","father",",","he","let","loose","a","variety","of","diabolical","weather","weapon","on","the","Smithsonian",",","Jefferson","and","Lincoln","Memorials",",","and","national","mall","!"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A series of","series of freak","of freak weather","freak weather occurrences","weather occurrences around","occurrences around Washington","around Washington D.C.","Washington D.C. reunites","D.C. reunites two","reunites two estranged","two estranged brothers","estranged brothers who","brothers who are","who are the","are the sons","the sons of","sons of a","of a once","a once prestigious","once prestigious climate","prestigious climate scientist","One of them","of them suspects","them suspects their","suspects their father","their father is","father is behind","is behind it","behind it and","it and upon","and upon further","upon further investigation","further investigation ,","investigation , they",", they discover","they discover that","discover that all","that all of","all of their","of their father","their father 's","father 's enemies","'s enemies are","enemies are dead","are dead -","dead -

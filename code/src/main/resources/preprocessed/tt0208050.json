{"title":"Chump Change","plot":"Rags to riches to rags comedy loosely based on the director Steve Burrows' actual experiences while writing screenplays in Los Angeles. Burrows (aka \"Milwaukee Steve\") finally makes it big as \"The Crotch Fresh\" commercial guy, but then can't catch another break -- not even when he auditions for a new Crotch Fresh commercial! He decides the only way to make a comeback as an actor is to fake his own death, then make a glorious return. Before that idea pans out, Milwaukee goes on \"Wheel of Fortune\", and become notorious when he's sued by the Merv Griffin Corp. \"Milwaukee Steve\" becomes a hot ticket, with numerous folks riding his coattails. However, after a studio hires him to write a script, nothing works out as planned. Desperate, broke, and depressed, Steve returns to Milwaukee, in mid-winter, to gain comfort from family and friends -- only to find his mother has rented out his room while on her annual trip to the Netherlands. \"Milwaukee\" then recounts his Los Angeles' saga to his mom's boarder as they explore some of Milwaukee's more amusing locales. By the end of the film we've met a host of crazy characters, and we are rooting for \"Milwaukee Steve/The Crotch Fresh Guy\" to find his own brand of \"fame, fortune, cheese, and beer.\"","genres":["Comedy","

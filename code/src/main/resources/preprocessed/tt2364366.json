{"title":"Pra LÃ¡ do Mundo","plot":"A magical breathtaking place in a hidden valley in Brazil attracted people from all over the world, who left large cities to unveil their abilities to reinvent themselves and everything they believed in. Suddenly they came face to face with a world of purity and vibrant perception, where natives and newcomers begun to exchange ideas and concepts as if they were from different eras. As time went on, they turned the place into a center for experimentation, diversity and ideological conflicts, which, at the same time, amaze and threat the life of the whole community.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","magic","breathtak","place","in","a","hidden","valley","in","Brazil","attract","peopl","from","all","over","the","world",",","who","left","larg","citi","to","unveil","their","abil","to","reinvent","themselv","and","everyth","they","believ","in",".","Sudden","they","came","face","to","face","with","a","world","of","puriti","and","vibrant","percept",",","where","nativ","and","newcom","begun","to","exchang","idea","and","concept","as","if","they","were","from","differ","era",".","As","time","went","on",",","they","turn","the","place","into","a","center","for","experiment",",","divers","and","ideolog","conflict",",","which",",","at","the","same","time",",","amaz","and","threat","the","life","of","the","whole","communiti","."],"lemmas":["a","magical","breathtaking","place","in","a","hidden","valley","in","Brazil","attract","people","from","all","over","the","world",",","who","leave","large","city","to","unveil","they","ability","to","reinvent","themselves","and","everything","they","believe","in",".","suddenly","they","come","face","to","face","with","a","world","of","purity","and","vibrant","perception",",","where","native","and","newcomer","begin","to","exchange","idea","and","concept","as","if","they","be","from","different","era",".","as","time","go","on",",","they","turn","the","place","into","a","center","for","experimentation",",","diversity","and","ideological","conflict",",","which",",","at","the","same","time",",","amaze","and","threat","the","life","of","the","whole","community","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A magical breathtaking","magical breathtaking place","breathtaking place in","place in a","in a hidden","a hidden valley","hidden valley in","valley in Brazil","in Brazil attracted","Brazil attracted people","attracted people from","people from all","from all over","all over the","over the world","the world ,","world , who",", who left","who left large","left large cities","large cities to","cities to unveil","to unveil their","unveil their abilities","their abilities to","abilities to reinvent","to reinvent themselves","reinvent themselves and","themselves and everything","and everything they","everything they believed","they believed in","Suddenly they came","they came face","came face to","face to face","to face with","face with a","with a world","a world of","world of purity","of purity and","purity and vibrant","and vibrant perception","vibrant perception ,","perception , where",", where natives","where natives and","natives and newcomers","and newcomers begun","newcomers begun to","begun to exchange","to exchange ideas","exchange ideas and","ideas and concepts","and concepts as","concepts as if","as if they","if they were","they were from","were from different","from different eras","As time went","time went on","went on ,","on , they",", they turned","they turned the","turned the place","the place into","place into a","into a center","a center for","center for experimentation","for experimentation ,","experimentation , diversity",", diversity and","diversity and ideological","and ideological conflicts","ideological conflicts ,","conflicts , which",", which ,","which , at",", at the","at the same","the same time","same time ,","time , amaze",", amaze and","amaze and threat","and threat the","threat the life","the life of","life of the","of the whole","the whole community"],"2grams":["A magical","magical breathtaking","breathtaking place","place in","in a","a hidden","hidden valley","valley in","in Brazil","Brazil attracted","attracted people","people from","from all","all over","over the","the world","world ,",", who","who left","left large","large cities","cities to","to unveil","unveil their","their abilities","abilities to","to reinvent","reinvent themselves","themselves and","and everything","everything they","they believed","believed in","Suddenly they","they came","came face","face to","to face","face with","with a","a world","world of","of purity","purity and","and vibrant","vibrant perception","perception ,",", where","where natives","natives and","and newcomers","newcomers begun","begun to","to exchange","exchange ideas","ideas and","and concepts","concepts as","as if","if they","they were","were from","from different","different eras","As time","time went","went on","on ,",", they","they turned","turned the","the place","place into","into a","a center","center for","for experimentation","experimentation ,",", diversity","diversity and","and ideological","ideological conflicts","conflicts ,",", which","which ,",", at","at the","the same","same time","time ,",", amaze","amaze and","and threat","threat the","the life","life of","of the","the whole","whole community"]}

{"title":"Me and Will","plot":"Jane and Will are familiar faces on the Los Angeles club scene. They meet officially at drug rehab after Jane OD'ed and Will crashed her motorcycle while driving stoned. They hit it off immediately and escape the clinic to travel to Montana and find the bike from Easy Rider (1969). Different from most road movies in that no one gets murdered, and no vengeance is reaped. On the contrary, the characters let their pasts and memories lead them down the road to emotional self-destruction. In other words, there is no seductive emancipation here, just people with problems that won't go away with a rev of a motor.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Jane","and","Will","are","familiar","face","on","the","Los","Angele","club","scene",".","They","meet","offici","at","drug","rehab","after","Jane","OD","'","ed","and","Will","crash","her","motorcycl","while","drive","stone",".","They","hit","it","off","immedi","and","escap","the","clinic","to","travel","to","Montana","and","find","the","bike","from","Easi","Rider","(","1969",")",".","Differ","from","most","road","movi","in","that","no","one","get","murder",",","and","no","vengeanc","is","reap",".","On","the","contrari",",","the","charact","let","their","past","and","memori","lead","them","down","the","road","to","emot","self-destruct",".","In","other","word",",","there","is","no","seduct","emancip","here",",","just","peopl","with","problem","that","wo","n't","go","away","with","a","rev","of","a","motor","."],"lemmas":["Jane","and","Will","be","familiar","face","on","the","Los","Angeles","club","scene",".","they","meet","officially","at","drug","rehab","after","Jane","OD","'","ed","and","Will","crash","she","motorcycle","while","drive","stone",".","they","hit","it","off","immediately","and","escape","the","clinic","to","travel","to","Montana","and","find","the","bike","from","Easy","Rider","-lrb-","1969","-rrb-",".","different","from","most","road","movie","in","that","no","one","get","murder",",","and","no","vengeance","be","reap",".","on","the","contrary",",","the","character","let","they","past","and","memory","lead","they","down","the","road","to","emotional","self-destruction",".","in","other","word",",","there","be","no","seductive","emancipation","here",",","just","people","with","problem","that","will","not","go","away","with","a","rev","of","a","motor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Jane

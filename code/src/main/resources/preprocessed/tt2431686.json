{"title":"15 North","plot":"Ben, a 25 year-old with anxiety and OCD, still living with his Mom, is forced to embark on a road trip with his only friend Richardson, an unambitious model. They are asked to drive to Salt Lake City to help Ben's angry great uncle move out of a retirement community and into his own home. In this take on modern young adulthood, we follow Ben and Richardson over the course of their enlightening three day road-trip that results in a series of fascinating encounters and the sort of banter that only occurs between two mismatched friends.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Ben",",","a","25","year-old","with","anxieti","and","OCD",",","still","live","with","his","Mom",",","is","forc","to","embark","on","a","road","trip","with","his","onli","friend","Richardson",",","an","unambiti","model",".","They","are","ask","to","drive","to","Salt","Lake","Citi","to","help","Ben","'s","angri","great","uncl","move","out","of","a","retir","communiti","and","into","his","own","home",".","In","this","take","on","modern","young","adulthood",",","we","follow","Ben","and","Richardson","over","the","cours","of","their","enlighten","three","day","road-trip","that","result","in","a","seri","of","fascin","encount","and","the","sort","of","banter","that","onli","occur","between","two","mismatch","friend","."],"lemmas":["Ben",",","a","25","year-old","with","anxiety","and","ocd",",","still","live","with","he","mom",",","be","force","to","embark","on","a","road","trip","with","he","only","friend","Richardson",",","a","unambitious","model",".","they","be","ask","to","drive","to","Salt","Lake","City","to","help","Ben","'s","angry","great","uncle","move","out","of","a","retirement","community","and","into","he","own","home",".","in","this","take","on","modern","young","adulthood",",","we","follow","Ben","and","Richardson","over","the","course","of","they","enlighten","three","day","road-trip","that","result","in","a","series","of","fascinating","encounter","and","the","sort","of","banter","that","only","occur","between","two","mismatched","friend","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ben , a",", a 25","a 25 year-old","25 year-old with","year-old with anxiety","with anxiety and","anxiety and OCD","and OCD ,","OCD , still",", still living","still living with","living with his","with his Mom","his Mom ,","Mom , is",", is forced","is forced to","forced to embark","to embark on","embark on a","on a road","a road trip","road trip with","trip with his","with his only","his only friend","only friend Richardson","friend Richardson ,","Richardson , an",", an unambitious","an unambitious model","They are asked","are asked to","asked to drive","to drive to","drive to Salt","to Salt Lake","Salt Lake City","Lake City to","City to help","to help Ben","help Ben 's","Ben 's angry","'s angry great","angry great uncle","great uncle move","uncle move out","move out of","out of a","of a retirement","a retirement community","retirement community and","community and into","and into his","into his own","his own home","In this take","this take on","take on modern","on modern young","modern young adulthood","young adulthood ,","adulthood , we",", we follow","we follow Ben","follow Ben and","Ben and Richardson","and Richardson over","Richardson over the","over the course","the course of","course of their","of their enlightening","their enlightening three","enlightening three day","three day road-trip","day road-trip that","road-trip that results","that results in","results in a","in a series","a series of","series of fascinating","of fascinating encounters","fascinating encounters and","encounters and the","and the sort","the sort of","sort of banter","of banter that","banter that only","that only occurs","only occurs between","occurs between two","between two mismatched","two mismatched friends"],"2grams":["Ben ,",", a","a 25","25 year-old","year-old with","with anxiety","anxiety and","and OCD","OCD ,",", still","still living","living with","with his","his Mom","Mom ,",", is","is forced","forced to","to embark","embark on","on a","a road","road trip","trip with","with his","his only","only friend","friend Richardson","Richardson ,",", an","an unambitious","unambitious model","They are","are asked","asked to","to drive","drive to","to Salt","Salt Lake","Lake City","City to","to help","help Ben","Ben 's","'s angry","angry great","great uncle","uncle move","move out","out of","of a","a retirement","retirement community","community and","and into","into his","his own","own home","In this","this take","take on","on modern","modern young","young adulthood","adulthood ,",", we","we follow","follow Ben","Ben and","and Richardson","Richardson over","over the","the course","course of","of their","their enlightening","enlightening three","three day","day road-trip","road-trip that","that results","results in","in a","a series","series of","of fascinating","fascinating encounters","encounters and","and the","the sort","sort of","of banter","banter that","that only","only occurs","occurs between","between two","two mismatched","mismatched friends"]}

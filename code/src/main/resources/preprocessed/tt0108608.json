{"title":"Woman Sesame Oil Maker","plot":"If money can't buy happiness, can it at least buy control over others? Xiang is hard-working, running a small sesame oil business. Her husband is lazy and drinks; her son is blood simple. When Japanese investors provide capital to expand Xiang's business, she has the wealth to raise her social standing and buy a wife for her son, Dunzi. When money and a forceful personality fail to bend others to her will, including daughter-in-law Huanhuan, Xiang must find another way to tranquillity.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["If","money","ca","n't","buy","happi",",","can","it","at","least","buy","control","over","other","?","Xiang","is","hard-work",",","run","a","small","sesam","oil","busi",".","Her","husband","is","lazi","and","drink",";","her","son","is","blood","simpl",".","When","Japanes","investor","provid","capit","to","expand","Xiang","'s","busi",",","she","has","the","wealth","to","rais","her","social","stand","and","buy","a","wife","for","her","son",",","Dunzi",".","When","money","and","a","forc","person","fail","to","bend","other","to","her","will",",","includ","daughter-in-law","Huanhuan",",","Xiang","must","find","anoth","way","to","tranquil","."],"lemmas":["if","money","can","not","buy","happiness",",","can","it","at","least","buy","control","over","other","?","Xiang","be","hard-working",",","run","a","small","sesame","oil","business",".","she","husband","be","lazy","and","drink",";","she","son","be","blood","simple",".","when","japanese","investor","provide","capital","to","expand","Xiang","'s","business",",","she","have","the","wealth","to","raise","she","social","standing","and","buy","a","wife","for","she","son",",","Dunzi",".","when","money","and","a","forceful","personality","fail","to","bend","other","to","she","will",",","include","daughter-in-law","Huanhuan",",","Xiang","must","find","another","way","to","tranquillity","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["If money ca","money ca n't","ca n't buy","n't buy happiness","buy happiness ,","happiness , can",", can it","can it at","it at least","at least buy","least buy control","buy control over","control over others","Xiang is hard-working","is hard-working ,","hard-working , running",", running a","running a small","a small sesame","small sesame oil","sesame oil business","Her husband is","husband is lazy","is lazy and","lazy and drinks","and drinks ;","drinks ; her","; her son","her son is","son is blood","is blood simple","When Japanese investors","Japanese investors provide","investors provide capital","provide capital to","capital to expand","to expand Xiang","expand Xiang 's","Xiang 's business","'s business ,","business , she",", she has","she has the","has the wealth","the wealth to","wealth to raise","to raise her","raise her social","her social standing","social standing and","standing and buy","and buy a","buy a wife","a wife for","wife for her","for her son","her son ,","son , Dunzi","When money and","money and a","and a forceful","a forceful personality","forceful personality fail","personality fail to","fail to bend","to bend others","bend others to","others to her","to her will","her will ,","will , including",", including daughter-in-law","including daughter-in-law Huanhuan","daughter-in-law Huanhuan ,","Huanhuan , Xiang",", Xiang must","Xiang must find","must find another","find another way","another way to","way to tranquillity"],"2grams":["If money","money ca","ca n't","n't buy","buy happiness","happiness ,",", can","can it","it at","at least","least buy","buy control","control over","over others","Xiang is","is hard-working","hard-working ,",", running","running a","a small","small sesame","sesame oil","oil business","Her husband","husband is","is lazy","lazy and","and drinks","drinks ;","; her","her son","son is","is blood","blood simple","When Japanese","Japanese investors","investors provide","provide capital","capital to","to expand","expand Xiang","Xiang 's","'s business","business ,",", she","she has","has the","the wealth","wealth to","to raise","raise her","her social","social standing","standing and","and buy","buy a","a wife","wife for","for her","her son","son ,",", Dunzi","When money","money and","and a","a forceful","forceful personality","personality fail","fail to","to bend","bend others","others to","to her","her will","will ,",", including","including daughter-in-law","daughter-in-law Huanhuan","Huanhuan ,",", Xiang","Xiang must","must find","find another","another way","way to","to tranquillity"]}

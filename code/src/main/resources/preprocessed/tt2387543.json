{"title":"Profile of a Killer","plot":"The H-61 Killer is leaving a trail of skeletons across the Northern Mid-West. With police baffled, a retired FBI profiler is called in to assist. A seer of the criminal psyche, Saul Aitken (Gabriele Angieri) detects an incipient game. Only to find himself at the center as he's abducted from his hotel. With the profiler as his captive, the killer reveals himself as a teenager named David (Joey Pollari). Ruthless, resourceful and clever, he challenges Aitken to a battle of wits; he must employ the science of profiling to stop David from killing again. Meanwhile the task force builds a trail with the help of FBI Special Agent, Rachel Cade (Emily Fradenburgh). With her own kind of ruthlessness, she fights to avenge the victims but now she must do so with a hostage in the equation. The cat and mouse reaches a climax as David lashes out at the authorities. Now facing their wrath, his game begins to unravel. But he still has the profiler as his hostage... and every game needs a final round.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["The","H-61","Killer","is","leav","a","trail","of","skeleton","across","the","Northern","Mid-West",".","With","polic","baffl",",","a","retir","FBI","profil","is","call","in","to","assist",".","A","seer","of","the","crimin","psych",",","Saul","Aitken","(","Gabriel","Angieri",")","detect","an","incipi","game",".","Onli","to","find","himself","at","the","center","as","he","'s","abduct","from","his","hotel",".","With","the","profil","as","his","captiv",",","the","killer","reveal","himself","as","a","teenag","name","David","(","Joey","Pollari",")",".","Ruthless",",","resourc","and","clever",",","he","challeng","Aitken","to","a","battl","of","wit",";","he","must","employ","the","scienc","of","profil","to","stop","David","from","kill","again",".","Meanwhil","the","task","forc","build","a","trail","with","the","help","of","FBI","Special","Agent",",","Rachel","Cade","(","Emili","Fradenburgh",")",".","With","her","own","kind","of","ruthless",",","she","fight","to","aveng","the","victim","but","now","she","must","do","so","with","a","hostag","in","the","equat",".","The","cat","and","mous","reach","a","climax","as","David","lash","out","at","the","author",".","Now","face","their","wrath",",","his","game","begin","to","unravel",".","But","he","still","has","the","profil","as","his","hostag","...","and","everi","game","need","a","final","round","."],"lemmas":["the","h-61","killer","be","leave","a","trail","of","skeleton","across","the","Northern","Mid-West",".","with","police","baffle",",","a","retire","FBI","profiler","be","call","in","to","assist",".","a","seer","of","the","criminal","psyche",",","Saul","Aitken","-lrb-","Gabriele","Angieri","-rrb-","detect","a","incipient","game",".","only","to","find","himself","at","the","center","as","he","be","abducted","from","he","hotel",".","with","the","profiler","as","he","captive",",","the","killer","reveal","himself","as","a","teenager","name","David","-lrb-","Joey","Pollari","-rrb-",".","ruthless",",","resourceful","and","clever",",","he","challenge","Aitken","to","a","battle","of","wit",";","he","must","employ","the","science","of","profile","to","stop","David","from","kill","again",".","meanwhile","the","task","force","build","a","trail","with","the","help","of","FBI","special","Agent",",","Rachel","Cade","-lrb-","Emily","Fradenburgh","-rrb-",".","with","she","own","kind","of","ruthlessness",",","she","fight","to","avenge","the","victim","but","now","she","must","do","so","with","a","hostage","in","the","equation",".","the","cat","and","mouse","reach","a","climax","as","David","lash","out","at","the","authority",".","now","face","they","wrath",",","he","game","begin","to","unravel",".","but","he","still","have","the","profiler","as","he","hostage","...","and","every","game","need","a","final","round","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The H-61 Killer","H-61 Killer is","Killer is leaving","is leaving a","leaving a trail","a trail of","trail of skeletons","of skeletons across","skeletons across the","across the Northern","the Northern Mid-West","With police baffled","police baffled ,","baffled , a",", a retired","a retired FBI","retired FBI profiler","FBI profiler is","profiler is called","is called in","called in to","in to assist","A seer of","seer of the","of the criminal","the criminal psyche","criminal psyche ,","psyche , Saul",", Saul Aitken","Saul Aitken (","Aitken ( Gabriele","( Gabriele Angieri","Gabriele Angieri )","Angieri ) detects",") detects an","detects an incipient","an incipient game","Only to find","to find himself","find himself at","himself at the","at the center","the center as","center as he","as he 's","he 's abducted","'s abducted from","abducted from his","from his hotel","With the profiler","the profiler as","profiler as his","as his captive","his captive ,","captive , the",", the killer","the killer reveals","killer reveals himself","reveals himself as","himself as a","as a teenager","a teenager named","teenager named David","named David (","David ( Joey","( Joey Pollari","Joey Pollari )","Ruthless , resourceful",", resourceful and","resourceful and clever","and clever ,","clever , he",", he challenges","he challenges Aitken","challenges Aitken to","Aitken to a","to a battle","a battle of","battle of wits","of wits ;","wits ;

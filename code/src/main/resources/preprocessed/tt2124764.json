{"title":"Chicago's Only Castle: The History of Givins' Irish Castle and Its Keepers","plot":"This feature-length film tells the exciting stories of the five keepers of the Castle, which was built by Robert C. Givins in 1886/1887. These stories unfold against the backdrop of Chicago's rich history, including the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the World's Columbian Exposition of 1893, the cable-car era, the dawn of the automobile, and the Chicago World's Fair of 1933. The main goals of this production have been to uncover and preserve the history of the iconic Castle and its five keepers and to raise money to help preserve and maintain the building. This project received a major arts grant from Chicago philanthropist Richard H. Driehaus. Filmmaker Errol Magidson was interviewed about this project on WGN-TV and WTTW-TV.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["This","feature-length","film","tell","the","excit","stori","of","the","five","keeper","of","the","Castl",",","which","was","built","by","Robert","C.","Givin","in","1886/1887",".","These","stori","unfold","against","the","backdrop","of","Chicago","'s","rich","histori",",","includ","the","Great","Chicago","Fire","of","1871",",","the","World","'s","Columbian","Exposit","of","1893",",","the","cable-car","era",",","the","dawn","of","the","automobil",",","and","the","Chicago","World","'s","Fair","of","1933",".","The","main","goal","of","this","product","have","been","to","uncov","and","preserv","the","histori","of","the","icon","Castl","and","it","five","keeper","and","to","rais","money","to","help","preserv","and","maintain","the","build",".","This","project","receiv","a","major","art","grant","from","Chicago","philanthropist","Richard","H.","Driehaus",".","Filmmak","Errol","Magidson","was","interview","about","this","project","on","WGN-TV","and","WTTW-TV","."],"lemmas":["this","feature-length","film","tell","the","exciting","story","of","the","five","keeper","of","the","Castle",",","which","be","build","by","Robert","C.","Givins","in","1886/1887",".","these","story","unfold","against","the","backdrop","of","Chicago","'s","rich","history",",","include","the","Great","Chicago","Fire","of","1871",",","the","World","'s","Columbian","Exposition","of","1893",",","the","cable-car","era",",","the","dawn","of","the","automobile",",","and","the","Chicago","World","'s","Fair","of","1933",".","the","main","goal","of","this","production","have","be","to","uncover","and","preserve","the","history","of","the","iconic","Castle","and","its","five","keeper","and","to","raise","money","to","help","preserve","and","maintain","the","building",".","this","project","receive","a","major","art","grant","from","Chicago","philanthropist","Richard","H.","Driehaus",".","Filmmaker","Errol","Magidson","be","interview","about","this","project","on","wgn-tv","and","wttw-tv","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["This feature-length film","feature-length film tells","film tells the","tells the exciting","the exciting stories","exciting stories of","stories of the","of the five","the five keepers","five keepers of","keepers of the","of the Castle","the Castle ,","Castle , which",", which was","which was built","was built by","built by Robert","by Robert C.","Robert C.

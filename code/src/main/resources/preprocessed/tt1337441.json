{"title":"Aki Ra's Boys","plot":"Little Boreak has big dreams. He wants to be a wrestler. A football star. A rap artist. A singer. His world is one of hope and possibility. The young Cambodian's optimism is remarkable given that he's witnessed a horrific landmine accident and three crude operations: all that's left of his right arm is a stump. This unexpectedly funny, thoughtful, poignant film looks at the world through the eyes of Boreak and his friends living in Siem Reap's Landmines Museum. Here, landmine survivor kids learn what it means to overcome trauma and be children again. Enter their lives as they row and play, fight, make up and get into trouble. Meet their guardian, Aki Ra, a former Khmer Rouge child soldier turned anti-mine crusader. And journey with him into a minefield - a place where one step in the wrong direction could mean injury or death.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Littl","Boreak","has","big","dream",".","He","want","to","be","a","wrestler",".","A","footbal","star",".","A","rap","artist",".","A","singer",".","His","world","is","one","of","hope","and","possibl",".","The","young","Cambodian","'s","optim","is","remark","given","that","he","'s","wit","a","horrif","landmin","accid","and","three","crude","oper",":","all","that","'s","left","of","his","right","arm","is","a","stump",".","This","unexpect","funni",",","thought",",","poignant","film","look","at","the","world","through","the","eye","of","Boreak","and","his","friend","live","in","Siem","Reap","'s","Landmin","Museum",".","Here",",","landmin","survivor","kid","learn","what","it","mean","to","overcom","trauma","and","be","children","again",".","Enter","their","live","as","they","row","and","play",",","fight",",","make","up","and","get","into","troubl",".","Meet","their","guardian",",","Aki","Ra",",","a","former","Khmer","Roug","child","soldier","turn","anti-min","crusad",".","And","journey","with","him","into","a","minefield","-","a","place","where","one","step","in","the","wrong","direct","could","mean","injuri","or","death","."],"lemmas":["Little","Boreak","have","big","dream",".","he","want","to","be","a","wrestler",".","a","football","star",".","a","rap","artist",".","a","singer",".","he","world","be","one","of","hope","and","possibility",".","the","young","cambodian","'s","optimism","be","remarkable","give","that","he","be","witness","a","horrific","landmine","accident","and","three","crude","operation",":","all","that","be","leave","of","he","right","arm","be","a","stump",".","this","unexpectedly","funny",",","thoughtful",",","poignant","film","look","at","the","world","through","the","eye","of","Boreak","and","he","friend","live","in","Siem","Reap","'s","Landmines","Museum",".","here",",","landmine","survivor","kid","learn","what","it","mean","to","overcome","trauma","and","be","child","again",".","enter","they","life","as","they","row","and","play",",","fight",",","make","up","and","get","into","trouble",".","meet","they","guardian",",","Aki","Ra",",","a","former","Khmer","Rouge","child","soldier","turn","anti-mine","crusader",".","and","journey","with","he","into","a","minefield","-","a","place","where","one","step","in","the","wrong","direction","could","mean","injury","or","death","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Little Boreak has","Boreak has big","has big dreams","He wants to","wants to be","to be a","be a wrestler","A football star","A rap artist","His world is","world is one","is one of","one of hope","of hope and","hope and possibility","The young Cambodian","young Cambodian 's","Cambodian 's optimism","'s optimism is","optimism is remarkable","is remarkable given","remarkable given that","given that he","that he 's","he 's witnessed","'s witnessed a","witnessed a horrific","a horrific landmine","horrific landmine accident","landmine accident and","accident and three","and three crude","three crude operations","crude operations :","operations : all",": all that","all that 's","that 's left","'s left of","left of his","of his right","his right arm","right arm is","arm is a","is a stump","This unexpectedly funny","unexpectedly funny ,","funny , thoughtful",", thoughtful ,","thoughtful , poignant",", poignant film","poignant film looks","film looks at","looks at the","at the world","the world through","world through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of Boreak","of Boreak and","Boreak and his","and his friends","his friends living","friends living in","living in Siem","in Siem Reap","Siem Reap 's","Reap 's Landmines","'s Landmines Museum","Here , landmine",", landmine survivor","landmine survivor kids","survivor kids learn","kids learn what","learn what it","what it means","it means to","means to overcome","to overcome trauma","overcome trauma and","trauma and be","and be children","be children again","Enter their lives","their lives as","lives as they","as they row","they row and","row and play","and play ,","play , fight",", fight ,","fight , make",", make up","make up and","up and get","and get into","get into trouble","Meet their guardian","their guardian ,","guardian , Aki",", Aki Ra","Aki Ra ,","Ra , a",", a former","a former Khmer","former Khmer Rouge","Khmer Rouge child","Rouge child soldier","child soldier turned","soldier turned anti-mine","turned anti-mine crusader","And journey with","journey with him","with him into","him into a","into a minefield","a minefield -","minefield -

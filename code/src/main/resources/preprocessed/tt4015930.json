{"title":"The Butchering","plot":"Every town has a devil. For the small community of Braxton, that devil is Tommy Miller. A bullied and tormented teen who finally snapped, killing his friends and family at the annual Braxton town hall party, Miller escaped into the woods, never to be seen or heard from again. Until now. Ten years later, a group of fresh-faced teens find themselves targeted by a masked man in a hooded cloak. It's up to Detective Ryan Fenton and his fish-out-of-water partner to protect the town from Miller's clutches; there's just one issue - Ryan himself is a survivor of the original massacre. Is Miller opening up a new chapter, or has he returned to attend to some unfinished business?","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Everi","town","has","a","devil",".","For","the","small","communiti","of","Braxton",",","that","devil","is","Tommi","Miller",".","A","bulli","and","torment","teen","who","final","snap",",","kill","his","friend","and","famili","at","the","annual","Braxton","town","hall","parti",",","Miller","escap","into","the","wood",",","never","to","be","seen","or","heard","from","again",".","Until","now",".","Ten","year","later",",","a","group","of","fresh-fac","teen","find","themselv","target","by","a","mask","man","in","a","hood","cloak",".","It","'s","up","to","Detect","Ryan","Fenton","and","his","fish-out-of-wat","partner","to","protect","the","town","from","Miller","'s","clutch",";","there","'s","just","one","issu","-","Ryan","himself","is","a","survivor","of","the","origin","massacr",".","Is","Miller","open","up","a","new","chapter",",","or","has","he","return","to","attend","to","some","unfinish","busi","?"],"lemmas":["every","town","have","a","devil",".","for","the","small","community","of","Braxton",",","that","devil","be","Tommy","Miller",".","a","bully","and","torment","teen","who","finally","snap",",","kill","he","friend","and","family","at","the","annual","Braxton","town","hall","party",",","Miller","escape","into","the","wood",",","never","to","be","see","or","hear","from","again",".","until","now",".","ten","year","later",",","a","group","of","fresh-faced","teens","find","themselves","target","by","a","mask","man","in","a","hooded","cloak",".","it","be","up","to","Detective","Ryan","fenton","and","he","fish-out-of-water","partner","to","protect","the","town","from","Miller","'s","clutch",";","there","be","just","one","issue","-","Ryan","himself","be","a","survivor","of","the","original","massacre",".","be","Miller","open","up","a","new","chapter",",","or","have","he","return","to","attend","to","some","unfinished","business","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Every town has","town has a","has a devil","For the small","the small community","small community of","community of Braxton","of Braxton ,","Braxton , that",", that devil","that devil is","devil is Tommy","is Tommy Miller","A bullied and","bullied and tormented","and tormented teen","tormented teen who","teen who finally","who finally snapped","finally snapped ,","snapped , killing",", killing his","killing his friends","his friends and","friends and family","and family at","family at the","at the annual","the annual Braxton","annual Braxton town","Braxton town hall","town hall party","hall party ,","party , Miller",", Miller escaped","Miller escaped into","escaped into the","into the woods","the woods ,","woods , never",", never to","never to be","to be seen","be seen or","seen or heard","or heard from","heard from again","Ten years later","years later ,","later , a",", a group","a group of","group of fresh-faced","of fresh-faced teens","fresh-faced teens find","teens find themselves","find themselves targeted","themselves targeted by","targeted by a","by a masked","a masked man","masked man in","man in a","in a hooded","a hooded cloak","It 's up","'s up to","up to Detective","to Detective Ryan","Detective Ryan Fenton","Ryan Fenton and","Fenton and his","and his fish-out-of-water","his fish-out-of-water partner","fish-out-of-water partner to","partner to protect","to protect the","protect the town","the town from","town from Miller","from Miller 's","Miller 's clutches","'s clutches ;","clutches ;

{"title":"What They Don't Talk About When They Talk About Love","plot":"At a high school for the visually impaired in Jakarta, Indonesia, the students are like any other teenagers: they attend classes, pursue artistic endeavors, and fall in love. The most privileged of the bunch, Diana, patiently awaits signs of womanhood and humors her mother's attempts to mold her into the perfect girl. The beautiful Fitri has no shortage of male attention and enters into a passionate affair with, unbeknownst to her, a hearing-impaired punk rocker who is masquerading as a doctor. Meanwhile, Maya, blind since birth, aspires to be an actress and performer. Regardless of physical barriers, the students find ways to communicate and collaborate, enabling them to connect-with each other and to the outside world.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["At","a","high","school","for","the","visual","impair","in","Jakarta",",","Indonesia",",","the","student","are","like","ani","other","teenag",":","they","attend","class",",","pursu","artist","endeavor",",","and","fall","in","love",".","The","most","privileg","of","the","bunch",",","Diana",",","patient","await","sign","of","womanhood","and","humor","her","mother","'s","attempt","to","mold","her","into","the","perfect","girl",".","The","beauti","Fitri","has","no","shortag","of","male","attent","and","enter","into","a","passion","affair","with",",","unbeknownst","to","her",",","a","hearing-impair","punk","rocker","who","is","masquerad","as","a","doctor",".","Meanwhil",",","Maya",",","blind","sinc","birth",",","aspir","to","be","an","actress","and","perform",".","Regardless","of","physic","barrier",",","the","student","find","way","to","communic","and","collabor",",","enabl","them","to","connect-with","each","other","and","to","the","outsid","world","."],"lemmas":["at","a","high","school","for","the","visually","impaired","in","Jakarta",",","Indonesia",",","the","student","be","like","any","other","teenager",":","they","attend","class",",","pursue","artistic","endeavor",",","and","fall","in","love",".","the","most","privileged","of","the","bunch",",","Diana",",","patiently","await","sign","of","womanhood","and","humor","she","mother","'s","attempt","to","mold","she","into","the","perfect","girl",".","the","beautiful","Fitri","have","no","shortage","of","male","attention","and","enter","into","a","passionate","affair","with",",","unbeknownst","to","she",",","a","hearing-impaired","punk","rocker","who","be","masquerade","as","a","doctor",".","meanwhile",",","maya",",","blind","since","birth",",","aspire","to","be","a","actress","and","performer",".","regardless","of","physical","barrier",",","the","student","find","way","to","communicate","and","collaborate",",","enable","they","to","connect-with","each","other","and","to","the","outside","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["At

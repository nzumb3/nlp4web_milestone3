{"title":"Bird Without Borders","plot":"Found nowhere else on earth but the last few pockets of wilderness along East Asia's rugged coastline, the Black-Faced Spoonbill is a survivor. Twice a year this enigmatic bird undertakes a behemoth migration route that navigates through the heart of Asia, a part of the world where geopolitical tensions always run high. For the very first time this magnificent migration has been captured on full HD. This film documents an epic journey, 2000 kilometres from its wintering grounds in Taiwan, across coastal China and the Yellow sea, to the world's most dangerous flashpoint - the DMZ between North and South Korea and the bird's annual breeding ground.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Found","nowher","els","on","earth","but","the","last","few","pocket","of","wilder","along","East","Asia","'s","rug","coastlin",",","the","Black-Fac","Spoonbil","is","a","survivor",".","Twice","a","year","this","enigmat","bird","undertak","a","behemoth","migrat","rout","that","navig","through","the","heart","of","Asia",",","a","part","of","the","world","where","geopolit","tension","alway","run","high",".","For","the","veri","first","time","this","magnific","migrat","has","been","captur","on","full","HD",".","This","film","document","an","epic","journey",",","2000","kilometr","from","it","winter","ground","in","Taiwan",",","across","coastal","China","and","the","Yellow","sea",",","to","the","world","'s","most","danger","flashpoint","-","the","DMZ","between","North","and","South","Korea","and","the","bird","'s","annual","breed","ground","."],"lemmas":["find","nowhere","else","on","earth","but","the","last","few","pocket","of","wilderness","along","East","Asia","'s","rugged","coastline",",","the","Black-Faced","Spoonbill","be","a","survivor",".","twice","a","year","this","enigmatic","bird","undertake","a","behemoth","migration","route","that","navigate","through","the","heart","of","Asia",",","a","part","of","the","world","where","geopolitical","tension","always","run","high",".","for","the","very","first","time","this","magnificent","migration","have","be","capture","on","full","hd",".","this","film","document","a","epic","journey",",","2000","kilometre","from","its","wintering","grounds","in","Taiwan",",","across","coastal","China","and","the","Yellow","sea",",","to","the","world","'s","most","dangerous","flashpoint","-","the","DMZ","between","North","and","South","Korea","and","the","bird","'s","annual","breeding","ground","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Found nowhere else","nowhere else on","else on earth","on earth but","earth but the","but the last","the last few","last few pockets","few pockets of","pockets of wilderness","of wilderness along","wilderness along East","along East Asia","East Asia 's","Asia 's rugged","'s rugged coastline","rugged coastline ,","coastline , the",", the Black-Faced","the Black-Faced Spoonbill","Black-Faced Spoonbill is","Spoonbill is a","is a survivor","Twice a year","a year this","year this enigmatic","this enigmatic bird","enigmatic bird undertakes","bird undertakes a","undertakes a behemoth","a behemoth migration","behemoth migration route","migration route that","route that navigates","that navigates through","navigates through the","through the heart","the heart of","heart of Asia","of Asia ,","Asia , a",", a part","a part of","part of the","of the world","the world where","world where geopolitical","where geopolitical tensions","geopolitical tensions always","tensions always run","always run high","For the very","the very first","very first time","first time this","time this magnificent","this magnificent migration","magnificent migration has","migration has been","has been captured","been captured on","captured on full","on full HD","This film documents","film documents an","documents an epic","an epic journey","epic journey ,","journey , 2000",", 2000 kilometres","2000 kilometres from","kilometres from its","from its wintering","its wintering grounds","wintering grounds in","grounds in Taiwan","in Taiwan ,","Taiwan , across",", across coastal","across coastal China","coastal China and","China and the","and the Yellow","the Yellow sea","Yellow sea ,","sea , to",", to the","to the world","the world 's","world 's most","'s most dangerous","most dangerous flashpoint","dangerous flashpoint -","flashpoint -

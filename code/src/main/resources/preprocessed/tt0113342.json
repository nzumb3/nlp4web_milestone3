{"title":"House","plot":"A comedy about a thirty-something man, named Victor who is to perform in a town, after having left group therapy. Victor cleverly bases his diatribes on the handful of locals who attend his performance. As his monologue coils out, his stories accurately reflect the audience's own lives, offering glimpses of themselves which irrevocably shift their relationship with each other.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["A","comedi","about","a","thirty-someth","man",",","name","Victor","who","is","to","perform","in","a","town",",","after","have","left","group","therapi",".","Victor","clever","base","his","diatrib","on","the","hand","of","local","who","attend","his","perform",".","As","his","monologu","coil","out",",","his","stori","accur","reflect","the","audienc","'s","own","live",",","offer","glimps","of","themselv","which","irrevoc","shift","their","relationship","with","each","other","."],"lemmas":["a","comedy","about","a","thirty-something","man",",","name","Victor","who","be","to","perform","in","a","town",",","after","have","leave","group","therapy",".","Victor","cleverly","base","he","diatribe","on","the","handful","of","local","who","attend","he","performance",".","as","he","monologue","coil","out",",","he","story","accurately","reflect","the","audience","'s","own","life",",","offer","glimpse","of","themselves","which","irrevocably","shift","they","relationship","with","each","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A comedy about","comedy about a","about a thirty-something","a thirty-something man","thirty-something man ,","man , named",", named Victor","named Victor who","Victor who is","who is to","is to perform","to perform in","perform in a","in a town","a town ,","town , after",", after having","after having left","having left group","left group therapy","Victor cleverly bases","cleverly bases his","bases his diatribes","his diatribes on","diatribes on the","on the handful","the handful of","handful of locals","of locals who","locals who attend","who attend his","attend his performance","As his monologue","his monologue coils","monologue coils out","coils out ,","out , his",", his stories","his stories accurately","stories accurately reflect","accurately reflect the","reflect the audience","the audience 's","audience 's own","'s own lives","own lives ,","lives , offering",", offering glimpses","offering glimpses of","glimpses of themselves","of themselves which","themselves which irrevocably","which irrevocably shift","irrevocably shift their","shift their relationship","their relationship with","relationship with each","with each other"],"2grams":["A comedy","comedy about","about a","a thirty-something","thirty-something man","man ,",", named","named Victor","Victor who","who is","is to","to perform","perform in","in a","a town","town ,",", after","after having","having left","left group","group therapy","Victor cleverly","cleverly bases","bases his","his diatribes","diatribes on","on the","the handful","handful of","of locals","locals who","who attend","attend his","his performance","As his","his monologue","monologue coils","coils out","out ,",", his","his stories","stories accurately","accurately reflect","reflect the","the audience","audience 's","'s own","own lives","lives ,",", offering","offering glimpses","glimpses of","of themselves","themselves which","which irrevocably","irrevocably shift","shift their","their relationship","relationship with","with each","each other"]}

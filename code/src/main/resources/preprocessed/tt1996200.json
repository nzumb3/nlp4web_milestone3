{"title":"Brash Young Turks","plot":"Set in a stylized and dynamic London, Brash Young Turks follows the interlinking stories of young Londoners dreaming of making it big while wading through oppression, greed and adversity. When troubled teen Mia is plucked from her hellish care home by a gang of charismatic hustlers and go-getters, flashy and fearless, her eyes are opened to a world full of new opportunities and dangers. With dreams of wild success, the group is faced with choices of following secondary careers dominated by big players, or reaching the top of the food chain themselves. With a no-holds barred exuberance and dynamism as well as special appearances from Julian Glover CBE, Grime legend D Double E and the Mayor of London Boris Johnson, Brash Young Turks is set to bring something fresh to British cinema.","genres":["Crime","

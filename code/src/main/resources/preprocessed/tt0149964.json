{"title":"Broken Vessels","plot":"A young Pennsylvania man moves to Los Angeles to begin work for an ambulance service. There he is teamed with a supremely confident vet who seemingly has gone through a large number of partners. Initially the novice is awed by the more experienced man's capabilities to deal with the high pressure situations they encounter. However, gradually he discovers that all is not as it seems. While the vet is ice on the surface, he actually gets through the ordeals by heavy drug use and avoids commitments. Soon the younger man finds himself pulled into the same world and has to decide what direction he wants to take.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","young","Pennsylvania","man","move","to","Los","Angele","to","begin","work","for","an","ambul","servic",".","There","he","is","team","with","a","suprem","confid","vet","who","seem","has","gone","through","a","larg","number","of","partner",".","Initial","the","novic","is","awe","by","the","more","experienc","man","'s","capabl","to","deal","with","the","high","pressur","situat","they","encount",".","Howev",",","gradual","he","discov","that","all","is","not","as","it","seem",".","While","the","vet","is","ice","on","the","surfac",",","he","actual","get","through","the","ordeal","by","heavi","drug","use","and","avoid","commit",".","Soon","the","younger","man","find","himself","pull","into","the","same","world","and","has","to","decid","what","direct","he","want","to","take","."],"lemmas":["a","young","Pennsylvania","man","move","to","Los","Angeles","to","begin","work","for","a","ambulance","service",".","there","he","be","team","with","a","supremely","confident","vet","who","seemingly","have","go","through","a","large","number","of","partner",".","initially","the","novice","be","awed","by","the","more","experienced","man","'s","capability","to","deal","with","the","high","pressure","situation","they","encounter",".","however",",","gradually","he","discover","that","all","be","not","as","it","seem",".","while","the","vet","be","ice","on","the","surface",",","he","actually","get","through","the","ordeal","by","heavy","drug","use","and","avoid","commitment",".","soon","the","younger","man","find","himself","pull","into","the","same","world","and","have","to","decide","what","direction","he","want","to","take","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A young Pennsylvania","young Pennsylvania man","Pennsylvania man moves","man moves to","moves to Los","to Los Angeles","Los Angeles to","Angeles to begin","to begin work","begin work for","work for an","for an ambulance","an ambulance service","There he is","he is teamed","is teamed with","teamed with a","with a supremely","a supremely confident","supremely confident vet","confident vet who","vet who seemingly","who seemingly has","seemingly has gone","has gone through","gone through a","through a large","a large number","large number of","number of partners","Initially the novice","the novice is","novice is awed","is awed by","awed by the","by the more","the more experienced","more experienced man","experienced man 's","man 's capabilities","'s capabilities to","capabilities to deal","to deal with","deal with the","with the high","the high pressure","high pressure situations","pressure situations they","situations they encounter","However , gradually",", gradually he","gradually he discovers","he discovers that","discovers that all","that all is","all is not","is not as","not as it","as it seems","While the vet","the vet is","vet is ice","is ice on","ice on the","on the surface","the surface ,","surface , he",", he actually","he actually gets","actually gets through","gets through the","through the ordeals","the ordeals by","ordeals by heavy","by heavy drug","heavy drug use","drug use and","use and avoids","and avoids commitments","Soon the younger","the younger man","younger man finds","man finds himself","finds himself pulled","himself pulled into","pulled into the","into the same","the same world","same world and","world and has","and has to","has to decide","to decide what","decide what direction","what direction he","direction he wants","he wants to","wants to take"],"2grams":["A young","young Pennsylvania","Pennsylvania man","man moves","moves to","to Los","Los Angeles","Angeles to","to begin","begin work","work for","for an","an ambulance","ambulance service","There he","he is","is teamed","teamed with","with a","a supremely","supremely confident","confident vet","vet who","who seemingly","seemingly has","has gone","gone through","through a","a large","large number","number of","of partners","Initially the","the novice","novice is","is awed","awed by","by the","the more","more experienced","experienced man","man 's","'s capabilities","capabilities to","to deal","deal with","with the","the high","high pressure","pressure situations","situations they","they encounter","However ,",", gradually","gradually he","he discovers","discovers that","that all","all is","is not","not as","as it","it seems","While the","the vet","vet is","is ice","ice on","on the","the surface","surface ,",", he","he actually","actually gets","gets through","through the","the ordeals","ordeals by","by heavy","heavy drug","drug use","use and","and avoids","avoids commitments","Soon the","the younger","younger man","man finds","finds himself","himself pulled","pulled into","into the","the same","same world","world and","and has","has to","to decide","decide what","what direction","direction he","he wants","wants to","to take"]}

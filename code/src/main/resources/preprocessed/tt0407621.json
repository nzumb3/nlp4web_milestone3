{"title":"Calvaire","plot":"A few days before Christmas, traveling entertainer Marc Stevens is stuck at nightfall in a remote wood in the swampy Hautes Fagnes region of Liège, his van conked out. An odd chap who's looking for a lost dog leads Marc to a shuttered inn; the owner gives Marc a room for the night. Next day, the innkeeper, Mr. Bartel, promises to fix the van, demands that Marc not visit the nearby village, and goes through Marc's things while the entertainer takes a walk. At dinner that night, Bartel laments his wife's having left him, and by next day, Marc is in a nightmare that may not end.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["A","few","day","befor","Christma",",","travel","entertain","Marc","Steven","is","stuck","at","nightfal","in","a","remot","wood","in","the","swampi","Haut","Fagn","region","of","Lièg",",","his","van","conk","out",".","An","odd","chap","who","'s","look","for","a","lost","dog","lead","Marc","to","a","shutter","inn",";","the","owner","give","Marc","a","room","for","the","night",".","Next","day",",","the","innkeep",",","Mr.","Bartel",",","promis","to","fix","the","van",",","demand","that","Marc","not","visit","the","nearbi","villag",",","and","goe","through","Marc","'s","thing","while","the","entertain","take","a","walk",".","At","dinner","that","night",",","Bartel","lament","his","wife","'s","have","left","him",",","and","by","next","day",",","Marc","is","in","a","nightmar","that","may","not","end","."],"lemmas":["a","few","day","before","Christmas",",","travel","entertainer","Marc","Stevens","be","stick","at","nightfall","in","a","remote","wood","in","the","swampy","Hautes","Fagnes","region","of","Liège",",","he","van","conk","out",".","a","odd","chap","who","be","look","for","a","lost","dog","lead","Marc","to","a","shutter","inn",";","the","owner","give","Marc","a","room","for","the","night",".","next","day",",","the","innkeeper",",","Mr.","Bartel",",","promise","to","fix","the","van",",","demand","that","Marc","not","visit","the","nearby","village",",","and","go","through","Marc","'s","thing","while","the","entertainer","take","a","walk",".","at","dinner","that","night",",","Bartel","lament","he","wife","'s","have","leave","he",",","and","by","next","day",",","Marc","be","in","a","nightmare","that","may","not","end","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A few days","few days before","days before Christmas","before Christmas ,","Christmas , traveling",", traveling entertainer","traveling entertainer Marc","entertainer Marc Stevens","Marc Stevens is","Stevens is stuck","is stuck at","stuck at nightfall","at nightfall in","nightfall in a","in a remote","a remote wood","remote wood in","wood in the","in the swampy","the swampy Hautes","swampy Hautes Fagnes","Hautes Fagnes region","Fagnes region of","region of Liège","of Liège ,","Liège , his",", his van","his van conked","van conked out","An odd chap","odd chap who","chap who 's","who 's looking","'s looking for","looking for a","for a lost","a lost dog","lost dog leads","dog leads Marc","leads Marc to","Marc to a","to a shuttered","a shuttered inn","shuttered inn ;","inn ;

Numbers obsessed Joe is in trouble. He owes £200 to a violent thug and is being rejected by his estranged daughter. Wanting to test his luck, the Filmmaker persuades Joe to play the lottery.

There's less than 12 hours left before the closing of the lottery ticket sales. In his frantic quest for £200, Joe becomes aware of how much he wants to change his life, gain his freedom and win back his daughter. When the numbers appear to line up, he begins to hope. Joe's road to redemption is beset with demons from the past and he's forced to face up to his biggest fear. It's Joe's day of reckoning. Will he prove to be the lucky man he is thought to be?","genres":["Adventure"," Mystery","

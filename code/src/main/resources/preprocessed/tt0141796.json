{"title":"A rózsa vére","plot":"Anita and her married boyfriend, András, get involved with some heavy hitters who smuggle from the Ukraine into Hungary. The deeper into it they get, the more their relationship is strained; things aren't helped by the unexpected visit that András's pregnant wife pays Anita and her mother. At a nightclub, Anita meets Alex, a Ruthenian who's a collector of folk songs. The two of them begin an affair, and András may be left out in the cold, with the local mob still waiting for him to deliver the goods. How patient will they be, how desperate will András get, and how will Anita sort out loyalty and infatuation?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Anita","and","her","marri","boyfriend",",","András",",","get","involv","with","some","heavi","hitter","who","smuggl","from","the","Ukrain","into","Hungari",".","The","deeper","into","it","they","get",",","the","more","their","relationship","is","strain",";","thing","are","n't","help","by","the","unexpect","visit","that","András","'s","pregnant","wife","pay","Anita","and","her","mother",".","At","a","nightclub",",","Anita","meet","Alex",",","a","Ruthenian","who","'s","a","collector","of","folk","song",".","The","two","of","them","begin","an","affair",",","and","András","may","be","left","out","in","the","cold",",","with","the","local","mob","still","wait","for","him","to","deliv","the","good",".","How","patient","will","they","be",",","how","desper","will","András","get",",","and","how","will","Anita","sort","out","loyalti","and","infatu","?"],"lemmas":["Anita","and","she","married","boyfriend",",","András",",","get","involve","with","some","heavy","hitter","who","smuggle","from","the","Ukraine","into","Hungary",".","the","deeper","into","it","they","get",",","the","more","they","relationship","be","strain",";","thing","be","not","help","by","the","unexpected","visit","that","András","'s","pregnant","wife","pay","Anita","and","she","mother",".","at","a","nightclub",",","Anita","meet","Alex",",","a","Ruthenian","who","be","a","collector","of","folk","song",".","the","two","of","they","begin","a","affair",",","and","András","may","be","leave","out","in","the","cold",",","with","the","local","mob","still","wait","for","he","to","deliver","the","goods",".","how","patient","will","they","be",",","how","desperate","will","András","get",",","and","how","will","Anita","sort","out","loyalty","and","infatuation","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Anita and her","and her married","her married boyfriend","married boyfriend ,","boyfriend , András",", András ,","András , get",", get involved","get involved with","involved with some","with some heavy","some heavy hitters","heavy hitters who","hitters who smuggle","who smuggle from","smuggle from the","from the Ukraine","the Ukraine into","Ukraine into Hungary","The deeper into","deeper into it","into it they","it they get","they get ,","get , the",", the more","the more their","more their relationship","their relationship is","relationship is strained","is strained ;","strained ;

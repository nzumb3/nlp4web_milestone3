{"title":"The Gospel According to Brabenec","plot":"Journalist Renata Kalenská's book of interviews with member of the Plastic People Vratislav Brabenec recorded not only his memories of the underground years, but also the author's experiences with this highly distinctive individual. This cinematic sequel builds on those experiences as it captures her additional interviews with Brabenec - improvised talks at places that hold some meaning for Brabenec or Kalenská. The result is several scenes of irrelevant philosophizing, self-deprecating humor, and commentary on the life of birds and on nature in general. The conversations, recorded mostly by hand-held camera, are interspersed with poetic citations.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Journalist","Renata","Kalenská","'s","book","of","interview","with","member","of","the","Plastic","Peopl","Vratislav","Brabenec","record","not","onli","his","memori","of","the","underground","year",",","but","also","the","author","'s","experi","with","this","high","distinct","individu",".","This","cinemat","sequel","build","on","those","experi","as","it","captur","her","addit","interview","with","Brabenec","-","improvis","talk","at","place","that","hold","some","mean","for","Brabenec","or","Kalenská",".","The","result","is","sever","scene","of","irrelev","philosoph",",","self-deprec","humor",",","and","commentari","on","the","life","of","bird","and","on","natur","in","general",".","The","convers",",","record","most","by","hand-held","camera",",","are","interspers","with","poetic","citat","."],"lemmas":["Journalist","Renata","Kalenská","'s","book","of","interview","with","member","of","the","Plastic","People","Vratislav","Brabenec","record","not","only","he","memory","of","the","underground","year",",","but","also","the","author","'s","experience","with","this","highly","distinctive","individual",".","this","cinematic","sequel","build","on","those","experience","as","it","capture","she","additional","interview","with","Brabenec","-","improvise","talk","at","place","that","hold","some","meaning","for","Brabenec","or","Kalenská",".","the","result","be","several","scene","of","irrelevant","philosophizing",",","self-deprecating","humor",",","and","commentary","on","the","life","of","bird","and","on","nature","in","general",".","the","conversation",",","record","mostly","by","hand-held","camera",",","be","intersperse","with","poetic","citation","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Journalist Renata Kalenská","Renata Kalenská 's","Kalenská 's book","'s book of","book of interviews","of interviews with","interviews with member","with member of","member of the","of the Plastic","the Plastic People","Plastic People Vratislav","People Vratislav Brabenec","Vratislav Brabenec recorded","Brabenec recorded not","recorded not only","not only his","only his memories","his memories of","memories of the","of the underground","the underground years","underground years ,","years , but",", but also","but also the","also the author","the author 's","author 's experiences","'s experiences with","experiences with this","with this highly","this highly distinctive","highly distinctive individual","This cinematic sequel","cinematic sequel builds","sequel builds on","builds on those","on those experiences","those experiences as","experiences as it","as it captures","it captures her","captures her additional","her additional interviews","additional interviews with","interviews with Brabenec","with Brabenec -","Brabenec -

{"title":"Rock On!!","plot":"Sakshi Shroff, the lonely and neglected wife of busy banking executive, Aditya, decides to give him a surprise on his birthday on July 22nd, but ends surprising him not once but multiple times. While Aditya is thrilled to know that both are going to be parents, and did appear surprised by the celebration, bitterness creeps in when he notices that Sakshi had also invited some ghosts (Rob Nancy and Kedar Zaveri) from his past. This gives rise to unpleasant memories involving a failed music group 'Magik' that he had associated with about a decade ago. Sakshi will soon find out why Aditya is displeased with her; why the music group broke up, ending in violence and acrimony especially between her husband and his former friend, Joseph Mascarenhas; why they cannot perform together ever again; as well as contemplate moving out and living with her mom.","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["Sakshi","Shroff",",","the","lone","and","neglect","wife","of","busi","bank","execut",",","Aditya",",","decid","to","give","him","a","surpris","on","his","birthday","on","Juli","22nd",",","but","end","surpris","him","not","onc","but","multipl","time",".","While","Aditya","is","thrill","to","know","that","both","are","go","to","be","parent",",","and","did","appear","surpris","by","the","celebr",",","bitter","creep","in","when","he","notic","that","Sakshi","had","also","invit","some","ghost","(","Rob","Nanci","and","Kedar","Zaveri",")","from","his","past",".","This","give","rise","to","unpleas","memori","involv","a","fail","music","group","'","Magik","'","that","he","had","associ","with","about","a","decad","ago",".","Sakshi","will","soon","find","out","whi","Aditya","is","displeas","with","her",";","whi","the","music","group","broke","up",",","end","in","violenc","and","acrimoni","especi","between","her","husband","and","his","former","friend",",","Joseph","Mascarenha",";","whi","they","can","not","perform","togeth","ever","again",";","as","well","as","contempl","move","out","and","live","with","her","mom","."],"lemmas":["Sakshi","Shroff",",","the","lonely","and","neglect","wife","of","busy","banking","executive",",","Aditya",",","decide","to","give","he","a","surprise","on","he","birthday","on","July","22nd",",","but","end","surprising","he","not","once","but","multiple","time",".","while","Aditya","be","thrill","to","know","that","both","be","go","to","be","parent",",","and","do","appear","surprise","by","the","celebration",",","bitterness","creep","in","when","he","notice","that","Sakshi","have","also","invite","some","ghost","-lrb-","Rob","Nancy","and","Kedar","Zaveri","-rrb-","from","he","past",".","this","give","rise","to","unpleasant","memory","involve","a","fail","music","group","'","Magik","'","that","he","have","associate","with","about","a","decade","ago",".","Sakshi","will","soon","find","out","why","Aditya","be","displeased","with","she",";","why","the","music","group","break","up",",","end","in","violence","and","acrimony","especially","between","she","husband","and","he","former","friend",",","Joseph","Mascarenhas",";","why","they","can","not","perform","together","ever","again",";","as","well","as","contemplate","move","out","and","live","with","she","mom","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sakshi Shroff ,","Shroff , the",", the lonely","the lonely and","lonely and neglected","and neglected wife","neglected wife of","wife of busy","of busy banking","busy banking executive","banking executive ,","executive , Aditya",", Aditya ,","Aditya , decides",", decides to","decides to give","to give him","give him a","him a surprise","a surprise on","surprise on his","on his birthday","his birthday on","birthday on July","on July 22nd","July 22nd ,","22nd , but",", but ends","but ends surprising","ends surprising him","surprising him not","him not once","not once but","once but multiple","but multiple times","While Aditya is","Aditya is thrilled","is thrilled to","thrilled to know","to know that","know that both","that both are","both are going","are going to","going to be","to be parents","be parents ,","parents , and",", and did","and did appear","did appear surprised","appear surprised by","surprised by the","by the celebration","the celebration ,","celebration , bitterness",", bitterness creeps","bitterness creeps in","creeps in when","in when he","when he notices","he notices that","notices that Sakshi","that Sakshi had","Sakshi had also","had also invited","also invited some","invited some ghosts","some ghosts (","ghosts ( Rob","( Rob Nancy","Rob Nancy and","Nancy and Kedar","and Kedar Zaveri","Kedar Zaveri )","Zaveri ) from",") from his","from his past","This gives rise","gives rise to","rise to unpleasant","to unpleasant memories","unpleasant memories involving","memories involving a","involving a failed","a failed music","failed music group","music group '","group ' Magik","' Magik '","Magik ' that","' that he","that he had","he had associated","had associated with","associated with about","with about a","about a decade","a decade ago","Sakshi will soon","will soon find","soon find out","find out why","out why Aditya","why Aditya is","Aditya is displeased","is displeased with","displeased with her","with her ;","her ;

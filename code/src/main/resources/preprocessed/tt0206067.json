{"title":"Kachche Dhaage","plot":"Unemployed Aftab is into smuggling on Indo-Pak border. One day he attempts to grab a consignment of arms and ammunition that is being supplied to terrorists. When he finds that he is being followed, he decides to destroy the consignment only to be recognized by the terrorists. Meanwhile, he goes to arrange his marriage with his beloved, Ruksana, whereby questions arise about his biological father; questions that he or his mother, Mariam are unable to answer, thus the marriage plans become nulled. A few days later he gets to meet Ramakant Pandit who Mariam introduces to him as his father and who on his death bed begs to forgive him. Shortly after, Ramakant passes away and Aftab gets to meet his step-brother Dhananjay alias Jai who is quite resentful towards Aftab and his mother. Meanwhile, Aftab and Mariam are apprehended and tortured by the same terrorists whose booty was destroyed by Aftab. He is forced to call Jai for help. Fortunately Jai agrees after Aftab pleads with him and soon both are on the run from not only the terrorists but the local police who accuses the duo of being hand in glove with the terrorists.","genres":["Action"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["Unemploy","Aftab","is","into","smuggl","on","Indo-Pak","border",".","One","day","he","attempt","to","grab","a","consign","of","arm","and","ammunit","that","is","be","suppli","to","terrorist",".","When","he","find","that","he","is","be","follow",",","he","decid","to","destroy","the","consign","onli","to","be","recogn","by","the","terrorist",".","Meanwhil",",","he","goe","to","arrang","his","marriag","with","his","belov",",","Ruksana",",","wherebi","question","aris","about","his","biolog","father",";","question","that","he","or","his","mother",",","Mariam","are","unabl","to","answer",",","thus","the","marriag","plan","becom","null",".","A","few","day","later","he","get","to","meet","Ramak","Pandit","who","Mariam","introduc","to","him","as","his","father","and","who","on","his","death","bed","beg","to","forgiv","him",".","Short","after",",","Ramak","pass","away","and","Aftab","get","to","meet","his","step-broth","Dhananjay","alia","Jai","who","is","quit","resent","toward","Aftab","and","his","mother",".","Meanwhil",",","Aftab","and","Mariam","are","apprehend","and","tortur","by","the","same","terrorist","whose","booti","was","destroy","by","Aftab",".","He","is","forc","to","call","Jai","for","help",".","Fortun","Jai","agre","after","Aftab","plead","with","him","and","soon","both","are","on","the","run","from","not","onli","the","terrorist","but","the","local","polic","who","accus","the","duo","of","be","hand","in","glove","with","the","terrorist","."],"lemmas":["Unemployed","Aftab","be","into","smuggling","on","Indo-Pak","border",".","one","day","he","attempt","to","grab","a","consignment","of","arm","and","ammunition","that","be","be","supply","to","terrorist",".","when","he","find","that","he","be","be","follow",",","he","decide","to","destroy","the","consignment","only","to","be","recognize","by","the","terrorist",".","meanwhile",",","he","go","to","arrange","he","marriage","with","he","beloved",",","Ruksana",",","whereby","question","arise","about","he","biological","father",";","question","that","he","or","he","mother",",","Mariam","be","unable","to","answer",",","thus","the","marriage","plan","become","nulled",".","a","few","day","later","he","get","to","meet","Ramakant","Pandit","who","Mariam","introduce","to","he","as","he","father","and","who","on","he","death","bed","beg","to","forgive","he",".","shortly","after",",","ramakant","pass","away","and","Aftab","get","to","meet","he","step-brother","Dhananjay","alia","Jai","who","be","quite","resentful","towards","Aftab","and","he","mother",".","meanwhile",",","Aftab","and","Mariam","be","apprehend","and","tortured","by","the","same","terrorist","whose","booty","be","destroy","by","Aftab",".","he","be","force","to","call","Jai","for","help",".","fortunately","Jai","agree","after","Aftab","plead","with","he","and","soon","both","be","on","the","run","from","not","only","the","terrorist","but","the","local","police","who","accuse","the","duo","of","be","hand","in","glove","with","the","terrorist","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Unemployed Aftab is","Aftab is into","is into smuggling","into smuggling on","smuggling on Indo-Pak","on Indo-Pak border","One day he","day he attempts","he attempts to","attempts to grab","to grab a","grab a consignment","a consignment of","consignment of arms","of arms and","arms and ammunition","and ammunition that","ammunition that is","that is being","is being supplied","being supplied to","supplied to terrorists","When he finds","he finds that","finds that he","that he is","he is being","is being followed","being followed ,","followed , he",", he decides","he decides to","decides to destroy","to destroy the","destroy the consignment","the consignment only","consignment only to","only to be","to be recognized","be recognized by","recognized by the","by the terrorists","Meanwhile , he",", he goes","he goes to","goes to arrange","to arrange his","arrange his marriage","his marriage with","marriage with his","with his beloved","his beloved ,","beloved , Ruksana",", Ruksana ,","Ruksana , whereby",", whereby questions","whereby questions arise","questions arise about","arise about his","about his biological","his biological father","biological father ;","father ;

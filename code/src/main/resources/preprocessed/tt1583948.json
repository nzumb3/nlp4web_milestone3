{"title":"The Flirting Club","plot":"Some people are beyond help when it comes to meeting someone. An American Pie meets Male Bridget Jones. Jamie, age 29 going on 12, loser, virgin, stumbles upon a group of misfits who meet every week above a pub in order to discover the secrets of love, relationships and finding the perfect partner.....The Flirting Club. Is it the answer to what he is searching for? Jamie has one month to meet a real girl otherwise he has to marry Laura 'the human pig' from next door. Inadvertently hampered by his best mate Bill, stuck with a schoolboy infatuation with his Hot Boss, two left feet and zero pulling skills an accidental encounter with his local flirting club, might just hold all the answers. The group of six, thirty-something singles and Miriam, their teacher who has an unusual approach to flirting success, seem unlikely to succeed. But as everyone knows the course to true love is never easy and the gang of misfits soon learn that getting it right is more about being yourself then trying to be someone else.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Some","peopl","are","beyond","help","when","it","come","to","meet","someon",".","An","American","Pie","meet","Male","Bridget","Jone",".","Jami",",","age","29","go","on","12",",","loser",",","virgin",",","stumbl","upon","a","group","of","misfit","who","meet","everi","week","abov","a","pub","in","order","to","discov","the","secret","of","love",",","relationship","and","find","the","perfect","partner",".....","The","Flirt","Club",".","Is","it","the","answer","to","what","he","is","search","for","?","Jami","has","one","month","to","meet","a","real","girl","otherwis","he","has","to","marri","Laura","'","the","human","pig","'","from","next","door",".","Inadvert","hamper","by","his","best","mate","Bill",",","stuck","with","a","schoolboy","infatu","with","his","Hot","Boss",",","two","left","feet","and","zero","pull","skill","an","accident","encount","with","his","local","flirt","club",",","might","just","hold","all","the","answer",".","The","group","of","six",",","thirty-someth","singl","and","Miriam",",","their","teacher","who","has","an","unusu","approach","to","flirt","success",",","seem","unlik","to","succeed",".","But","as","everyon","know","the","cours","to","true","love","is","never","easi","and","the","gang","of","misfit","soon","learn","that","get","it","right","is","more","about","be","yourself","then","tri","to","be","someon","els","."],"lemmas":["some","people","be","beyond","help","when","it","come","to","meeting","someone",".","a","American","Pie","meet","Male","Bridget","Jones",".","Jamie",",","age","29","go","on","12",",","loser",",","virgin",",","stumble","upon","a","group","of","misfit","who","meet","every","week","above","a","pub","in","order","to","discover","the","secret","of","love",",","relationship","and","find","the","perfect","partner",".....","The","Flirting","Club",".","be","it","the","answer","to","what","he","be","search","for","?","Jamie","have","one","month","to","meet","a","real","girl","otherwise","he","have","to","marry","Laura","'","the","human","pig","'","from","next","door",".","inadvertently","hamper","by","he","best","mate","Bill",",","stick","with","a","schoolboy","infatuation","with","he","Hot","Boss",",","two","left","foot","and","zero","pull","skill","a","accidental","encounter","with","he","local","flirt","club",",","might","just","hold","all","the","answer",".","the","group","of","six",",","thirty-something","singles","and","Miriam",",","they","teacher","who","have","a","unusual","approach","to","flirt","success",",","seem","unlikely","to","succeed",".","but","as","everyone","know","the","course","to","true","love","be","never","easy","and","the","gang","of","misfit","soon","learn","that","get","it","right","be","more","about","be","yourself","then","try","to","be","someone","else","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Some people are","people are beyond","are beyond help","beyond help when","help when it","when it comes","it comes to","comes to meeting","to meeting someone","An American Pie","American Pie meets","Pie meets Male","meets Male Bridget","Male Bridget Jones","Jamie , age",", age 29","age 29 going","29 going on","going on 12","on 12 ,","12 , loser",", loser ,","loser , virgin",", virgin ,","virgin , stumbles",", stumbles upon","stumbles upon a","upon a group","a group of","group of misfits","of misfits who","misfits who meet","who meet every","meet every week","every week above","week above a","above a pub","a pub in","pub in order","in order to","order to discover","to discover the","discover the secrets","the secrets of","secrets of love","of love ,","love , relationships",", relationships and","relationships and finding","and finding the","finding the perfect","the perfect partner","perfect partner .....","partner .....

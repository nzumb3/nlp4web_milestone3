{"title":"Caesar Must Die","plot":"In Rebibbia Prison in Italy, its inmate theatre program puts on a well received production of William Shakespeare's Julius Caesar. The film goes back several months earlier as the coordinators announces the play as the program's production of the year. With that project set, we see its creation as the cast is auditioned and selected for this artistic challenge. As they rehearse, the prisoners, many of whom are long termers and lifers for serious crimes, find that the classic play has both a striking resonance and contrast to their confined lives.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["In","Rebibbia","Prison","in","Itali",",","it","inmat","theatr","program","put","on","a","well","receiv","product","of","William","Shakespear","'s","Julius","Caesar",".","The","film","goe","back","sever","month","earlier","as","the","coordin","announc","the","play","as","the","program","'s","product","of","the","year",".","With","that","project","set",",","we","see","it","creation","as","the","cast","is","audit","and","select","for","this","artist","challeng",".","As","they","rehears",",","the","prison",",","mani","of","whom","are","long","termer","and","lifer","for","serious","crime",",","find","that","the","classic","play","has","both","a","strike","reson","and","contrast","to","their","confin","live","."],"lemmas":["in","Rebibbia","Prison","in","Italy",",","its","inmate","theatre","program","put","on","a","well","receive","production","of","William","Shakespeare","'s","Julius","Caesar",".","the","film","go","back","several","month","earlier","as","the","coordinator","announce","the","play","as","the","program","'s","production","of","the","year",".","with","that","project","set",",","we","see","its","creation","as","the","cast","be","audition","and","select","for","this","artistic","challenge",".","as","they","rehearse",",","the","prisoner",",","many","of","whom","be","long","termer","and","lifer","for","serious","crime",",","find","that","the","classic","play","have","both","a","striking","resonance","and","contrast","to","they","confine","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Rebibbia Prison","Rebibbia Prison in","Prison in Italy","in Italy ,","Italy , its",", its inmate","its inmate theatre","inmate theatre program","theatre program puts","program puts on","puts on a","on a well","a well received","well received production","received production of","production of William","of William Shakespeare","William Shakespeare 's","Shakespeare 's Julius","'s Julius Caesar","The film goes","film goes back","goes back several","back several months","several months earlier","months earlier as","earlier as the","as the coordinators","the coordinators announces","coordinators announces the","announces the play","the play as","play as the","as the program","the program 's","program 's production","'s production of","production of the","of the year","With that project","that project set","project set ,","set , we",", we see","we see its","see its creation","its creation as","creation as the","as the cast","the cast is","cast is auditioned","is auditioned and","auditioned and selected","and selected for","selected for this","for this artistic","this artistic challenge","As they rehearse","they rehearse ,","rehearse , the",", the prisoners","the prisoners ,","prisoners , many",", many of","many of whom","of whom are","whom are long","are long termers","long termers and","termers and lifers","and lifers for","lifers for serious","for serious crimes","serious crimes ,","crimes , find",", find that","find that the","that the classic","the classic play","classic play has","play has both","has both a","both a striking","a striking resonance","striking resonance and","resonance and contrast","and contrast to","contrast to their","to their confined","their confined lives"],"2grams":["In Rebibbia","Rebibbia Prison","Prison in","in Italy","Italy ,",", its","its inmate","inmate theatre","theatre program","program puts","puts on","on a","a well","well received","received production","production of","of William","William Shakespeare","Shakespeare 's","'s Julius","Julius Caesar","The film","film goes","goes back","back several","several months","months earlier","earlier as","as the","the coordinators","coordinators announces","announces the","the play","play as","as the","the program","program 's","'s production","production of","of the","the year","With that","that project","project set","set ,",", we","we see","see its","its creation","creation as","as the","the cast","cast is","is auditioned","auditioned and","and selected","selected for","for this","this artistic","artistic challenge","As they","they rehearse","rehearse ,",", the","the prisoners","prisoners ,",", many","many of","of whom","whom are","are long","long termers","termers and","and lifers","lifers for","for serious","serious crimes","crimes ,",", find","find that","that the","the classic","classic play","play has","has both","both a","a striking","striking resonance","resonance and","and contrast","contrast to","to their","their confined","confined lives"]}

{"title":"Ich bin eine Terroristin","plot":"Violette knows that she will go and one night, she goes. Once away from her home,she will make good on her innermost wish, to walk in the steps of Rosa, the Rosa to whom she feels intimately attached, her Rosa, Rosa Luxembourg. Just eleven, but Violette, thinks of herself as Rosa's heir, the guardian of her memory. In the energy and the courage of this revolutionary figure, she finds her own identity. She feels herself transported by the utopia vision of the letters which Rosa wrote from her prison cells in 1917.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"],"stems":["Violett","know","that","she","will","go","and","one","night",",","she","goe",".","Once","away","from","her","home",",","she","will","make","good","on","her","innermost","wish",",","to","walk","in","the","step","of","Rosa",",","the","Rosa","to","whom","she","feel","intim","attach",",","her","Rosa",",","Rosa","Luxembourg",".","Just","eleven",",","but","Violett",",","think","of","herself","as","Rosa","'s","heir",",","the","guardian","of","her","memori",".","In","the","energi","and","the","courag","of","this","revolutionari","figur",",","she","find","her","own","ident",".","She","feel","herself","transport","by","the","utopia","vision","of","the","letter","which","Rosa","wrote","from","her","prison","cell","in","1917","."],"lemmas":["Violette","know","that","she","will","go","and","one","night",",","she","go",".","once","away","from","she","home",",","she","will","make","good","on","she","innermost","wish",",","to","walk","in","the","step","of","Rosa",",","the","Rosa","to","whom","she","feel","intimately","attach",",","she","Rosa",",","Rosa","Luxembourg",".","just","eleven",",","but","Violette",",","think","of","herself","as","Rosa","'s","heir",",","the","guardian","of","she","memory",".","in","the","energy","and","the","courage","of","this","revolutionary","figure",",","she","find","she","own","identity",".","she","feel","herself","transport","by","the","utopia","vision","of","the","letter","which","Rosa","write","from","she","prison","cell","in","1917","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Violette knows that","knows that she","that she will","she will go","will go and","go and one","and one night","one night ,","night , she",", she goes","Once away from","away from her","from her home","her home ,","home , she",", she will","she will make","will make good","make good on","good on her","on her innermost","her innermost wish","innermost wish ,","wish , to",", to walk","to walk in","walk in the","in the steps","the steps of","steps of Rosa","of Rosa ,","Rosa , the",", the Rosa","the Rosa to","Rosa to whom","to whom she","whom she feels","she feels intimately","feels intimately attached","intimately attached ,","attached , her",", her Rosa","her Rosa ,","Rosa , Rosa",", Rosa Luxembourg","Just eleven ,","eleven , but",", but Violette","but Violette ,","Violette , thinks",", thinks of","thinks of herself","of herself as","herself as Rosa","as Rosa 's","Rosa 's heir","'s heir ,","heir , the",", the guardian","the guardian of","guardian of her","of her memory","In the energy","the energy and","energy and the","and the courage","the courage of","courage of this","of this revolutionary","this revolutionary figure","revolutionary figure ,","figure , she",", she finds","she finds her","finds her own","her own identity","She feels herself","feels herself transported","herself transported by","transported by the","by the utopia","the utopia vision","utopia vision of","vision of the","of the letters","the letters which","letters which Rosa","which Rosa wrote","Rosa wrote from","wrote from her","from her prison","her prison cells","prison cells in","cells in 1917"],"2grams":["Violette knows","knows that","that she","she will","will go","go and","and one","one night","night ,",", she","she goes","Once away","away from","from her","her home","home ,",", she","she will","will make","make good","good on","on her","her innermost","innermost wish","wish ,",", to","to walk","walk in","in the","the steps","steps of","of Rosa","Rosa ,",", the","the Rosa","Rosa to","to whom","whom she","she feels","feels intimately","intimately attached","attached ,",", her","her Rosa","Rosa ,",", Rosa","Rosa Luxembourg","Just eleven","eleven ,",", but","but Violette","Violette ,",", thinks","thinks of","of herself","herself as","as Rosa","Rosa 's","'s heir","heir ,",", the","the guardian","guardian of","of her","her memory","In the","the energy","energy and","and the","the courage","courage of","of this","this revolutionary","revolutionary figure","figure ,",", she","she finds","finds her","her own","own identity","She feels","feels herself","herself transported","transported by","by the","the utopia","utopia vision","vision of","of the","the letters","letters which","which Rosa","Rosa wrote","wrote from","from her","her prison","prison cells","cells in","in 1917"]}

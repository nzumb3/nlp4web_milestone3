{"title":"Dromed√°rio no asfalto","plot":"A promising young crew from the extreme south part of Brazil combined their efforts and talents so this film would happen. Guided by feature debut director Gilson Vargas, who has already been acclaimed for his shorts and known for his work as a film professor, the small group spent weeks traveling from Porto Alegre, Brazil, to Montevideo, Uruguay, while shooting the scenes along the way. The result is a singular film for Brazilian cinematography, that experiments unusual aesthetics and production style to its scenario. The main character's search for his father after his mother's death is very close to the actor's own personal life, adding emotional moments to the narrative.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","promis","young","crew","from","the","extrem","south","part","of","Brazil","combin","their","effort","and","talent","so","this","film","would","happen",".","Guid","by","featur","debut","director","Gilson","Varga",",","who","has","alreadi","been","acclaim","for","his","short","and","known","for","his","work","as","a","film","professor",",","the","small","group","spent","week","travel","from","Porto","Alegr",",","Brazil",",","to","Montevideo",",","Uruguay",",","while","shoot","the","scene","along","the","way",".","The","result","is","a","singular","film","for","Brazilian","cinematographi",",","that","experi","unusu","aesthet","and","product","style","to","it","scenario",".","The","main","charact","'s","search","for","his","father","after","his","mother","'s","death","is","veri","close","to","the","actor","'s","own","person","life",",","ad","emot","moment","to","the","narrat","."],"lemmas":["a","promising","young","crew","from","the","extreme","south","part","of","Brazil","combine","they","effort","and","talent","so","this","film","would","happen",".","guide","by","feature","debut","director","Gilson","Vargas",",","who","have","already","be","acclaimed","for","he","shorts","and","know","for","he","work","as","a","film","professor",",","the","small","group","spend","week","travel","from","Porto","Alegre",",","Brazil",",","to","Montevideo",",","Uruguay",",","while","shoot","the","scene","along","the","way",".","the","result","be","a","singular","film","for","brazilian","cinematography",",","that","experiment","unusual","aesthetics","and","production","style","to","its","scenario",".","the","main","character","'s","search","for","he","father","after","he","mother","'s","death","be","very","close","to","the","actor","'s","own","personal","life",",","add","emotional","moment","to","the","narrative","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A

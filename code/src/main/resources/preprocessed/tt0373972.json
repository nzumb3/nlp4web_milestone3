{"title":"Khullam Khulla Pyaar Karen","plot":"International Criminal Don, Supremo, alias Trikal Anna is concerned when he hears that two of his trusted lieutenants are at war with each other. So he decides to travel to India to settle their dispute. Upon arrival, he summons Goverdhan and Damani to his chambers and instructs them to shake hands and end their dispute, when they refuse, he instructs them to marry their children with each other. Goverdhan and Damani agree and shake hands. Goverdhan returns home and instructs his son, Vicky, to go to Surat, meet with Damani's daughter, Priti, get to know her and then marry her. Vicky does so, and travels to Surat via his car. Goverdhan receives word that Vicky has reached Surat, has met Priti, and both are in love with each other. Then he gets a shock when Vicky shows up at home, claiming that he never reached Surat, as his car met with an accident. An agitated Goverdhan, fearing a plot by the scheming Damani, travels to Surat along with his wife and Vicky, and this is where Goverdhan's world will turn upside down, and his life, quite hilariously, will never be the same again.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Internat","Crimin","Don",",","Supremo",",","alia","Trikal","Anna","is","concern","when","he","hear","that","two","of","his","trust","lieuten","are","at","war","with","each","other",".","So","he","decid","to","travel","to","India","to","settl","their","disput",".","Upon","arriv",",","he","summon","Goverdhan","and","Damani","to","his","chamber","and","instruct","them","to","shake","hand","and","end","their","disput",",","when","they","refus",",","he","instruct","them","to","marri","their","children","with","each","other",".","Goverdhan","and","Damani","agre","and","shake","hand",".","Goverdhan","return","home","and","instruct","his","son",",","Vicki",",","to","go","to","Surat",",","meet","with","Damani","'s","daughter",",","Priti",",","get","to","know","her","and","then","marri","her",".","Vicki","doe","so",",","and","travel","to","Surat","via","his","car",".","Goverdhan","receiv","word","that","Vicki","has","reach","Surat",",","has","met","Priti",",","and","both","are","in","love","with","each","other",".","Then","he","get","a","shock","when","Vicki","show","up","at","home",",","claim","that","he","never","reach","Surat",",","as","his","car","met","with","an","accid",".","An","agit","Goverdhan",",","fear","a","plot","by","the","scheme","Damani",",","travel","to","Surat","along","with","his","wife","and","Vicki",",","and","this","is","where","Goverdhan","'s","world","will","turn","upsid","down",",","and","his","life",",","quit","hilari",",","will","never","be","the","same","again","."],"lemmas":["International","Criminal","Don",",","Supremo",",","alia","Trikal","Anna","be","concern","when","he","hear","that","two","of","he","trust","lieutenant","be","at","war","with","each","other",".","so","he","decide","to","travel","to","India","to","settle","they","dispute",".","upon","arrival",",","he","summons","Goverdhan","and","Damani","to","he","chamber","and","instruct","they","to","shake","hand","and","end","they","dispute",",","when","they","refuse",",","he","instruct","they","to","marry","they","child","with","each","other",".","Goverdhan","and","Damani","agree","and","shake","hand",".","goverdhan","return","home","and","instruct","he","son",",","Vicky",",","to","go","to","Surat",",","meet","with","Damani","'s","daughter",",","Priti",",","get","to","know","she","and","then","marry","she",".","Vicky","do","so",",","and","travel","to","Surat","via","he","car",".","Goverdhan","receive","word","that","Vicky","have","reach","Surat",",","have","meet","Priti",",","and","both","be","in","love","with","each","other",".","then","he","get","a","shock","when","Vicky","show","up","at","home",",","claim","that","he","never","reach","Surat",",","as","he","car","meet","with","a","accident",".","a","agitate","Goverdhan",",","fear","a","plot","by","the","scheming","Damani",",","travel","to","Surat","along","with","he","wife","and","Vicky",",","and","this","be","where","Goverdhan","'s","world","will","turn","upside","down",",","and","he","life",",","quite","hilariously",",","will","never","be","the","same","again","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["International

{"title":"Antarctica: Ice World Pioneers","plot":"Filed over a period of 5 years, Antarctica: Ice World Pioneers tells the epic story of ingenuity, perseverance and achievement of the team that conceived and built one of the most advanced science research facilities on the Antarctic continent - South Africa's base: SANAE IV. Stunning visuals, an original music score and a compelling narrative depict extreme hardship and happiness, failure and victory, incredible beauty and uncompromising weather conditions - and the tragedy of those who paid the ultimate price while working in this merciless wasteland. This is a story told through the eyes of ordinary people who work in that place we call Antarctica, towards an end that may seem distant and beyond the realities of our everyday life, but which adds more to the survival of our planet than any other scientific endeavour on earth. This is the story of Antarctica's modern day ice world pioneers.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["File","over","a","period","of","5","year",",","Antarctica",":","Ice","World","Pioneer","tell","the","epic","stori","of","ingenu",",","persever","and","achiev","of","the","team","that","conceiv","and","built","one","of","the","most","advanc","scienc","research","facil","on","the","Antarctic","contin","-","South","Africa","'s","base",":","SANAE","IV",".","Stun","visual",",","an","origin","music","score","and","a","compel","narrat","depict","extrem","hardship","and","happi",",","failur","and","victori",",","incred","beauti","and","uncompromis","weather","condit","-","and","the","tragedi","of","those","who","paid","the","ultim","price","while","work","in","this","merciless","wasteland",".","This","is","a","stori","told","through","the","eye","of","ordinari","peopl","who","work","in","that","place","we","call","Antarctica",",","toward","an","end","that","may","seem","distant","and","beyond","the","realiti","of","our","everyday","life",",","but","which","add","more","to","the","surviv","of","our","planet","than","ani","other","scientif","endeavour","on","earth",".","This","is","the","stori","of","Antarctica","'s","modern","day","ice","world","pioneer","."],"lemmas":["file","over","a","period","of","5","year",",","Antarctica",":","Ice","World","Pioneers","tell","the","epic","story","of","ingenuity",",","perseverance","and","achievement","of","the","team","that","conceive","and","build","one","of","the","most","advanced","science","research","facility","on","the","antarctic","continent","-","South","Africa","'s","base",":","SANAE","IV",".","stunning","visual",",","a","original","music","score","and","a","compelling","narrative","depict","extreme","hardship","and","happiness",",","failure","and","victory",",","incredible","beauty","and","uncompromising","weather","condition","-","and","the","tragedy","of","those","who","pay","the","ultimate","price","while","work","in","this","merciless","wasteland",".","this","be","a","story","tell","through","the","eye","of","ordinary","people","who","work","in","that","place","we","call","Antarctica",",","towards","a","end","that","may","seem","distant","and","beyond","the","reality","of","we","everyday","life",",","but","which","add","more","to","the","survival","of","we","planet","than","any","other","scientific","endeavour","on","earth",".","this","be","the","story","of","Antarctica","'s","modern","day","ice","world","pioneer","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Filed over a","over a period","a period of","period of 5","of 5 years","5 years ,","years , Antarctica",", Antarctica :","Antarctica : Ice",": Ice World","Ice World Pioneers","World Pioneers tells","Pioneers tells the","tells the epic","the epic story","epic story of","story of ingenuity","of ingenuity ,","ingenuity , perseverance",", perseverance and","perseverance and achievement","and achievement of","achievement of the","of the team","the team that","team that conceived","that conceived and","conceived and built","and built one","built one of","one of the","of the most","the most advanced","most advanced science","advanced science research","science research facilities","research facilities on","facilities on the","on the Antarctic","the Antarctic continent","Antarctic continent -","continent -

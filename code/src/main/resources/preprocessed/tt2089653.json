{"title":"Craters of the Moon","plot":"Molly and her troubled husband Roger are on a cross-country road trip when they get into a scrape at a highway rest stop and decide to run. Disoriented by a blizzard in the back roads of the Idaho lava rock desert, the couple becomes snowbound. Their relationship strains under the pressures of starvation, hypothermia, and wolves. It is a slow-burning psychological thriller that builds to a horrifying climax in a small car at The Craters of The Moon National Park.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Horror"],"stems":["Molli","and","her","troubl","husband","Roger","are","on","a","cross-countri","road","trip","when","they","get","into","a","scrape","at","a","highway","rest","stop","and","decid","to","run",".","Disori","by","a","blizzard","in","the","back","road","of","the","Idaho","lava","rock","desert",",","the","coupl","becom","snowbound",".","Their","relationship","strain","under","the","pressur","of","starvat",",","hypothermia",",","and","wolv",".","It","is","a","slow-burn","psycholog","thriller","that","build","to","a","horrifi","climax","in","a","small","car","at","The","Crater","of","The","Moon","Nation","Park","."],"lemmas":["Molly","and","she","troubled","husband","Roger","be","on","a","cross-country","road","trip","when","they","get","into","a","scrape","at","a","highway","rest","stop","and","decide","to","run",".","disorient","by","a","blizzard","in","the","back","road","of","the","Idaho","lava","rock","desert",",","the","couple","become","snowbound",".","they","relationship","strain","under","the","pressure","of","starvation",",","hypothermia",",","and","wolf",".","it","be","a","slow-burning","psychological","thriller","that","build","to","a","horrifying","climax","in","a","small","car","at","the","crater","of","the","Moon","National","Park","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Molly and her","and her troubled","her troubled husband","troubled husband Roger","husband Roger are","Roger are on","are on a","on a cross-country","a cross-country road","cross-country road trip","road trip when","trip when they","when they get","they get into","get into a","into a scrape","a scrape at","scrape at a","at a highway","a highway rest","highway rest stop","rest stop and","stop and decide","and decide to","decide to run","Disoriented by a","by a blizzard","a blizzard in","blizzard in the","in the back","the back roads","back roads of","roads of the","of the Idaho","the Idaho lava","Idaho lava rock","lava rock desert","rock desert ,","desert , the",", the couple","the couple becomes","couple becomes snowbound","Their relationship strains","relationship strains under","strains under the","under the pressures","the pressures of","pressures of starvation","of starvation ,","starvation , hypothermia",", hypothermia ,","hypothermia , and",", and wolves","It is a","is a slow-burning","a slow-burning psychological","slow-burning psychological thriller","psychological thriller that","thriller that builds","that builds to","builds to a","to a horrifying","a horrifying climax","horrifying climax in","climax in a","in a small","a small car","small car at","car at The","at The Craters","The Craters of","Craters of The","of The Moon","The Moon National","Moon National Park"],"2grams":["Molly and","and her","her troubled","troubled husband","husband Roger","Roger are","are on","on a","a cross-country","cross-country road","road trip","trip when","when they","they get","get into","into a","a scrape","scrape at","at a","a highway","highway rest","rest stop","stop and","and decide","decide to","to run","Disoriented by","by a","a blizzard","blizzard in","in the","the back","back roads","roads of","of the","the Idaho","Idaho lava","lava rock","rock desert","desert ,",", the","the couple","couple becomes","becomes snowbound","Their relationship","relationship strains","strains under","under the","the pressures","pressures of","of starvation","starvation ,",", hypothermia","hypothermia ,",", and","and wolves","It is","is a","a slow-burning","slow-burning psychological","psychological thriller","thriller that","that builds","builds to","to a","a horrifying","horrifying climax","climax in","in a","a small","small car","car at","at The","The Craters","Craters of","of The","The Moon","Moon National","National Park"]}

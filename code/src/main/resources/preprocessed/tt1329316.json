{"title":"Black Wave: The Legacy of the Exxon Valdez","plot":"In the early hours of March 24th 1989 the Exxon Valdez oil supertanker runs aground in Alaska. It discharges millions of gallons of crude oil. The incident becomes the biggest environmental catastrophe in North American history. In a flash, dramatic images shoot across the planet. They show thousands of carcasses of dead seabirds and sea otters covered in oil. A thick black tide rises and covers the beaches of once-pristine Prince William Sound. For twenty years, Riki Ott and the fishermen of the little town of Cordova, Alaska have waged the longest legal battle in U.S. history against the world's most powerful oil company - ExxonMobil. They tell us all about the environmental, social and economic consequences of the black wave that changed their lives forever. This is the legacy of the Exxon Valdez.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","earli","hour","of","March","24th","1989","the","Exxon","Valdez","oil","supertank","run","aground","in","Alaska",".","It","discharg","million","of","gallon","of","crude","oil",".","The","incid","becom","the","biggest","environment","catastroph","in","North","American","histori",".","In","a","flash",",","dramat","imag","shoot","across","the","planet",".","They","show","thousand","of","carcass","of","dead","seabird","and","sea","otter","cover","in","oil",".","A","thick","black","tide","rise","and","cover","the","beach","of","once-pristin","Princ","William","Sound",".","For","twenti","year",",","Riki","Ott","and","the","fishermen","of","the","littl","town","of","Cordova",",","Alaska","have","wage","the","longest","legal","battl","in","U.S.","histori","against","the","world","'s","most","power","oil","compani","-","ExxonMobil",".","They","tell","us","all","about","the","environment",",","social","and","econom","consequ","of","the","black","wave","that","chang","their","live","forev",".","This","is","the","legaci","of","the","Exxon","Valdez","."],"lemmas":["in","the","early","hour","of","March","24th","1989","the","Exxon","Valdez","oil","supertanker","run","aground","in","Alaska",".","it","discharge","million","of","gallon","of","crude","oil",".","the","incident","become","the","biggest","environmental","catastrophe","in","north","american","history",".","in","a","flash",",","dramatic","image","shoot","across","the","planet",".","they","show","thousand","of","carcass","of","dead","seabird","and","sea","otter","cover","in","oil",".","a","thick","black","tide","rise","and","cover","the","beach","of","once-pristine","Prince","William","Sound",".","for","twenty","year",",","Riki","Ott","and","the","fisherman","of","the","little","town","of","Cordova",",","Alaska","have","wage","the","longest","legal","battle","in","U.S.","history","against","the","world","'s","most","powerful","oil","company","-","ExxonMobil",".","they","tell","we","all","about","the","environmental",",","social","and","economic","consequence","of","the","black","wave","that","change","they","life","forever",".","this","be","the","legacy","of","the","Exxon","Valdez","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In the early","the early hours","early hours of","hours of March","of March 24th","March 24th 1989","24th 1989 the","1989 the Exxon","the Exxon Valdez","Exxon Valdez oil","Valdez oil supertanker","oil supertanker runs","supertanker runs aground","runs aground in","aground in Alaska","It discharges millions","discharges millions of","millions of gallons","of gallons of","gallons of crude","of crude oil","The incident becomes","incident becomes the","becomes the biggest","the biggest environmental","biggest environmental catastrophe","environmental catastrophe in","catastrophe in North","in North American","North American history","In a flash","a flash ,","flash , dramatic",", dramatic images","dramatic images shoot","images shoot across","shoot across the","across the planet","They show thousands","show thousands of","thousands of carcasses","of carcasses of","carcasses of dead","of dead seabirds","dead seabirds and","seabirds and sea","and sea otters","sea otters covered","otters covered in","covered in oil","A thick black","thick black tide","black tide rises","tide rises and","rises and covers","and covers the","covers the beaches","the beaches of","beaches of once-pristine","of once-pristine Prince","once-pristine Prince William","Prince William Sound","For twenty years","twenty years ,","years , Riki",", Riki Ott","Riki Ott and","Ott and the","and the fishermen","the fishermen of","fishermen of the","of the little","the little town","little town of","town of Cordova","of Cordova ,","Cordova , Alaska",", Alaska have","Alaska have waged","have waged the","waged the longest","the longest legal","longest legal battle","legal battle in","battle in U.S.","in U.S. history","U.S. history against","history against the","against the world","the world 's","world 's most","'s most powerful","most powerful oil","powerful oil company","oil company -","company -

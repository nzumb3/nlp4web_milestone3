{"title":"My Brazil","plot":"In some violent favelas (slums) of Rio de Janeiro, local community leaders put their lives on the line to fight for basic rights and social services for their fellow citizens. What compels these volunteers to face discrimination, intense pressure from political parties and drug traffickers, with the sole purpose of improving their communities' quality of life? Based on her research and experience with more than a hundred community leaders over a period of four years, filmmaker Daniela Broitman explores this question in the documentary film \"My Brazil.\" The film follows the daily lives of three courageous leaders and their surprising journey to the Fifth World Social Forum -- the most important global meeting on social justice. As they interact with activists, policymakers and leaders from all over the world, they seek ways to combat social, gender and racial discrimination, and enhance living conditions in the favelas. Featuring: 33 community leaders, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Venezuela's President Hugo Chavez, Musician Gilberto Gil, Portuguese writer Jose Saramago, Uruguayan journalist Eduardo Galeano, and Frei Betto and Leonardo Boff - two of the major voices of social justice in Latin America.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","some","violent","favela","(","slum",")","of","Rio","de","Janeiro",",","local","communiti","leader","put","their","live","on","the","line","to","fight","for","basic","right","and","social","servic","for","their","fellow","citizen",".","What","compel","these","volunt","to","face","discrimin",",","intens","pressur","from","polit","parti","and","drug","traffick",",","with","the","sole","purpos","of","improv","their","communiti","'","qualiti","of","life","?","Base","on","her","research","and","experi","with","more","than","a","hundr","communiti","leader","over","a","period","of","four","year",",","filmmak","Daniela","Broitman","explor","this","question","in","the","documentari","film","\"","My","Brazil",".","\"","The","film","follow","the","daili","live","of","three","courag","leader","and","their","surpris","journey","to","the","Fifth","World","Social","Forum","--","the","most","import","global","meet","on","social","justic",".","As","they","interact","with","activist",",","policymak","and","leader","from","all","over","the","world",",","they","seek","way","to","combat","social",",","gender","and","racial","discrimin",",","and","enhanc","live","condit","in","the","favela",".","Featur",":","33","communiti","leader",",","Brazil","'s","Presid","Luiz","Inacio","Lula","da","Silva",",","Venezuela","'s","Presid","Hugo","Chavez",",","Musician","Gilberto","Gil",",","Portugues","writer","Jose","Saramago",",","Uruguayan","journalist","Eduardo","Galeano",",","and","Frei","Betto","and","Leonardo","Boff","-","two","of","the","major","voic","of","social","justic","in","Latin","America","."],"lemmas":["in","some","violent","favela","-lrb-","slum","-rrb-","of","Rio","de","Janeiro",",","local","community","leader","put","they","life","on","the","line","to","fight","for","basic","rights","and","social","service","for","they","fellow","citizen",".","what","compel","these","volunteer","to","face","discrimination",",","intense","pressure","from","political","party","and","drug","trafficker",",","with","the","sole","purpose","of","improve","they","community","'","quality","of","life","?","base","on","she","research","and","experience","with","more","than","a","hundred","community","leader","over","a","period","of","four","year",",","filmmaker","Daniela","Broitman","explore","this","question","in","the","documentary","film","``","My","Brazil",".","''","the","film","follow","the","daily","life","of","three","courageous","leader","and","they","surprising","journey","to","the","Fifth","World","Social","Forum","--","the","most","important","global","meeting","on","social","justice",".","as","they","interact","with","activist",",","policymaker","and","leader","from","all","over","the","world",",","they","seek","way","to","combat","social",",","gender","and","racial","discrimination",",","and","enhance","living","condition","in","the","favela",".","feature",":","33","community","leader",",","Brazil","'s","President","Luiz","Inacio","Lula","da","Silva",",","Venezuela","'s","President","Hugo","Chavez",",","musician","Gilberto","Gil",",","Portuguese","writer","Jose","Saramago",",","Uruguayan","journalist","Eduardo","Galeano",",","and","Frei","Betto","and","Leonardo","Boff","-","two","of","the","major","voice","of","social","justice","in","Latin","America","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

{"title":"Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York","plot":"'Ordinary Miracles: The Photo League's New York' is the story of the Photo League (1936-1951), which for fifteen years was the center of the documentary movement in American photography at a time when the camera was held to be, in James Agee's words, 'the central instrument of our time'. Featuring little-known examples of the work of fifty of the Photo League's leading photographers and supplemented with interviews with still feisty (and active) League veterans, the film features a captivating, 'period' musical score and an incisive narration read by Campbell Scott. 'Ordinary Miracles' is a tribute to the high purpose of photography, a remarkable group and an unmatched panorama of urban life in the neighborhoods of New York City during the 1930's and 40's.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Ordinari","Miracl",":","The","Photo","Leagu","'s","New","York","'","is","the","stori","of","the","Photo","Leagu","(","1936-1951",")",",","which","for","fifteen","year","was","the","center","of","the","documentari","movement","in","American","photographi","at","a","time","when","the","camera","was","held","to","be",",","in","Jame","Agee","'s","word",",","'","the","central","instrument","of","our","time","'",".","Featur","little-known","exampl","of","the","work","of","fifti","of","the","Photo","Leagu","'s","lead","photograph","and","supplement","with","interview","with","still","feisti","(","and","activ",")","Leagu","veteran",",","the","film","featur","a","captiv",",","'","period","'","music","score","and","an","incis","narrat","read","by","Campbel","Scott",".","'","Ordinari","Miracl","'","is","a","tribut","to","the","high","purpos","of","photographi",",","a","remark","group","and","an","unmatch","panorama","of","urban","life","in","the","neighborhood","of","New","York","Citi","dure","the","1930","'s","and","40","'s","."],"lemmas":["'","ordinary","miracle",":","the","Photo","League","'s","New","York","'","be","the","story","of","the","Photo","League","-lrb-","1936-1951","-rrb-",",","which","for","fifteen","year","be","the","center","of","the","documentary","movement","in","american","photography","at","a","time","when","the","camera","be","hold","to","be",",","in","James","Agee","'s","word",",","'","the","central","instrument","of","we","time","'",".","feature","little-known","example","of","the","work","of","fifty","of","the","Photo","League","'s","lead","photographer","and","supplement","with","interview","with","still","feisty","-lrb-","and","active","-rrb-","League","veteran",",","the","film","feature","a","captivating",",","'","period","'","musical","score","and","a","incisive","narration","read","by","Campbell","Scott",".","'","ordinary","miracle","'","be","a","tribute","to","the","high","purpose","of","photography",",","a","remarkable","group","and","a","unmatched","panorama","of","urban","life","in","the","neighborhood","of","New","York","City","during","the","1930","'s","and","40","'s","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Ordinary Miracles","Ordinary Miracles :","Miracles : The",": The Photo","The Photo League","Photo League 's","League 's New","'s New York","New York '","York ' is","' is the","is the story","the story of","story of the","of the Photo","the Photo League","Photo League (","League ( 1936-1951","( 1936-1951 )","1936-1951 ) ,",") , which",", which for","which for fifteen","for fifteen years","fifteen years was","years was the","was the center","the center of","center of the","of the documentary","the documentary movement","documentary movement in","movement in American","in American photography","American photography at","photography at a","at a time","a time when","time when the","when the camera","the camera was","camera was held","was held to","held to be","to be ,","be , in",", in James","in James Agee","James Agee 's","Agee 's words","'s words ,","words , '",", ' the","' the central","the central instrument","central instrument of","instrument of our","of our time","our time '","Featuring little-known examples","little-known examples of","examples of the","of the work","the work of","work of fifty","of fifty of","fifty of the","of the Photo","the Photo League","Photo League 's","League 's leading","'s leading photographers","leading photographers and","photographers and supplemented","and supplemented with","supplemented with interviews","with interviews with","interviews with still","with still feisty","still feisty (","feisty ( and","( and active","and active )","active ) League",") League veterans","League veterans ,","veterans , the",", the film","the film features","film features a","features a captivating","a captivating ,","captivating , '",", ' period","' period '","period ' musical","' musical score","musical score and","score and an","and an incisive","an incisive narration","incisive narration read","narration read by","read by Campbell","by Campbell Scott","Campbell Scott .","Scott .

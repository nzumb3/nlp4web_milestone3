{"title":"Cuckoo","plot":"WWII, 1942. Losses over enemy territory of planes from RAF Bandon - call-sign \"Dunnock\" - a British bomber airbase in Southern England, have its C.O. concerned. For Wing Commander Marshall, the numbers of his bombers being intercepted are high... consistently too high to be a fluke. His suspicions that all is not what it seems among the base staff are realized when Intelligence Office Lt. Larry Ford confirms transmissions to German High Command are being detected, originating from somewhere in the base. Who is the traitorous cuckoo in the nest? And can they be found before more lives are lost?","genres":["Drama"," War"," Thriller"],"stems":["WWII",",","1942",".","Loss","over","enemi","territori","of","plane","from","RAF","Bandon","-","call-sign","\"","Dunnock","\"","-","a","British","bomber","airbas","in","Southern","England",",","have","it","C.O.","concern",".","For","Wing","Command","Marshal",",","the","number","of","his","bomber","be","intercept","are","high","...","consist","too","high","to","be","a","fluke",".","His","suspicion","that","all","is","not","what","it","seem","among","the","base","staff","are","realiz","when","Intellig","Office","Lt.","Larri","Ford","confirm","transmiss","to","German","High","Command","are","be","detect",",","origin","from","somewher","in","the","base",".","Who","is","the","traitor","cuckoo","in","the","nest","?","And","can","they","be","found","befor","more","live","are","lost","?"],"lemmas":["WWII",",","1942",".","loss","over","enemy","territory","of","plane","from","RAF","Bandon","-","call-sign","``","Dunnock","''","-","a","british","bomber","airbase","in","Southern","England",",","have","its","C.O.","concern",".","for","Wing","Commander","Marshall",",","the","number","of","he","bomber","be","intercept","be","high","...","consistently","too","high","to","be","a","fluke",".","he","suspicion","that","all","be","not","what","it","seem","among","the","base","staff","be","realize","when","Intelligence","Office","Lt.","Larry","Ford","confirm","transmission","to","german","high","command","be","be","detect",",","originate","from","somewhere","in","the","base",".","who","be","the","traitorous","cuckoo","in","the","nest","?","and","can","they","be","find","before","more","life","be","lose","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["WWII , 1942","Losses over enemy","over enemy territory","enemy territory of","territory of planes","of planes from","planes from RAF","from RAF Bandon","RAF Bandon -","Bandon - call-sign","- call-sign \"","call-sign \" Dunnock","\" Dunnock \"","Dunnock \" -","\" - a","- a British","a British bomber","British bomber airbase","bomber airbase in","airbase in Southern","in Southern England","Southern England ,","England , have",", have its","have its C.O.","its C.O. concerned","For Wing Commander","Wing Commander Marshall","Commander Marshall ,","Marshall , the",", the numbers","the numbers of","numbers of his","of his bombers","his bombers being","bombers being intercepted","being intercepted are","intercepted are high","are high ...","high ... consistently","... consistently too","consistently too high","too high to","high to be","to be a","be a fluke","His suspicions that","suspicions that all","that all is","all is not","is not what","not what it","what it seems","it seems among","seems among the","among the base","the base staff","base staff are","staff are realized","are realized when","realized when Intelligence","when Intelligence Office","Intelligence Office Lt.","Office Lt.

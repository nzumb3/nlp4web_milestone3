{"title":"What Lies Beneath","plot":"Norman Spencer, a university research scientist, is growing more and more concerned about his wife, Claire, a retired concert cellist who a year ago was involved in a serious auto accident, and who has just sent off her daughter Caitlin (Norman's stepdaughter) to college. Now, Claire reports hearing voices and witnessing eerie occurrences in and around their lakeside Vermont home, including seeing the face of a young woman reflected in water. An increasingly frightened Claire thinks the phenomena have something to do with the couple living next door, especially since the wife has disappeared without apparent explanation. At her husband's urging, Claire starts to see a therapist; she tells him she thinks the house is being haunted by a ghost. His advice? Try to make contact. Enlisting the help of her best friend, Jody, and a ouija board, Claire seeks to find out the truth of What Lies Beneath.","genres":["Drama"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Norman","Spencer",",","a","univers","research","scientist",",","is","grow","more","and","more","concern","about","his","wife",",","Clair",",","a","retir","concert","cellist","who","a","year","ago","was","involv","in","a","serious","auto","accid",",","and","who","has","just","sent","off","her","daughter","Caitlin","(","Norman","'s","stepdaught",")","to","colleg",".","Now",",","Clair","report","hear","voic","and","wit","eeri","occurr","in","and","around","their","lakesid","Vermont","home",",","includ","see","the","face","of","a","young","woman","reflect","in","water",".","An","increas","frighten","Clair","think","the","phenomena","have","someth","to","do","with","the","coupl","live","next","door",",","especi","sinc","the","wife","has","disappear","without","appar","explan",".","At","her","husband","'s","urg",",","Clair","start","to","see","a","therapist",";","she","tell","him","she","think","the","hous","is","be","haunt","by","a","ghost",".","His","advic","?","Tri","to","make","contact",".","Enlist","the","help","of","her","best","friend",",","Jodi",",","and","a","ouija","board",",","Clair","seek","to","find","out","the","truth","of","What","Lie","Beneath","."],"lemmas":["Norman","Spencer",",","a","university","research","scientist",",","be","grow","more","and","more","concerned","about","he","wife",",","Claire",",","a","retired","concert","cellist","who","a","year","ago","be","involve","in","a","serious","auto","accident",",","and","who","have","just","send","off","she","daughter","Caitlin","-lrb-","Norman","'s","stepdaughter","-rrb-","to","college",".","now",",","Claire","report","hearing","voice","and","witness","eerie","occurrence","in","and","around","they","lakeside","Vermont","home",",","include","see","the","face","of","a","young","woman","reflect","in","water",".","a","increasingly","frightened","Claire","think","the","phenomenon","have","something","to","do","with","the","couple","live","next","door",",","especially","since","the","wife","have","disappear","without","apparent","explanation",".","at","she","husband","'s","urge",",","Claire","start","to","see","a","therapist",";","she","tell","he","she","think","the","house","be","be","haunt","by","a","ghost",".","he","advice","?","try","to","make","contact",".","enlist","the","help","of","she","best","friend",",","Jody",",","and","a","ouija","board",",","Claire","seek","to","find","out","the","truth","of","what","lie","beneath","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Norman Spencer ,","Spencer , a",", a university","a university research","university research scientist","research scientist ,","scientist , is",", is growing","is growing more","growing more and","more and more","and more concerned","more concerned about","concerned about his","about his wife","his wife ,","wife , Claire",", Claire ,","Claire , a",", a retired","a retired concert","retired concert cellist","concert cellist who","cellist who a","who a year","a year ago","year ago was","ago was involved","was involved in","involved in a","in a serious","a serious auto","serious auto accident","auto accident ,","accident , and",", and who","and who has","who has just","has just sent","just sent off","sent off her","off her daughter","her daughter Caitlin","daughter Caitlin (","Caitlin ( Norman","( Norman 's","Norman 's stepdaughter","'s stepdaughter )","stepdaughter ) to",") to college","Now , Claire",", Claire reports","Claire reports hearing","reports hearing voices","hearing voices and","voices and witnessing","and witnessing eerie","witnessing eerie occurrences","eerie occurrences in","occurrences in and","in and around","and around their","around their lakeside","their lakeside Vermont","lakeside Vermont home","Vermont home ,","home , including",", including seeing","including seeing the","seeing the face","the face of","face of a","of a young","a young woman","young woman reflected","woman reflected in","reflected in water","An increasingly frightened","increasingly frightened Claire","frightened Claire thinks","Claire thinks the","thinks the phenomena","the phenomena have","phenomena have something","have something to","something to do","to do with","do with the","with the couple","the couple living","couple living next","living next door","next door ,","door , especially",", especially since","especially since the","since the wife","the wife has","wife has disappeared","has disappeared without","disappeared without apparent","without apparent explanation","At her husband","her husband 's","husband 's urging","'s urging ,","urging , Claire",", Claire starts","Claire starts to","starts to see","to see a","see a therapist","a therapist ;","therapist ;

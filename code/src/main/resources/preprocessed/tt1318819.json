{"title":"Among Dead Men","plot":"Life on the wild side sometimes has its own way in regulating or instigating consciousness awakening on its most devoted disciple. Bobby Delgado, undefeated MMA World Champion (of an elusive and clandestine underworld tournament of Mixed Martial Arts) is incarcerated for eight years after accidentally killing his opponent. During this period of purgatory, Bobby experiences a paranormal 'life changing' event that will dictate his future path to redemption. Infuriated by the financial loss and the death of his master fighter, Jarvis Sweet swears vengeance on Delgado and finds himself a new hitter in the form of Wade Bull, a vicious ex underworld enforcer with killing skills few men can match. Sweet and Mafia boss kingpin Sal Civelo, formulate a ruthless and provocative campaign aimed at putting Delgado back into the pit. As pressure builds and danger closes in, Bobby has to concoct a subtle mind game to confront his nemesis in an environment that he can control. What follows is a brutal and bloody confrontation for survival. There will be no rules and no mercy in this new game of death and all scores will be settled in 'Among Dead Men'.","genres":["Action"," Horror","

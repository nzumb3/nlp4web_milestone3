{"title":"Overview","plot":"Astronauts who have seen the Earth from space have often described the 'Overview Effect', an experience that has transformed their perspective of the planet and mankind's place upon it, and enabled them to perceive it as our shared home, without boundaries between nations or species. 'Overview' is a short film that explores this perspective through interviews with astronauts who have experienced the Overview Effect. The film also features insights from commentators and thinkers on the wider implications and importance of this understanding for humanity as a whole, and especially its relevance to how we meet the tremendous challenges facing our planet at this time.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Astronaut","who","have","seen","the","Earth","from","space","have","often","describ","the","'","Overview","Effect","'",",","an","experi","that","has","transform","their","perspect","of","the","planet","and","mankind","'s","place","upon","it",",","and","enabl","them","to","perceiv","it","as","our","share","home",",","without","boundari","between","nation","or","speci",".","'","Overview","'","is","a","short","film","that","explor","this","perspect","through","interview","with","astronaut","who","have","experienc","the","Overview","Effect",".","The","film","also","featur","insight","from","comment","and","thinker","on","the","wider","implic","and","import","of","this","understand","for","human","as","a","whole",",","and","especi","it","relev","to","how","we","meet","the","tremend","challeng","face","our","planet","at","this","time","."],"lemmas":["astronaut","who","have","see","the","Earth","from","space","have","often","describe","the","'","overview","effect","'",",","a","experience","that","have","transform","they","perspective","of","the","planet","and","mankind","'s","place","upon","it",",","and","enable","they","to","perceive","it","as","we","shared","home",",","without","boundary","between","nation","or","species",".","'","overview","'","be","a","short","film","that","explore","this","perspective","through","interview","with","astronaut","who","have","experience","the","overview","effect",".","the","film","also","feature","insight","from","commentator","and","thinker","on","the","wider","implication","and","importance","of","this","understanding","for","humanity","as","a","whole",",","and","especially","its","relevance","to","how","we","meet","the","tremendous","challenge","face","we","planet","at","this","time","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Astronauts who have","who have seen","have seen the","seen the Earth","the Earth from","Earth from space","from space have","space have often","have often described","often described the","described the '","the ' Overview","' Overview Effect","Overview Effect '","Effect ' ,","' , an",", an experience","an experience that","experience that has","that has transformed","has transformed their","transformed their perspective","their perspective of","perspective of the","of the planet","the planet and","planet and mankind","and mankind 's","mankind 's place","'s place upon","place upon it","upon it ,","it , and",", and enabled","and enabled them","enabled them to","them to perceive","to perceive it","perceive it as","it as our","as our shared","our shared home","shared home ,","home , without",", without boundaries","without boundaries between","boundaries between nations","between nations or","nations or species","or species .","species .

{"title":"Lucky Numbers","plot":"Winter, 1988: Harrisburg PA's celebrity weatherman, Russ Richards, is broke: he's borrowed heavily to open a snowmobile dealership, and it's still unseasonably warm. Gig, his seedy pal, advises him to run an insurance scam; when it goes awry, Russ is out another $10,000 and in trouble with Dale, a bat-wielding thug. Gig convinces Russ to rig the state lottery with the help of Crystal, a gold-digging ditz with a heart of tin. They have to find a beard to buy the ticket, and then they have to cash it. Soon, murder and various double-crosses add to Russ's nightmare. A lazy cop zeroes in. Jail is closer than riches. Will Russ have to choose between his money and his life?","genres":["Comedy"," Crime"],"stems":["Winter",",","1988",":","Harrisburg","PA","'s","celebr","weatherman",",","Russ","Richard",",","is","broke",":","he","'s","borrow","heavili","to","open","a","snowmobil","dealership",",","and","it","'s","still","unseason","warm",".","Gig",",","his","seedi","pal",",","advis","him","to","run","an","insur","scam",";","when","it","goe","awri",",","Russ","is","out","anoth","$","10,000","and","in","troubl","with","Dale",",","a","bat-wield","thug",".","Gig","convinc","Russ","to","rig","the","state","lotteri","with","the","help","of","Crystal",",","a","gold-dig","ditz","with","a","heart","of","tin",".","They","have","to","find","a","beard","to","buy","the","ticket",",","and","then","they","have","to","cash","it",".","Soon",",","murder","and","various","double-cross","add","to","Russ","'s","nightmar",".","A","lazi","cop","zero","in",".","Jail","is","closer","than","rich",".","Will","Russ","have","to","choos","between","his","money","and","his","life","?"],"lemmas":["Winter",",","1988",":","Harrisburg","pa","'s","celebrity","weatherman",",","Russ","Richards",",","be","break",":","he","be","borrow","heavily","to","open","a","snowmobile","dealership",",","and","it","be","still","unseasonably","warm",".","gig",",","he","seedy","pal",",","advise","he","to","run","a","insurance","scam",";","when","it","go","awry",",","Russ","be","out","another","$","10,000","and","in","trouble","with","Dale",",","a","bat-wielding","thug",".","gig","convince","Russ","to","rig","the","state","lottery","with","the","help","of","Crystal",",","a","gold-digging","ditz","with","a","heart","of","tin",".","they","have","to","find","a","beard","to","buy","the","ticket",",","and","then","they","have","to","cash","it",".","soon",",","murder","and","various","double-cross","add","to","Russ","'s","nightmare",".","a","lazy","cop","zero","in",".","jail","be","closer","than","riches",".","Will","Russ","have","to","choose","between","he","money","and","he","life","?"],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Winter , 1988",", 1988 :","1988 : Harrisburg",": Harrisburg PA","Harrisburg PA 's","PA 's celebrity","'s celebrity weatherman","celebrity weatherman ,","weatherman , Russ",", Russ Richards","Russ Richards ,","Richards , is",", is broke","is broke :","broke : he",": he 's","he 's borrowed","'s borrowed heavily","borrowed heavily to","heavily to open","to open a","open a snowmobile","a snowmobile dealership","snowmobile dealership ,","dealership , and",", and it","and it 's","it 's still","'s still unseasonably","still unseasonably warm","Gig , his",", his seedy","his seedy pal","seedy pal ,","pal , advises",", advises him","advises him to","him to run","to run an","run an insurance","an insurance scam","insurance scam ;","scam ;

{"title":"Accelerating America","plot":"ACCELERATING AMERICA tells the story of a revolutionary school in Rhode Island that gives inner-city youths who are at risk of dropping out a second chance by accelerating their studies. At the head of the school is a fearless principal, Robert DeBlois, who as a quadriplegic knows something about overcoming adversity. If the word \"inspiring\" gets overused, it rarely feels as apt as when watching DeBlois apply his tough love educational techniques on hardened teens. We watch three students - America, Jason and Yazmine - as they struggle through a make-or-break year, drawing upon conviction, pride and humor in order to survive.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["ACCELERATING","AMERICA","tell","the","stori","of","a","revolutionari","school","in","Rhode","Island","that","give","inner-c","youth","who","are","at","risk","of","drop","out","a","second","chanc","by","acceler","their","studi",".","At","the","head","of","the","school","is","a","fearless","princip",",","Robert","DeBloi",",","who","as","a","quadripleg","know","someth","about","overcom","advers",".","If","the","word","\"","inspir","\"","get","overus",",","it","rare","feel","as","apt","as","when","watch","DeBloi","appli","his","tough","love","educ","techniqu","on","harden","teen",".","We","watch","three","student","-","America",",","Jason","and","Yazmin","-","as","they","struggl","through","a","make-or-break","year",",","draw","upon","convict",",","pride","and","humor","in","order","to","surviv","."],"lemmas":["ACCELERATING","AMERICA","tell","the","story","of","a","revolutionary","school","in","Rhode","Island","that","give","inner-city","youth","who","be","at","risk","of","drop","out","a","second","chance","by","accelerate","they","study",".","at","the","head","of","the","school","be","a","fearless","principal",",","Robert","DeBlois",",","who","as","a","quadriplegic","know","something","about","overcome","adversity",".","if","the","word","``","inspiring","''","get","overuse",",","it","rarely","feel","as","apt","as","when","watch","DeBlois","apply","he","tough","love","educational","technique","on","hardened","teens",".","we","watch","three","student","-","America",",","Jason","and","Yazmine","-","as","they","struggle","through","a","make-or-break","year",",","draw","upon","conviction",",","pride","and","humor","in","order","to","survive","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["ACCELERATING AMERICA tells","AMERICA tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of a","of a revolutionary","a revolutionary school","revolutionary school in","school in Rhode","in Rhode Island","Rhode Island that","Island that gives","that gives inner-city","gives inner-city youths","inner-city youths who","youths who are","who are at","are at risk","at risk of","risk of dropping","of dropping out","dropping out a","out a second","a second chance","second chance by","chance by accelerating","by accelerating their","accelerating their studies","At the head","the head of","head of the","of the school","the school is","school is a","is a fearless","a fearless principal","fearless principal ,","principal , Robert",", Robert DeBlois","Robert DeBlois ,","DeBlois , who",", who as","who as a","as a quadriplegic","a quadriplegic knows","quadriplegic knows something","knows something about","something about overcoming","about overcoming adversity","If the word","the word \"","word \" inspiring","\" inspiring \"","inspiring \" gets","\" gets overused","gets overused ,","overused , it",", it rarely","it rarely feels","rarely feels as","feels as apt","as apt as","apt as when","as when watching","when watching DeBlois","watching DeBlois apply","DeBlois apply his","apply his tough","his tough love","tough love educational","love educational techniques","educational techniques on","techniques on hardened","on hardened teens","We watch three","watch three students","three students -","students -

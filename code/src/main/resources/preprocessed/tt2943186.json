{"title":"Falling Leaves","plot":"Amir waits alone in Tehran for his son's return from California to help him run the traditional family business. Arash does not share his father's sense of duty and has chosen to follow his heart. Amir has no understanding or sympathy for his son's choice until he reconnects with the woman he would have married had his own father not intervened. Caught between traditional values and personal integrity, Amir chooses to rethink and come to terms with the choices he has made in his life.","genres":["Drama"," Family"],"stems":["Amir","wait","alon","in","Tehran","for","his","son","'s","return","from","California","to","help","him","run","the","tradit","famili","busi",".","Arash","doe","not","share","his","father","'s","sens","of","duti","and","has","chosen","to","follow","his","heart",".","Amir","has","no","understand","or","sympathi","for","his","son","'s","choic","until","he","reconnect","with","the","woman","he","would","have","marri","had","his","own","father","not","interven",".","Caught","between","tradit","valu","and","person","integr",",","Amir","choos","to","rethink","and","come","to","term","with","the","choic","he","has","made","in","his","life","."],"lemmas":["Amir","wait","alone","in","Tehran","for","he","son","'s","return","from","California","to","help","he","run","the","traditional","family","business",".","Arash","do","not","share","he","father","'s","sense","of","duty","and","have","choose","to","follow","he","heart",".","Amir","have","no","understanding","or","sympathy","for","he","son","'s","choice","until","he","reconnect","with","the","woman","he","would","have","marry","have","he","own","father","not","intervene",".","catch","between","traditional","value","and","personal","integrity",",","Amir","choose","to","rethink","and","come","to","term","with","the","choice","he","have","make","in","he","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Amir waits alone","waits alone in","alone in Tehran","in Tehran for","Tehran for his","for his son","his son 's","son 's return","'s return from","return from California","from California to","California to help","to help him","help him run","him run the","run the traditional","the traditional family","traditional family business","Arash does not","does not share","not share his","share his father","his father 's","father 's sense","'s sense of","sense of duty","of duty and","duty and has","and has chosen","has chosen to","chosen to follow","to follow his","follow his heart","Amir has no","has no understanding","no understanding or","understanding or sympathy","or sympathy for","sympathy for his","for his son","his son 's","son 's choice","'s choice until","choice until he","until he reconnects","he reconnects with","reconnects with the","with the woman","the woman he","woman he would","he would have","would have married","have married had","married had his","had his own","his own father","own father not","father not intervened","Caught between traditional","between traditional values","traditional values and","values and personal","and personal integrity","personal integrity ,","integrity , Amir",", Amir chooses","Amir chooses to","chooses to rethink","to rethink and","rethink and come","and come to","come to terms","to terms with","terms with the","with the choices","the choices he","choices he has","he has made","has made in","made in his","in his life"],"2grams":["Amir waits","waits alone","alone in","in Tehran","Tehran for","for his","his son","son 's","'s return","return from","from California","California to","to help","help him","him run","run the","the traditional","traditional family","family business","Arash does","does not","not share","share his","his father","father 's","'s sense","sense of","of duty","duty and","and has","has chosen","chosen to","to follow","follow his","his heart","Amir has","has no","no understanding","understanding or","or sympathy","sympathy for","for his","his son","son 's","'s choice","choice until","until he","he reconnects","reconnects with","with the","the woman","woman he","he would","would have","have married","married had","had his","his own","own father","father not","not intervened","Caught between","between traditional","traditional values","values and","and personal","personal integrity","integrity ,",", Amir","Amir chooses","chooses to","to rethink","rethink and","and come","come to","to terms","terms with","with the","the choices","choices he","he has","has made","made in","in his","his life"]}

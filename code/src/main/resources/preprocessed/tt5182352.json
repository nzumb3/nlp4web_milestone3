{"title":"Inuit Cree Reconciliation","plot":"Filmmakers Zacharias Kunuk and Neil Diamond join forces on a journey to the remote site where their ancestors once clashed to celebrate 200 years of peace. Elders recount dramatic stories of battles, heroes and peacemaking from two different cultural perspectives. Coupled with incredible footage and a fantastic soundtrack, the film depicts the modern complexities of two communities living together in Canada's Far North and an age-old conflict between the Cree and Inuit that lasted more than a century.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Filmmak","Zacharia","Kunuk","and","Neil","Diamond","join","forc","on","a","journey","to","the","remot","site","where","their","ancestor","onc","clash","to","celebr","200","year","of","peac",".","Elder","recount","dramat","stori","of","battl",",","hero","and","peacemak","from","two","differ","cultur","perspect",".","Coupl","with","incred","footag","and","a","fantast","soundtrack",",","the","film","depict","the","modern","complex","of","two","communiti","live","togeth","in","Canada","'s","Far","North","and","an","age-old","conflict","between","the","Cree","and","Inuit","that","last","more","than","a","centuri","."],"lemmas":["filmmaker","Zacharias","Kunuk","and","Neil","Diamond","join","force","on","a","journey","to","the","remote","site","where","they","ancestor","once","clash","to","celebrate","200","year","of","peace",".","Elders","recount","dramatic","story","of","battle",",","hero","and","peacemake","from","two","different","cultural","perspective",".","couple","with","incredible","footage","and","a","fantastic","soundtrack",",","the","film","depict","the","modern","complexity","of","two","community","live","together","in","Canada","'s","Far","North","and","a","age-old","conflict","between","the","Cree","and","Inuit","that","last","more","than","a","century","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Filmmakers Zacharias Kunuk","Zacharias Kunuk and","Kunuk and Neil","and Neil Diamond","Neil Diamond join","Diamond join forces","join forces on","forces on a","on a journey","a journey to","journey to the","to the remote","the remote site","remote site where","site where their","where their ancestors","their ancestors once","ancestors once clashed","once clashed to","clashed to celebrate","to celebrate 200","celebrate 200 years","200 years of","years of peace","Elders recount dramatic","recount dramatic stories","dramatic stories of","stories of battles","of battles ,","battles , heroes",", heroes and","heroes and peacemaking","and peacemaking from","peacemaking from two","from two different","two different cultural","different cultural perspectives","Coupled with incredible","with incredible footage","incredible footage and","footage and a","and a fantastic","a fantastic soundtrack","fantastic soundtrack ,","soundtrack , the",", the film","the film depicts","film depicts the","depicts the modern","the modern complexities","modern complexities of","complexities of two","of two communities","two communities living","communities living together","living together in","together in Canada","in Canada 's","Canada 's Far","'s Far North","Far North and","North and an","and an age-old","an age-old conflict","age-old conflict between","conflict between the","between the Cree","the Cree and","Cree and Inuit","and Inuit that","Inuit that lasted","that lasted more","lasted more than","more than a","than a century"],"2grams":["Filmmakers Zacharias","Zacharias Kunuk","Kunuk and","and Neil","Neil Diamond","Diamond join","join forces","forces on","on a","a journey","journey to","to the","the remote","remote site","site where","where their","their ancestors","ancestors once","once clashed","clashed to","to celebrate","celebrate 200","200 years","years of","of peace","Elders recount","recount dramatic","dramatic stories","stories of","of battles","battles ,",", heroes","heroes and","and peacemaking","peacemaking from","from two","two different","different cultural","cultural perspectives","Coupled with","with incredible","incredible footage","footage and","and a","a fantastic","fantastic soundtrack","soundtrack ,",", the","the film","film depicts","depicts the","the modern","modern complexities","complexities of","of two","two communities","communities living","living together","together in","in Canada","Canada 's","'s Far","Far North","North and","and an","an age-old","age-old conflict","conflict between","between the","the Cree","Cree and","and Inuit","Inuit that","that lasted","lasted more","more than","than a","a century"]}

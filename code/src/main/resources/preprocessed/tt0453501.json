{"title":"It's a Mismatch","plot":"Aman, a talented young architect, raised by his Uncle has all the love and care a family could offer, even if he does take it for granted. While working towards his dream, his life takes a beautiful turn when he bumps into the perfect girl Neha. The two fall in love, and nothing seems able to come between them. Nothing, that is, until it comes time for their families to meet. Sparks fly. Every known disaster strikes when the hyper-vibrant Mr. Bhalla and the rigidly-conventional Mr. Patel meet and their differences become hilariously apparent. The two are woefully mismatched from the start. Disapproval inevitably comes when the two fathers lock horns, but the lovebirds, true to their feelings, are ready to do anything to make their dreams come true. They must find a way to bring their families together which leads to a comical series of misadventures of the two disapproving, faultfinding fathers. Between the struggles of making his career dreams a reality and bringing two families together, Aman realizes the true definition of family and what it really means to love someone.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

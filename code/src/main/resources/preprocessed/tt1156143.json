{"title":"Wild Grass","plot":"A wallet lost and found opens the door to romantic adventure for Georges and Marguerite. After examining the ID papers of its owner, it is not a simple matter for Georges to turn the red wallet he found in to the police. Nor is it that Marguerite can recuperate her wallet without being piqued with curiosity about whom it was who found it. As they navigate the social protocols of giving and acknowledging thanks, turbulence enters their otherwise quotidian lives.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["A","wallet","lost","and","found","open","the","door","to","romant","adventur","for","Georg","and","Marguerit",".","After","examin","the","ID","paper","of","it","owner",",","it","is","not","a","simpl","matter","for","Georg","to","turn","the","red","wallet","he","found","in","to","the","polic",".","Nor","is","it","that","Marguerit","can","recuper","her","wallet","without","be","piqu","with","curios","about","whom","it","was","who","found","it",".","As","they","navig","the","social","protocol","of","give","and","acknowledg","thank",",","turbul","enter","their","otherwis","quotidian","live","."],"lemmas":["a","wallet","lose","and","find","open","the","door","to","romantic","adventure","for","Georges","and","Marguerite",".","after","examine","the","id","papers","of","its","owner",",","it","be","not","a","simple","matter","for","Georges","to","turn","the","red","wallet","he","find","in","to","the","police",".","nor","be","it","that","Marguerite","can","recuperate","she","wallet","without","be","pique","with","curiosity","about","whom","it","be","who","find","it",".","as","they","navigate","the","social","protocol","of","give","and","acknowledge","thanks",",","turbulence","enter","they","otherwise","quotidian","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A wallet lost","wallet lost and","lost and found","and found opens","found opens the","opens the door","the door to","door to romantic","to romantic adventure","romantic adventure for","adventure for Georges","for Georges and","Georges and Marguerite","After examining the","examining the ID","the ID papers","ID papers of","papers of its","of its owner","its owner ,","owner , it",", it is","it is not","is not a","not a simple","a simple matter","simple matter for","matter for Georges","for Georges to","Georges to turn","to turn the","turn the red","the red wallet","red wallet he","wallet he found","he found in","found in to","in to the","to the police","Nor is it","is it that","it that Marguerite","that Marguerite can","Marguerite can recuperate","can recuperate her","recuperate her wallet","her wallet without","wallet without being","without being piqued","being piqued with","piqued with curiosity","with curiosity about","curiosity about whom","about whom it","whom it was","it was who","was who found","who found it","As they navigate","they navigate the","navigate the social","the social protocols","social protocols of","protocols of giving","of giving and","giving and acknowledging","and acknowledging thanks","acknowledging thanks ,","thanks , turbulence",", turbulence enters","turbulence enters their","enters their otherwise","their otherwise quotidian","otherwise quotidian lives"],"2grams":["A wallet","wallet lost","lost and","and found","found opens","opens the","the door","door to","to romantic","romantic adventure","adventure for","for Georges","Georges and","and Marguerite","After examining","examining the","the ID","ID papers","papers of","of its","its owner","owner ,",", it","it is","is not","not a","a simple","simple matter","matter for","for Georges","Georges to","to turn","turn the","the red","red wallet","wallet he","he found","found in","in to","to the","the police","Nor is","is it","it that","that Marguerite","Marguerite can","can recuperate","recuperate her","her wallet","wallet without","without being","being piqued","piqued with","with curiosity","curiosity about","about whom","whom it","it was","was who","who found","found it","As they","they navigate","navigate the","the social","social protocols","protocols of","of giving","giving and","and acknowledging","acknowledging thanks","thanks ,",", turbulence","turbulence enters","enters their","their otherwise","otherwise quotidian","quotidian lives"]}

{"title":"A Northern Town","plot":"Kempsey is a town haunted by the ghosts of it's past. As the white witnesses to this history have grown old, many have found themselves doing what they never could have imagined: moving in with black people. Yet, at Booroongen Djugun aged care facility, white people and Aboriginal people are living together... and they're talking. A Northern Town peels back more than 100 years of history as the residents of Booroongen - both black and white - relate tales that lay bare the truth of history and break the tragic divisions of the past.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Kempsey","is","a","town","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","it","'s","past",".","As","the","white","wit","to","this","histori","have","grown","old",",","mani","have","found","themselv","do","what","they","never","could","have","imagin",":","move","in","with","black","peopl",".","Yet",",","at","Booroongen","Djugun","age","care","facil",",","white","peopl","and","Aborigin","peopl","are","live","togeth","...","and","they","re","talk",".","A","Northern","Town","peel","back","more","than","100","year","of","histori","as","the","resid","of","Booroongen","-","both","black","and","white","-","relat","tale","that","lay","bare","the","truth","of","histori","and","break","the","tragic","divis","of","the","past","."],"lemmas":["Kempsey","be","a","town","haunt","by","the","ghost","of","it","be","past",".","as","the","white","witness","to","this","history","have","grow","old",",","many","have","find","themselves","do","what","they","never","could","have","imagine",":","move","in","with","black","people",".","yet",",","at","Booroongen","Djugun","aged","care","facility",",","white","people","and","aboriginal","people","be","live","together","...","and","they","be","talk",".","a","Northern","Town","peel","back","more","than","100","year","of","history","as","the","resident","of","Booroongen","-","both","black","and","white","-","relate","tale","that","lay","bare","the","truth","of","history","and","break","the","tragic","division","of","the","past","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Kempsey is a","is a town","a town haunted","town haunted by","haunted by the","by the ghosts","the ghosts of","ghosts of it","of it 's","it 's past","As the white","the white witnesses","white witnesses to","witnesses to this","to this history","this history have","history have grown","have grown old","grown old ,","old , many",", many have","many have found","have found themselves","found themselves doing","themselves doing what","doing what they","what they never","they never could","never could have","could have imagined","have imagined :","imagined : moving",": moving in","moving in with","in with black","with black people","Yet , at",", at Booroongen","at Booroongen Djugun","Booroongen Djugun aged","Djugun aged care","aged care facility","care facility ,","facility , white",", white people","white people and","people and Aboriginal","and Aboriginal people","Aboriginal people are","people are living","are living together","living together ...","together ... and","... and they","and they 're","they 're talking","A Northern Town","Northern Town peels","Town peels back","peels back more","back more than","more than 100","than 100 years","100 years of","years of history","of history as","history as the","as the residents","the residents of","residents of Booroongen","of Booroongen -","Booroongen - both","- both black","both black and","black and white","and white -","white - relate","- relate tales","relate tales that","tales that lay","that lay bare","lay bare the","bare the truth","the truth of","truth of history","of history and","history and break","and break the","break the tragic","the tragic divisions","tragic divisions of","divisions of the","of the past"],"2grams":["Kempsey is","is a","a town","town haunted","haunted by","by the","the ghosts","ghosts of","of it","it 's","'s past","As the","the white","white witnesses","witnesses to","to this","this history","history have","have grown","grown old","old ,",", many","many have","have found","found themselves","themselves doing","doing what","what they","they never","never could","could have","have imagined","imagined :",": moving","moving in","in with","with black","black people","Yet ,",", at","at Booroongen","Booroongen Djugun","Djugun aged","aged care","care facility","facility ,",", white","white people","people and","and Aboriginal","Aboriginal people","people are","are living","living together","together ...","... and","and they","they 're","'re talking","A Northern","Northern Town","Town peels","peels back","back more","more than","than 100","100 years","years of","of history","history as","as the","the residents","residents of","of Booroongen","Booroongen -","- both","both black","black and","and white","white -","- relate","relate tales","tales that","that lay","lay bare","bare the","the truth","truth of","of history","history and","and break","break the","the tragic","tragic divisions","divisions of","of the","the past"]}

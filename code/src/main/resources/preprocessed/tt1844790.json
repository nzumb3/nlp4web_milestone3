{"title":"The Black Dove","plot":"Released after serving an 18 year sentence for a string of compounded criminal charges, country music idol Jake Williams is entering a world he has never known with one objective; finding his legendary Gibson Black Dove guitar. Along the way, Jake flirts with disaster as he falls back into his old hard-living ways until the daughter he has never known reluctantly enters his life. Her presence serves as a catalyst of change as they each learn forgiveness while Jake pursues the Black Dove and ultimately, his dream of playing music again. Jake's life becomes a taxing but rewarding journey as his dreams are gradually realized, not as he intended, but through his daughter's love and the redemptive power of the elusive Black Dove guitar.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Releas","after","serv","an","18","year","sentenc","for","a","string","of","compound","crimin","charg",",","countri","music","idol","Jake","William","is","enter","a","world","he","has","never","known","with","one","object",";","find","his","legendari","Gibson","Black","Dove","guitar",".","Along","the","way",",","Jake","flirt","with","disast","as","he","fall","back","into","his","old","hard-liv","way","until","the","daughter","he","has","never","known","reluct","enter","his","life",".","Her","presenc","serv","as","a","catalyst","of","chang","as","they","each","learn","forgiv","while","Jake","pursu","the","Black","Dove","and","ultim",",","his","dream","of","play","music","again",".","Jake","'s","life","becom","a","tax","but","reward","journey","as","his","dream","are","gradual","realiz",",","not","as","he","intend",",","but","through","his","daughter","'s","love","and","the","redempt","power","of","the","elus","Black","Dove","guitar","."],"lemmas":["release","after","serve","a","18","year","sentence","for","a","string","of","compounded","criminal","charge",",","country","music","idol","Jake","Williams","be","enter","a","world","he","have","never","know","with","one","objective",";","find","he","legendary","Gibson","Black","dove","guitar",".","along","the","way",",","Jake","flirt","with","disaster","as","he","fall","back","into","he","old","hard-living","way","until","the","daughter","he","have","never","know","reluctantly","enter","he","life",".","she","presence","serve","as","a","catalyst","of","change","as","they","each","learn","forgiveness","while","Jake","pursue","the","black","dove","and","ultimately",",","he","dream","of","play","music","again",".","Jake","'s","life","become","a","taxing","but","rewarding","journey","as","he","dream","be","gradually","realize",",","not","as","he","intend",",","but","through","he","daughter","'s","love","and","the","redemptive","power","of","the","elusive","black","dove","guitar","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Released after serving","after serving an","serving an 18","an 18 year","18 year sentence","year sentence for","sentence for a","for a string","a string of","string of compounded","of compounded criminal","compounded criminal charges","criminal charges ,","charges , country",", country music","country music idol","music idol Jake","idol Jake Williams","Jake Williams is","Williams is entering","is entering a","entering a world","a world he","world he has","he has never","has never known","never known with","known with one","with one objective","one objective ;","objective ;

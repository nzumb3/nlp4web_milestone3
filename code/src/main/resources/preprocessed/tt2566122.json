{"title":"Bridge","plot":"A study of three similar but distinct microcultures: the Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge and Williamsburg Bridge. Interrogated through the use of contact microphones, the physical infrastructures of these bridges become audible and reveal their inherent macroacoustics. The film treats the bridge as an anthropological body for discourse, as a physiology of limbs, organs, eyes and ears moving in time.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["A","studi","of","three","similar","but","distinct","microcultur",":","the","Manhattan","Bridg",",","Brooklyn","Bridg","and","Williamsburg","Bridg",".","Interrog","through","the","use","of","contact","microphon",",","the","physic","infrastructur","of","these","bridg","becom","audibl","and","reveal","their","inher","macroacoust",".","The","film","treat","the","bridg","as","an","anthropolog","bodi","for","discours",",","as","a","physiolog","of","limb",",","organ",",","eye","and","ear","move","in","time","."],"lemmas":["a","study","of","three","similar","but","distinct","microculture",":","the","Manhattan","Bridge",",","Brooklyn","Bridge","and","Williamsburg","Bridge",".","interrogate","through","the","use","of","contact","microphone",",","the","physical","infrastructure","of","these","bridge","become","audible","and","reveal","they","inherent","macroacoustic",".","the","film","treat","the","bridge","as","a","anthropological","body","for","discourse",",","as","a","physiology","of","limb",",","organ",",","eye","and","ear","move","in","time","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A study of","study of three","of three similar","three similar but","similar but distinct","but distinct microcultures","distinct microcultures :","microcultures : the",": the Manhattan","the Manhattan Bridge","Manhattan Bridge ,","Bridge , Brooklyn",", Brooklyn Bridge","Brooklyn Bridge and","Bridge and Williamsburg","and Williamsburg Bridge","Interrogated through the","through the use","the use of","use of contact","of contact microphones","contact microphones ,","microphones , the",", the physical","the physical infrastructures","physical infrastructures of","infrastructures of these","of these bridges","these bridges become","bridges become audible","become audible and","audible and reveal","and reveal their","reveal their inherent","their inherent macroacoustics","The film treats","film treats the","treats the bridge","the bridge as","bridge as an","as an anthropological","an anthropological body","anthropological body for","body for discourse","for discourse ,","discourse , as",", as a","as a physiology","a physiology of","physiology of limbs","of limbs ,","limbs , organs",", organs ,","organs , eyes",", eyes and","eyes and ears","and ears moving","ears moving in","moving in time"],"2grams":["A study","study of","of three","three similar","similar but","but distinct","distinct microcultures","microcultures :",": the","the Manhattan","Manhattan Bridge","Bridge ,",", Brooklyn","Brooklyn Bridge","Bridge and","and Williamsburg","Williamsburg Bridge","Interrogated through","through the","the use","use of","of contact","contact microphones","microphones ,",", the","the physical","physical infrastructures","infrastructures of","of these","these bridges","bridges become","become audible","audible and","and reveal","reveal their","their inherent","inherent macroacoustics","The film","film treats","treats the","the bridge","bridge as","as an","an anthropological","anthropological body","body for","for discourse","discourse ,",", as","as a","a physiology","physiology of","of limbs","limbs ,",", organs","organs ,",", eyes","eyes and","and ears","ears moving","moving in","in time"]}

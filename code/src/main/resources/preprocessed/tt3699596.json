{"title":"Liberia: The Secret War","plot":"Deep in the jungles of Liberia and Sierra Leone, a new kind of war is born. Warlords take command. Boys turn into killers. But amidst the chaos, there's a hidden harmony. Part tribal. Part hip-hop. Part Hong Kong action. JuJu they call it. Produced ten years before BLOOD DIAMOND, LIBERIA: THE SECRET WAR focuses on JuJu magic, the life-force Liberians believe gives our world its very meaning. LIBERIA won at the Vues D'Afriques film festival, screened at the Vancouver International Film Festival - and has been used to teach post-colonial theory at the university level.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Deep","in","the","jungl","of","Liberia","and","Sierra","Leon",",","a","new","kind","of","war","is","born",".","Warlord","take","command",".","Boy","turn","into","killer",".","But","amidst","the","chao",",","there","'s","a","hidden","harmoni",".","Part","tribal",".","Part","hip-hop",".","Part","Hong","Kong","action",".","JuJu","they","call","it",".","Produc","ten","year","befor","BLOOD","DIAMOND",",","LIBERIA",":","THE","SECRET","WAR","focus","on","JuJu","magic",",","the","life-forc","Liberian","believ","give","our","world","it","veri","mean",".","LIBERIA","won","at","the","Vue","D'Afriqu","film","festiv",",","screen","at","the","Vancouv","Internat","Film","Festiv","-","and","has","been","use","to","teach","post-coloni","theori","at","the","univers","level","."],"lemmas":["deep","in","the","jungle","of","Liberia","and","Sierra","Leone",",","a","new","kind","of","war","be","bear",".","warlord","take","command",".","boy","turn","into","killer",".","but","amidst","the","chaos",",","there","be","a","hidden","harmony",".","part","tribal",".","part","hip-hop",".","Part","Hong","Kong","action",".","juju","they","call","it",".","produce","ten","year","before","blood","diamond",",","LIBERIA",":","the","secret","war","focus","on","juju","magic",",","the","life-force","Liberians","believe","give","we","world","its","very","meaning",".","LIBERIA","win","at","the","vues","d'afriques","film","festival",",","screen","at","the","Vancouver","International","Film","Festival","-","and","have","be","use","to","teach","post-colonial","theory","at","the","university","level","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Deep in the","in the jungles","the jungles of","jungles of Liberia","of Liberia and","Liberia and Sierra","and Sierra Leone","Sierra Leone ,","Leone , a",", a new","a new kind","new kind of","kind of war","of war is","war is born","Warlords take command","Boys turn into","turn into killers","But amidst the","amidst the chaos","the chaos ,","chaos , there",", there 's","there 's a","'s a hidden","a hidden harmony","Part Hong Kong","Hong Kong action","JuJu they call","they call it","Produced ten years","ten years before","years before BLOOD","before BLOOD DIAMOND","BLOOD DIAMOND ,","DIAMOND , LIBERIA",", LIBERIA :","LIBERIA : THE",": THE SECRET","THE SECRET WAR","SECRET WAR focuses","WAR focuses on","focuses on JuJu","on JuJu magic","JuJu magic ,","magic , the",", the life-force","the life-force Liberians","life-force Liberians believe","Liberians believe gives","believe gives our","gives our world","our world its","world its very","its very meaning","LIBERIA won at","won at the","at the Vues","the Vues D'Afriques","Vues D'Afriques film","D'Afriques film festival","film festival ,","festival , screened",", screened at","screened at the","at the Vancouver","the Vancouver International","Vancouver International Film","International Film Festival","Film Festival -","Festival - and","- and has","and has been","has been used","been used to","used to teach","to teach post-colonial","teach post-colonial theory","post-colonial theory at","theory at the","at the university","the university level"],"2grams":["Deep in","in the","the jungles","jungles of","of Liberia","Liberia and","and Sierra","Sierra Leone","Leone ,",", a","a new","new kind","kind of","of war","war is","is born","Warlords take","take command","Boys turn","turn into","into killers","But amidst","amidst the","the chaos","chaos ,",", there","there 's","'s a","a hidden","hidden harmony","Part tribal","Part hip-hop","Part Hong","Hong Kong","Kong action","JuJu they","they call","call it","Produced ten","ten years","years before","before BLOOD","BLOOD DIAMOND","DIAMOND ,",", LIBERIA","LIBERIA :",": THE","THE SECRET","SECRET WAR","WAR focuses","focuses on","on JuJu","JuJu magic","magic ,",", the","the life-force","life-force Liberians","Liberians believe","believe gives","gives our","our world","world its","its very","very meaning","LIBERIA won","won at","at the","the Vues","Vues D'Afriques","D'Afriques film","film festival","festival ,",", screened","screened at","at the","the Vancouver","Vancouver International","International Film","Film Festival","Festival -","- and","and has","has been","been used","used to","to teach","teach post-colonial","post-colonial theory","theory at","at the","the university","university level"]}

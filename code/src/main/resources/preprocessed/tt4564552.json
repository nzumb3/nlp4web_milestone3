{"title":"Dreams Deferred: Legacy of American Apartheid","plot":"The election of the first African American President, Barack Obama in 2008, was celebrated worldwide. However, the situation of a large part of the African American community still remains outside the 'American Dream' despite decades since the Civil Rights -movement victories. Documentary tells about present day community activists, organizations and individuals. It examines the effect of the prison absence on the community and the family. Documentary gives the viewer a deep understanding of the reality by introducing organizations, such as Roseland Ceasefire, working to prevent street violence, and special schools in youth detention centers. American Director Joe Davidow explores systematic exclusion in the US from a European viewpoint.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["The","elect","of","the","first","African","American","Presid",",","Barack","Obama","in","2008",",","was","celebr","worldwid",".","Howev",",","the","situat","of","a","larg","part","of","the","African","American","communiti","still","remain","outsid","the","'","American","Dream","'","despit","decad","sinc","the","Civil","Right","-","movement","victori",".","Documentari","tell","about","present","day","communiti","activist",",","organ","and","individu",".","It","examin","the","effect","of","the","prison","absenc","on","the","communiti","and","the","famili",".","Documentari","give","the","viewer","a","deep","understand","of","the","realiti","by","introduc","organ",",","such","as","Roseland","Ceasefir",",","work","to","prevent","street","violenc",",","and","special","school","in","youth","detent","center",".","American","Director","Joe","Davidow","explor","systemat","exclus","in","the","US","from","a","European","viewpoint","."],"lemmas":["the","election","of","the","first","African","American","President",",","Barack","Obama","in","2008",",","be","celebrate","worldwide",".","however",",","the","situation","of","a","large","part","of","the","african","american","community","still","remain","outside","the","'","american","dream","'","despite","decade","since","the","Civil","Rights","-","movement","victory",".","documentary","tell","about","present","day","community","activist",",","organization","and","individual",".","it","examine","the","effect","of","the","prison","absence","on","the","community","and","the","family",".","documentary","give","the","viewer","a","deep","understanding","of","the","reality","by","introduce","organization",",","such","as","Roseland","Ceasefire",",","work","to","prevent","street","violence",",","and","special","school","in","youth","detention","center",".","American","Director","Joe","Davidow","explore","systematic","exclusion","in","the","US","from","a","european","viewpoint","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The election of","election of the","of the first","the first African","first African American","African American President","American President ,","President , Barack",", Barack Obama","Barack Obama in","Obama in 2008","in 2008 ,","2008 , was",", was celebrated","was celebrated worldwide","However , the",", the situation","the situation of","situation of a","of a large","a large part","large part of","part of the","of the African","the African American","African American community","American community still","community still remains","still remains outside","remains outside the","outside the '","the ' American","' American Dream","American Dream '","Dream ' despite","' despite decades","despite decades since","decades since the","since the Civil","the Civil Rights","Civil Rights -","Rights -

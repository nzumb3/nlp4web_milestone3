{"title":"Mondovino","plot":"Explores a thesis: that the deep colored, oak-aged taste of Bordeaux wines has become the world standard, following the writing of critic Robert Parker, the magazine \"Wine Spectator,\" the consulting work of Michel Rolland of Pomerol, and the money of Mondavi, a publicly-traded corporation based in Napa with a family history of wine making. Wine makers worldwide, many using Rolland as a consultant, pursue this structure, color, and taste - to the detriment, argue some, of wine that should reflect the character of the land where the grape is grown, including the lighter Burgundy. A few old wine makers, from Aniane, Sardinia, and Argentina offer this argument.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Explore","a","thesi",":","that","the","deep","color",",","oak-ag","tast","of","Bordeaux","wine","has","becom","the","world","standard",",","follow","the","write","of","critic","Robert","Parker",",","the","magazin","\"","Wine","Spectat",",","\"","the","consult","work","of","Michel","Rolland","of","Pomerol",",","and","the","money","of","Mondavi",",","a","publicly-trad","corpor","base","in","Napa","with","a","famili","histori","of","wine","make",".","Wine","maker","worldwid",",","mani","use","Rolland","as","a","consult",",","pursu","this","structur",",","color",",","and","tast","-","to","the","detriment",",","argu","some",",","of","wine","that","should","reflect","the","charact","of","the","land","where","the","grape","is","grown",",","includ","the","lighter","Burgundi",".","A","few","old","wine","maker",",","from","Anian",",","Sardinia",",","and","Argentina","offer","this","argument","."],"lemmas":["explore","a","thesis",":","that","the","deep","colored",",","oak-aged","taste","of","Bordeaux","wine","have","become","the","world","standard",",","follow","the","writing","of","critic","Robert","Parker",",","the","magazine","``","Wine","Spectator",",","''","the","consulting","work","of","Michel","Rolland","of","Pomerol",",","and","the","money","of","Mondavi",",","a","publicly-traded","corporation","base","in","Napa","with","a","family","history","of","wine","making",".","wine","maker","worldwide",",","many","use","Rolland","as","a","consultant",",","pursue","this","structure",",","color",",","and","taste","-","to","the","detriment",",","argue","some",",","of","wine","that","should","reflect","the","character","of","the","land","where","the","grape","be","grow",",","include","the","lighter","Burgundy",".","a","few","old","wine","maker",",","from","Aniane",",","Sardinia",",","and","Argentina","offer","this","argument","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Explores a thesis","a thesis :","thesis : that",": that the","that the deep","the deep colored","deep colored ,","colored , oak-aged",", oak-aged taste","oak-aged taste of","taste of Bordeaux","of Bordeaux wines","Bordeaux wines has","wines has become","has become the","become the world","the world standard","world standard ,","standard , following",", following the","following the writing","the writing of","writing of critic","of critic Robert","critic Robert Parker","Robert Parker ,","Parker , the",", the magazine","the magazine \"","magazine \" Wine","\" Wine Spectator","Wine Spectator ,","Spectator , \"",", \" the","\" the consulting","the consulting work","consulting work of","work of Michel","of Michel Rolland","Michel Rolland of","Rolland of Pomerol","of Pomerol ,","Pomerol , and",", and the","and the money","the money of","money of Mondavi","of Mondavi ,","Mondavi , a",", a publicly-traded","a publicly-traded corporation","publicly-traded corporation based","corporation based in","based in Napa","in Napa with","Napa with a","with a family","a family history","family history of","history of wine","of wine making","Wine makers worldwide","makers worldwide ,","worldwide , many",", many using","many using Rolland","using Rolland as","Rolland as a","as a consultant","a consultant ,","consultant , pursue",", pursue this","pursue this structure","this structure ,","structure , color",", color ,","color , and",", and taste","and taste -","taste -

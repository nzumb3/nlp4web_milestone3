{"title":"Sic Transit Gloria","plot":"The year was 1965. A year prior, the Beatles had made their tremendous debut on the Ed Sullivan Show, igniting the British Invasion and prompting the emergence of bands all over the United States. 63% of all kids under 20 were in a band. Most teens wanted to be like the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Animals, etc. They had the drive to pick up an instrument, get together and create songs with a powerful and expressive delivery, but never entered the musical mainstream. This is the story of the very lucky ones.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"," History"],"stems":["The","year","was","1965",".","A","year","prior",",","the","Beatl","had","made","their","tremend","debut","on","the","Ed","Sullivan","Show",",","ignit","the","British","Invasion","and","prompt","the","emerg","of","band","all","over","the","Unite","State",".","63","%","of","all","kid","under","20","were","in","a","band",".","Most","teen","want","to","be","like","the","Beatl",",","the","Roll","Stone",",","the","Animal",",","etc",".","They","had","the","drive","to","pick","up","an","instrument",",","get","togeth","and","creat","song","with","a","power","and","express","deliveri",",","but","never","enter","the","music","mainstream",".","This","is","the","stori","of","the","veri","lucki","one","."],"lemmas":["the","year","be","1965",".","a","year","prior",",","the","Beatles","have","make","they","tremendous","debut","on","the","Ed","Sullivan","Show",",","ignite","the","British","Invasion","and","prompt","the","emergence","of","band","all","over","the","United","States",".","63","%","of","all","kid","under","20","be","in","a","band",".","most","teens","want","to","be","like","the","Beatles",",","the","Rolling","Stones",",","the","Animals",",","etc",".","they","have","the","drive","to","pick","up","a","instrument",",","get","together","and","create","song","with","a","powerful","and","expressive","delivery",",","but","never","enter","the","musical","mainstream",".","this","be","the","story","of","the","very","lucky","one","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The year was","year was 1965","A year prior","year prior ,","prior , the",", the Beatles","the Beatles had","Beatles had made","had made their","made their tremendous","their tremendous debut","tremendous debut on","debut on the","on the Ed","the Ed Sullivan","Ed Sullivan Show","Sullivan Show ,","Show , igniting",", igniting the","igniting the British","the British Invasion","British Invasion and","Invasion and prompting","and prompting the","prompting the emergence","the emergence of","emergence of bands","of bands all","bands all over","all over the","over the United","the United States","63 % of","% of all","of all kids","all kids under","kids under 20","under 20 were","20 were in","were in a","in a band","Most teens wanted","teens wanted to","wanted to be","to be like","be like the","like the Beatles","the Beatles ,","Beatles , the",", the Rolling","the Rolling Stones","Rolling Stones ,","Stones , the",", the Animals","the Animals ,","Animals , etc","They had the","had the drive","the drive to","drive to pick","to pick up","pick up an","up an instrument","an instrument ,","instrument , get",", get together","get together and","together and create","and create songs","create songs with","songs with a","with a powerful","a powerful and","powerful and expressive","and expressive delivery","expressive delivery ,","delivery , but",", but never","but never entered","never entered the","entered the musical","the musical mainstream","This is the","is the story","the story of","story of the","of the very","the very lucky","very lucky ones"],"2grams":["The year","year was","was 1965","A year","year prior","prior ,",", the","the Beatles","Beatles had","had made","made their","their tremendous","tremendous debut","debut on","on the","the Ed","Ed Sullivan","Sullivan Show","Show ,",", igniting","igniting the","the British","British Invasion","Invasion and","and prompting","prompting the","the emergence","emergence of","of bands","bands all","all over","over the","the United","United States","63 %","% of","of all","all kids","kids under","under 20","20 were","were in","in a","a band","Most teens","teens wanted","wanted to","to be","be like","like the","the Beatles","Beatles ,",", the","the Rolling","Rolling Stones","Stones ,",", the","the Animals","Animals ,",", etc","They had","had the","the drive","drive to","to pick","pick up","up an","an instrument","instrument ,",", get","get together","together and","and create","create songs","songs with","with a","a powerful","powerful and","and expressive","expressive delivery","delivery ,",", but","but never","never entered","entered the","the musical","musical mainstream","This is","is the","the story","story of","of the","the very","very lucky","lucky ones"]}

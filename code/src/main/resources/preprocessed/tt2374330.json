{"title":"Set for Life","plot":"Three Baby Boomers, who believed they were set for life, struggle to recover from the devastating impact of losing their jobs in the Great Recession. Now older than 50, they strive to hang onto their homes, health insurance and hope. Experts, animated info graphics and brief clips from additional unemployed boomers across the United States set the three main characters' stories in a broader national context. They each find a way to cope with the drastic effects of unemployment on their lives, but their futures are no longer secure, and they have lost their confidence in the American Dream.","genres":["Documentary","

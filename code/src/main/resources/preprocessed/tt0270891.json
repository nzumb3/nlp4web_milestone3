{"title":"Costa!","plot":"This movie follows the popular formula of the homonymous Dutch-Flemish TV series, and includes most of its main characters, either from the previous or the following seasons. On their first-ever holiday with her sister Angela and their arrogant friends Joyce and Maureen, at the beach in Spain (hence the title) the outspoken Janet meets Rens, who since a few years works there, rooming with his colleagues Tommy, Bjorn and Frida and 'wanna-be propper' Bart, as sexy 'propper' for the popular disco 'Costa!' - the job is to lure in customers by their sex appeal. The rivaling club 'Empire' looks set to win a dance competition, and with it too much clientèle. Rens soon falls for Janet, causing consternation and jealousy, but they need the couple as their best dancers. As usual the competition resorts to dirty tricks, but is beaten in the end.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["This","movi","follow","the","popular","formula","of","the","homonym","Dutch-Flemish","TV","seri",",","and","includ","most","of","it","main","charact",",","either","from","the","previous","or","the","follow","season",".","On","their","first-ev","holiday","with","her","sister","Angela","and","their","arrog","friend","Joyc","and","Maureen",",","at","the","beach","in","Spain","(","henc","the","titl",")","the","outspoken","Janet","meet","Ren",",","who","sinc","a","few","year","work","there",",","room","with","his","colleagu","Tommi",",","Bjorn","and","Frida","and","'","wanna-b","propper","'","Bart",",","as","sexi","'","propper","'","for","the","popular","disco","'","Costa","!","'","-","the","job","is","to","lure","in","custom","by","their","sex","appeal",".","The","rival","club","Em","pire","'","look","set","to","win","a","danc","competit",",","and","with","it","too","much","clientèl",".","Ren","soon","fall","for","Janet",",","caus","constern","and","jealousi",",","but","they","need","the","coupl","as","their","best","dancer",".","As","usual","the","competit","resort","to","dirti","trick",",","but","is","beaten","in","the","end","."],"lemmas":["this","movie","follow","the","popular","formula","of","the","homonymous","dutch-flemish","tv","series",",","and","include","most","of","its","main","character",",","either","from","the","previous","or","the","following","season",".","on","they","first-ever","holiday","with","she","sister","Angela","and","they","arrogant","friend","Joyce","and","Maureen",",","at","the","beach","in","Spain","-lrb-","hence","the","title","-rrb-","the","outspoken","Janet","meet","ren",",","who","since","a","few","year","work","there",",","room","with","he","colleague","Tommy",",","Bjorn","and","Frida","and","'","wanna-be","propper","'","Bart",",","as","sexy","'","propper","'","for","the","popular","disco","'","Costa","!","'","-","the","job","be","to","lure","in","customer","by","they","sex","appeal",".","the","rival","club","'Em","pire","'","look","set","to","win","a","dance","competition",",","and","with","it","too","much","clientèle",".","ren","soon","fall","for","Janet",",","cause","consternation","and","jealousy",",","but","they","need","the","couple","as","they","best","dancer",".","as","usual","the","competition","resort","to","dirty","trick",",","but","be","beat","in","the","end","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This movie follows","movie follows the","follows the popular","the popular formula","popular formula of","formula of the","of the homonymous","the homonymous Dutch-Flemish","homonymous Dutch-Flemish TV","Dutch-Flemish TV series","TV series ,","series , and",", and includes","and includes most","includes most of","most of its","of its main","its main characters","main characters ,","characters , either",", either from","either from the","from the previous","the previous or","previous or the","or the following","the following seasons","On their first-ever","their first-ever holiday","first-ever holiday with","holiday with her","with her sister","her sister Angela","sister Angela and","Angela and their","and their arrogant","their arrogant friends","arrogant friends Joyce","friends Joyce and","Joyce and Maureen","and Maureen ,","Maureen , at",", at the","at the beach","the beach in","beach in Spain","in Spain (","Spain ( hence","( hence the","hence the title","the title )","title ) the",") the outspoken","the outspoken Janet","outspoken Janet meets","Janet meets Rens","meets Rens ,","Rens , who",", who since","who since a","since a few","a few years","few years works","years works there","works there ,","there , rooming",", rooming with","rooming with his","with his colleagues","his colleagues Tommy","colleagues Tommy ,","Tommy , Bjorn",", Bjorn and","Bjorn and Frida","and Frida and","Frida and '","and ' wanna-be","' wanna-be propper","wanna-be propper '","propper ' Bart","' Bart ,","Bart , as",", as sexy","as sexy '","sexy ' propper","' propper '","propper ' for","' for the","for the popular","the popular disco","popular disco '","disco ' Costa","' Costa !","Costa !

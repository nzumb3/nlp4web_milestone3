{"title":"Melodrama Lo-Fi","plot":"Aida, a young woman from the southern chilean town of Hornopiren, who has just arrived in Santiago, finds work as a housekeeper in a house shared by a mother and her daughter. They share a dysfunctional relationship constantly marred by a painful family loss. Aida is quiet, observant, always engrossed in her own thoughts and displaying behavior that at times borders on childish. She doesn't interact with anyone, until one day she happens to meet Michel, a young deaf-mute man who delivers mail on his motorcycle. A strong bond forms between these two outcasts as they figure out a special way to communicate on their outings through different corners of the city. Their ability to be amazed is rich and never-ending. But, sooner or later, fate and society will force Aida to come to terms with herself and become a part of the world she's been running from.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Aida",",","a","young","woman","from","the","southern","chilean","town","of","Hornopiren",",","who","has","just","arriv","in","Santiago",",","find","work","as","a","housekeep","in","a","hous","share","by","a","mother","and","her","daughter",".","They","share","a","dysfunct","relationship","constant","mar","by","a","pain","famili","loss",".","Aida","is","quiet",",","observ",",","alway","engross","in","her","own","thought","and","display","behavior","that","at","time","border","on","childish",".","She","doe","n't","interact","with","anyon",",","until","one","day","she","happen","to","meet","Michel",",","a","young","deaf-mut","man","who","deliv","mail","on","his","motorcycl",".","A","strong","bond","form","between","these","two","outcast","as","they","figur","out","a","special","way","to","communic","on","their","outing","through","differ","corner","of","the","citi",".","Their","abil","to","be","amaz","is","rich","and","never-end",".","But",",","sooner","or","later",",","fate","and","societi","will","forc","Aida","to","come","to","term","with","herself","and","becom","a","part","of","the","world","she","'s","been","run","from","."],"lemmas":["Aida",",","a","young","woman","from","the","southern","chilean","town","of","Hornopiren",",","who","have","just","arrive","in","Santiago",",","find","work","as","a","housekeeper","in","a","house","share","by","a","mother","and","she","daughter",".","they","share","a","dysfunctional","relationship","constantly","mar","by","a","painful","family","loss",".","Aida","be","quiet",",","observant",",","always","engross","in","she","own","thought","and","display","behavior","that","at","time","border","on","childish",".","she","do","not","interact","with","anyone",",","until","one","day","she","happen","to","meet","Michel",",","a","young","deaf-mute","man","who","deliver","mail","on","he","motorcycle",".","a","strong","bond","form","between","these","two","outcast","as","they","figure","out","a","special","way","to","communicate","on","they","outing","through","different","corner","of","the","city",".","they","ability","to","be","amaze","be","rich","and","never-ending",".","but",",","sooner","or","later",",","fate","and","society","will","force","Aida","to","come","to","term","with","herself","and","become","a","part","of","the","world","she","be","be","run","from","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Aida

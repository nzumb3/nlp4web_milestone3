{"title":"Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century","plot":"Critics place Berenice Abbott at the head of her class. She was one of the greatest American photographers of the 20th Century. From her portraits of the avant-garde taken in Paris during the 1920's, to her documentation of New York in the 1930's, to her science photography of the 1950s, and her studies of small-town America, Abbott's genius is in the incredible range of her work. Filmed during her 91st and 92nd years, the open-hearted Abbott takes us on a guided tour of her century. The tour teaches history, perseverance, courage, and single-minded dedication to one's chosen field. A brilliant film about a brilliant American artist!","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Critic","place","Berenic","Abbott","at","the","head","of","her","class",".","She","was","one","of","the","greatest","American","photograph","of","the","20th","Centuri",".","From","her","portrait","of","the","avant-gard","taken","in","Pari","dure","the","1920","'s",",","to","her","document","of","New","York","in","the","1930","'s",",","to","her","scienc","photographi","of","the","1950s",",","and","her","studi","of","small-town","America",",","Abbott","'s","genius","is","in","the","incred","rang","of","her","work",".","Film","dure","her","91st","and","92nd","year",",","the","open-heart","Abbott","take","us","on","a","guid","tour","of","her","centuri",".","The","tour","teach","histori",",","persever",",","courag",",","and","single-mind","dedic","to","one","'s","chosen","field",".","A","brilliant","film","about","a","brilliant","American","artist","!"],"lemmas":["critic","place","Berenice","Abbott","at","the","head","of","she","class",".","she","be","one","of","the","greatest","american","photographer","of","the","20th","Century",".","from","she","portrait","of","the","avant-garde","take","in","Paris","during","the","1920","'s",",","to","she","documentation","of","New","York","in","the","1930","'s",",","to","she","science","photography","of","the","1950",",","and","she","study","of","small-town","America",",","Abbott","'s","genius","be","in","the","incredible","range","of","she","work",".","film","during","she","91st","and","92nd","year",",","the","open-hearted","Abbott","take","we","on","a","guide","tour","of","she","century",".","the","tour","teach","history",",","perseverance",",","courage",",","and","single-minded","dedication","to","one","'s","chosen","field",".","a","brilliant","film","about","a","brilliant","american","artist","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Critics

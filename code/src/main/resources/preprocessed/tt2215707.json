{"title":"Uprising: Hip Hop and the LA Riots","plot":"20 years after riots ripped through Los Angeles, \"Uprising\" documents how hip hop forecasted -- and some say ignited -- the worst civil unrest of the 20th century. The film revisits the riots in gripping detail and draws from a diverse collection of voices -- the rappers, rioters, victims, police officers, journalists and everyday citizens of South Central Los Angeles. The documentary traces the rise of dissent in Los Angeles in the 80's and 90's and explores why citizens chose to rise up violently against police abuse and perceived injustices.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["20","year","after","riot","rip","through","Los","Angele",",","\"","Uprise","\"","document","how","hip","hop","forecast","--","and","some","say","ignit","--","the","worst","civil","unrest","of","the","20th","centuri",".","The","film","revisit","the","riot","in","grip","detail","and","draw","from","a","divers","collect","of","voic","--","the","rapper",",","rioter",",","victim",",","polic","offic",",","journalist","and","everyday","citizen","of","South","Central","Los","Angele",".","The","documentari","trace","the","rise","of","dissent","in","Los","Angele","in","the","80","'s","and","90","'s","and","explor","whi","citizen","chose","to","rise","up","violent","against","polic","abus","and","perceiv","injustic","."],"lemmas":["20","year","after","riot","rip","through","Los","Angeles",",","``","Uprising","''","document","how","hip","hop","forecast","--","and","some","say","ignite","--","the","worst","civil","unrest","of","the","20th","century",".","the","film","revisit","the","riot","in","grip","detail","and","draw","from","a","diverse","collection","of","voice","--","the","rapper",",","rioter",",","victim",",","police","officer",",","journalist","and","everyday","citizen","of","South","Central","Los","Angeles",".","the","documentary","trace","the","rise","of","dissent","in","Los","Angeles","in","the","80","'s","and","90","'s","and","explore","why","citizen","choose","to","rise","up","violently","against","police","abuse","and","perceive","injustice","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["20 years after","years after riots","after riots ripped","riots ripped through","ripped through Los","through Los Angeles","Los Angeles ,","Angeles , \"",", \" Uprising","\" Uprising \"","Uprising \" documents","\" documents how","documents how hip","how hip hop","hip hop forecasted","hop forecasted --","forecasted -- and","-- and some","and some say","some say ignited","say ignited --","ignited -- the","-- the worst","the worst civil","worst civil unrest","civil unrest of","unrest of the","of the 20th","the 20th century","The film revisits","film revisits the","revisits the riots","the riots in","riots in gripping","in gripping detail","gripping detail and","detail and draws","and draws from","draws from a","from a diverse","a diverse collection","diverse collection of","collection of voices","of voices --","voices -- the","-- the rappers","the rappers ,","rappers , rioters",", rioters ,","rioters , victims",", victims ,","victims , police",", police officers","police officers ,","officers , journalists",", journalists and","journalists and everyday","and everyday citizens","everyday citizens of","citizens of South","of South Central","South Central Los","Central Los Angeles","The documentary traces","documentary traces the","traces the rise","the rise of","rise of dissent","of dissent in","dissent in Los","in Los Angeles","Los Angeles in","Angeles in the","in the 80","the 80 's","80 's and","'s and 90","and 90 's","90 's and","'s and explores","and explores why","explores why citizens","why citizens chose","citizens chose to","chose to rise","to rise up","rise up violently","up violently against","violently against police","against police abuse","police abuse and","abuse and perceived","and perceived injustices"],"2grams":["20 years","years after","after riots","riots ripped","ripped through","through Los","Los Angeles","Angeles ,",", \"","\" Uprising","Uprising \"","\" documents","documents how","how hip","hip hop","hop forecasted","forecasted --","-- and","and some","some say","say ignited","ignited --","-- the","the worst","worst civil","civil unrest","unrest of","of the","the 20th","20th century","The film","film revisits","revisits the","the riots","riots in","in gripping","gripping detail","detail and","and draws","draws from","from a","a diverse","diverse collection","collection of","of voices","voices --","-- the","the rappers","rappers ,",", rioters","rioters ,",", victims","victims ,",", police","police officers","officers ,",", journalists","journalists and","and everyday","everyday citizens","citizens of","of South","South Central","Central Los","Los Angeles","The documentary","documentary traces","traces the","the rise","rise of","of dissent","dissent in","in Los","Los Angeles","Angeles in","in the","the 80","80 's","'s and","and 90","90 's","'s and","and explores","explores why","why citizens","citizens chose","chose to","to rise","rise up","up violently","violently against","against police","police abuse","abuse and","and perceived","perceived injustices"]}

{"title":"Three Boys from Pasadena: A Tribute to Helmut Newton","plot":"Follow the friendship and mentorship between Helmut Newton and his \"three boys\", proteges, Mark Arbeit, George Holz, and Just Loomis through a remarkable relationship that spanned over 30 years. Directed and edited by Joey Carey, and produced by Arbeit, Holz, and Loomis, the film offers a rare glimpse into the private world behind the scenes of this iconic and generous photographer, his wife June, and the three photographers. The film is historical, personal, and at times, surprisingly emotional, exhibiting the dream so many artists are never able to grasp: a lifelong mentorship relationship that goes beyond life itself, continuing in the ongoing and celebrated work of each photographer. This quietly understated documentary illustrates such a relationship, with Helmut's widow, June, very much at its heart.","genres":["Biography","

{"title":"Dance of the Dead","plot":"It is prom night in middle America. Tuxes have been rented and dresses have been bought. But when the dead unexpectedly rise from their graves to eat the living, it's up to the geeks, the nerds, the outcast and the losers who couldn't get dates to the dance to save the town from the undead. Unlikely heroes will rise to the challenge as they are forced to put aside their differences and band together to fight for their lives. Armed with bats, sledgehammers, garden tools and guitars, this rag-tag group of high-school teens are in for a prom night they will never forget.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"],"stems":["It","is","prom","night","in","middl","America",".","Tux","have","been","rent","and","dress","have","been","bought",".","But","when","the","dead","unexpect","rise","from","their","grave","to","eat","the","live",",","it","'s","up","to","the","geek",",","the","nerd",",","the","outcast","and","the","loser","who","could","n't","get","date","to","the","danc","to","save","the","town","from","the","undead",".","Unlike","hero","will","rise","to","the","challeng","as","they","are","forc","to","put","asid","their","differ","and","band","togeth","to","fight","for","their","live",".","Armed","with","bat",",","sledgehamm",",","garden","tool","and","guitar",",","this","rag-tag","group","of","high-school","teen","are","in","for","a","prom","night","they","will","never","forget","."],"lemmas":["it","be","prom","night","in","middle","America",".","tux","have","be","rent","and","dress","have","be","buy",".","but","when","the","dead","unexpectedly","rise","from","they","grave","to","eat","the","living",",","it","be","up","to","the","geek",",","the","nerd",",","the","outcast","and","the","loser","who","could","not","get","date","to","the","dance","to","save","the","town","from","the","undead",".","unlikely","hero","will","rise","to","the","challenge","as","they","be","force","to","put","aside","they","difference","and","band","together","to","fight","for","they","life",".","arm","with","bat",",","sledgehammer",",","garden","tool","and","guitar",",","this","rag-tag","group","of","high-school","teens","be","in","for","a","prom","night","they","will","never","forget","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["It is prom","is prom night","prom night in","night in middle","in middle America","Tuxes have been","have been rented","been rented and","rented and dresses","and dresses have","dresses have been","have been bought","But when the","when the dead","the dead unexpectedly","dead unexpectedly rise","unexpectedly rise from","rise from their","from their graves","their graves to","graves to eat","to eat the","eat the living","the living ,","living , it",", it 's","it 's up","'s up to","up to the","to the geeks","the geeks ,","geeks , the",", the nerds","the nerds ,","nerds , the",", the outcast","the outcast and","outcast and the","and the losers","the losers who","losers who could","who could n't","could n't get","n't get dates","get dates to","dates to the","to the dance","the dance to","dance to save","to save the","save the town","the town from","town from the","from the undead","Unlikely heroes will","heroes will rise","will rise to","rise to the","to the challenge","the challenge as","challenge as they","as they are","they are forced","are forced to","forced to put","to put aside","put aside their","aside their differences","their differences and","differences and band","and band together","band together to","together to fight","to fight for","fight for their","for their lives","Armed with bats","with bats ,","bats , sledgehammers",", sledgehammers ,","sledgehammers , garden",", garden tools","garden tools and","tools and guitars","and guitars ,","guitars , this",", this rag-tag","this rag-tag group","rag-tag group of","group of high-school","of high-school teens","high-school teens are","teens are in","are in for","in for a","for a prom","a prom night","prom night they","night they will","they will never","will never forget"],"2grams":["It is","is prom","prom night","night in","in middle","middle America","Tuxes have","have been","been rented","rented and","and dresses","dresses have","have been","been bought","But when","when the","the dead","dead unexpectedly","unexpectedly rise","rise from","from their","their graves","graves to","to eat","eat the","the living","living ,",", it","it 's","'s up","up to","to the","the geeks","geeks ,",", the","the nerds","nerds ,",", the","the outcast","outcast and","and the","the losers","losers who","who could","could n't","n't get","get dates","dates to","to the","the dance","dance to","to save","save the","the town","town from","from the","the undead","Unlikely heroes","heroes will","will rise","rise to","to the","the challenge","challenge as","as they","they are","are forced","forced to","to put","put aside","aside their","their differences","differences and","and band","band together","together to","to fight","fight for","for their","their lives","Armed with","with bats","bats ,",", sledgehammers","sledgehammers ,",", garden","garden tools","tools and","and guitars","guitars ,",", this","this rag-tag","rag-tag group","group of","of high-school","high-school teens","teens are","are in","in for","for a","a prom","prom night","night they","they will","will never","never forget"]}

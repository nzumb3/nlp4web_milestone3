{"title":"Silvestre Pantale√≥n","plot":"The story of an elderly man from the Nahuatl-speaking village of San Agustin Oapan, Guerrero, Mexico. Told with a lyrical combination of lingering imagery and ethnographic detail, 'Silvestre Pantaleon' follows the protagonist as he struggles to pay for a curing ceremony and provide for his family. He dedicates himself to the only remunerative activities he knows: handcrafting rope for religious ceremonies and building seldom-used household objects that he alone still has the skills to produce. 'Silvestre Pantaleon' is a simple though universal tale of aging. It suggests both triumph (the household provided for and health recovered--through offerings to the hearth, the earth, the river, and the deceased) and reversal (the recognition that healing is but an ephemeral hiatus in the inexorable advance of time).","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","stori","of","an","elder","man","from","the","Nahuatl-speak","villag","of","San","Agustin","Oapan",",","Guerrero",",","Mexico",".","Told","with","a","lyric","combin","of","linger","imageri","and","ethnograph","detail",",","'","Silvestr","Pantaleon","'","follow","the","protagonist","as","he","struggl","to","pay","for","a","cure","ceremoni","and","provid","for","his","famili",".","He","dedic","himself","to","the","onli","remun","activ","he","know",":","handcraft","rope","for","religi","ceremoni","and","build","seldom-us","household","object","that","he","alon","still","has","the","skill","to","produc",".","'","Silvestr","Pantaleon","'","is","a","simpl","though","univers","tale","of","age",".","It","suggest","both","triumph","(","the","household","provid","for","and","health","recov","--","through","offer","to","the","hearth",",","the","earth",",","the","river",",","and","the","deceas",")","and","revers","(","the","recognit","that","heal","is","but","an","ephemer","hiatus","in","the","inexor","advanc","of","time",")","."],"lemmas":["the","story","of","a","elderly","man","from","the","nahuatl-speaking","village","of","San","Agustin","Oapan",",","Guerrero",",","Mexico",".","tell","with","a","lyrical","combination","of","linger","imagery","and","ethnographic","detail",",","'","Silvestre","Pantaleon","'","follow","the","protagonist","as","he","struggle","to","pay","for","a","cure","ceremony","and","provide","for","he","family",".","he","dedicate","himself","to","the","only","remunerative","activity","he","know",":","handcraft","rope","for","religious","ceremony","and","build","seldom-used","household","object","that","he","alone","still","have","the","skill","to","produce",".","'","Silvestre","Pantaleon","'","be","a","simple","though","universal","tale","of","aging",".","it","suggest","both","triumph","-lrb-","the","household","provide","for","and","health","recover","--","through","offering","to","the","hearth",",","the","earth",",","the","river",",","and","the","deceased","-rrb-","and","reversal","-lrb-","the","recognition","that","healing","be","but","a","ephemeral","hiatus","in","the","inexorable","advance","of","time","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The story of","story of an","of an elderly","an elderly man","elderly man from","man from the","from the Nahuatl-speaking","the Nahuatl-speaking village","Nahuatl-speaking village of","village of San","of San Agustin","San Agustin Oapan","Agustin Oapan ,","Oapan , Guerrero",", Guerrero ,","Guerrero , Mexico","Told with a","with a lyrical","a lyrical combination","lyrical combination of","combination of lingering","of lingering imagery","lingering imagery and","imagery and ethnographic","and ethnographic detail","ethnographic detail ,","detail , '",", ' Silvestre","' Silvestre Pantaleon","Silvestre Pantaleon '","Pantaleon ' follows","' follows the","follows the protagonist","the protagonist as","protagonist as he","as he struggles","he struggles to","struggles to pay","to pay for","pay for a","for a curing","a curing ceremony","curing ceremony and","ceremony and provide","and provide for","provide for his","for his family","He dedicates himself","dedicates himself to","himself to the","to the only","the only remunerative","only remunerative activities","remunerative activities he","activities he knows","he knows :","knows : handcrafting",": handcrafting rope","handcrafting rope for","rope for religious","for religious ceremonies","religious ceremonies and","ceremonies and building","and building seldom-used","building seldom-used household","seldom-used household objects","household objects that","objects that he","that he alone","he alone still","alone still has","still has the","has the skills","the skills to","skills to produce","to produce .","produce .

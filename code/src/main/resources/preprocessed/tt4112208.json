{"title":"Kuttram Kadithal","plot":"Merlin (Radhika Prasiddha) is a newly married school teacher, who is about to start a fresh lease of life with her soul mate, Manikandan ( Sai Rajkumar). As the couple belongs to different community, it's quite obvious that Merlin's mom is not willing to accept her. On her first day at school, Merlin accepts to substitute one of her colleague but unfortunately that particular decision turns her life upside down as she beats a naughty student, Chezhiyan (Master Ajay), who collapses and goes into coma. Chezhiyan's mom (Sathya) is a single parent and auto driver, his uncle Udayan (Pavel Navageethan) is a communist, who can't tolerate and fight back against the carelessness of the rich.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Merlin","(","Radhika","Prasiddha",")","is","a","newli","marri","school","teacher",",","who","is","about","to","start","a","fresh","leas","of","life","with","her","soul","mate",",","Manikandan","(","Sai","Rajkumar",")",".","As","the","coupl","belong","to","differ","communiti",",","it","'s","quit","obvious","that","Merlin","'s","mom","is","not","will","to","accept","her",".","On","her","first","day","at","school",",","Merlin","accept","to","substitut","one","of","her","colleagu","but","unfortun","that","particular","decis","turn","her","life","upsid","down","as","she","beat","a","naughti","student",",","Chezhiyan","(","Master","Ajay",")",",","who","collaps","and","goe","into","coma",".","Chezhiyan","'s","mom","(","Sathya",")","is","a","singl","parent","and","auto","driver",",","his","uncl","Udayan","(","Pavel","Navageethan",")","is","a","communist",",","who","ca","n't","toler","and","fight","back","against","the","careless","of","the","rich","."],"lemmas":["Merlin","-lrb-","Radhika","Prasiddha","-rrb-","be","a","newly","marry","school","teacher",",","who","be","about","to","start","a","fresh","lease","of","life","with","she","soul","mate",",","Manikandan","-lrb-","Sai","Rajkumar","-rrb-",".","as","the","couple","belong","to","different","community",",","it","be","quite","obvious","that","Merlin","'s","mom","be","not","willing","to","accept","she",".","on","she","first","day","at","school",",","Merlin","accept","to","substitute","one","of","she","colleague","but","unfortunately","that","particular","decision","turn","she","life","upside","down","as","she","beat","a","naughty","student",",","Chezhiyan","-lrb-","Master","Ajay","-rrb-",",","who","collapse","and","go","into","coma",".","Chezhiyan","'s","mom","-lrb-","sathya","-rrb-","be","a","single","parent","and","auto","driver",",","he","uncle","Udayan","-lrb-","Pavel","Navageethan","-rrb-","be","a","communist",",","who","can","not","tolerate","and","fight","back","against","the","carelessness","of","the","rich","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Merlin

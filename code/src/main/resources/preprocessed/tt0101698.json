{"title":"Defending Your Life","plot":"Yuppie Daniel Miller is killed in a car accident and goes to Judgment City, a waiting room for the afterlife. During the day, he must prove in a courtroom-style process that he successfully overcame his fears (a hard task, given the pitiful life we are shown); at night, he falls in love with Julia, the only other young person in town. Nights are a time of hedonistic pleasure, since you can (for instance) eat all you want without getting fat.","genres":["Comedy"," Fantasy"," Drama"],"stems":["Yuppi","Daniel","Miller","is","kill","in","a","car","accid","and","goe","to","Judgment","Citi",",","a","wait","room","for","the","afterlif",".","Dure","the","day",",","he","must","prove","in","a","courtroom-styl","process","that","he","success","overcam","his","fear","(","a","hard","task",",","given","the","piti","life","we","are","shown",")",";","at","night",",","he","fall","in","love","with","Julia",",","the","onli","other","young","person","in","town",".","Night","are","a","time","of","hedonist","pleasur",",","sinc","you","can","(","for","instanc",")","eat","all","you","want","without","get","fat","."],"lemmas":["Yuppie","Daniel","Miller","be","kill","in","a","car","accident","and","go","to","Judgment","City",",","a","wait","room","for","the","afterlife",".","during","the","day",",","he","must","prove","in","a","courtroom-style","process","that","he","successfully","overcome","he","fear","-lrb-","a","hard","task",",","give","the","pitiful","life","we","be","show","-rrb-",";","at","night",",","he","fall","in","love","with","Julia",",","the","only","other","young","person","in","town",".","Nights","be","a","time","of","hedonistic","pleasure",",","since","you","can","-lrb-","for","instance","-rrb-","eat","all","you","want","without","get","fat","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Yuppie Daniel Miller","Daniel Miller is","Miller is killed","is killed in","killed in a","in a car","a car accident","car accident and","accident and goes","and goes to","goes to Judgment","to Judgment City","Judgment City ,","City , a",", a waiting","a waiting room","waiting room for","room for the","for the afterlife","During the day","the day ,","day , he",", he must","he must prove","must prove in","prove in a","in a courtroom-style","a courtroom-style process","courtroom-style process that","process that he","that he successfully","he successfully overcame","successfully overcame his","overcame his fears","his fears (","fears ( a","( a hard","a hard task","hard task ,","task , given",", given the","given the pitiful","the pitiful life","pitiful life we","life we are","we are shown","are shown )","shown ) ;",") ; at","; at night","at night ,","night , he",", he falls","he falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with Julia","with Julia ,","Julia , the",", the only","the only other","only other young","other young person","young person in","person in town","Nights are a","are a time","a time of","time of hedonistic","of hedonistic pleasure","hedonistic pleasure ,","pleasure , since",", since you","since you can","you can (","can ( for","( for instance","for instance )","instance ) eat",") eat all","eat all you","all you want","you want without","want without getting","without getting fat"],"2grams":["Yuppie Daniel","Daniel Miller","Miller is","is killed","killed in","in a","a car","car accident","accident and","and goes","goes to","to Judgment","Judgment City","City ,",", a","a waiting","waiting room","room for","for the","the afterlife","During the","the day","day ,",", he","he must","must prove","prove in","in a","a courtroom-style","courtroom-style process","process that","that he","he successfully","successfully overcame","overcame his","his fears","fears (","( a","a hard","hard task","task ,",", given","given the","the pitiful","pitiful life","life we","we are","are shown","shown )",") ;","; at","at night","night ,",", he","he falls","falls in","in love","love with","with Julia","Julia ,",", the","the only","only other","other young","young person","person in","in town","Nights are","are a","a time","time of","of hedonistic","hedonistic pleasure","pleasure ,",", since","since you","you can","can (","( for","for instance","instance )",") eat","eat all","all you","you want","want without","without getting","getting fat"]}

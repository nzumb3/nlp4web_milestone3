{"title":"From Russia to Hollywood: The 100-Year Odyssey of Chekhov and Shdanoff","plot":"Several of the interviews in this documentary were filmed at a symposium about the career and biography of Michael Chekhov, which was held in the US in the 1990s. The participants in the symposium shared their memories about being taught by, or working with, the late, great actor, director, and drama coach, Russian-born Chekhov (1891-1955), who was the nephew of the Russian writer Anton Chekhov (1860-1904). Many film clips, plus some rare stills of Chekhov & Shdanoff themselves, are added, to illustrate the interviews and commentaries. One of the participants, actress Mala Powers, is mentioned in the film's credits also as executor of Michael Chekhov's estate & foundation, and undoubtedly played an important role in getting this documentary made.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sever","of","the","interview","in","this","documentari","were","film","at","a","symposium","about","the","career","and","biographi","of","Michael","Chekhov",",","which","was","held","in","the","US","in","the","1990s",".","The","particip","in","the","symposium","share","their","memori","about","be","taught","by",",","or","work","with",",","the","late",",","great","actor",",","director",",","and","drama","coach",",","Russian-born","Chekhov","(","1891-1955",")",",","who","was","the","nephew","of","the","Russian","writer","Anton","Chekhov","(","1860-1904",")",".","Mani","film","clip",",","plus","some","rare","still","of","Chekhov","&","Shdanoff","themselv",",","are","ad",",","to","illustr","the","interview","and","commentari",".","One","of","the","particip",",","actress","Mala","Power",",","is","mention","in","the","film","'s","credit","also","as","executor","of","Michael","Chekhov","'s","estat","&","foundat",",","and","undoubt","play","an","import","role","in","get","this","documentari","made","."],"lemmas":["several","of","the","interview","in","this","documentary","be","film","at","a","symposium","about","the","career","and","biography","of","Michael","Chekhov",",","which","be","hold","in","the","US","in","the","1990s",".","the","participant","in","the","symposium","share","they","memory","about","be","teach","by",",","or","work","with",",","the","late",",","great","actor",",","director",",","and","drama","coach",",","russian-born","Chekhov","-lrb-","1891-1955","-rrb-",",","who","be","the","nephew","of","the","russian","writer","Anton","Chekhov","-lrb-","1860-1904","-rrb-",".","many","film","clip",",","plus","some","rare","still","of","Chekhov","&","Shdanoff","themselves",",","be","add",",","to","illustrate","the","interview","and","commentary",".","one","of","the","participant",",","actress","Mala","Powers",",","be","mention","in","the","film","'s","credit","also","as","executor","of","Michael","Chekhov","'s","estate","&","foundation",",","and","undoubtedly","play","a","important","role","in","get","this","documentary","make","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Several

{"title":"The Manor","plot":"During a snowstorm, Patrick Roarke, a manservant, is found dead at the bottom of the main staircase in a gothic English mansion. Inspector Hatcher is sent to investigate the death. When he arrives, he finds a household consisting of five women: the somewhat eccentric Lady Ravenscroft and her mentally unstable daughter Gillian, the icy foreign governess Miss Keiner, the simple minded maid Dolly, and the sinister cook Mrs French. When questioned by the inspector, each of the women tells a different story, all of which are illustrated by flashback scenes showing the events as related by that particular person. Everybody seems to protect somebody and the inspector becomes increasingly intoxicated as he tries to untangle the web of lies in his endeavour to find out the truth.","genres":["Comedy","

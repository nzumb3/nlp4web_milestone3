{"title":"Reconciliation: Mandela's Miracle","plot":"Once considered a \"terrorist,\" Nelson Mandela saved his country from bloody civil war and dismantled the system of apartheid through the spirit of reconciliation. Reconciliation: Mandela's Miracle details the events that lead up to what South African's have coined \"Mandela's miracle,\" a strategy that shepherded in a peaceful transition from apartheid to a democracy. It is driven by the notion that even the most terrible tyranny can be overcome through reconciliation, as both the oppressed and the oppressors need to be liberated from the vice-grip of prejudice and injustice. Additionally, we visit Clint Eastwood on the set of Invictus. His outsider's perspective finds in Mandela an exemplary hero who broke down an inhumane ideology after having been its most notorious victim: \"a Biblical figure\" whose wisdom will be a source of inspiration for future generations. He sums it up simply: \"The world needs people like him.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Once","consid","a","\"","terrorist",",","\"","Nelson","Mandela","save","his","countri","from","bloodi","civil","war","and","dismantl","the","system","of","apartheid","through","the","spirit","of","reconcili",".","Reconcili",":","Mandela","'s","Miracl","detail","the","event","that","lead","up","to","what","South","African","'s","have","coin","\"","Mandela","'s","miracl",",","\"","a","strategi","that","shepherd","in","a","peac","transit","from","apartheid","to","a","democraci",".","It","is","driven","by","the","notion","that","even","the","most","terribl","tyranni","can","be","overcom","through","reconcili",",","as","both","the","oppress","and","the","oppressor","need","to","be","liber","from","the","vice-grip","of","prejudic","and","injustic",".","Addition",",","we","visit","Clint","Eastwood","on","the","set","of","Invictus",".","His","outsid","'s","perspect","find","in","Mandela","an","exemplari","hero","who","broke","down","an","inhuman","ideolog","after","have","been","it","most","notori","victim",":","\"","a","Biblic","figur","\"","whose","wisdom","will","be","a","sourc","of","inspir","for","futur","generat",".","He","sum","it","up","simpli",":","\"","The","world","need","peopl","like","him",".","\""],"lemmas":["once","consider","a","``","terrorist",",","''","Nelson","Mandela","save","he","country","from","bloody","civil","war","and","dismantle","the","system","of","apartheid","through","the","spirit","of","reconciliation",".","Reconciliation",":","Mandela","'s","Miracle","detail","the","event","that","lead","up","to","what","South","African","'s","have","coin","``","Mandela","'s","miracle",",","''","a","strategy","that","shepherd","in","a","peaceful","transition","from","apartheid","to","a","democracy",".","it","be","drive","by","the","notion","that","even","the","most","terrible","tyranny","can","be","overcome","through","reconciliation",",","as","both","the","oppressed","and","the","oppressor","need","to","be","liberate","from","the","vice-grip","of","prejudice","and","injustice",".","additionally",",","we","visit","Clint","Eastwood","on","the","set","of","Invictus",".","he","outsider","'s","perspective","find","in","Mandela","a","exemplary","hero","who","break","down","a","inhumane","ideology","after","have","be","its","most","notorious","victim",":","``","a","biblical","figure","''","whose","wisdom","will","be","a","source","of","inspiration","for","future","generation",".","he","sum","it","up","simply",":","``","the","world","need","people","like","he",".","''"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Once

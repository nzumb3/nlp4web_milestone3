{"title":"March of the Penguins","plot":"At the end of each Antarctic summer, the emperor penguins of the South Pole journey to their traditional breeding grounds in a fascinating mating ritual that is captured in this documentary by intrepid filmmaker Luc Jacquet. The journey across frozen tundra proves to be the simplest part of the ritual, as after the egg is hatched, the female must delicately transfer it to the male and make her way back to the distant sea to nourish herself and bring back food to her newborn chick.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"],"stems":["At","the","end","of","each","Antarctic","summer",",","the","emperor","penguin","of","the","South","Pole","journey","to","their","tradit","breed","ground","in","a","fascin","mate","ritual","that","is","captur","in","this","documentari","by","intrepid","filmmak","Luc","Jacquet",".","The","journey","across","frozen","tundra","prove","to","be","the","simplest","part","of","the","ritual",",","as","after","the","egg","is","hatch",",","the","femal","must","delic","transfer","it","to","the","male","and","make","her","way","back","to","the","distant","sea","to","nourish","herself","and","bring","back","food","to","her","newborn","chick","."],"lemmas":["at","the","end","of","each","antarctic","summer",",","the","emperor","penguin","of","the","South","Pole","journey","to","they","traditional","breeding","grounds","in","a","fascinating","mating","ritual","that","be","capture","in","this","documentary","by","intrepid","filmmaker","luc","Jacquet",".","the","journey","across","frozen","tundra","prove","to","be","the","simplest","part","of","the","ritual",",","as","after","the","egg","be","hatch",",","the","female","must","delicately","transfer","it","to","the","male","and","make","she","way","back","to","the","distant","sea","to","nourish","herself","and","bring","back","food","to","she","newborn","chick","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["At the end","the end of","end of each","of each Antarctic","each Antarctic summer","Antarctic summer ,","summer , the",", the emperor","the emperor penguins","emperor penguins of","penguins of the","of the South","the South Pole","South Pole journey","Pole journey to","journey to their","to their traditional","their traditional breeding","traditional breeding grounds","breeding grounds in","grounds in a","in a fascinating","a fascinating mating","fascinating mating ritual","mating ritual that","ritual that is","that is captured","is captured in","captured in this","in this documentary","this documentary by","documentary by intrepid","by intrepid filmmaker","intrepid filmmaker Luc","filmmaker Luc Jacquet","The journey across","journey across frozen","across frozen tundra","frozen tundra proves","tundra proves to","proves to be","to be the","be the simplest","the simplest part","simplest part of","part of the","of the ritual","the ritual ,","ritual , as",", as after","as after the","after the egg","the egg is","egg is hatched","is hatched ,","hatched , the",", the female","the female must","female must delicately","must delicately transfer","delicately transfer it","transfer it to","it to the","to the male","the male and","male and make","and make her","make her way","her way back","way back to","back to the","to the distant","the distant sea","distant sea to","sea to nourish","to nourish herself","nourish herself and","herself and bring","and bring back","bring back food","back food to","food to her","to her newborn","her newborn chick"],"2grams":["At the","the end","end of","of each","each Antarctic","Antarctic summer","summer ,",", the","the emperor","emperor penguins","penguins of","of the","the South","South Pole","Pole journey","journey to","to their","their traditional","traditional breeding","breeding grounds","grounds in","in a","a fascinating","fascinating mating","mating ritual","ritual that","that is","is captured","captured in","in this","this documentary","documentary by","by intrepid","intrepid filmmaker","filmmaker Luc","Luc Jacquet","The journey","journey across","across frozen","frozen tundra","tundra proves","proves to","to be","be the","the simplest","simplest part","part of","of the","the ritual","ritual ,",", as","as after","after the","the egg","egg is","is hatched","hatched ,",", the","the female","female must","must delicately","delicately transfer","transfer it","it to","to the","the male","male and","and make","make her","her way","way back","back to","to the","the distant","distant sea","sea to","to nourish","nourish herself","herself and","and bring","bring back","back food","food to","to her","her newborn","newborn chick"]}

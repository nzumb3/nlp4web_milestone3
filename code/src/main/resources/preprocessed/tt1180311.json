{"title":"The Flower of Kim Jong II","plot":"For some, the Korean War was a clear example of American imperialism. For others, it was a valiant effort on the part of the UN and the Koreans to quash the spread of communism. For all Koreans, it was a tragedy. The country was not just divided; it was devastated. The death toll was astronomical, and the destruction profound. Many engage in assigning blame for the war according to their political beliefs, but this is a useless exercise. The point is that the human rights situation in North Korea today is catastrophic. KIMJONGILIA is the first film to let North Korean refugees tell their stories in their own words.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["For","some",",","the","Korean","War","was","a","clear","exampl","of","American","imperi",".","For","other",",","it","was","a","valiant","effort","on","the","part","of","the","UN","and","the","Korean","to","quash","the","spread","of","communism",".","For","all","Korean",",","it","was","a","tragedi",".","The","countri","was","not","just","divid",";","it","was","devast",".","The","death","toll","was","astronom",",","and","the","destruct","profound",".","Mani","engag","in","assign","blame","for","the","war","accord","to","their","polit","belief",",","but","this","is","a","useless","exercis",".","The","point","is","that","the","human","right","situat","in","North","Korea","today","is","catastroph",".","KIMJONGILIA","is","the","first","film","to","let","North","Korean","refuge","tell","their","stori","in","their","own","word","."],"lemmas":["for","some",",","the","Korean","War","be","a","clear","example","of","american","imperialism",".","for","other",",","it","be","a","valiant","effort","on","the","part","of","the","UN","and","the","Koreans","to","quash","the","spread","of","communism",".","for","all","Koreans",",","it","be","a","tragedy",".","the","country","be","not","just","divide",";","it","be","devastate",".","the","death","toll","be","astronomical",",","and","the","destruction","profound",".","many","engage","in","assign","blame","for","the","war","accord","to","they","political","belief",",","but","this","be","a","useless","exercise",".","the","point","be","that","the","human","rights","situation","in","North","Korea","today","be","catastrophic",".","KIMJONGILIA","be","the","first","film","to","let","North","Korean","refugee","tell","they","story","in","they","own","word","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["For some ,","some , the",", the Korean","the Korean War","Korean War was","War was a","was a clear","a clear example","clear example of","example of American","of American imperialism","For others ,","others , it",", it was","it was a","was a valiant","a valiant effort","valiant effort on","effort on the","on the part","the part of","part of the","of the UN","the UN and","UN and the","and the Koreans","the Koreans to","Koreans to quash","to quash the","quash the spread","the spread of","spread of communism","For all Koreans","all Koreans ,","Koreans , it",", it was","it was a","was a tragedy","The country was","country was not","was not just","not just divided","just divided ;","divided ; it","; it was","it was devastated","The death toll","death toll was","toll was astronomical","was astronomical ,","astronomical , and",", and the","and the destruction","the destruction profound","Many engage in","engage in assigning","in assigning blame","assigning blame for","blame for the","for the war","the war according","war according to","according to their","to their political","their political beliefs","political beliefs ,","beliefs , but",", but this","but this is","this is a","is a useless","a useless exercise","The point is","point is that","is that the","that the human","the human rights","human rights situation","rights situation in","situation in North","in North Korea","North Korea today","Korea today is","today is catastrophic","KIMJONGILIA is the","is the first","the first film","first film to","film to let","to let North","let North Korean","North Korean refugees","Korean refugees tell","refugees tell their","tell their stories","their stories in","stories in their","in their own","their own words"],"2grams":["For some","some ,",", the","the Korean","Korean War","War was","was a","a clear","clear example","example of","of American","American imperialism","For others","others ,",", it","it was","was a","a valiant","valiant effort","effort on","on the","the part","part of","of the","the UN","UN and","and the","the Koreans","Koreans to","to quash","quash the","the spread","spread of","of communism","For all","all Koreans","Koreans ,",", it","it was","was a","a tragedy","The country","country was","was not","not just","just divided","divided ;","; it","it was","was devastated","The death","death toll","toll was","was astronomical","astronomical ,",", and","and the","the destruction","destruction profound","Many engage","engage in","in assigning","assigning blame","blame for","for the","the war","war according","according to","to their","their political","political beliefs","beliefs ,",", but","but this","this is","is a","a useless","useless exercise","The point","point is","is that","that the","the human","human rights","rights situation","situation in","in North","North Korea","Korea today","today is","is catastrophic","KIMJONGILIA is","is the","the first","first film","film to","to let","let North","North Korean","Korean refugees","refugees tell","tell their","their stories","stories in","in their","their own","own words"]}

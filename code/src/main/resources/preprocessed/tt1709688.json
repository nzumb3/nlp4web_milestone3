{"title":"Maria Magdalena","plot":"From 1942 to 1981 in Switzerland, authorities arrested pregnant teenagers without any legal basis and put them in jails with criminals without any charge in order to educate them. Maria Magdalena is one them. Her baby was given up for adoption without her consent, before she was put in Interbank prison. While she thought it was always the fault of the Catholic church for all that happened to her, the sudden discovery of her father's letter put much needed light into her life.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["From","1942","to","1981","in","Switzerland",",","author","arrest","pregnant","teenag","without","ani","legal","basi","and","put","them","in","jail","with","crimin","without","ani","charg","in","order","to","educ","them",".","Maria","Magdalena","is","one","them",".","Her","babi","was","given","up","for","adopt","without","her","consent",",","befor","she","was","put","in","Interbank","prison",".","While","she","thought","it","was","alway","the","fault","of","the","Cathol","church","for","all","that","happen","to","her",",","the","sudden","discoveri","of","her","father","'s","letter","put","much","need","light","into","her","life","."],"lemmas":["from","1942","to","1981","in","Switzerland",",","authority","arrest","pregnant","teenager","without","any","legal","basis","and","put","they","in","jail","with","criminal","without","any","charge","in","order","to","educate","they",".","Maria","Magdalena","be","one","they",".","she","baby","be","give","up","for","adoption","without","she","consent",",","before","she","be","put","in","Interbank","prison",".","while","she","think","it","be","always","the","fault","of","the","Catholic","church","for","all","that","happen","to","she",",","the","sudden","discovery","of","she","father","'s","letter","put","much","need","light","into","she","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["From 1942 to","1942 to 1981","to 1981 in","1981 in Switzerland","in Switzerland ,","Switzerland , authorities",", authorities arrested","authorities arrested pregnant","arrested pregnant teenagers","pregnant teenagers without","teenagers without any","without any legal","any legal basis","legal basis and","basis and put","and put them","put them in","them in jails","in jails with","jails with criminals","with criminals without","criminals without any","without any charge","any charge in","charge in order","in order to","order to educate","to educate them","Maria Magdalena is","Magdalena is one","is one them","Her baby was","baby was given","was given up","given up for","up for adoption","for adoption without","adoption without her","without her consent","her consent ,","consent , before",", before she","before she was","she was put","was put in","put in Interbank","in Interbank prison","While she thought","she thought it","thought it was","it was always","was always the","always the fault","the fault of","fault of the","of the Catholic","the Catholic church","Catholic church for","church for all","for all that","all that happened","that happened to","happened to her","to her ,","her , the",", the sudden","the sudden discovery","sudden discovery of","discovery of her","of her father","her father 's","father 's letter","'s letter put","letter put much","put much needed","much needed light","needed light into","light into her","into her life"],"2grams":["From 1942","1942 to","to 1981","1981 in","in Switzerland","Switzerland ,",", authorities","authorities arrested","arrested pregnant","pregnant teenagers","teenagers without","without any","any legal","legal basis","basis and","and put","put them","them in","in jails","jails with","with criminals","criminals without","without any","any charge","charge in","in order","order to","to educate","educate them","Maria Magdalena","Magdalena is","is one","one them","Her baby","baby was","was given","given up","up for","for adoption","adoption without","without her","her consent","consent ,",", before","before she","she was","was put","put in","in Interbank","Interbank prison","While she","she thought","thought it","it was","was always","always the","the fault","fault of","of the","the Catholic","Catholic church","church for","for all","all that","that happened","happened to","to her","her ,",", the","the sudden","sudden discovery","discovery of","of her","her father","father 's","'s letter","letter put","put much","much needed","needed light","light into","into her","her life"]}

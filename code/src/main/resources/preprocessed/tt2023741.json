{"title":"El Huaso","plot":"Struggling with short-term memory loss, Gustavo has retired from his business and finds some solace in his homeland of Chile by pursuing a childhood dream - competing as a \"huaso\" in rodeos. Awaiting the results of tests to determine whether he has Alzheimer's, and having long professed he would end his life if it became unbearable, he begins making preparations for his death, while his family struggles to accept his decision to end his life. El Huaso explores the pivotal point in one man's life where he takes it upon himself to shape his own mortality.","genres":["Documentary"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Struggl","with","short-term","memori","loss",",","Gustavo","has","retir","from","his","busi","and","find","some","solac","in","his","homeland","of","Chile","by","pursu","a","childhood","dream","-","compet","as","a","\"","huaso","\"","in","rodeo",".","Await","the","result","of","test","to","determin","whether","he","has","Alzheimer","'s",",","and","have","long","profess","he","would","end","his","life","if","it","becam","unbear",",","he","begin","make","prepar","for","his","death",",","while","his","famili","struggl","to","accept","his","decis","to","end","his","life",".","El","Huaso","explor","the","pivot","point","in","one","man","'s","life","where","he","take","it","upon","himself","to","shape","his","own","mortal","."],"lemmas":["struggle","with","short-term","memory","loss",",","Gustavo","have","retire","from","he","business","and","find","some","solace","in","he","homeland","of","Chile","by","pursue","a","childhood","dream","-","compete","as","a","``","huaso","''","in","rodeo",".","await","the","result","of","test","to","determine","whether","he","have","Alzheimer","'s",",","and","have","long","profess","he","would","end","he","life","if","it","become","unbearable",",","he","begin","make","preparation","for","he","death",",","while","he","family","struggle","to","accept","he","decision","to","end","he","life",".","El","Huaso","explore","the","pivotal","point","in","one","man","'s","life","where","he","take","it","upon","himself","to","shape","he","own","mortality","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Struggling with short-term","with short-term memory","short-term memory loss","memory loss ,","loss , Gustavo",", Gustavo has","Gustavo has retired","has retired from","retired from his","from his business","his business and","business and finds","and finds some","finds some solace","some solace in","solace in his","in his homeland","his homeland of","homeland of Chile","of Chile by","Chile by pursuing","by pursuing a","pursuing a childhood","a childhood dream","childhood dream -","dream - competing","- competing as","competing as a","as a \"","a \" huaso","\" huaso \"","huaso \" in","\" in rodeos","Awaiting the results","the results of","results of tests","of tests to","tests to determine","to determine whether","determine whether he","whether he has","he has Alzheimer","has Alzheimer 's","Alzheimer 's ,","'s , and",", and having","and having long","having long professed","long professed he","professed he would","he would end","would end his","end his life","his life if","life if it","if it became","it became unbearable","became unbearable ,","unbearable , he",", he begins","he begins making","begins making preparations","making preparations for","preparations for his","for his death","his death ,","death , while",", while his","while his family","his family struggles","family struggles to","struggles to accept","to accept his","accept his decision","his decision to","decision to end","to end his","end his life","El Huaso explores","Huaso explores the","explores the pivotal","the pivotal point","pivotal point in","point in one","in one man","one man 's","man 's life","'s life where","life where he","where he takes","he takes it","takes it upon","it upon himself","upon himself to","himself to shape","to shape his","shape his own","his own mortality"],"2grams":["Struggling with","with short-term","short-term memory","memory loss","loss ,",", Gustavo","Gustavo has","has retired","retired from","from his","his business","business and","and finds","finds some","some solace","solace in","in his","his homeland","homeland of","of Chile","Chile by","by pursuing","pursuing a","a childhood","childhood dream","dream -","- competing","competing as","as a","a \"","\" huaso","huaso \"","\" in","in rodeos","Awaiting the","the results","results of","of tests","tests to","to determine","determine whether","whether he","he has","has Alzheimer","Alzheimer 's","'s ,",", and","and having","having long","long professed","professed he","he would","would end","end his","his life","life if","if it","it became","became unbearable","unbearable ,",", he","he begins","begins making","making preparations","preparations for","for his","his death","death ,",", while","while his","his family","family struggles","struggles to","to accept","accept his","his decision","decision to","to end","end his","his life","El Huaso","Huaso explores","explores the","the pivotal","pivotal point","point in","in one","one man","man 's","'s life","life where","where he","he takes","takes it","it upon","upon himself","himself to","to shape","shape his","his own","own mortality"]}

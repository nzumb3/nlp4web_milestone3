{"title":"Scheherazade's Diary","plot":"In 2012, after a 10 months drama therapy workshop, the women inmates of a Beirut prison presented their play Scheherazade in Baabda inside prison to the audience. This film follows the women during these 10 months. The women tell their stories showing how difficult it is to be a woman in Lebanon, and in general in the Arab world, which is governed by a patriarchal mentality. They convey the voices of all women who are imprisoned by oppressive mentalities which in many cases lead women to crime.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","2012",",","after","a","10","month","drama","therapi","workshop",",","the","women","inmat","of","a","Beirut","prison","present","their","play","Scheherazad","in","Baabda","insid","prison","to","the","audienc",".","This","film","follow","the","women","dure","these","10","month",".","The","women","tell","their","stori","show","how","difficult","it","is","to","be","a","woman","in","Lebanon",",","and","in","general","in","the","Arab","world",",","which","is","govern","by","a","patriarch","mental",".","They","convey","the","voic","of","all","women","who","are","imprison","by","oppress","mental","which","in","mani","case","lead","women","to","crime","."],"lemmas":["in","2012",",","after","a","10","month","drama","therapy","workshop",",","the","woman","inmate","of","a","Beirut","prison","present","they","play","Scheherazade","in","Baabda","inside","prison","to","the","audience",".","this","film","follow","the","woman","during","these","10","month",".","the","woman","tell","they","story","show","how","difficult","it","be","to","be","a","woman","in","Lebanon",",","and","in","general","in","the","Arab","world",",","which","be","govern","by","a","patriarchal","mentality",".","they","convey","the","voice","of","all","woman","who","be","imprison","by","oppressive","mentality","which","in","many","case","lead","woman","to","crime","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 2012 ,","2012 , after",", after a","after a 10","a 10 months","10 months drama","months drama therapy","drama therapy workshop","therapy workshop ,","workshop , the",", the women","the women inmates","women inmates of","inmates of a","of a Beirut","a Beirut prison","Beirut prison presented","prison presented their","presented their play","their play Scheherazade","play Scheherazade in","Scheherazade in Baabda","in Baabda inside","Baabda inside prison","inside prison to","prison to the","to the audience","This film follows","film follows the","follows the women","the women during","women during these","during these 10","these 10 months","The women tell","women tell their","tell their stories","their stories showing","stories showing how","showing how difficult","how difficult it","difficult it is","it is to","is to be","to be a","be a woman","a woman in","woman in Lebanon","in Lebanon ,","Lebanon , and",", and in","and in general","in general in","general in the","in the Arab","the Arab world","Arab world ,","world , which",", which is","which is governed","is governed by","governed by a","by a patriarchal","a patriarchal mentality","They convey the","convey the voices","the voices of","voices of all","of all women","all women who","women who are","who are imprisoned","are imprisoned by","imprisoned by oppressive","by oppressive mentalities","oppressive mentalities which","mentalities which in","which in many","in many cases","many cases lead","cases lead women","lead women to","women to crime"],"2grams":["In 2012","2012 ,",", after","after a","a 10","10 months","months drama","drama therapy","therapy workshop","workshop ,",", the","the women","women inmates","inmates of","of a","a Beirut","Beirut prison","prison presented","presented their","their play","play Scheherazade","Scheherazade in","in Baabda","Baabda inside","inside prison","prison to","to the","the audience","This film","film follows","follows the","the women","women during","during these","these 10","10 months","The women","women tell","tell their","their stories","stories showing","showing how","how difficult","difficult it","it is","is to","to be","be a","a woman","woman in","in Lebanon","Lebanon ,",", and","and in","in general","general in","in the","the Arab","Arab world","world ,",", which","which is","is governed","governed by","by a","a patriarchal","patriarchal mentality","They convey","convey the","the voices","voices of","of all","all women","women who","who are","are imprisoned","imprisoned by","by oppressive","oppressive mentalities","mentalities which","which in","in many","many cases","cases lead","lead women","women to","to crime"]}

{"title":"The Power of Art: Women's Voices in Africa","plot":"\"Africa is not only a continent of war and crisis. There is also an Africa that is alive and well, and is often borne by women\" Odile Sorgho-Moulinier (United Nations) Culture is no longer a static body of knowledge, values, practices and expressions shared and passed on by a community. It is a dynamic reality. \"The Power of Art / Women's Voices in Africa\" explores how contemporary African women who choose to be professional artists claim their position, and deal with the stereotypes associated with being an African and a woman. The film also focuses on the role professional artists may play in addressing the challenges women are faced with on the African continent.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","Africa","is","not","onli","a","contin","of","war","and","crisi",".","There","is","also","an","Africa","that","is","aliv","and","well",",","and","is","often","born","by","women","\"","Odile","Sorgho-Moulini","(","Unite","Nation",")","Cultur","is","no","longer","a","static","bodi","of","knowledg",",","valu",",","practic","and","express","share","and","pass","on","by","a","communiti",".","It","is","a","dynam","realiti",".","\"","The","Power","of","Art","/","Women","'s","Voic","in","Africa","\"","explor","how","contemporari","African","women","who","choos","to","be","profession","artist","claim","their","posit",",","and","deal","with","the","stereotyp","associ","with","be","an","African","and","a","woman",".","The","film","also","focus","on","the","role","profession","artist","may","play","in","address","the","challeng","women","are","face","with","on","the","African","contin","."],"lemmas":["``","Africa","be","not","only","a","continent","of","war","and","crisis",".","there","be","also","a","Africa","that","be","alive","and","well",",","and","be","often","bear","by","woman","``","Odile","Sorgho-Moulinier","-lrb-","United","Nations","-rrb-","culture","be","no","longer","a","static","body","of","knowledge",",","value",",","practice","and","expression","share","and","pass","on","by","a","community",".","it","be","a","dynamic","reality",".","``","the","Power","of","Art","/","Women","'s","voice","in","Africa","''","explore","how","contemporary","african","woman","who","choose","to","be","professional","artist","claim","they","position",",","and","deal","with","the","stereotype","associate","with","be","a","African","and","a","woman",".","the","film","also","focus","on","the","role","professional","artist","may","play","in","address","the","challenge","woman","be","face","with","on","the","african","continent","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\"

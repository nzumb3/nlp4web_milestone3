{"title":"I'm Single Because","plot":"The film examines the disconnect between African American men and women. The documentary captures thought provoking concepts on how to approach relationships for the 21st century. It surveys a group of young people opinions, stories and challenges with being single. Relationship experts and grassroots activists put the conversation in context and advocate different paths towards change, while collectively expounding the underlying factors that contribute to the quandary. Janks Morton asserts an old school mentality by dissecting the effects of media, belief systems and other factors concerning the black community and its profound effects on relationships while Leandra Ollie for the Talented Tenth offers a mother-like nurturing tune by expressing her interactions with the men in her life and breaking down the family dynamic structure from the '50s and contrasting the same today. Overall I'm Single Because is a thought provoking heart felt film that aspires to reach the masses of young African America adults who might be single in the 21st century.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","film","examin","the","disconnect","between","African","American","men","and","women",".","The","documentari","captur","thought","provok","concept","on","how","to","approach","relationship","for","the","21st","centuri",".","It","survey","a","group","of","young","peopl","opinion",",","stori","and","challeng","with","be","singl",".","Relationship","expert","and","grassroot","activist","put","the","convers","in","context","and","advoc","differ","path","toward","chang",",","while","collect","expound","the","under","factor","that","contribut","to","the","quandari",".","Jank","Morton","assert","an","old","school","mental","by","dissect","the","effect","of","media",",","belief","system","and","other","factor","concern","the","black","communiti","and","it","profound","effect","on","relationship","while","Leandra","Ollie","for","the","Talent","Tenth","offer","a","mother-lik","nurtur","tune","by","express","her","interact","with","the","men","in","her","life","and","break","down","the","famili","dynam","structur","from","the","50s","and","contrast","the","same","today",".","Overal","I","'m","Singl","Becaus","is","a","thought","provok","heart","felt","film","that","aspir","to","reach","the","mass","of","young","African","America","adult","who","might","be","singl","in","the","21st","centuri","."],"lemmas":["the","film","examine","the","disconnect","between","african","american","man","and","woman",".","the","documentary","capture","think","provoke","concept","on","how","to","approach","relationship","for","the","21st","century",".","it","survey","a","group","of","young","people","opinion",",","story","and","challenge","with","be","single",".","relationship","expert","and","grassroot","activist","put","the","conversation","in","context","and","advocate","different","path","towards","change",",","while","collectively","expound","the","underlie","factor","that","contribute","to","the","quandary",".","Janks","Morton","assert","a","old","school","mentality","by","dissect","the","effect","of","media",",","belief","system","and","other","factor","concern","the","black","community","and","its","profound","effect","on","relationship","while","Leandra","Ollie","for","the","Talented","Tenth","offer","a","mother-like","nurturing","tune","by","express","she","interaction","with","the","man","in","she","life","and","break","down","the","family","dynamic","structure","from","the","'50s","and","contrast","the","same","today",".","overall","I","be","single","because","be","a","thought","provoke","heart","feel","film","that","aspire","to","reach","the","mass","of","young","African","America","adult","who","might","be","single","in","the","21st","century","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

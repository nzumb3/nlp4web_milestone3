{"title":"A Vossa Casa","plot":"Indefatigable worker and in multiple artistic fronts, the architect Raul Lino (1879-1974) left us a fundamental work for the understanding of the Portuguese ways of being and inhabiting. The film approaches that legacy starting from texts published by the architect, which place the problematic of the House in a much wider context than that placed by the problems of construction itself. Imagined and drawn for people, being so mirrors of their personalities, tastes and memoires, Houses are the meeting-point between Man, Art and Nature. Therefore, the tremendous responsibility of Architecture: of those who make it and those who uses it.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Indefatig","worker","and","in","multipl","artist","front",",","the","architect","Raul","Lino","(","1879-1974",")","left","us","a","fundament","work","for","the","understand","of","the","Portugues","way","of","be","and","inhabit",".","The","film","approach","that","legaci","start","from","text","publish","by","the","architect",",","which","place","the","problemat","of","the","Hous","in","a","much","wider","context","than","that","place","by","the","problem","of","construct","itself",".","Imagin","and","drawn","for","peopl",",","be","so","mirror","of","their","person",",","tast","and","memoir",",","Hous","are","the","meeting-point","between","Man",",","Art","and","Natur",".","Therefor",",","the","tremend","respons","of","Architectur",":","of","those","who","make","it","and","those","who","use","it","."],"lemmas":["indefatigable","worker","and","in","multiple","artistic","front",",","the","architect","Raul","Lino","-lrb-","1879-1974","-rrb-","leave","we","a","fundamental","work","for","the","understanding","of","the","portuguese","way","of","be","and","inhabit",".","the","film","approach","that","legacy","start","from","text","publish","by","the","architect",",","which","place","the","problematic","of","the","House","in","a","much","wider","context","than","that","place","by","the","problem","of","construction","itself",".","imagine","and","draw","for","people",",","be","so","mirror","of","they","personality",",","taste","and","memoire",",","house","be","the","meeting-point","between","Man",",","Art","and","Nature",".","therefore",",","the","tremendous","responsibility","of","Architecture",":","of","those","who","make","it","and","those","who","use","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Indefatigable

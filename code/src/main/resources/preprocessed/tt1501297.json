{"title":"I Sing of a Well","plot":"When Prince Wenambe hands the little kingdom of Kotengbi over to Mansa Musa to protect, he wins the throne from His father. To ascend the throne though, he must find a wife. His choice is the beautiful Soraya who is betrothed to Dume the hunter. He is Prince and what he wants he gets, Wenambe marries Soraya in the time when Mansa Musa begins to sell the Kingdom of Kotengbi to slave traders. The folly of choice. Wenambe becomes a pawn of the gods; taunted daily by Alarka the old seer, he turns into a man troubled and confused, not even the son Soraya bears him is able to wipe away his shame. He becomes a ruler of slaves, but the gods still weave an intricate web, yarn after yarn, a new era is born, a new hope, though lined with the arrival of other slave traders even more powerful than Mansa Musa himself.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","Princ","Wenamb","hand","the","littl","kingdom","of","Kotengbi","over","to","Mansa","Musa","to","protect",",","he","win","the","throne","from","His","father",".","To","ascend","the","throne","though",",","he","must","find","a","wife",".","His","choic","is","the","beauti","Soraya","who","is","betroth","to","Dume","the","hunter",".","He","is","Princ","and","what","he","want","he","get",",","Wenamb","marri","Soraya","in","the","time","when","Mansa","Musa","begin","to","sell","the","Kingdom","of","Kotengbi","to","slave","trader",".","The","folli","of","choic",".","Wenamb","becom","a","pawn","of","the","god",";","taunt","daili","by","Alarka","the","old","seer",",","he","turn","into","a","man","troubl","and","confus",",","not","even","the","son","Soraya","bear","him","is","abl","to","wipe","away","his","shame",".","He","becom","a","ruler","of","slave",",","but","the","god","still","weav","an","intric","web",",","yarn","after","yarn",",","a","new","era","is","born",",","a","new","hope",",","though","line","with","the","arriv","of","other","slave","trader","even","more","power","than","Mansa","Musa","himself","."],"lemmas":["when","Prince","Wenambe","hand","the","little","kingdom","of","Kotengbi","over","to","Mansa","Musa","to","protect",",","he","win","the","throne","from","he","father",".","to","ascend","the","throne","though",",","he","must","find","a","wife",".","he","choice","be","the","beautiful","Soraya","who","be","betroth","to","dume","the","hunter",".","he","be","Prince","and","what","he","want","he","get",",","Wenambe","marry","Soraya","in","the","time","when","Mansa","Musa","begin","to","sell","the","Kingdom","of","Kotengbi","to","slave","trader",".","the","folly","of","choice",".","Wenambe","become","a","pawn","of","the","god",";","taunt","daily","by","Alarka","the","old","seer",",","he","turn","into","a","man","trouble","and","confuse",",","not","even","the","son","Soraya","bear","he","be","able","to","wipe","away","he","shame",".","he","become","a","ruler","of","slave",",","but","the","god","still","weave","a","intricate","web",",","yarn","after","yarn",",","a","new","era","be","bear",",","a","new","hope",",","though","line","with","the","arrival","of","other","slave","trader","even","more","powerful","than","Mansa","Musa","himself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Prince Wenambe","Prince Wenambe hands","Wenambe hands the","hands the little","the little kingdom","little kingdom of","kingdom of Kotengbi","of Kotengbi over","Kotengbi over to","over to Mansa","to Mansa Musa","Mansa Musa to","Musa to protect","to protect ,","protect , he",", he wins","he wins the","wins the throne","the throne from","throne from His","from His father","To ascend the","ascend the throne","the throne though","throne though ,","though , he",", he must","he must find","must find a","find a wife","His choice is","choice is the","is the beautiful","the beautiful Soraya","beautiful Soraya who","Soraya who is","who is betrothed","is betrothed to","betrothed to Dume","to Dume the","Dume the hunter","He is Prince","is Prince and","Prince and what","and what he","what he wants","he wants he","wants he gets","he gets ,","gets , Wenambe",", Wenambe marries","Wenambe marries Soraya","marries Soraya in","Soraya in the","in the time","the time when","time when Mansa","when Mansa Musa","Mansa Musa begins","Musa begins to","begins to sell","to sell the","sell the Kingdom","the Kingdom of","Kingdom of Kotengbi","of Kotengbi to","Kotengbi to slave","to slave traders","The folly of","folly of choice","Wenambe becomes a","becomes a pawn","a pawn of","pawn of the","of the gods","the gods ;","gods ;

{"title":"Luthier","plot":"Raul Orlando Perez lives deep in the mountains of Patagonia. He crafted his first instrument in 1962. He thinks of his work as a sort of re-creation, a form of alchemy, transforming natural materials into living, breathing instruments. A well-crafted instrument is not only defined by the age, treatment and construction of its materials, but it also continues to grow and adapt with use. In 2009, I brought him a door salvaged from my family home lost to fire. He transformed it into a beautiful handcrafted flamenco guitar.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Raul","Orlando","Perez","live","deep","in","the","mountain","of","Patagonia",".","He","craft","his","first","instrument","in","1962",".","He","think","of","his","work","as","a","sort","of","re-creat",",","a","form","of","alchemi",",","transform","natur","materi","into","live",",","breath","instrument",".","A","well-craft","instrument","is","not","onli","defin","by","the","age",",","treatment","and","construct","of","it","materi",",","but","it","also","continu","to","grow","and","adapt","with","use",".","In","2009",",","I","brought","him","a","door","salvag","from","my","famili","home","lost","to","fire",".","He","transform","it","into","a","beauti","handcraft","flamenco","guitar","."],"lemmas":["Raul","Orlando","Perez","live","deep","in","the","mountain","of","Patagonia",".","he","craft","he","first","instrument","in","1962",".","he","think","of","he","work","as","a","sort","of","re-creation",",","a","form","of","alchemy",",","transform","natural","material","into","living",",","breathing","instrument",".","a","well-crafted","instrument","be","not","only","define","by","the","age",",","treatment","and","construction","of","its","material",",","but","it","also","continue","to","grow","and","adapt","with","use",".","in","2009",",","I","bring","he","a","door","salvage","from","my","family","home","lose","to","fire",".","he","transform","it","into","a","beautiful","handcrafted","flamenco","guitar","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Raul Orlando Perez","Orlando Perez lives","Perez lives deep","lives deep in","deep in the","in the mountains","the mountains of","mountains of Patagonia","He crafted his","crafted his first","his first instrument","first instrument in","instrument in 1962","He thinks of","thinks of his","of his work","his work as","work as a","as a sort","a sort of","sort of re-creation","of re-creation ,","re-creation , a",", a form","a form of","form of alchemy","of alchemy ,","alchemy , transforming",", transforming natural","transforming natural materials","natural materials into","materials into living","into living ,","living , breathing",", breathing instruments","A well-crafted instrument","well-crafted instrument is","instrument is not","is not only","not only defined","only defined by","defined by the","by the age","the age ,","age , treatment",", treatment and","treatment and construction","and construction of","construction of its","of its materials","its materials ,","materials , but",", but it","but it also","it also continues","also continues to","continues to grow","to grow and","grow and adapt","and adapt with","adapt with use","In 2009 ,","2009 , I",", I brought","I brought him","brought him a","him a door","a door salvaged","door salvaged from","salvaged from my","from my family","my family home","family home lost","home lost to","lost to fire","He transformed it","transformed it into","it into a","into a beautiful","a beautiful handcrafted","beautiful handcrafted flamenco","handcrafted flamenco guitar"],"2grams":["Raul Orlando","Orlando Perez","Perez lives","lives deep","deep in","in the","the mountains","mountains of","of Patagonia","He crafted","crafted his","his first","first instrument","instrument in","in 1962","He thinks","thinks of","of his","his work","work as","as a","a sort","sort of","of re-creation","re-creation ,",", a","a form","form of","of alchemy","alchemy ,",", transforming","transforming natural","natural materials","materials into","into living","living ,",", breathing","breathing instruments","A well-crafted","well-crafted instrument","instrument is","is not","not only","only defined","defined by","by the","the age","age ,",", treatment","treatment and","and construction","construction of","of its","its materials","materials ,",", but","but it","it also","also continues","continues to","to grow","grow and","and adapt","adapt with","with use","In 2009","2009 ,",", I","I brought","brought him","him a","a door","door salvaged","salvaged from","from my","my family","family home","home lost","lost to","to fire","He transformed","transformed it","it into","into a","a beautiful","beautiful handcrafted","handcrafted flamenco","flamenco guitar"]}

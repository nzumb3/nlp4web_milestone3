{"title":"Thought Woman: The Life and Ideas of Paula Gunn Allen","plot":"Thought Woman is the result of filmmaker Ellen Marie Hinchcliffe's journey to interview and honor one of her intellectual heroines. Paula Gunn Allen was a Two Spirit/Lesbian from the Laguna Pueblo people and of Lebanese, Scottish and Metis descent. She wrote the groundbreaking book The Sacred Hoop- Recovering the Feminine in American Indian Traditions as well as novels, essays, poetry and literary criticism. In 2007 the filmmaker spent a week filming Paula talking about her life and ideas. Seven months later Paula joined the ancestors. From that meeting comes this personal, beautiful film about a brilliant, hilarious woman and her bold thinking on politics, history, and spirit. Features stunning art by Paula's granddaughter, interviews with her daughter and the music of The Neeconis Women Singers.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Thought","Woman","is","the","result","of","filmmak","Ellen","Mari","Hinchcliff","'s","journey","to","interview","and","honor","one","of","her","intellectu","heroin",".","Paula","Gunn","Allen","was","a","Two","Spirit/Lesbian","from","the","Laguna","Pueblo","peopl","and","of","Lebanes",",","Scottish","and","Meti","descent",".","She","wrote","the","groundbreak","book","The","Sacr","Hoop","-","Recov","the","Feminin","in","American","Indian","Tradit","as","well","as","novel",",","essay",",","poetri","and","literari","critic",".","In","2007","the","filmmak","spent","a","week","film","Paula","talk","about","her","life","and","idea",".","Seven","month","later","Paula","join","the","ancestor",".","From","that","meet","come","this","person",",","beauti","film","about","a","brilliant",",","hilari","woman","and","her","bold","think","on","polit",",","histori",",","and","spirit",".","Featur","stun","art","by","Paula","'s","granddaught",",","interview","with","her","daughter","and","the","music","of","The","Neeconi","Women","Singer","."],"lemmas":["Thought","Woman","be","the","result","of","filmmaker","Ellen","Marie","Hinchcliffe","'s","journey","to","interview","and","honor","one","of","she","intellectual","heroine",".","Paula","Gunn","Allen","be","a","two","spirit/lesbian","from","the","Laguna","Pueblo","people","and","of","Lebanese",",","Scottish","and","Metis","descent",".","she","write","the","groundbreak","book","the","sacred","hoop","-","recover","the","feminine","in","american","indian","tradition","as","well","as","novel",",","essay",",","poetry","and","literary","criticism",".","in","2007","the","filmmaker","spend","a","week","film","Paula","talk","about","she","life","and","idea",".","seven","month","later","Paula","join","the","ancestor",".","from","that","meeting","come","this","personal",",","beautiful","film","about","a","brilliant",",","hilarious","woman","and","she","bold","thinking","on","politics",",","history",",","and","spirit",".","feature","stunning","art","by","Paula","'s","granddaughter",",","interview","with","she","daughter","and","the","music","of","the","Neeconis","Women","Singers","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Thought Woman is","Woman is the","is the result","the result of","result of filmmaker","of filmmaker Ellen","filmmaker Ellen Marie","Ellen Marie Hinchcliffe","Marie Hinchcliffe 's","Hinchcliffe 's journey","'s journey to","journey to interview","to interview and","interview and honor","and honor one","honor one of","one of her","of her intellectual","her intellectual heroines","Paula Gunn Allen","Gunn Allen was","Allen was a","was a Two","a Two Spirit/Lesbian","Two Spirit/Lesbian from","Spirit/Lesbian from the","from the Laguna","the Laguna Pueblo","Laguna Pueblo people","Pueblo people and","people and of","and of Lebanese","of Lebanese ,","Lebanese , Scottish",", Scottish and","Scottish and Metis","and Metis descent","She wrote the","wrote the groundbreaking","the groundbreaking book","groundbreaking book The","book The Sacred","The Sacred Hoop","Sacred Hoop -","Hoop -

{"title":"Ranbhool","plot":"Lokesh, an innocent kid who loves playing his guitar, is turned into a psychotic killer thanks to a traumatic childhood experience, courtesy his ruthless father. Lokesh's passion for playing the guitar turns into an obsession for making disturbing tunes for spreading a message to the world, a message by God, and Lokesh believes himself to be God's Messenger. Whoever is unfortunate enough not to understand his music and his message doesn't deserve the right to live. Reva, a lonely young girl, torn apart by her parent's separation, feels the pain and the passion behind Lokesh's music, but oblivious to his psychotic killing spree, she puts herself, her friend and her kid sister, in danger of Lokesh's wrath!","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Lokesh",",","an","innoc","kid","who","love","play","his","guitar",",","is","turn","into","a","psychot","killer","thank","to","a","traumat","childhood","experi",",","courtesi","his","ruthless","father",".","Lokesh","'s","passion","for","play","the","guitar","turn","into","an","obsess","for","make","disturb","tune","for","spread","a","messag","to","the","world",",","a","messag","by","God",",","and","Lokesh","believ","himself","to","be","God","'s","Messeng",".","Whoever","is","unfortun","enough","not","to","understand","his","music","and","his","messag","doe","n't","deserv","the","right","to","live",".","Reva",",","a","lone","young","girl",",","torn","apart","by","her","parent","'s","separ",",","feel","the","pain","and","the","passion","behind","Lokesh","'s","music",",","but","oblivi","to","his","psychot","kill","spree",",","she","put","herself",",","her","friend","and","her","kid","sister",",","in","danger","of","Lokesh","'s","wrath","!"],"lemmas":["Lokesh",",","a","innocent","kid","who","love","play","he","guitar",",","be","turn","into","a","psychotic","killer","thanks","to","a","traumatic","childhood","experience",",","courtesy","he","ruthless","father",".","Lokesh","'s","passion","for","play","the","guitar","turn","into","a","obsession","for","make","disturbing","tune","for","spread","a","message","to","the","world",",","a","message","by","God",",","and","Lokesh","believe","himself","to","be","God","'s","messenger",".","whoever","be","unfortunate","enough","not","to","understand","he","music","and","he","message","do","not","deserve","the","right","to","live",".","Reva",",","a","lonely","young","girl",",","tear","apart","by","she","parent","'s","separation",",","feel","the","pain","and","the","passion","behind","Lokesh","'s","music",",","but","oblivious","to","he","psychotic","killing","spree",",","she","put","herself",",","she","friend","and","she","kid","sister",",","in","danger","of","Lokesh","'s","wrath","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Lokesh

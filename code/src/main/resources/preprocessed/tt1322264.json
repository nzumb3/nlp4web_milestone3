{"title":"The Dry Land","plot":"A thesis picture. James arrives home to West Texas from Iraq. He doesn't remember much about the war, and it's soon clear he has post traumatic stress. He takes a job at an abattoir. After an alcohol-fueled fights with co-workers and his wife, he seeks help at the VA. He returns to find she's leaving him until he can regain control. He leaves his dog with his ailing mother and drives northeast to visit an Army buddy and find out what it is he can't remember. His friend won't say much, so James drives on to Walter Reed Hospital where another friend convalesces. Will James find out what he's repressed, and if he does, will it make anything better? What options does he have?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","thesi","pictur",".","Jame","arriv","home","to","West","Texa","from","Iraq",".","He","doe","n't","rememb","much","about","the","war",",","and","it","'s","soon","clear","he","has","post","traumat","stress",".","He","take","a","job","at","an","abattoir",".","After","an","alcohol-fuel","fight","with","co-work","and","his","wife",",","he","seek","help","at","the","VA",".","He","return","to","find","she","'s","leav","him","until","he","can","regain","control",".","He","leav","his","dog","with","his","ail","mother","and","drive","northeast","to","visit","an","Armi","buddi","and","find","out","what","it","is","he","ca","n't","rememb",".","His","friend","wo","n't","say","much",",","so","Jame","drive","on","to","Walter","Reed","Hospit","where","anoth","friend","convalesc",".","Will","Jame","find","out","what","he","'s","repress",",","and","if","he","doe",",","will","it","make","anyth","better","?","What","option","doe","he","have","?"],"lemmas":["a","thesis","picture",".","James","arrive","home","to","West","Texas","from","Iraq",".","he","do","not","remember","much","about","the","war",",","and","it","be","soon","clear","he","have","post","traumatic","stress",".","he","take","a","job","at","a","abattoir",".","after","a","alcohol-fueled","fight","with","co-worker","and","he","wife",",","he","seek","help","at","the","VA",".","he","return","to","find","she","be","leave","he","until","he","can","regain","control",".","he","leave","he","dog","with","he","ailing","mother","and","drive","northeast","to","visit","a","Army","buddy","and","find","out","what","it","be","he","can","not","remember",".","he","friend","will","not","say","much",",","so","James","drive","on","to","Walter","Reed","Hospital","where","another","friend","convalesce",".","Will","James","find","out","what","he","be","repress",",","and","if","he","do",",","will","it","make","anything","better","?","what","option","do","he","have","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

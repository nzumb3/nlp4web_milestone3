{"title":"Paul Blart: Mall Cop","plot":"Paul Blart is a mild-mannered man who works as a security guard in a New Jersey mall. For years, he has applied to become a cop, but he always fails the physical exam because he is overweight. One day, a gang of organized criminals put the mall under siege and take hostages. Blart becomes trapped inside, and because of his sense of duty, refuses to leave. He thus becomes the police department's eyes on the inside and attempts to stop the criminals on his own.","genres":["Action"," Crime"," Comedy"],"stems":["Paul","Blart","is","a","mild-mann","man","who","work","as","a","secur","guard","in","a","New","Jersey","mall",".","For","year",",","he","has","appli","to","becom","a","cop",",","but","he","alway","fail","the","physic","exam","becaus","he","is","overweight",".","One","day",",","a","gang","of","organ","crimin","put","the","mall","under","sieg","and","take","hostag",".","Blart","becom","trap","insid",",","and","becaus","of","his","sens","of","duti",",","refus","to","leav",".","He","thus","becom","the","polic","depart","'s","eye","on","the","insid","and","attempt","to","stop","the","crimin","on","his","own","."],"lemmas":["Paul","Blart","be","a","mild-mannered","man","who","work","as","a","security","guard","in","a","New","Jersey","mall",".","for","year",",","he","have","apply","to","become","a","cop",",","but","he","always","fail","the","physical","exam","because","he","be","overweight",".","one","day",",","a","gang","of","organized","criminal","put","the","mall","under","siege","and","take","hostage",".","Blart","become","trapped","inside",",","and","because","of","he","sense","of","duty",",","refuse","to","leave",".","he","thus","become","the","police","department","'s","eye","on","the","inside","and","attempt","to","stop","the","criminal","on","he","own","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Paul Blart is","Blart is a","is a mild-mannered","a mild-mannered man","mild-mannered man who","man who works","who works as","works as a","as a security","a security guard","security guard in","guard in a","in a New","a New Jersey","New Jersey mall","For years ,","years , he",", he has","he has applied","has applied to","applied to become","to become a","become a cop","a cop ,","cop , but",", but he","but he always","he always fails","always fails the","fails the physical","the physical exam","physical exam because","exam because he","because he is","he is overweight","One day ,","day , a",", a gang","a gang of","gang of organized","of organized criminals","organized criminals put","criminals put the","put the mall","the mall under","mall under siege","under siege and","siege and take","and take hostages","Blart becomes trapped","becomes trapped inside","trapped inside ,","inside , and",", and because","and because of","because of his","of his sense","his sense of","sense of duty","of duty ,","duty , refuses",", refuses to","refuses to leave","He thus becomes","thus becomes the","becomes the police","the police department","police department 's","department 's eyes","'s eyes on","eyes on the","on the inside","the inside and","inside and attempts","and attempts to","attempts to stop","to stop the","stop the criminals","the criminals on","criminals on his","on his own"],"2grams":["Paul Blart","Blart is","is a","a mild-mannered","mild-mannered man","man who","who works","works as","as a","a security","security guard","guard in","in a","a New","New Jersey","Jersey mall","For years","years ,",", he","he has","has applied","applied to","to become","become a","a cop","cop ,",", but","but he","he always","always fails","fails the","the physical","physical exam","exam because","because he","he is","is overweight","One day","day ,",", a","a gang","gang of","of organized","organized criminals","criminals put","put the","the mall","mall under","under siege","siege and","and take","take hostages","Blart becomes","becomes trapped","trapped inside","inside ,",", and","and because","because of","of his","his sense","sense of","of duty","duty ,",", refuses","refuses to","to leave","He thus","thus becomes","becomes the","the police","police department","department 's","'s eyes","eyes on","on the","the inside","inside and","and attempts","attempts to","to stop","stop the","the criminals","criminals on","on his","his own"]}

{"title":"Vancouver Vagabond II","plot":"Vancouver has become known on the world stage to spawn various rebel social movements. It is a city that artist and animator Heath Tait took his camera to the streets for a series of dramatic documentary Vagabond stories in the years straddling the 2010 Winter Olympics - the politics, the people, the scene. The Olympic Games were a Canadian smash, a wild party in the streets. In 2011 the Vancouver Canucks would bring about a 2nd street smash - of a different sort. Olympics, pro hockey, wacky politics, rich music and shocking spectacle - this is VVII.","genres":["Animation"," Documentary"," Crime"],"stems":["Vancouv","has","becom","known","on","the","world","stage","to","spawn","various","rebel","social","movement",".","It","is","a","citi","that","artist","and","anim","Heath","Tait","took","his","camera","to","the","street","for","a","seri","of","dramat","documentari","Vagabond","stori","in","the","year","straddl","the","2010","Winter","Olympic","-","the","polit",",","the","peopl",",","the","scene",".","The","Olympic","Game","were","a","Canadian","smash",",","a","wild","parti","in","the","street",".","In","2011","the","Vancouv","Canuck","would","bring","about","a","2nd","street","smash","-","of","a","differ","sort",".","Olympic",",","pro","hockey",",","wacki","polit",",","rich","music","and","shock","spectacl","-","this","is","VVII","."],"lemmas":["Vancouver","have","become","know","on","the","world","stage","to","spawn","various","rebel","social","movement",".","it","be","a","city","that","artist","and","animator","Heath","Tait","take","he","camera","to","the","street","for","a","series","of","dramatic","documentary","vagabond","story","in","the","year","straddle","the","2010","Winter","Olympics","-","the","politics",",","the","people",",","the","scene",".","the","Olympic","Games","be","a","canadian","smash",",","a","wild","party","in","the","street",".","in","2011","the","Vancouver","Canucks","would","bring","about","a","2nd","street","smash","-","of","a","different","sort",".","Olympics",",","pro","hockey",",","wacky","politics",",","rich","music","and","shocking","spectacle","-","this","be","VVII","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Vancouver has become","has become known","become known on","known on the","on the world","the world stage","world stage to","stage to spawn","to spawn various","spawn various rebel","various rebel social","rebel social movements","It is a","is a city","a city that","city that artist","that artist and","artist and animator","and animator Heath","animator Heath Tait","Heath Tait took","Tait took his","took his camera","his camera to","camera to the","to the streets","the streets for","streets for a","for a series","a series of","series of dramatic","of dramatic documentary","dramatic documentary Vagabond","documentary Vagabond stories","Vagabond stories in","stories in the","in the years","the years straddling","years straddling the","straddling the 2010","the 2010 Winter","2010 Winter Olympics","Winter Olympics -","Olympics - the","- the politics","the politics ,","politics , the",", the people","the people ,","people , the",", the scene","The Olympic Games","Olympic Games were","Games were a","were a Canadian","a Canadian smash","Canadian smash ,","smash , a",", a wild","a wild party","wild party in","party in the","in the streets","In 2011 the","2011 the Vancouver","the Vancouver Canucks","Vancouver Canucks would","Canucks would bring","would bring about","bring about a","about a 2nd","a 2nd street","2nd street smash","street smash -","smash - of","- of a","of a different","a different sort","Olympics , pro",", pro hockey","pro hockey ,","hockey , wacky",", wacky politics","wacky politics ,","politics , rich",", rich music","rich music and","music and shocking","and shocking spectacle","shocking spectacle -","spectacle - this","- this is","this is VVII"],"2grams":["Vancouver has","has become","become known","known on","on the","the world","world stage","stage to","to spawn","spawn various","various rebel","rebel social","social movements","It is","is a","a city","city that","that artist","artist and","and animator","animator Heath","Heath Tait","Tait took","took his","his camera","camera to","to the","the streets","streets for","for a","a series","series of","of dramatic","dramatic documentary","documentary Vagabond","Vagabond stories","stories in","in the","the years","years straddling","straddling the","the 2010","2010 Winter","Winter Olympics","Olympics -","- the","the politics","politics ,",", the","the people","people ,",", the","the scene","The Olympic","Olympic Games","Games were","were a","a Canadian","Canadian smash","smash ,",", a","a wild","wild party","party in","in the","the streets","In 2011","2011 the","the Vancouver","Vancouver Canucks","Canucks would","would bring","bring about","about a","a 2nd","2nd street","street smash","smash -","- of","of a","a different","different sort","Olympics ,",", pro","pro hockey","hockey ,",", wacky","wacky politics","politics ,",", rich","rich music","music and","and shocking","shocking spectacle","spectacle -","- this","this is","is VVII"]}

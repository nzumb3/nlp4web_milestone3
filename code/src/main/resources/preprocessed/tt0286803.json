{"title":"Main Solah Baras Ki","plot":"When Bollywood megastar Dev Anand makes an announcement he is on the look-out for a female lead in his forthcoming Hindi movie, many Indian women and men all over the world wait with bated breath to see who the lucky woman was going to be. Dev did not find anyone in India, so he decided to tour the U.K., and meets with beautiful Tina, who he casts in his next film. While meeting Tina, he also meets 16 year old Madhu Mehra in U.K., who also wants to act in his movie called \"Main Solah Baras Ki\". The common thing between them is that both share the same birth date (the year is different); Dev likes Madhu, while Madhu loves Dev, and will do anything to make him notice her as a woman, not as a teen. The question is whether this veteran actor can decide to hold onto his own, while this charming teenager turns on her charm on him.","genres":["Musical"," Romance"],"stems":["When","Bollywood","megastar","Dev","Anand","make","an","announc","he","is","on","the","look-out","for","a","femal","lead","in","his","forthcom","Hindi","movi",",","mani","Indian","women","and","men","all","over","the","world","wait","with","bate","breath","to","see","who","the","lucki","woman","was","go","to","be",".","Dev","did","not","find","anyon","in","India",",","so","he","decid","to","tour","the","U.K.",",","and","meet","with","beauti","Tina",",","who","he","cast","in","his","next","film",".","While","meet","Tina",",","he","also","meet","16","year","old","Madhu","Mehra","in","U.K.",",","who","also","want","to","act","in","his","movi","call","\"","Main","Solah","Bara","Ki","\"",".","The","common","thing","between","them","is","that","both","share","the","same","birth","date","(","the","year","is","differ",")",";","Dev","like","Madhu",",","while","Madhu","love","Dev",",","and","will","do","anyth","to","make","him","notic","her","as","a","woman",",","not","as","a","teen",".","The","question","is","whether","this","veteran","actor","can","decid","to","hold","onto","his","own",",","while","this","charm","teenag","turn","on","her","charm","on","him","."],"lemmas":["when","Bollywood","megastar","Dev","Anand","make","a","announcement","he","be","on","the","look-out","for","a","female","lead","in","he","forthcoming","Hindi","movie",",","many","indian","woman","and","man","all","over","the","world","wait","with","bated","breath","to","see","who","the","lucky","woman","be","go","to","be",".","dev","do","not","find","anyone","in","India",",","so","he","decide","to","tour","the","U.K.",",","and","meet","with","beautiful","Tina",",","who","he","cast","in","he","next","film",".","while","meet","Tina",",","he","also","meet","16","year","old","Madhu","Mehra","in","U.K.",",","who","also","want","to","act","in","he","movie","call","``","Main","Solah","Baras","ki","''",".","the","common","thing","between","they","be","that","both","share","the","same","birth","date","-lrb-","the","year","be","different","-rrb-",";","Dev","like","Madhu",",","while","Madhu","love","Dev",",","and","will","do","anything","to","make","he","notice","she","as","a","woman",",","not","as","a","teen",".","the","question","be","whether","this","veteran","actor","can","decide","to","hold","onto","he","own",",","while","this","charming","teenager","turn","on","she","charm","on","he","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Bollywood megastar","Bollywood megastar Dev","megastar Dev Anand","Dev Anand makes","Anand makes an","makes an announcement","an announcement he","announcement he is","he is on","is on the","on the look-out","the look-out for","look-out for a","for a female","a female lead","female lead in","lead in his","in his forthcoming","his forthcoming Hindi","forthcoming Hindi movie","Hindi movie ,","movie , many",", many Indian","many Indian women","Indian women and","women and men","and men all","men all over","all over the","over the world","the world wait","world wait with","wait with bated","with bated breath","bated breath to","breath to see","to see who","see who the","who the lucky","the lucky woman","lucky woman was","woman was going","was going to","going to be","Dev did not","did not find","not find anyone","find anyone in","anyone in India","in India ,","India , so",", so he","so he decided","he decided to","decided to tour","to tour the","tour the U.K.","the U.K. ,","U.K. , and",", and meets","and meets with","meets with beautiful","with beautiful Tina","beautiful Tina ,","Tina , who",", who he","who he casts","he casts in","casts in his","in his next","his next film","While meeting Tina","meeting Tina ,","Tina , he",", he also","he also meets","also meets 16","meets 16 year","16 year old","year old Madhu","old Madhu Mehra","Madhu Mehra in","Mehra in U.K.","in U.K. ,","U.K. , who",", who also","who also wants","also wants to","wants to act","to act in","act in his","in his movie","his movie called","movie called \"","called \" Main","\" Main Solah","Main Solah Baras","Solah Baras Ki","Baras Ki \"","The common thing","common thing between","thing between them","between them is","them is that","is that both","that both share","both share the","share the same","the same birth","same birth date","birth date (","date ( the","( the year","the year is","year is different","is different )","different ) ;",") ;

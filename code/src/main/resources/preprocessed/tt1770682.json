{"title":"Freeing Bernie Baran","plot":"In 1984, 19-year-old, openly gay Bernard Baran was accused of multiple counts of child molestation and rape during the American Day Care Panic of the 1980s and 1990s. His conviction in January 1985 was the first of the dozens or wrongful prosecutions in the panic. Unlike others, it received no national attention and remained unknown for a decade. It would take another 15 years to set him free.","genres":["Crime"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","1984",",","19-year-old",",","open","gay","Bernard","Baran","was","accus","of","multipl","count","of","child","molest","and","rape","dure","the","American","Day","Care","Panic","of","the","1980s","and","1990s",".","His","convict","in","Januari","1985","was","the","first","of","the","dozen","or","wrong","prosecut","in","the","panic",".","Unlike","other",",","it","receiv","no","nation","attent","and","remain","unknown","for","a","decad",".","It","would","take","anoth","15","year","to","set","him","free","."],"lemmas":["in","1984",",","19-year-old",",","openly","gay","Bernard","Baran","be","accuse","of","multiple","count","of","child","molestation","and","rape","during","the","American","Day","Care","panic","of","the","1980","and","1990",".","he","conviction","in","January","1985","be","the","first","of","the","dozen","or","wrongful","prosecution","in","the","panic",".","unlike","other",",","it","receive","no","national","attention","and","remain","unknown","for","a","decade",".","it","would","take","another","15","year","to","set","he","free","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1984 ,","1984 , 19-year-old",", 19-year-old ,","19-year-old , openly",", openly gay","openly gay Bernard","gay Bernard Baran","Bernard Baran was","Baran was accused","was accused of","accused of multiple","of multiple counts","multiple counts of","counts of child","of child molestation","child molestation and","molestation and rape","and rape during","rape during the","during the American","the American Day","American Day Care","Day Care Panic","Care Panic of","Panic of the","of the 1980s","the 1980s and","1980s and 1990s","His conviction in","conviction in January","in January 1985","January 1985 was","1985 was the","was the first","the first of","first of the","of the dozens","the dozens or","dozens or wrongful","or wrongful prosecutions","wrongful prosecutions in","prosecutions in the","in the panic","Unlike others ,","others , it",", it received","it received no","received no national","no national attention","national attention and","attention and remained","and remained unknown","remained unknown for","unknown for a","for a decade","It would take","would take another","take another 15","another 15 years","15 years to","years to set","to set him","set him free"],"2grams":["In 1984","1984 ,",", 19-year-old","19-year-old ,",", openly","openly gay","gay Bernard","Bernard Baran","Baran was","was accused","accused of","of multiple","multiple counts","counts of","of child","child molestation","molestation and","and rape","rape during","during the","the American","American Day","Day Care","Care Panic","Panic of","of the","the 1980s","1980s and","and 1990s","His conviction","conviction in","in January","January 1985","1985 was","was the","the first","first of","of the","the dozens","dozens or","or wrongful","wrongful prosecutions","prosecutions in","in the","the panic","Unlike others","others ,",", it","it received","received no","no national","national attention","attention and","and remained","remained unknown","unknown for","for a","a decade","It would","would take","take another","another 15","15 years","years to","to set","set him","him free"]}

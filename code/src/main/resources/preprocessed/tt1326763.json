{"title":"Division Street","plot":"This is not your father's road trip. From pristine roadless areas to concrete jungles, follow filmmaker Eric Bendick as he tours North America, dodging Yellowstone's grizzlies and Miami's taxicabs, and highlighting sustainable road projects and wildlife corridors for the 21st century. Roads are the largest human artifact on the planet; they have fragmented wild landscapes, ushered in the 'age of urban sprawl,' and challenged our bedrock sense of community. But as the transportation crisis appears to be spiraling out of control, a new generation of ecologists, engineers, city-planners, and everyday citizens are transforming the future of the American road. 'Division Street' is at once a portrait of both ancient wilderness and new technologies as well as a call for connectivity, innovation, and solutions to shape the emerging green transportation movement.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","not","your","father","'s","road","trip",".","From","pristin","roadless","area","to","concret","jungl",",","follow","filmmak","Eric","Bendick","as","he","tour","North","America",",","dodg","Yellowston","'s","grizzli","and","Miami","'s","taxicab",",","and","highlight","sustain","road","project","and","wildlif","corridor","for","the","21st","centuri",".","Road","are","the","largest","human","artifact","on","the","planet",";","they","have","fragment","wild","landscap",",","usher","in","the","'","age","of","urban","sprawl",",","'","and","challeng","our","bedrock","sens","of","communiti",".","But","as","the","transport","crisi","appear","to","be","spiral","out","of","control",",","a","new","generat","of","ecologist",",","engin",",","city-plann",",","and","everyday","citizen","are","transform","the","futur","of","the","American","road",".","'","Divis","Street","'","is","at","onc","a","portrait","of","both","ancient","wilder","and","new","technolog","as","well","as","a","call","for","connect",",","innov",",","and","solut","to","shape","the","emerg","green","transport","movement","."],"lemmas":["this","be","not","you","father","'s","road","trip",".","from","pristine","roadless","area","to","concrete","jungle",",","follow","filmmaker","Eric","Bendick","as","he","tour","North","America",",","dodge","Yellowstone","'s","grizzly","and","Miami","'s","taxicab",",","and","highlight","sustainable","road","project","and","wildlife","corridor","for","the","21st","century",".","road","be","the","largest","human","artifact","on","the","planet",";","they","have","fragment","wild","landscape",",","usher","in","the","'","age","of","urban","sprawl",",","'","and","challenge","we","bedrock","sense","of","community",".","but","as","the","transportation","crisis","appear","to","be","spiral","out","of","control",",","a","new","generation","of","ecologist",",","engineer",",","city-planner",",","and","everyday","citizen","be","transform","the","future","of","the","american","road",".","'","Division","Street","'","be","at","once","a","portrait","of","both","ancient","wilderness","and","new","technology","as","well","as","a","call","for","connectivity",",","innovation",",","and","solution","to","shape","the","emerge","green","transportation","movement","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["This is not","is not your","not your father","your father 's","father 's road","'s road trip","From pristine roadless","pristine roadless areas","roadless areas to","areas to concrete","to concrete jungles","concrete jungles ,","jungles , follow",", follow filmmaker","follow filmmaker Eric","filmmaker Eric Bendick","Eric Bendick as","Bendick as he","as he tours","he tours North","tours North America","North America ,","America , dodging",", dodging Yellowstone","dodging Yellowstone 's","Yellowstone 's grizzlies","'s grizzlies and","grizzlies and Miami","and Miami 's","Miami 's taxicabs","'s taxicabs ,","taxicabs , and",", and highlighting","and highlighting sustainable","highlighting sustainable road","sustainable road projects","road projects and","projects and wildlife","and wildlife corridors","wildlife corridors for","corridors for the","for the 21st","the 21st century","Roads are the","are the largest","the largest human","largest human artifact","human artifact on","artifact on the","on the planet","the planet ;","planet ; they","; they have","they have fragmented","have fragmented wild","fragmented wild landscapes","wild landscapes ,","landscapes , ushered",", ushered in","ushered in the","in the '","the ' age","' age of","age of urban","of urban sprawl","urban sprawl ,","sprawl , '",", ' and","' and challenged","and challenged our","challenged our bedrock","our bedrock sense","bedrock sense of","sense of community","But as the","as the transportation","the transportation crisis","transportation crisis appears","crisis appears to","appears to be","to be spiraling","be spiraling out","spiraling out of","out of control","of control ,","control , a",", a new","a new generation","new generation of","generation of ecologists","of ecologists ,","ecologists , engineers",", engineers ,","engineers , city-planners",", city-planners ,","city-planners , and",", and everyday","and everyday citizens","everyday citizens are","citizens are transforming","are transforming the","transforming the future","the future of","future of the","of the American","the American road","American road .","road .

{"title":"Sy klink soos lente","plot":"(She Sounds Like Spring) is about Ben, a mechanic at a car dealership in Johannesburg, and Linda, a beautiful and brainy redhead. Linda and Ben's paths cross one evening and he recognises her as his boss's daughter - but she doesn't know who Ben is. There is an instant connection between them and in an attempt to hide his identity, he tell her that he is in a band. This innocent lie threatens to expose Ben when it turns out that they like each other more than anticipated. As a result, he decides if he's going to be good enough for Linda, he needs to live up his lie. He makes up his mind to pursue a dream he neglected years ago and starts a band with two of his co-workers. They enter a battle-of-the-bands competition, but soon to realise that a music career is rather daunting. And what will happen when Ben's real identity is revealed to Linda?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["(","She","Sound","Like","Spring",")","is","about","Ben",",","a","mechan","at","a","car","dealership","in","Johannesburg",",","and","Linda",",","a","beauti","and","braini","redhead",".","Linda","and","Ben","'s","path","cross","one","even","and","he","recognis","her","as","his","boss","'s","daughter","-","but","she","doe","n't","know","who","Ben","is",".","There","is","an","instant","connect","between","them","and","in","an","attempt","to","hide","his","ident",",","he","tell","her","that","he","is","in","a","band",".","This","innoc","lie","threaten","to","expos","Ben","when","it","turn","out","that","they","like","each","other","more","than","anticip",".","As","a","result",",","he","decid","if","he","'s","go","to","be","good","enough","for","Linda",",","he","need","to","live","up","his","lie",".","He","make","up","his","mind","to","pursu","a","dream","he","neglect","year","ago","and","start","a","band","with","two","of","his","co-work",".","They","enter","a","battle-of-the-band","competit",",","but","soon","to","realis","that","a","music","career","is","rather","daunt",".","And","what","will","happen","when","Ben","'s","real","ident","is","reveal","to","Linda","?"],"lemmas":["-lrb-","she","sound","like","spring","-rrb-","be","about","Ben",",","a","mechanic","at","a","car","dealership","in","Johannesburg",",","and","Linda",",","a","beautiful","and","brainy","redhead",".","Linda","and","Ben","'s","path","cross","one","evening","and","he","recognise","she","as","he","boss","'s","daughter","-","but","she","do","not","know","who","Ben","be",".","there","be","a","instant","connection","between","they","and","in","a","attempt","to","hide","he","identity",",","he","tell","she","that","he","be","in","a","band",".","this","innocent","lie","threaten","to","expose","Ben","when","it","turn","out","that","they","like","each","other","more","than","anticipate",".","as","a","result",",","he","decide","if","he","be","go","to","be","good","enough","for","Linda",",","he","need","to","live","up","he","lie",".","he","make","up","he","mind","to","pursue","a","dream","he","neglect","year","ago","and","start","a","band","with","two","of","he","co-worker",".","they","enter","a","battle-of-the-bands","competition",",","but","soon","to","realise","that","a","music","career","be","rather","daunting",".","and","what","will","happen","when","Ben","'s","real","identity","be","reveal","to","Linda","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["( She Sounds","She Sounds Like","Sounds Like Spring","Like Spring )","Spring ) is",") is about","is about Ben","about Ben ,","Ben , a",", a mechanic","a mechanic at","mechanic at a","at a car","a car dealership","car dealership in","dealership in Johannesburg","in Johannesburg ,","Johannesburg , and",", and Linda","and Linda ,","Linda , a",", a beautiful","a beautiful and","beautiful and brainy","and brainy redhead","Linda and Ben","and Ben 's","Ben 's paths","'s paths cross","paths cross one","cross one evening","one evening and","evening and he","and he recognises","he recognises her","recognises her as","her as his","as his boss","his boss 's","boss 's daughter","'s daughter -","daughter -

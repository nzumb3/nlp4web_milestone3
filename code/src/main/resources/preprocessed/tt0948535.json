{"title":"Paris 36","plot":"A man is charged with murder. He is Pigoil, the aging stage manager at Chansonia, a music hall in a Paris faubourg. His confession is a long flashback to New Year's Eve, 1935, when he discovers his wife is unfaithful and Galapiat, the local mobster, closes the music hall. Over the next few months, Pigoil loses custody of his beloved son, Jo-Jo, and must find work. Pigoil and his pals take over the Chansonia as a co-op; Galapiat is momentarily benign. Their star is the young Douce, a girl from near Lille for whom Galapiat lusts. She in turn falls in love with Milou, a local Red. There are ups and downs, but mostly ups - but what about Jo-Jo and what about the murder?","genres":["Drama"," Musical"," Music"],"stems":["A","man","is","charg","with","murder",".","He","is","Pigoil",",","the","age","stage","manag","at","Chansonia",",","a","music","hall","in","a","Pari","faubourg",".","His","confess","is","a","long","flashback","to","New","Year","'s","Eve",",","1935",",","when","he","discov","his","wife","is","unfaith","and","Galapiat",",","the","local","mobster",",","close","the","music","hall",".","Over","the","next","few","month",",","Pigoil","lose","custodi","of","his","belov","son",",","Jo-Jo",",","and","must","find","work",".","Pigoil","and","his","pal","take","over","the","Chansonia","as","a","co-op",";","Galapiat","is","momentarili","benign",".","Their","star","is","the","young","Douc",",","a","girl","from","near","Lill","for","whom","Galapiat","lust",".","She","in","turn","fall","in","love","with","Milou",",","a","local","Red",".","There","are","up","and","down",",","but","most","up","-","but","what","about","Jo-Jo","and","what","about","the","murder","?"],"lemmas":["a","man","be","charge","with","murder",".","he","be","Pigoil",",","the","aging","stage","manager","at","Chansonia",",","a","music","hall","in","a","Paris","faubourg",".","he","confession","be","a","long","flashback","to","New","Year","'s","Eve",",","1935",",","when","he","discover","he","wife","be","unfaithful","and","Galapiat",",","the","local","mobster",",","close","the","music","hall",".","over","the","next","few","month",",","Pigoil","lose","custody","of","he","beloved","son",",","jo-jo",",","and","must","find","work",".","pigoil","and","he","pal","take","over","the","Chansonia","as","a","co-op",";","Galapiat","be","momentarily","benign",".","they","star","be","the","young","Douce",",","a","girl","from","near","Lille","for","whom","Galapiat","lust",".","she","in","turn","fall","in","love","with","Milou",",","a","local","Red",".","there","be","up","and","downs",",","but","mostly","up","-","but","what","about","jo-jo","and","what","about","the","murder","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A man is","man is charged","is charged with","charged with murder","He is Pigoil","is Pigoil ,","Pigoil , the",", the aging","the aging stage","aging stage manager","stage manager at","manager at Chansonia","at Chansonia ,","Chansonia , a",", a music","a music hall","music hall in","hall in a","in a Paris","a Paris faubourg","His confession is","confession is a","is a long","a long flashback","long flashback to","flashback to New","to New Year","New Year 's","Year 's Eve","'s Eve ,","Eve , 1935",", 1935 ,","1935 , when",", when he","when he discovers","he discovers his","discovers his wife","his wife is","wife is unfaithful","is unfaithful and","unfaithful and Galapiat","and Galapiat ,","Galapiat , the",", the local","the local mobster","local mobster ,","mobster , closes",", closes the","closes the music","the music hall","Over the next","the next few","next few months","few months ,","months , Pigoil",", Pigoil loses","Pigoil loses custody","loses custody of","custody of his","of his beloved","his beloved son","beloved son ,","son , Jo-Jo",", Jo-Jo ,","Jo-Jo , and",", and must","and must find","must find work","Pigoil and his","and his pals","his pals take","pals take over","take over the","over the Chansonia","the Chansonia as","Chansonia as a","as a co-op","a co-op ;","co-op ;

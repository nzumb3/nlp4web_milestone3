{"title":"When Love Walks In","plot":"Irresponsible... Distant... Self-serving... These are the snapshots that describe John Redgrave. But that's before his wife dies and leaves him alone to raise their three-year-old daughter. Emotionally devastated, John attempts to pick up the pieces of his shattered life as his overzealous father rushes him to find a mother for his little girl. He could fall for Annelise Machiavelli, the aspiring artist he's hired as a baby-sitter, but his lingering grief continues to make him hesitant and uncertain about committing to a new relationship. Though Annelise stands ready to teach him that even tragedy can open the door to new opportunity, self-doubt, selfish ambition, and a crazy potential mother-in-law always seem to get in the way. Grief may conquer him... Fear may ruin him... But everything changes... When Love Walks In.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["Irrespons","...","Distant","...","Self-serv","...","These","are","the","snapshot","that","describ","John","Redgrav",".","But","that","'s","befor","his","wife","die","and","leav","him","alon","to","rais","their","three-year-old","daughter",".","Emotion","devast",",","John","attempt","to","pick","up","the","piec","of","his","shatter","life","as","his","overzeal","father","rush","him","to","find","a","mother","for","his","littl","girl",".","He","could","fall","for","Annelis","Machiavelli",",","the","aspir","artist","he","'s","hire","as","a","baby-sitt",",","but","his","linger","grief","continu","to","make","him","hesit","and","uncertain","about","commit","to","a","new","relationship",".","Though","Annelis","stand","readi","to","teach","him","that","even","tragedi","can","open","the","door","to","new","opportun",",","self-doubt",",","selfish","ambit",",","and","a","crazi","potenti","mother-in-law","alway","seem","to","get","in","the","way",".","Grief","may","conquer","him","...","Fear","may","ruin","him","...","But","everyth","chang","...","When","Love","Walk","In","."],"lemmas":["irresponsible","...","distant","...","self-serving","...","these","be","the","snapshot","that","describe","John","Redgrave",".","but","that","be","before","he","wife","die","and","leave","he","alone","to","raise","they","three-year-old","daughter",".","emotionally","devastate",",","John","attempt","to","pick","up","the","piece","of","he","shattered","life","as","he","overzealous","father","rush","he","to","find","a","mother","for","he","little","girl",".","he","could","fall","for","Annelise","Machiavelli",",","the","aspiring","artist","he","be","hire","as","a","baby-sitter",",","but","he","linger","grief","continue","to","make","he","hesitant","and","uncertain","about","commit","to","a","new","relationship",".","Though","Annelise","stand","ready","to","teach","he","that","even","tragedy","can","open","the","door","to","new","opportunity",",","self-doubt",",","selfish","ambition",",","and","a","crazy","potential","mother-in-law","always","seem","to","get","in","the","way",".","grief","may","conquer","he","...","fear","may","ruin","he","...","but","everything","change","...","when","Love","Walks","In","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Irresponsible ...

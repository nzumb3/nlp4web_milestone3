{"title":"The Geographer Drank His Globe Away","plot":"Victor Sluzhkin signs on as a teacher of geography in a secondary school in his native Perm (in the Urals) and gets lost in a haze of hard vodka, desperate love for a nymphet-like student and the stress of educating teenagers. Geographer, as the students immediately dub Sluzhkin, attempts to escape from the grueling, dull, stultifying reality of Russia's provincial life in a rafting tour to the Urals. Accompanied by wild, adventure-seeking adolescents, faced with the numerous grim surprises of the nature, Geographer is poised to find himself and his own truth.","genres":["Adventure"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Victor","Sluzhkin","sign","on","as","a","teacher","of","geographi","in","a","secondari","school","in","his","nativ","Perm","(","in","the","Ural",")","and","get","lost","in","a","haze","of","hard","vodka",",","desper","love","for","a","nymphet-lik","student","and","the","stress","of","educ","teenag",".","Geograph",",","as","the","student","immedi","dub","Sluzhkin",",","attempt","to","escap","from","the","gruel",",","dull",",","stultifi","realiti","of","Russia","'s","provinci","life","in","a","raft","tour","to","the","Ural",".","Accompani","by","wild",",","adventure-seek","adolesc",",","face","with","the","numer","grim","surpris","of","the","natur",",","Geograph","is","pois","to","find","himself","and","his","own","truth","."],"lemmas":["Victor","Sluzhkin","sign","on","as","a","teacher","of","geography","in","a","secondary","school","in","he","native","Perm","-lrb-","in","the","ural","-rrb-","and","get","lose","in","a","haze","of","hard","vodka",",","desperate","love","for","a","nymphet-like","student","and","the","stress","of","educate","teenager",".","Geographer",",","as","the","student","immediately","dub","Sluzhkin",",","attempt","to","escape","from","the","grueling",",","dull",",","stultifying","reality","of","Russia","'s","provincial","life","in","a","raft","tour","to","the","ural",".","accompany","by","wild",",","adventure-seeking","adolescent",",","face","with","the","numerous","grim","surprise","of","the","nature",",","Geographer","be","poise","to","find","himself","and","he","own","truth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Victor Sluzhkin signs","Sluzhkin signs on","signs on as","on as a","as a teacher","a teacher of","teacher of geography","of geography in","geography in a","in a secondary","a secondary school","secondary school in","school in his","in his native","his native Perm","native Perm (","Perm ( in","( in the","in the Urals","the Urals )","Urals ) and",") and gets","and gets lost","gets lost in","lost in a","in a haze","a haze of","haze of hard","of hard vodka","hard vodka ,","vodka , desperate",", desperate love","desperate love for","love for a","for a nymphet-like","a nymphet-like student","nymphet-like student and","student and the","and the stress","the stress of","stress of educating","of educating teenagers","Geographer , as",", as the","as the students","the students immediately","students immediately dub","immediately dub Sluzhkin","dub Sluzhkin ,","Sluzhkin , attempts",", attempts to","attempts to escape","to escape from","escape from the","from the grueling","the grueling ,","grueling , dull",", dull ,","dull , stultifying",", stultifying reality","stultifying reality of","reality of Russia","of Russia 's","Russia 's provincial","'s provincial life","provincial life in","life in a","in a rafting","a rafting tour","rafting tour to","tour to the","to the Urals","Accompanied by wild","by wild ,","wild , adventure-seeking",", adventure-seeking adolescents","adventure-seeking adolescents ,","adolescents , faced",", faced with","faced with the","with the numerous","the numerous grim","numerous grim surprises","grim surprises of","surprises of the","of the nature","the nature ,","nature , Geographer",", Geographer is","Geographer is poised","is poised to","poised to find","to find himself","find himself and","himself and his","and his own","his own truth"],"2grams":["Victor Sluzhkin","Sluzhkin signs","signs on","on as","as a","a teacher","teacher of","of geography","geography in","in a","a secondary","secondary school","school in","in his","his native","native Perm","Perm (","( in","in the","the Urals","Urals )",") and","and gets","gets lost","lost in","in a","a haze","haze of","of hard","hard vodka","vodka ,",", desperate","desperate love","love for","for a","a nymphet-like","nymphet-like student","student and","and the","the stress","stress of","of educating","educating teenagers","Geographer ,",", as","as the","the students","students immediately","immediately dub","dub Sluzhkin","Sluzhkin ,",", attempts","attempts to","to escape","escape from","from the","the grueling","grueling ,",", dull","dull ,",", stultifying","stultifying reality","reality of","of Russia","Russia 's","'s provincial","provincial life","life in","in a","a rafting","rafting tour","tour to","to the","the Urals","Accompanied by","by wild","wild ,",", adventure-seeking","adventure-seeking adolescents","adolescents ,",", faced","faced with","with the","the numerous","numerous grim","grim surprises","surprises of","of the","the nature","nature ,",", Geographer","Geographer is","is poised","poised to","to find","find himself","himself and","and his","his own","own truth"]}

{"title":"Hodsch Und Ich","plot":"A young man (30) with cancer confronts his disease authentically and unswervingly through his camera lens. In one year he conducts this experiment through interviews and observations on the unusual and absurd parts of life. There's separation and rediscovery of love, security from and powerlessness amongst friends and family, there's humor and insufferable cancer therapy, and there is passion, body awareness and a plan to save his ability to remain fertile. And behind all the horrors, and contrary to his own expectations, he rediscovers beauty in the simple things in life. His existence and body slows down, partially into a trance by the chemotherapy, and by living through a year of extremes looking out on an uncertain future.","genres":["Animation","

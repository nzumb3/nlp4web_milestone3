{"title":"Karakib","plot":"Most of the Egyptians keep a lot of old stuff in the corners of their balconies, and inside the houses there are many invisible corners cluttered with such unused stuff. This phenomenon is so common in all the Egyptians houses to the extent that it became a part of the nature and features of the Egyptian house. The film offers an exciting experience by letting us have a closer look inside the houses of a number of Egyptian families. The Director's lens traces the places where the Egyptians stack their old stuff or as they call it \"Clutter\", trying to figure out \"Why do Egyptians keep their old stuff.\"","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Most","of","the","Egyptian","keep","a","lot","of","old","stuff","in","the","corner","of","their","balconi",",","and","insid","the","hous","there","are","mani","invis","corner","clutter","with","such","unus","stuff",".","This","phenomenon","is","so","common","in","all","the","Egyptian","hous","to","the","extent","that","it","becam","a","part","of","the","natur","and","featur","of","the","Egyptian","hous",".","The","film","offer","an","excit","experi","by","let","us","have","a","closer","look","insid","the","hous","of","a","number","of","Egyptian","famili",".","The","Director","'s","len","trace","the","place","where","the","Egyptian","stack","their","old","stuff","or","as","they","call","it","\"","Clutter","\"",",","tri","to","figur","out","\"","Whi","do","Egyptian","keep","their","old","stuff",".","\""],"lemmas":["most","of","the","Egyptians","keep","a","lot","of","old","stuff","in","the","corner","of","they","balcony",",","and","inside","the","house","there","be","many","invisible","corner","clutter","with","such","unused","stuff",".","this","phenomenon","be","so","common","in","all","the","Egyptians","house","to","the","extent","that","it","become","a","part","of","the","nature","and","feature","of","the","egyptian","house",".","the","film","offer","a","exciting","experience","by","let","we","have","a","closer","look","inside","the","house","of","a","number","of","egyptian","family",".","the","Director","'s","lens","trace","the","place","where","the","Egyptians","stack","they","old","stuff","or","as","they","call","it","``","Clutter","''",",","try","to","figure","out","``","why","do","Egyptians","keep","they","old","stuff",".","''"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Most

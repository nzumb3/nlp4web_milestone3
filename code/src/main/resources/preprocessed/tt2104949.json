{"title":"Nuttin Bafflin","plot":"A small community of 5000 former slaves on a tiny island in the North Eastern Caribbean, mold the accidents of history with their struggle for survival and develop a unique brand of boat racing practiced nowhere else on earth. Every year the villages of Anguilla join together in a celebration of the competitive sport of boat racing. This is no gentlemen's sport. The stakes are high and often dangerous. Although this fierce competition courses through the blood of every Anguillian native many do not know where or how this story began. \"Nuttin Bafflin\" is the first historical film and account of the island of Anguilla and its unique cultural history. A story unknown by the outside world and only passed down to Anguillians as folklore. Tales of blood, salt, struggle, and survival begin when this abandoned colony of slaves were faced with death on a deserted island. Seeing no sure future the islanders took to the sea. They survived only by inventions of their own creative means and eventually became masters of the ocean. They watched the water and the wind and intuitively understood how the sea would move against the hull of their hand crafted ships and how the wind would dance with their custom fashioned sails. They forged into the future creating the heritage and culture known today as Anguilla. 'Nuttin Bafflin' - A tale with a genesis in desperation and destruction and an outcome of passionate triumph and colorful competition.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","small","communiti","of","5000","former","slave","on","a","tini","island","in","the","North","Eastern","Caribbean",",","mold","the","accid","of","histori","with","their","struggl","for","surviv","and","develop","a","uniqu","brand","of","boat","race","practic","nowher","els","on","earth",".","Everi","year","the","villag","of","Anguilla","join","togeth","in","a","celebr","of","the","competit","sport","of","boat","race",".","This","is","no","gentlemen","'s","sport",".","The","stake","are","high","and","often","danger",".","Although","this","fierc","competit","cours","through","the","blood","of","everi","Anguillian","nativ","mani","do","not","know","where","or","how","this","stori","began",".","\"","Nuttin","Bafflin","\"","is","the","first","histor","film","and","account","of","the","island","of","Anguilla","and","it","uniqu","cultur","histori",".","A","stori","unknown","by","the","outsid","world","and","onli","pass","down","to","Anguillian","as","folklor",".","Tale","of","blood",",","salt",",","struggl",",","and","surviv","begin","when","this","abandon","coloni","of","slave","were","face","with","death","on","a","desert","island",".","See","no","sure","futur","the","island","took","to","the","sea",".","They","surviv","onli","by","invent","of","their","own","creativ","mean","and","eventu","becam","master","of","the","ocean",".","They","watch","the","water","and","the","wind","and","intuit","understood","how","the","sea","would","move","against","the","hull","of","their","hand","craft","ship","and","how","the","wind","would","danc","with","their","custom","fashion","sail",".","They","forg","into","the","futur","creat","the","heritag","and","cultur","known","today","as","Anguilla",".","'","Nuttin","Bafflin","'","-","A","tale","with","a","genesi","in","desper","and","destruct","and","an","outcom","of","passion","triumph","and","color","competit","."],"lemmas":["a","small","community","of","5000","former","slave","on","a","tiny","island","in","the","North","Eastern","Caribbean",",","mold","the","accident","of","history","with","they","struggle","for","survival","and","develop","a","unique","brand","of","boat","racing","practice","nowhere","else","on","earth",".","every","year","the","village","of","Anguilla","join","together","in","a","celebration","of","the","competitive","sport","of","boat","racing",".","this","be","no","gentleman","'s","sport",".","the","stake","be","high","and","often","dangerous",".","although","this","fierce","competition","course","through","the","blood","of","every","anguillian","native","many","do","not","know","where","or","how","this","story","begin",".","``","Nuttin","Bafflin","''","be","the","first","historical","film","and","account","of","the","island","of","Anguilla","and","its","unique","cultural","history",".","a","story","unknown","by","the","outside","world","and","only","pass","down","to","anguillian","as","folklore",".","tale","of","blood",",","salt",",","struggle",",","and","survival","begin","when","this","abandoned","colony","of","slave","be","face","with","death","on","a","desert","island",".","see","no","sure","future","the","islander","take","to","the","sea",".","they","survive","only","by","invention","of","they","own","creative","means","and","eventually","become","master","of","the","ocean",".","they","watch","the","water","and","the","wind","and","intuitively","understand","how","the","sea","would","move","against","the","hull","of","they","hand","craft","ship","and","how","the","wind","would","dance","with","they","custom","fashion","sail",".","they","forge","into","the","future","create","the","heritage","and","culture","known","today","as","Anguilla",".","'","Nuttin","Bafflin","'","-","a","tale","with","a","genesis","in","desperation","and","destruction","and","a","outcome","of","passionate","triumph","and","colorful","competition","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

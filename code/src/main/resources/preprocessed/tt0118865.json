{"title":"The Climb","plot":"John Langer, a crusty old civic engineer, has an arsenal full of memories. With irreverent wit, he rattles on, in his irascible humorous style, burning his spicy stories into the imagination of a young neighbor kid, Danny Himes. Danny is a gifted, spirited athlete with something to prove. Worldly, old man Langer has turned his back on proving anything at all. It's post WWII. Danny's father, Earl, did not serve in the military and is considered a coward. Danny excels to overcome his father's reputation while Earl is actually more a man than the town knows. \"You don't smoke, you don't drink, and you don't screw. What kind of man are you anyway?\" old man Langer asks Danny. The more appropriate question is: \"What kind of men are they?\"","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["John","Langer",",","a","crusti","old","civic","engin",",","has","an","arsenal","full","of","memori",".","With","irrever","wit",",","he","rattl","on",",","in","his","irasc","humor","style",",","burn","his","spici","stori","into","the","imagin","of","a","young","neighbor","kid",",","Danni","Hime",".","Danni","is","a","gift",",","spirit","athlet","with","someth","to","prove",".","World",",","old","man","Langer","has","turn","his","back","on","prove","anyth","at","all",".","It","'s","post","WWII",".","Danni","'s","father",",","Earl",",","did","not","serv","in","the","militari","and","is","consid","a","coward",".","Danni","excel","to","overcom","his","father","'s","reput","while","Earl","is","actual","more","a","man","than","the","town","know",".","\"","You","do","n't","smoke",",","you","do","n't","drink",",","and","you","do","n't","screw",".","What","kind","of","man","are","you","anyway","?","\"","old","man","Langer","ask","Danni",".","The","more","appropri","question","is",":","\"","What","kind","of","men","are","they","?","\""],"lemmas":["John","Langer",",","a","crusty","old","civic","engineer",",","have","a","arsenal","full","of","memory",".","with","irreverent","wit",",","he","rattle","on",",","in","he","irascible","humorous","style",",","burn","he","spicy","story","into","the","imagination","of","a","young","neighbor","kid",",","Danny","Himes",".","Danny","be","a","gifted",",","spirited","athlete","with","something","to","prove",".","worldly",",","old","man","Langer","have","turn","he","back","on","prove","anything","at","all",".","it","be","post","WWII",".","Danny","'s","father",",","Earl",",","do","not","serve","in","the","military","and","be","consider","a","coward",".","Danny","excel","to","overcome","he","father","'s","reputation","while","Earl","be","actually","more","a","man","than","the","town","know",".","``","you","do","not","smoke",",","you","do","not","drink",",","and","you","do","not","screw",".","what","kind","of","man","be","you","anyway","?","''","old","man","Langer","ask","Danny",".","the","more","appropriate","question","be",":","``","what","kind","of","man","be","they","?","''"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["John Langer ,","Langer , a",", a crusty","a crusty old","crusty old civic","old civic engineer","civic engineer ,","engineer , has",", has an","has an arsenal","an arsenal full","arsenal full of","full of memories","With irreverent wit","irreverent wit ,","wit , he",", he rattles","he rattles on","rattles on ,","on , in",", in his","in his irascible","his irascible humorous","irascible humorous style","humorous style ,","style , burning",", burning his","burning his spicy","his spicy stories","spicy stories into","stories into the","into the imagination","the imagination of","imagination of a","of a young","a young neighbor","young neighbor kid","neighbor kid ,","kid , Danny",", Danny Himes","Danny is a","is a gifted","a gifted ,","gifted , spirited",", spirited athlete","spirited athlete with","athlete with something","with something to","something to prove","Worldly , old",", old man","old man Langer","man Langer has","Langer has turned","has turned his","turned his back","his back on","back on proving","on proving anything","proving anything at","anything at all","It 's post","'s post WWII","Danny 's father","'s father ,","father , Earl",", Earl ,","Earl , did",", did not","did not serve","not serve in","serve in the","in the military","the military and","military and is","and is considered","is considered a","considered a coward","Danny excels to","excels to overcome","to overcome his","overcome his father","his father 's","father 's reputation","'s reputation while","reputation while Earl","while Earl is","Earl is actually","is actually more","actually more a","more a man","a man than","man than the","than the town","the town knows","\" You do","You do n't","do n't smoke","n't smoke ,","smoke , you",", you do","you do n't","do n't drink","n't drink ,","drink , and",", and you","and you do","you do n't","do n't screw","What kind of","kind of man","of man are","man are you","are you anyway","you anyway ?","anyway ?

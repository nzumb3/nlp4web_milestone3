{"title":"A Date with Ed: Reunion Tour","plot":"A Date With Ed: Reunion Tour is a documentary chronicling a young filmmaker's journey across the Canadian landscape to save a dying friendship and reunite a band that only existed for one afternoon. On the heels of a lack luster career as a competitive skier, Matt (the filmmaker) seeks out his two former best friends to help him find his way back into the greater moment around him. It is an intimate look at a personal journey to live out dreams, hold on to friendship, move into adulthood, and to be in your place and of your time.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"," Comedy"],"stems":["A","Date","With","Ed",":","Reunion","Tour","is","a","documentari","chronicl","a","young","filmmak","'s","journey","across","the","Canadian","landscap","to","save","a","die","friendship","and","reunit","a","band","that","onli","exist","for","one","afternoon",".","On","the","heel","of","a","lack","luster","career","as","a","competit","skier",",","Matt","(","the","filmmak",")","seek","out","his","two","former","best","friend","to","help","him","find","his","way","back","into","the","greater","moment","around","him",".","It","is","an","intim","look","at","a","person","journey","to","live","out","dream",",","hold","on","to","friendship",",","move","into","adulthood",",","and","to","be","in","your","place","and","of","your","time","."],"lemmas":["a","Date","With","Ed",":","Reunion","Tour","be","a","documentary","chronicle","a","young","filmmaker","'s","journey","across","the","canadian","landscape","to","save","a","die","friendship","and","reunite","a","band","that","only","exist","for","one","afternoon",".","on","the","heel","of","a","lack","luster","career","as","a","competitive","skier",",","Matt","-lrb-","the","filmmaker","-rrb-","seek","out","he","two","former","best","friend","to","help","he","find","he","way","back","into","the","greater","moment","around","he",".","it","be","a","intimate","look","at","a","personal","journey","to","live","out","dream",",","hold","on","to","friendship",",","move","into","adulthood",",","and","to","be","in","you","place","and","of","you","time","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["A Date With","Date With Ed","With Ed :","Ed : Reunion",": Reunion Tour","Reunion Tour is","Tour is a","is a documentary","a documentary chronicling","documentary chronicling a","chronicling a young","a young filmmaker","young filmmaker 's","filmmaker 's journey","'s journey across","journey across the","across the Canadian","the Canadian landscape","Canadian landscape to","landscape to save","to save a","save a dying","a dying friendship","dying friendship and","friendship and reunite","and reunite a","reunite a band","a band that","band that only","that only existed","only existed for","existed for one","for one afternoon","On the heels","the heels of","heels of a","of a lack","a lack luster","lack luster career","luster career as","career as a","as a competitive","a competitive skier","competitive skier ,","skier , Matt",", Matt (","Matt ( the","( the filmmaker","the filmmaker )","filmmaker ) seeks",") seeks out","seeks out his","out his two","his two former","two former best","former best friends","best friends to","friends to help","to help him","help him find","him find his","find his way","his way back","way back into","back into the","into the greater","the greater moment","greater moment around","moment around him","It is an","is an intimate","an intimate look","intimate look at","look at a","at a personal","a personal journey","personal journey to","journey to live","to live out","live out dreams","out dreams ,","dreams , hold",", hold on","hold on to","on to friendship","to friendship ,","friendship , move",", move into","move into adulthood","into adulthood ,","adulthood , and",", and to","and to be","to be in","be in your","in your place","your place and","place and of","and of your","of your time"],"2grams":["A Date","Date With","With Ed","Ed :",": Reunion","Reunion Tour","Tour is","is a","a documentary","documentary chronicling","chronicling a","a young","young filmmaker","filmmaker 's","'s journey","journey across","across the","the Canadian","Canadian landscape","landscape to","to save","save a","a dying","dying friendship","friendship and","and reunite","reunite a","a band","band that","that only","only existed","existed for","for one","one afternoon","On the","the heels","heels of","of a","a lack","lack luster","luster career","career as","as a","a competitive","competitive skier","skier ,",", Matt","Matt (","( the","the filmmaker","filmmaker )",") seeks","seeks out","out his","his two","two former","former best","best friends","friends to","to help","help him","him find","find his","his way","way back","back into","into the","the greater","greater moment","moment around","around him","It is","is an","an intimate","intimate look","look at","at a","a personal","personal journey","journey to","to live","live out","out dreams","dreams ,",", hold","hold on","on to","to friendship","friendship ,",", move","move into","into adulthood","adulthood ,",", and","and to","to be","be in","in your","your place","place and","and of","of your","your time"]}

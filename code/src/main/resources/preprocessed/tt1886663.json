{"title":"Satrangee Parachute","plot":"Nainital-based Chhotulal sells iced-golas and lives an impoverished lifestyle with his pretty wife, Sumitra, and a school-going son, Rishabh. He faces criticism from the community after Rishabh runs away, and is located and brought home from Mumbai's Gateway of India. Hardly had Chhotulal's life settled down after this and other incidents involving his son, he will be approached by several other parents in the community who will complain that their children are missing, and may have been influenced by Rishabh's habit of running away from home. Chhotulal does not know that the children have all traveled to Mumbai to try and procure a parachute for a blind girl named Kuhu. He is not aware that the children have reached Mumbai and are being held by the authorities - suspected of aiding terrorists.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["Nainital-bas","Chhotul","sell","iced-gola","and","live","an","impoverish","lifestyl","with","his","pretti","wife",",","Sumitra",",","and","a","school-go","son",",","Rishabh",".","He","face","critic","from","the","communiti","after","Rishabh","run","away",",","and","is","locat","and","brought","home","from","Mumbai","'s","Gateway","of","India",".","Hard","had","Chhotul","'s","life","settl","down","after","this","and","other","incid","involv","his","son",",","he","will","be","approach","by","sever","other","parent","in","the","communiti","who","will","complain","that","their","children","are","miss",",","and","may","have","been","influenc","by","Rishabh","'s","habit","of","run","away","from","home",".","Chhotul","doe","not","know","that","the","children","have","all","travel","to","Mumbai","to","tri","and","procur","a","parachut","for","a","blind","girl","name","Kuhu",".","He","is","not","awar","that","the","children","have","reach","Mumbai","and","are","be","held","by","the","author","-","suspect","of","aid","terrorist","."],"lemmas":["nainital-based","Chhotulal","sell","iced-gola","and","live","a","impoverished","lifestyle","with","he","pretty","wife",",","Sumitra",",","and","a","school-going","son",",","Rishabh",".","he","face","criticism","from","the","community","after","Rishabh","run","away",",","and","be","located","and","bring","home","from","Mumbai","'s","Gateway","of","India",".","hardly","have","Chhotulal","'s","life","settle","down","after","this","and","other","incident","involve","he","son",",","he","will","be","approach","by","several","other","parent","in","the","community","who","will","complain","that","they","child","be","miss",",","and","may","have","be","influence","by","Rishabh","'s","habit","of","run","away","from","home",".","Chhotulal","do","not","know","that","the","child","have","all","travel","to","Mumbai","to","try","and","procure","a","parachute","for","a","blind","girl","name","Kuhu",".","he","be","not","aware","that","the","child","have","reach","Mumbai","and","be","be","hold","by","the","authority","-","suspect","of","aid","terrorist","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Nainital-based Chhotulal sells","Chhotulal sells iced-golas","sells iced-golas and","iced-golas and lives","and lives an","lives an impoverished","an impoverished lifestyle","impoverished lifestyle with","lifestyle with his","with his pretty","his pretty wife","pretty wife ,","wife , Sumitra",", Sumitra ,","Sumitra , and",", and a","and a school-going","a school-going son","school-going son ,","son , Rishabh","He faces criticism","faces criticism from","criticism from the","from the community","the community after","community after Rishabh","after Rishabh runs","Rishabh runs away","runs away ,","away , and",", and is","and is located","is located and","located and brought","and brought home","brought home from","home from Mumbai","from Mumbai 's","Mumbai 's Gateway","'s Gateway of","Gateway of India","Hardly had Chhotulal","had Chhotulal 's","Chhotulal 's life","'s life settled","life settled down","settled down after","down after this","after this and","this and other","and other incidents","other incidents involving","incidents involving his","involving his son","his son ,","son , he",", he will","he will be","will be approached","be approached by","approached by several","by several other","several other parents","other parents in","parents in the","in the community","the community who","community who will","who will complain","will complain that","complain that their","that their children","their children are","children are missing","are missing ,","missing , and",", and may","and may have","may have been","have been influenced","been influenced by","influenced by Rishabh","by Rishabh 's","Rishabh 's habit","'s habit of","habit of running","of running away","running away from","away from home","Chhotulal does not","does not know","not know that","know that the","that the children","the children have","children have all","have all traveled","all traveled to","traveled to Mumbai","to Mumbai to","Mumbai to try","to try and","try and procure","and procure a","procure a parachute","a parachute for","parachute for a","for a blind","a blind girl","blind girl named","girl named Kuhu","He is not","is not aware","not aware that","aware that the","that the children","the children have","children have reached","have reached Mumbai","reached Mumbai and","Mumbai and are","and are being","are being held","being held by","held by the","by the authorities","the authorities -","authorities -

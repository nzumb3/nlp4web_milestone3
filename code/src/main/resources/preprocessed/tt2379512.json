{"title":"Sweetheart Come","plot":"Imagine a country, 82 kilometers long by 57 kilometers large. All around are borders. What's between these borders? 500.000 people: Many are rich, some are poor. All are looking for happiness, but one person's innermost desire may be his neighbor's taboo. This film deals with the borders we cross with great strides... and the walls we're building up inside to protect ourselves. Through portraits of eleven people with vastly different backgrounds, from spoiled teen to a physically handicapped couple, from aged dominatrix to a freshly ordained priest, \"Sweetheart, come\" asks the question: in a society of stupendous wealth and diversity, what must people do to belong?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Imagin","a","countri",",","82","kilomet","long","by","57","kilomet","larg",".","All","around","are","border",".","What","'s","between","these","border","?","500.000","peopl",":","Mani","are","rich",",","some","are","poor",".","All","are","look","for","happi",",","but","one","person","'s","innermost","desir","may","be","his","neighbor","'s","taboo",".","This","film","deal","with","the","border","we","cross","with","great","stride","...","and","the","wall","we","re","build","up","insid","to","protect","ourselv",".","Through","portrait","of","eleven","peopl","with","vast","differ","background",",","from","spoil","teen","to","a","physic","handicap","coupl",",","from","age","dominatrix","to","a","fresh","ordain","priest",",","\"","Sweetheart",",","come","\"","ask","the","question",":","in","a","societi","of","stupend","wealth","and","divers",",","what","must","peopl","do","to","belong","?"],"lemmas":["imagine","a","country",",","82","kilometer","long","by","57","kilometer","large",".","all","around","be","border",".","what","be","between","these","border","?","500.000","people",":","many","be","rich",",","some","be","poor",".","all","be","look","for","happiness",",","but","one","person","'s","innermost","desire","may","be","he","neighbor","'s","taboo",".","this","film","deal","with","the","border","we","cross","with","great","stride","...","and","the","wall","we","be","build","up","inside","to","protect","ourselves",".","through","portrait","of","eleven","people","with","vastly","different","background",",","from","spoil","teen","to","a","physically","handicapped","couple",",","from","aged","dominatrix","to","a","freshly","ordain","priest",",","``","sweetheart",",","come","''","ask","the","question",":","in","a","society","of","stupendous","wealth","and","diversity",",","what","must","people","do","to","belong","?"],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Imagine

{"title":"Dabbe: Bir Cin Vakasi","plot":"Turkish director Hasan Karacadag is something of an unusual case. In a nation that appears uncertain how to feel about its own history with exploitation film and generally reluctant to embrace genre film - though there are obvious exceptions - Karacadag has jumped headlong into the horror pool. The director first came to attention with the J-horror influenced D@BB, a surprise hit in Turkey that allowed Karacadag to move on to the more visually ambitious - and effects heavy - effort, Semum. Both film showcased Karacadag's growing ability to shock and terrify his audiences by taking the rich folklore of his country and pushing it to its dark extremes. And he's at it again with D@BB: Bir Cin Vakasi. The sequel to his original hit, this latest efforts puts away the Japanese influence in favor of a more Paranormal vibe, but the underlying mythology remains purely regional with the story following a Turkish family whose home is possessed by angry jinns.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Turkish","director","Hasan","Karacadag","is","someth","of","an","unusu","case",".","In","a","nation","that","appear","uncertain","how","to","feel","about","it","own","histori","with","exploit","film","and","general","reluct","to","embrac","genr","film","-","though","there","are","obvious","except","-","Karacadag","has","jump","headlong","into","the","horror","pool",".","The","director","first","came","to","attent","with","the","J-horror","influenc","D@BB,","a","surpris","hit","in","Turkey","that","allow","Karacadag","to","move","on","to","the","more","visual","ambiti","-","and","effect","heavi","-","effort",",","Semum",".","Both","film","showcas","Karacadag","'s","grow","abil","to","shock","and","terrifi","his","audienc","by","take","the","rich","folklor","of","his","countri","and","push","it","to","it","dark","extrem",".","And","he","'s","at","it","again","with","D@BB:","Bir","Cin","Vakasi",".","The","sequel","to","his","origin","hit",",","this","latest","effort","put","away","the","Japanes","influenc","in","favor","of","a","more","Paranorm","vibe",",","but","the","under","mytholog","remain","pure","region","with","the","stori","follow","a","Turkish","famili","whose","home","is","possess","by","angri","jinn","."],"lemmas":["turkish","director","Hasan","Karacadag","be","something","of","a","unusual","case",".","in","a","nation","that","appear","uncertain","how","to","feel","about","its","own","history","with","exploitation","film","and","generally","reluctant","to","embrace","genre","film","-","though","there","be","obvious","exception","-","Karacadag","have","jump","headlong","into","the","horror","pool",".","the","director","first","come","to","attention","with","the","j-horror","influence","d@bb,","a","surprise","hit","in","Turkey","that","allow","Karacadag","to","move","on","to","the","more","visually","ambitious","-","and","effect","heavy","-","effort",",","Semum",".","both","film","showcase","Karacadag","'s","grow","ability","to","shock","and","terrify","he","audience","by","take","the","rich","folklore","of","he","country","and","push","it","to","its","dark","extreme",".","and","he","be","at","it","again","with","D@BB:","Bir","Cin","Vakasi",".","the","sequel","to","he","original","hit",",","this","latest","effort","put","away","the","japanese","influence","in","favor","of","a","more","Paranormal","vibe",",","but","the","underlying","mythology","remain","purely","regional","with","the","story","follow","a","turkish","family","whose","home","be","possess","by","angry","jinn","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Turkish director Hasan","director Hasan Karacadag","Hasan Karacadag is","Karacadag is something","is something of","something of an","of an unusual","an unusual case","In a nation","a nation that","nation that appears","that appears uncertain","appears uncertain how","uncertain how to","how to feel","to feel about","feel about its","about its own","its own history","own history with","history with exploitation","with exploitation film","exploitation film and","film and generally","and generally reluctant","generally reluctant to","reluctant to embrace","to embrace genre","embrace genre film","genre film -","film -

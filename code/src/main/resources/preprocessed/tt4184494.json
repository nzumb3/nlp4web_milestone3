{"title":"My Life in China","plot":"In America, everyone has a family story of immigration. Every family, at some point, has had somebody leave their native country behind to search for a better life. How did they hold onto their identity? How did they adapt to their new life? Every family has a special story. In my case, it's my Chinese-American story. My father would always tell us his story about walking for 7 days and 6 nights, before swimming for 4 hours to Macau to escape communism in 1966. His story would fall on my deaf ears until I returned to China with him.","genres":["Biography"," Family"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","America",",","everyon","has","a","famili","stori","of","immigr",".","Everi","famili",",","at","some","point",",","has","had","somebodi","leav","their","nativ","countri","behind","to","search","for","a","better","life",".","How","did","they","hold","onto","their","ident","?","How","did","they","adapt","to","their","new","life","?","Everi","famili","has","a","special","stori",".","In","my","case",",","it","'s","my","Chinese-American","stori",".","My","father","would","alway","tell","us","his","stori","about","walk","for","7","day","and","6","night",",","befor","swim","for","4","hour","to","Macau","to","escap","communism","in","1966",".","His","stori","would","fall","on","my","deaf","ear","until","I","return","to","China","with","him","."],"lemmas":["in","America",",","everyone","have","a","family","story","of","immigration",".","every","family",",","at","some","point",",","have","have","somebody","leave","they","native","country","behind","to","search","for","a","better","life",".","how","do","they","hold","onto","they","identity","?","how","do","they","adapt","to","they","new","life","?","every","family","have","a","special","story",".","in","my","case",",","it","be","my","Chinese-American","story",".","my","father","would","always","tell","we","he","story","about","walk","for","7","day","and","6","night",",","before","swim","for","4","hour","to","Macau","to","escape","communism","in","1966",".","he","story","would","fall","on","my","deaf","ear","until","I","return","to","China","with","he","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In America ,","America , everyone",", everyone has","everyone has a","has a family","a family story","family story of","story of immigration","Every family ,","family , at",", at some","at some point","some point ,","point , has",", has had","has had somebody","had somebody leave","somebody leave their","leave their native","their native country","native country behind","country behind to","behind to search","to search for","search for a","for a better","a better life","How did they","did they hold","they hold onto","hold onto their","onto their identity","How did they","did they adapt","they adapt to","adapt to their","to their new","their new life","Every family has","family has a","has a special","a special story","In my case","my case ,","case , it",", it 's","it 's my","'s my Chinese-American","my Chinese-American story","My father would","father would always","would always tell","always tell us","tell us his","us his story","his story about","story about walking","about walking for","walking for 7","for 7 days","7 days and","days and 6","and 6 nights","6 nights ,","nights , before",", before swimming","before swimming for","swimming for 4","for 4 hours","4 hours to","hours to Macau","to Macau to","Macau to escape","to escape communism","escape communism in","communism in 1966","His story would","story would fall","would fall on","fall on my","on my deaf","my deaf ears","deaf ears until","ears until I","until I returned","I returned to","returned to China","to China with","China with him"],"2grams":["In America","America ,",", everyone","everyone has","has a","a family","family story","story of","of immigration","Every family","family ,",", at","at some","some point","point ,",", has","has had","had somebody","somebody leave","leave their","their native","native country","country behind","behind to","to search","search for","for a","a better","better life","How did","did they","they hold","hold onto","onto their","their identity","How did","did they","they adapt","adapt to","to their","their new","new life","Every family","family has","has a","a special","special story","In my","my case","case ,",", it","it 's","'s my","my Chinese-American","Chinese-American story","My father","father would","would always","always tell","tell us","us his","his story","story about","about walking","walking for","for 7","7 days","days and","and 6","6 nights","nights ,",", before","before swimming","swimming for","for 4","4 hours","hours to","to Macau","Macau to","to escape","escape communism","communism in","in 1966","His story","story would","would fall","fall on","on my","my deaf","deaf ears","ears until","until I","I returned","returned to","to China","China with","with him"]}

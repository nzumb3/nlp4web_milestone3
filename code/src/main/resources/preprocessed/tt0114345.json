{"title":"The Scarlet Letter","plot":"In 1666 in the Massachusetts Bay colony, Puritans and Algonquian have an uneasy truce. Hester arrives from England, seeking independence. Awaiting her husband, she establishes independence, fixing up a house, befriending Quakers and other outsiders. Passion draws her to a young pastor. He feels the same; when they learn her husband has probably died at the hands of Indians, they consummate their love. A child is born, and on the day Hester is publicly humiliated and made to wear a scarlet letter, her husband appears after a year with Indians. Calling himself Chillingworth, he seeks revenge, searching out Hester's lover and stirring fears of witchcraft. Will his murderous plot succeed?","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["In","1666","in","the","Massachusett","Bay","coloni",",","Puritan","and","Algonquian","have","an","uneasi","truce",".","Hester","arriv","from","England",",","seek","independ",".","Await","her","husband",",","she","establish","independ",",","fix","up","a","hous",",","befriend","Quaker","and","other","outsid",".","Passion","draw","her","to","a","young","pastor",".","He","feel","the","same",";","when","they","learn","her","husband","has","probabl","die","at","the","hand","of","Indian",",","they","consumm","their","love",".","A","child","is","born",",","and","on","the","day","Hester","is","public","humili","and","made","to","wear","a","scarlet","letter",",","her","husband","appear","after","a","year","with","Indian",".","Call","himself","Chillingworth",",","he","seek","reveng",",","search","out","Hester","'s","lover","and","stir","fear","of","witchcraft",".","Will","his","murder","plot","succeed","?"],"lemmas":["in","1666","in","the","Massachusetts","Bay","colony",",","Puritans","and","Algonquian","have","a","uneasy","truce",".","Hester","arrive","from","England",",","seek","independence",".","await","she","husband",",","she","establish","independence",",","fix","up","a","house",",","befriend","Quakers","and","other","outsider",".","passion","draw","she","to","a","young","pastor",".","he","feel","the","same",";","when","they","learn","she","husband","have","probably","die","at","the","hand","of","Indians",",","they","consummate","they","love",".","a","child","be","bear",",","and","on","the","day","Hester","be","publicly","humiliate","and","make","to","wear","a","scarlet","letter",",","she","husband","appear","after","a","year","with","Indians",".","call","himself","Chillingworth",",","he","seek","revenge",",","search","out","Hester","'s","lover","and","stir","fear","of","witchcraft",".","will","he","murderous","plot","succeed","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In 1666 in","1666 in the","in the Massachusetts","the Massachusetts Bay","Massachusetts Bay colony","Bay colony ,","colony , Puritans",", Puritans and","Puritans and Algonquian","and Algonquian have","Algonquian have an","have an uneasy","an uneasy truce","Hester arrives from","arrives from England","from England ,","England , seeking",", seeking independence","Awaiting her husband","her husband ,","husband , she",", she establishes","she establishes independence","establishes independence ,","independence , fixing",", fixing up","fixing up a","up a house","a house ,","house , befriending",", befriending Quakers","befriending Quakers and","Quakers and other","and other outsiders","Passion draws her","draws her to","her to a","to a young","a young pastor","He feels the","feels the same","the same ;","same ;

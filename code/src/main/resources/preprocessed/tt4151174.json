{"title":"Water to Tabato","plot":"In mid-summer 2011, Paulo Carneiro and set out as assistant director for a film crew working on a project on the west African coast. There he unexpectedly ended up shooting his own film, a documentary report about a sinking ship near the coast of Guinea-Bissau on which he was a passenger. The digital camera records the growing panic on the ship after it has gotten stuck in the ocean in an oppressive nighttime atmosphere. In shaky interview footage, we see passengers move from an initial apathy to nervous anxiety, and from there fluidly to a fear for their lives. The growing tension on board is reflected in the film's ever quickening tempo.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","mid-summ","2011",",","Paulo","Carneiro","and","set","out","as","assist","director","for","a","film","crew","work","on","a","project","on","the","west","African","coast",".","There","he","unexpect","end","up","shoot","his","own","film",",","a","documentari","report","about","a","sink","ship","near","the","coast","of","Guinea-Bissau","on","which","he","was","a","passeng",".","The","digit","camera","record","the","grow","panic","on","the","ship","after","it","has","gotten","stuck","in","the","ocean","in","an","oppress","nighttim","atmospher",".","In","shaki","interview","footag",",","we","see","passeng","move","from","an","initi","apathi","to","nervous","anxieti",",","and","from","there","fluid","to","a","fear","for","their","live",".","The","grow","tension","on","board","is","reflect","in","the","film","'s","ever","quicken","tempo","."],"lemmas":["in","mid-summer","2011",",","Paulo","Carneiro","and","set","out","as","assistant","director","for","a","film","crew","work","on","a","project","on","the","west","african","coast",".","there","he","unexpectedly","end","up","shoot","he","own","film",",","a","documentary","report","about","a","sink","ship","near","the","coast","of","Guinea-Bissau","on","which","he","be","a","passenger",".","the","digital","camera","record","the","grow","panic","on","the","ship","after","it","have","get","stick","in","the","ocean","in","a","oppressive","nighttime","atmosphere",".","in","shaky","interview","footage",",","we","see","passenger","move","from","a","initial","apathy","to","nervous","anxiety",",","and","from","there","fluidly","to","a","fear","for","they","life",".","the","grow","tension","on","board","be","reflect","in","the","film","'s","ever","quicken","tempo","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In

Tired, cold and miles away from the nearest town, the true danger begins to dawn on the passengers as they find themselves being picked off by a group of demonic creatures, enraged by the fact that humans have strayed into their murky territory.","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Four","car","lie","strand","on","a","dark","and","desol","countri","road","in","the","middl","of","the","night","-","the","aftermath","of","a","car","crash",".","Tension","run","high","as","the","survivor","struggl","to","resolv","the","situat",",","but","they","soon","realis","that","the","worst","is","far","from","over","...","Tire",",","cold","and","mile","away","from","the","nearest","town",",","the","true","danger","begin","to","dawn","on","the","passeng","as","they","find","themselv","be","pick","off","by","a","group","of","demon","creatur",",","enrag","by","the","fact","that","human","have","stray","into","their","murki","territori","."],"lemmas":["four","car","lie","strand","on","a","dark","and","desolate","country","road","in","the","middle","of","the","night","-","the","aftermath","of","a","car","crash",".","tension","run","high","as","the","survivor","struggle","to","resolve","the","situation",",","but","they","soon","realise","that","the","worst","be","far","from","over","...","tired",",","cold","and","mile","away","from","the","nearest","town",",","the","true","danger","begin","to","dawn","on","the","passenger","as","they","find","themselves","be","pick","off","by","a","group","of","demonic","creature",",","enrage","by","the","fact","that","human","have","stray","into","they","murky","territory","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Four cars lie","cars lie stranded","lie stranded on","stranded on a","on a dark","a dark and","dark and desolate","and desolate country","desolate country road","country road in","road in the","in the middle","the middle of","middle of the","of the night","the night -","night - the","- the aftermath","the aftermath of","aftermath of a","of a car","a car crash","Tensions run high","run high as","high as the","as the survivors","the survivors struggle","survivors struggle to","struggle to resolve","to resolve the","resolve the situation","the situation ,","situation , but",", but they","but they soon","they soon realise","soon realise that","realise that the","that the worst","the worst is","worst is far","is far from","far from over","from over ...","over ...

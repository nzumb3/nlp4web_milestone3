{"title":"I Do, Maybe?","plot":"Brad and Monica are excited about their upcoming wedding, but every time they turn around something happens. If it's not the baby mama drama with Cindy, the in-laws and their opinions and feuds, the step child, the friends who can't mind their own business and think they are giving you the right advice or the unforeseen accidents, they probably wouldn't doubt their decision to marry. Can their love be strong enough to pull them through the dilemmas? When all the smoke clears and the truth is out, will there be a \"happily\" ever after?","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Brad","and","Monica","are","excit","about","their","upcom","wed",",","but","everi","time","they","turn","around","someth","happen",".","If","it","'s","not","the","babi","mama","drama","with","Cindi",",","the","in-law","and","their","opinion","and","feud",",","the","step","child",",","the","friend","who","ca","n't","mind","their","own","busi","and","think","they","are","give","you","the","right","advic","or","the","unforeseen","accid",",","they","probabl","would","n't","doubt","their","decis","to","marri",".","Can","their","love","be","strong","enough","to","pull","them","through","the","dilemma","?","When","all","the","smoke","clear","and","the","truth","is","out",",","will","there","be","a","\"","happili","\"","ever","after","?"],"lemmas":["Brad","and","Monica","be","excited","about","they","upcome","wedding",",","but","every","time","they","turn","around","something","happen",".","if","it","be","not","the","baby","mama","drama","with","Cindy",",","the","in-law","and","they","opinion","and","feud",",","the","step","child",",","the","friend","who","can","not","mind","they","own","business","and","think","they","be","give","you","the","right","advice","or","the","unforeseen","accident",",","they","probably","would","not","doubt","they","decision","to","marry",".","can","they","love","be","strong","enough","to","pull","they","through","the","dilemma","?","when","all","the","smoke","clear","and","the","truth","be","out",",","will","there","be","a","``","happily","''","ever","after","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Brad and Monica","and Monica are","Monica are excited","are excited about","excited about their","about their upcoming","their upcoming wedding","upcoming wedding ,","wedding , but",", but every","but every time","every time they","time they turn","they turn around","turn around something","around something happens","If it 's","it 's not","'s not the","not the baby","the baby mama","baby mama drama","mama drama with","drama with Cindy","with Cindy ,","Cindy , the",", the in-laws","the in-laws and","in-laws and their","and their opinions","their opinions and","opinions and feuds","and feuds ,","feuds , the",", the step","the step child","step child ,","child , the",", the friends","the friends who","friends who ca","who ca n't","ca n't mind","n't mind their","mind their own","their own business","own business and","business and think","and think they","think they are","they are giving","are giving you","giving you the","you the right","the right advice","right advice or","advice or the","or the unforeseen","the unforeseen accidents","unforeseen accidents ,","accidents , they",", they probably","they probably would","probably would n't","would n't doubt","n't doubt their","doubt their decision","their decision to","decision to marry","Can their love","their love be","love be strong","be strong enough","strong enough to","enough to pull","to pull them","pull them through","them through the","through the dilemmas","When all the","all the smoke","the smoke clears","smoke clears and","clears and the","and the truth","the truth is","truth is out","is out ,","out , will",", will there","will there be","there be a","be a \"","a \" happily","\" happily \"","happily \" ever","\" ever after"],"2grams":["Brad and","and Monica","Monica are","are excited","excited about","about their","their upcoming","upcoming wedding","wedding ,",", but","but every","every time","time they","they turn","turn around","around something","something happens","If it","it 's","'s not","not the","the baby","baby mama","mama drama","drama with","with Cindy","Cindy ,",", the","the in-laws","in-laws and","and their","their opinions","opinions and","and feuds","feuds ,",", the","the step","step child","child ,",", the","the friends","friends who","who ca","ca n't","n't mind","mind their","their own","own business","business and","and think","think they","they are","are giving","giving you","you the","the right","right advice","advice or","or the","the unforeseen","unforeseen accidents","accidents ,",", they","they probably","probably would","would n't","n't doubt","doubt their","their decision","decision to","to marry","Can their","their love","love be","be strong","strong enough","enough to","to pull","pull them","them through","through the","the dilemmas","When all","all the","the smoke","smoke clears","clears and","and the","the truth","truth is","is out","out ,",", will","will there","there be","be a","a \"","\" happily","happily \"","\" ever","ever after"]}

{"title":"Forgive Us","plot":"After losing 83 colleagues on September 11th, 2001, the film director Anthony Haden West, saw the US, his newly adopted homeland, descend into a thinly disguised anti-Muslim frenzy that left him aghast. He is traditionally Christian but had no understanding of evangelical America. He picked up a camera and followed 4 US missionaries through Muslim parts of Africa over 5 years. The film is tender, warm, close to the characters but still shows a sample of a vast global trend in religious fundamentalism.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["After","lose","83","colleagu","on","Septemb","11th",",","2001",",","the","film","director","Anthoni","Haden","West",",","saw","the","US",",","his","newli","adopt","homeland",",","descend","into","a","thin","disguis","anti-Muslim","frenzi","that","left","him","aghast",".","He","is","tradit","Christian","but","had","no","understand","of","evangel","America",".","He","pick","up","a","camera","and","follow","4","US","missionari","through","Muslim","part","of","Africa","over","5","year",".","The","film","is","tender",",","warm",",","close","to","the","charact","but","still","show","a","sampl","of","a","vast","global","trend","in","religi","fundament","."],"lemmas":["after","lose","83","colleague","on","September","11th",",","2001",",","the","film","director","Anthony","Haden","West",",","see","the","US",",","he","newly","adopt","homeland",",","descend","into","a","thinly","disguise","anti-muslim","frenzy","that","leave","he","aghast",".","he","be","traditionally","christian","but","have","no","understanding","of","evangelical","America",".","he","pick","up","a","camera","and","follow","4","US","missionary","through","muslim","part","of","Africa","over","5","year",".","the","film","be","tender",",","warm",",","close","to","the","character","but","still","show","a","sample","of","a","vast","global","trend","in","religious","fundamentalism","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["After losing 83","losing 83 colleagues","83 colleagues on","colleagues on September","on September 11th","September 11th ,","11th , 2001",", 2001 ,","2001 , the",", the film","the film director","film director Anthony","director Anthony Haden","Anthony Haden West","Haden West ,","West , saw",", saw the","saw the US","the US ,","US , his",", his newly","his newly adopted","newly adopted homeland","adopted homeland ,","homeland , descend",", descend into","descend into a","into a thinly","a thinly disguised","thinly disguised anti-Muslim","disguised anti-Muslim frenzy","anti-Muslim frenzy that","frenzy that left","that left him","left him aghast","He is traditionally","is traditionally Christian","traditionally Christian but","Christian but had","but had no","had no understanding","no understanding of","understanding of evangelical","of evangelical America","He picked up","picked up a","up a camera","a camera and","camera and followed","and followed 4","followed 4 US","4 US missionaries","US missionaries through","missionaries through Muslim","through Muslim parts","Muslim parts of","parts of Africa","of Africa over","Africa over 5","over 5 years","The film is","film is tender","is tender ,","tender , warm",", warm ,","warm , close",", close to","close to the","to the characters","the characters but","characters but still","but still shows","still shows a","shows a sample","a sample of","sample of a","of a vast","a vast global","vast global trend","global trend in","trend in religious","in religious fundamentalism"],"2grams":["After losing","losing 83","83 colleagues","colleagues on","on September","September 11th","11th ,",", 2001","2001 ,",", the","the film","film director","director Anthony","Anthony Haden","Haden West","West ,",", saw","saw the","the US","US ,",", his","his newly","newly adopted","adopted homeland","homeland ,",", descend","descend into","into a","a thinly","thinly disguised","disguised anti-Muslim","anti-Muslim frenzy","frenzy that","that left","left him","him aghast","He is","is traditionally","traditionally Christian","Christian but","but had","had no","no understanding","understanding of","of evangelical","evangelical America","He picked","picked up","up a","a camera","camera and","and followed","followed 4","4 US","US missionaries","missionaries through","through Muslim","Muslim parts","parts of","of Africa","Africa over","over 5","5 years","The film","film is","is tender","tender ,",", warm","warm ,",", close","close to","to the","the characters","characters but","but still","still shows","shows a","a sample","sample of","of a","a vast","vast global","global trend","trend in","in religious","religious fundamentalism"]}

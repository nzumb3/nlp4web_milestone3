{"title":"Today We Saw the Face of God","plot":"In January of 2010, a team of 23 volunteers set off on what should have been an ordinary medical mission. They had no way of knowing the devastation to come. On their final evening, they treated their last patient and set off towards their sleeping quarters. Suddenly they felt a jolt of panic as the world began to shake violently beneath them. Within hours, the entire team was thrust into the center of one of the worst natural disasters in modern history. The documentary film, Today We Saw the Face of God transcends viewers from their comfortable homes into the poverty-stricken world that Haitians navigate daily. As the team journeys back, they recount the harrowing reality of being first responders in an unprecedented medical crisis.","genres":["Documentary","

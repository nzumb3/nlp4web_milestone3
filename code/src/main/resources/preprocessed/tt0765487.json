Investigators are baffled, and the chase to find the killer begins.","genres":["Horror"," Mystery"],"stems":["Montag","the","Magnific","(","Glover",")","is","a","master","illusionist","who","perform","at","underground","venu",",","select","femal","volunt","from","his","rave-lik","audienc",".","To","their","hysteria",",","it","appear","he","'s","dismemb","their","bodi",",","but","his","sleight","of","hand","has","them","fool",".","Howev",",","femal","bodi","show","up","dead","from","the","same","wound","perform","on","stage",".","Investig","are","baffl",",","and","the","chase","to","find","the","killer","begin","."],"lemmas":["Montag","the","Magnificent","-lrb-","Glover","-rrb-","be","a","master","illusionist","who","perform","at","underground","venue",",","select","female","volunteer","from","he","rave-like","audience",".","to","they","hysteria",",","it","appear","he","be","dismember","they","body",",","but","he","sleight","of","hand","have","they","fool",".","however",",","female","body","show","up","dead","from","the","same","wound","perform","on","stage",".","investigator","be","baffle",",","and","the","chase","to","find","the","killer","begin","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Montag the Magnificent","the Magnificent (","Magnificent ( Glover","( Glover )","Glover ) is",") is a","is a master","a master illusionist","master illusionist who","illusionist who performs","who performs at","performs at underground","at underground venues","underground venues ,","venues , selecting",", selecting female","selecting female volunteers","female volunteers from","volunteers from his","from his rave-like","his rave-like audiences","To their hysteria","their hysteria ,","hysteria , it",", it appears","it appears he","appears he 's","he 's dismembered","'s dismembered their","dismembered their bodies","their bodies ,","bodies , but",", but his","but his sleight","his sleight of","sleight of hand","of hand has","hand has them","has them fooled","However , female",", female bodies","female bodies show","bodies show up","show up dead","up dead from","dead from the","from the same","the same wounds","same wounds performed","wounds performed on","performed on stage","Investigators are baffled","are baffled ,","baffled , and",", and the","and the chase","the chase to","chase to find","to find the","find the killer","the killer begins"],"2grams":["Montag the","the Magnificent","Magnificent (","( Glover","Glover )",") is","is a","a master","master illusionist","illusionist who","who performs","performs at","at underground","underground venues","venues ,",", selecting","selecting female","female volunteers","volunteers from","from his","his rave-like","rave-like audiences","To their","their hysteria","hysteria ,",", it","it appears","appears he","he 's","'s dismembered","dismembered their","their bodies","bodies ,",", but","but his","his sleight","sleight of","of hand","hand has","has them","them fooled","However ,",", female","female bodies","bodies show","show up","up dead","dead from","from the","the same","same wounds","wounds performed","performed on","on stage","Investigators are","are baffled","baffled ,",", and","and the","the chase","chase to","to find","find the","the killer","killer begins"]}

{"title":"Janela da Alma","plot":"Nineteen people with differing degrees of visual impairment - from mild nearsightedness to total blindness - discuss how they see themselves, how they see others and how they perceive the world. Writer and Nobel laureate José Saramago, musician Hermeto Paschoal, filmmaker Wim Wenders, blind Franco-Slovenian photographer Evgen Bavcar, neurologist Oliver Sacks, actress Marieta Severo, blind city councilman Arnaldo Godoy, among others, make personal and surprising revelations about various aspects of vision - the physiological working of the eye; the use of glasses and what it means about personality; the meaning of seeing or not seeing in a world saturated by images; and, also, the importance of emotions in transforming reality if, that is, there is such a thing common to all. Unusual images, of burning trees or empty deserts, link the interviews, which vary from deep to funny to poetic.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Nineteen","peopl","with","differ","degre","of","visual","impair","-","from","mild","nearsighted","to","total","blind","-","discuss","how","they","see","themselv",",","how","they","see","other","and","how","they","perceiv","the","world",".","Writer","and","Nobel","laureat","José","Saramago",",","musician","Hermeto","Paschoal",",","filmmak","Wim","Wender",",","blind","Franco-Slovenian","photograph","Evgen","Bavcar",",","neurologist","Oliver","Sack",",","actress","Marieta","Severo",",","blind","citi","councilman","Arnaldo","Godoy",",","among","other",",","make","person","and","surpris","revel","about","various","aspect","of","vision","-","the","physiolog","work","of","the","eye",";","the","use","of","glass","and","what","it","mean","about","person",";","the","mean","of","see","or","not","see","in","a","world","satur","by","imag",";","and",",","also",",","the","import","of","emot","in","transform","realiti","if",",","that","is",",","there","is","such","a","thing","common","to","all",".","Unusual","imag",",","of","burn","tree","or","empti","desert",",","link","the","interview",",","which","vari","from","deep","to","funni","to","poetic","."],"lemmas":["nineteen","people","with","differ","degree","of","visual","impairment","-","from","mild","nearsightedness","to","total","blindness","-","discuss","how","they","see","themselves",",","how","they","see","other","and","how","they","perceive","the","world",".","writer","and","Nobel","laureate","José","Saramago",",","musician","Hermeto","Paschoal",",","filmmaker","Wim","Wenders",",","blind","Franco-Slovenian","photographer","Evgen","Bavcar",",","neurologist","Oliver","Sacks",",","actress","Marieta","Severo",",","blind","city","councilman","Arnaldo","Godoy",",","among","other",",","make","personal","and","surprising","revelation","about","various","aspect","of","vision","-","the","physiological","working","of","the","eye",";","the","use","of","glass","and","what","it","mean","about","personality",";","the","meaning","of","see","or","not","see","in","a","world","saturate","by","image",";","and",",","also",",","the","importance","of","emotion","in","transform","reality","if",",","that","be",",","there","be","such","a","thing","common","to","all",".","unusual","image",",","of","burning","tree","or","empty","desert",",","link","the","interview",",","which","vary","from","deep","to","funny","to","poetic","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Nineteen people with","people with differing","with differing degrees","differing degrees of","degrees of visual","of visual impairment","visual impairment -","impairment - from","- from mild","from mild nearsightedness","mild nearsightedness to","nearsightedness to total","to total blindness","total blindness -","blindness - discuss","- discuss how","discuss how they","how they see","they see themselves","see themselves ,","themselves , how",", how they","how they see","they see others","see others and","others and how","and how they","how they perceive","they perceive the","perceive the world","Writer and Nobel","and Nobel laureate","Nobel laureate José","laureate José Saramago","José Saramago ,","Saramago , musician",", musician Hermeto","musician Hermeto Paschoal","Hermeto Paschoal ,","Paschoal , filmmaker",", filmmaker Wim","filmmaker Wim Wenders","Wim Wenders ,","Wenders , blind",", blind Franco-Slovenian","blind Franco-Slovenian photographer","Franco-Slovenian photographer Evgen","photographer Evgen Bavcar","Evgen Bavcar ,","Bavcar , neurologist",", neurologist Oliver","neurologist Oliver Sacks","Oliver Sacks ,","Sacks , actress",", actress Marieta","actress Marieta Severo","Marieta Severo ,","Severo , blind",", blind city","blind city councilman","city councilman Arnaldo","councilman Arnaldo Godoy","Arnaldo Godoy ,","Godoy , among",", among others","among others ,","others , make",", make personal","make personal and","personal and surprising","and surprising revelations","surprising revelations about","revelations about various","about various aspects","various aspects of","aspects of vision","of vision -","vision - the","- the physiological","the physiological working","physiological working of","working of the","of the eye","the eye ;","eye ;

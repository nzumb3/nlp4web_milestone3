{"title":"The Cost of Living","plot":"This hilarious comedy is about the bad decisions that people can make while living under a \"broke mentality\"! When an elderly couple runs into some financial troubles, and their only way out is death or living on the streets, George plots a clever life insurance scam behind his wife's back, one that ensures their son will never have to work again, and one that will surely solve the couple's problems, permanently. George hires a hit-man to target himself and his wife and make it look like and accident. However, what he doesn't know might not kill him. Brett [the hit-man] is still very new at the job, and really isn't very good at killing people yet, often failing quite miserably and somehow hurting himself during his many attempts. As this wacky comedy of errors ensues, will Brett ever manage to finish the job? Or will George's clever scam be discovered?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["This","hilari","comedi","is","about","the","bad","decis","that","peopl","can","make","while","live","under","a","\"","broke","mental","\"","!","When","an","elder","coupl","run","into","some","financi","troubl",",","and","their","onli","way","out","is","death","or","live","on","the","street",",","Georg","plot","a","clever","life","insur","scam","behind","his","wife","'s","back",",","one","that","ensur","their","son","will","never","have","to","work","again",",","and","one","that","will","sure","solv","the","coupl","'s","problem",",","perman",".","Georg","hire","a","hit-man","to","target","himself","and","his","wife","and","make","it","look","like","and","accid",".","Howev",",","what","he","doe","n't","know","might","not","kill","him",".","Brett","[","the","hit-man","]","is","still","veri","new","at","the","job",",","and","realli","is","n't","veri","good","at","kill","peopl","yet",",","often","fail","quit","miser","and","somehow","hurt","himself","dure","his","mani","attempt",".","As","this","wacki","comedi","of","error","ensu",",","will","Brett","ever","manag","to","finish","the","job","?","Or","will","Georg","'s","clever","scam","be","discov","?"],"lemmas":["this","hilarious","comedy","be","about","the","bad","decision","that","people","can","make","while","live","under","a","``","break","mentality","''","!","when","a","elderly","couple","run","into","some","financial","trouble",",","and","they","only","way","out","be","death","or","live","on","the","street",",","George","plot","a","clever","life","insurance","scam","behind","he","wife","'s","back",",","one","that","ensure","they","son","will","never","have","to","work","again",",","and","one","that","will","surely","solve","the","couple","'s","problem",",","permanently",".","George","hire","a","hit-man","to","target","himself","and","he","wife","and","make","it","look","like","and","accident",".","however",",","what","he","do","not","know","might","not","kill","he",".","Brett","-lsb-","the","hit-man","-rsb-","be","still","very","new","at","the","job",",","and","really","be","not","very","good","at","kill","people","yet",",","often","fail","quite","miserably","and","somehow","hurt","himself","during","he","many","attempt",".","as","this","wacky","comedy","of","error","ensue",",","will","Brett","ever","manage","to","finish","the","job","?","or","will","George","'s","clever","scam","be","discover","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

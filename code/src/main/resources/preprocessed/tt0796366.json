{"title":"Star Trek","plot":"On the day of James Kirk's birth, his father dies on his damaged starship in a last stand against a Romulan mining vessel looking for Ambassador Spock, who in this time, has grown on Vulcan disdained by his neighbors for his half-human heritage. 25 years later, James T. Kirk has grown into a young rebellious troublemaker. Challenged by Captain Christopher Pike to realize his potential in Starfleet, he comes to annoy academy instructors like Commander Spock. Suddenly, there is an emergency on Vulcan and the newly-commissioned USS Enterprise is crewed with promising cadets like Nyota Uhura, Hikaru Sulu, Pavel Chekov and even Kirk himself, thanks to Leonard McCoy's medical trickery. Together, this crew will have an adventure in the final frontier where the old legend is altered forever as a new version of the legend begins.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Adventure"],"stems":["On","the","day","of","Jame","Kirk","'s","birth",",","his","father","die","on","his","damag","starship","in","a","last","stand","against","a","Romulan","mine","vessel","look","for","Ambassador","Spock",",","who","in","this","time",",","has","grown","on","Vulcan","disdain","by","his","neighbor","for","his","half-human","heritag",".","25","year","later",",","Jame","T.","Kirk","has","grown","into","a","young","rebelli","troublemak",".","Challeng","by","Captain","Christoph","Pike","to","realiz","his","potenti","in","Starfleet",",","he","come","to","annoy","academi","instructor","like","Command","Spock",".","Sudden",",","there","is","an","emerg","on","Vulcan","and","the","newly-commiss","USS","Enterpris","is","crew","with","promis","cadet","like","Nyota","Uhura",",","Hikaru","Sulu",",","Pavel","Chekov","and","even","Kirk","himself",",","thank","to","Leonard","McCoy","'s","medic","trickeri",".","Togeth",",","this","crew","will","have","an","adventur","in","the","final","frontier","where","the","old","legend","is","alter","forev","as","a","new","version","of","the","legend","begin","."],"lemmas":["on","the","day","of","James","Kirk","'s","birth",",","he","father","die","on","he","damaged","starship","in","a","last","stand","against","a","romulan","mining","vessel","look","for","Ambassador","Spock",",","who","in","this","time",",","have","grow","on","Vulcan","disdain","by","he","neighbor","for","he","half-human","heritage",".","25","year","later",",","James","T.","Kirk","have","grow","into","a","young","rebellious","troublemaker",".","challenge","by","Captain","Christopher","Pike","to","realize","he","potential","in","Starfleet",",","he","come","to","annoy","academy","instructor","like","Commander","Spock",".","suddenly",",","there","be","a","emergency","on","Vulcan","and","the","newly-commissioned","USS","Enterprise","be","crew","with","promising","cadet","like","Nyota","Uhura",",","Hikaru","Sulu",",","Pavel","Chekov","and","even","Kirk","himself",",","thanks","to","Leonard","McCoy","'s","medical","trickery",".","together",",","this","crew","will","have","a","adventure","in","the","final","frontier","where","the","old","legend","be","alter","forever","as","a","new","version","of","the","legend","begin","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On the day","the day of","day of James","of James Kirk","James Kirk 's","Kirk 's birth","'s birth ,","birth , his",", his father","his father dies","father dies on","dies on his","on his damaged","his damaged starship","damaged starship in","starship in a","in a last","a last stand","last stand against","stand against a","against a Romulan","a Romulan mining","Romulan mining vessel","mining vessel looking","vessel looking for","looking for Ambassador","for Ambassador Spock","Ambassador Spock ,","Spock , who",", who in","who in this","in this time","this time ,","time , has",", has grown","has grown on","grown on Vulcan","on Vulcan disdained","Vulcan disdained by","disdained by his","by his neighbors","his neighbors for","neighbors for his","for his half-human","his half-human heritage","25 years later","years later ,","later , James",", James T.","James T.

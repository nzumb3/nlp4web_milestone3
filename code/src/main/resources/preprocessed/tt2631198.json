{"title":"The Passage","plot":"On a voyage from Washington to California, a young woman's life is changed forever when she falls headfirst into the magical world of tall ship sailing. The crew are brave, diverse, and eccentric, sacrificing their lives on land to find a home at sea, in the hull of a tall ship, frozen in time. Living without the comforts of home and in complete isolation from their life on shore, these young, self sustained sailors find it a small price to pay for the opportunity to reinvent themselves, pursue their thirst for adventure, and, ultimately, quench a primal yearning to belong.","genres":["Adventure"," Family","

{"title":"The Wolf OR-7 Expedition","plot":"The Wolf OR-7 Expedition retraced the approximate track generated by the GPS collar worn by the Oregon wolf known as Wolf OR-7. This young male grey wolf traversed over 1,200 miles through Oregon and into California, to become the first and only documented free-roaming wolf in California in nearly 90 years, and he is still out there . . . Our team consisted of a wolf ecologist, a storyteller, a filmmaker, a National Geographic Young Explorer, a logistics coordinator and a wild peace advocate. Our aim was and continues to be about raising awareness of local strategies that make on-the-ground strides toward human and wolf coexistence in the region.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Wolf","OR-7","Expedit","retrac","the","approxim","track","generat","by","the","GPS","collar","worn","by","the","Oregon","wolf","known","as","Wolf","OR-7",".","This","young","male","grey","wolf","travers","over","1,200","mile","through","Oregon","and","into","California",",","to","becom","the","first","and","onli","document","free-roam","wolf","in","California","in","near","90","year",",","and","he","is","still","out","there",".

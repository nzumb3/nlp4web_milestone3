{"title":"Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days","plot":"Summer vacation started, and Greg has his own way to enjoy it with video games. However, his father wants him to go outside and stop playing video games, and his mother has her own plans, including a reading club. In addition, Greg can't get along with his father. The only thing they have in common is the hatred for the Lil Cutie Comics. Things only get worse after the stay at the beachside cabin goes totally wrong. Will anything go right? At least there's Holly Hills.","genres":["Comedy"," Family"],"stems":["Summer","vacat","start",",","and","Greg","has","his","own","way","to","enjoy","it","with","video","game",".","Howev",",","his","father","want","him","to","go","outsid","and","stop","play","video","game",",","and","his","mother","has","her","own","plan",",","includ","a","read","club",".","In","addit",",","Greg","ca","n't","get","along","with","his","father",".","The","onli","thing","they","have","in","common","is","the","hatr","for","the","Lil","Cuti","Comic",".","Thing","onli","get","wors","after","the","stay","at","the","beachsid","cabin","goe","total","wrong",".","Will","anyth","go","right","?","At","least","there","'s","Holli","Hill","."],"lemmas":["summer","vacation","start",",","and","Greg","have","he","own","way","to","enjoy","it","with","video","game",".","however",",","he","father","want","he","to","go","outside","and","stop","play","video","game",",","and","he","mother","have","she","own","plan",",","include","a","reading","club",".","in","addition",",","Greg","can","not","get","along","with","he","father",".","the","only","thing","they","have","in","common","be","the","hatred","for","the","Lil","Cutie","Comics",".","thing","only","get","worse","after","the","stay","at","the","beachside","cabin","go","totally","wrong",".","will","anything","go","right","?","at","least","there","be","Holly","Hills","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Summer vacation started","vacation started ,","started , and",", and Greg","and Greg has","Greg has his","has his own","his own way","own way to","way to enjoy","to enjoy it","enjoy it with","it with video","with video games","However , his",", his father","his father wants","father wants him","wants him to","him to go","to go outside","go outside and","outside and stop","and stop playing","stop playing video","playing video games","video games ,","games , and",", and his","and his mother","his mother has","mother has her","has her own","her own plans","own plans ,","plans , including",", including a","including a reading","a reading club","In addition ,","addition , Greg",", Greg ca","Greg ca n't","ca n't get","n't get along","get along with","along with his","with his father","The only thing","only thing they","thing they have","they have in","have in common","in common is","common is the","is the hatred","the hatred for","hatred for the","for the Lil","the Lil Cutie","Lil Cutie Comics","Things only get","only get worse","get worse after","worse after the","after the stay","the stay at","stay at the","at the beachside","the beachside cabin","beachside cabin goes","cabin goes totally","goes totally wrong","Will anything go","anything go right","At least there","least there 's","there 's Holly","'s Holly Hills"],"2grams":["Summer vacation","vacation started","started ,",", and","and Greg","Greg has","has his","his own","own way","way to","to enjoy","enjoy it","it with","with video","video games","However ,",", his","his father","father wants","wants him","him to","to go","go outside","outside and","and stop","stop playing","playing video","video games","games ,",", and","and his","his mother","mother has","has her","her own","own plans","plans ,",", including","including a","a reading","reading club","In addition","addition ,",", Greg","Greg ca","ca n't","n't get","get along","along with","with his","his father","The only","only thing","thing they","they have","have in","in common","common is","is the","the hatred","hatred for","for the","the Lil","Lil Cutie","Cutie Comics","Things only","only get","get worse","worse after","after the","the stay","stay at","at the","the beachside","beachside cabin","cabin goes","goes totally","totally wrong","Will anything","anything go","go right","At least","least there","there 's","'s Holly","Holly Hills"]}

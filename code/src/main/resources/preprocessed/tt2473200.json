{"title":"Nona Beamer: A Legacy of Aloha","plot":"'Nona Beamer: A Legacy of Aloha' is a feature length documentary about a remarkable Hawaiian woman, who was descended from a long line of traditional Hawaiian musicians and dancers, and ran headlong into the missionary influences still extant in the Twentieth Century. This film portrait of Aunty Nona is created by some of the many people whose lives were influenced by her. Through stories, songs, and hula, from her students, friends and colleagues, a picture emerges of an amazing woman shaped by a turbulent time in Hawaiian history, who also played a role in shaping that history. The film appeals both to those who don't know of Aunty Nona, and those who know her well.","genres":["Biography"," History","

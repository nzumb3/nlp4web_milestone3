{"title":"City of Life","plot":"A privileged young male Arab at odds with his cultural identity and his less fortunate street smart friend; a disillusioned Indian taxi driver who bears an uncanny resemblance to a famous Bollywood star; and a former Romanian ballet dancer now working as a flight attendant and searching for love and companionship ... these individuals all live in Dubai and their lives are about to collide for better or for worse in a city where ambition, growth and opportunity are encouraged and dreams can still manifest. \"City of Life\" is an urban drama that tracks the various intersections of a multi-ethnic cast, examining how random interactions and their consequences can irrevocably impact another's life. As the name suggests, City of Life's inordinately humane kaleidoscope of converging experiences introduces a city that is in itself a living pulsating character. \"City of Life\" ultimately reveals how unexpected tragedy and loss can lead to hope and profound transformation as it explores and exposes the complex network that exists in an emerging multi cultural society's race, ethnicity and class divide.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["A","privileg","young","male","Arab","at","odd","with","his","cultur","ident","and","his","less","fortun","street","smart","friend",";","a","disillus","Indian","taxi","driver","who","bear","an","uncanni","resembl","to","a","famous","Bollywood","star",";","and","a","former","Romanian","ballet","dancer","now","work","as","a","flight","attend","and","search","for","love","and","companionship","...","these","individu","all","live","in","Dubai","and","their","live","are","about","to","collid","for","better","or","for","wors","in","a","citi","where","ambit",",","growth","and","opportun","are","encourag","and","dream","can","still","manifest",".","\"","Citi","of","Life","\"","is","an","urban","drama","that","track","the","various","intersect","of","a","multi-ethn","cast",",","examin","how","random","interact","and","their","consequ","can","irrevoc","impact","anoth","'s","life",".","As","the","name","suggest",",","Citi","of","Life","'s","inordin","human","kaleidoscop","of","converg","experi","introduc","a","citi","that","is","in","itself","a","live","pulsat","charact",".","\"","Citi","of","Life","\"","ultim","reveal","how","unexpect","tragedi","and","loss","can","lead","to","hope","and","profound","transform","as","it","explor","and","expos","the","complex","network","that","exist","in","an","emerg","multi","cultur","societi","'s","race",",","ethnic","and","class","divid","."],"lemmas":["a","privileged","young","male","Arab","at","odds","with","he","cultural","identity","and","he","less","fortunate","street","smart","friend",";","a","disillusioned","indian","taxi","driver","who","bear","a","uncanny","resemblance","to","a","famous","Bollywood","star",";","and","a","former","romanian","ballet","dancer","now","work","as","a","flight","attendant","and","search","for","love","and","companionship","...","these","individual","all","live","in","Dubai","and","they","life","be","about","to","collide","for","better","or","for","worse","in","a","city","where","ambition",",","growth","and","opportunity","be","encouraged","and","dream","can","still","manifest",".","``","City","of","Life","''","be","a","urban","drama","that","track","the","various","intersection","of","a","multi-ethnic","cast",",","examine","how","random","interaction","and","they","consequence","can","irrevocably","impact","another","'s","life",".","as","the","name","suggest",",","City","of","Life","'s","inordinately","humane","kaleidoscope","of","converge","experience","introduce","a","city","that","be","in","itself","a","living","pulsate","character",".","``","City","of","Life","''","ultimately","reveal","how","unexpected","tragedy","and","loss","can","lead","to","hope","and","profound","transformation","as","it","explore","and","expose","the","complex","network","that","exist","in","a","emerge","multi","cultural","society","'s","race",",","ethnicity","and","class","divide","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["A privileged young","privileged young male","young male Arab","male Arab at","Arab at odds","at odds with","odds with his","with his cultural","his cultural identity","cultural identity and","identity and his","and his less","his less fortunate","less fortunate street","fortunate street smart","street smart friend","smart friend ;","friend ;

{"title":"Headshots","plot":"Trapped in the world of the \"young creative class\" in Berlin, where life is your career, love is sexual convenience, and happiness measured by degrees of cynical detachment, Marianne (Loretta Pflaum), a thirty-something photographer, begins to look at things anew after discovering that she is pregnant. Then things go haywire when a model dies after a photo shoot. A hidden world of darkness and disorder, mistrust and lies breaks into the open. Told as a web of interlocking anecdotes, Headshots charts the course from fragile love to betrayal, from complicity to self-annihilation, and back through twists that are comical, poignant, and ridiculous, in a contemporary Berlin that has never been shown before.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Trap","in","the","world","of","the","\"","young","creativ","class","\"","in","Berlin",",","where","life","is","your","career",",","love","is","sexual","conveni",",","and","happi","measur","by","degre","of","cynic","detach",",","Mariann","(","Loretta","Pflaum",")",",","a","thirty-someth","photograph",",","begin","to","look","at","thing","anew","after","discov","that","she","is","pregnant",".","Then","thing","go","haywir","when","a","model","die","after","a","photo","shoot",".","A","hidden","world","of","dark","and","disord",",","mistrust","and","lie","break","into","the","open",".","Told","as","a","web","of","interlock","anecdot",",","Headshot","chart","the","cours","from","fragil","love","to","betray",",","from","complic","to","self-annihil",",","and","back","through","twist","that","are","comic",",","poignant",",","and","ridicul",",","in","a","contemporari","Berlin","that","has","never","been","shown","befor","."],"lemmas":["trap","in","the","world","of","the","``","young","creative","class","''","in","Berlin",",","where","life","be","you","career",",","love","be","sexual","convenience",",","and","happiness","measure","by","degree","of","cynical","detachment",",","Marianne","-lrb-","Loretta","Pflaum","-rrb-",",","a","thirty-something","photographer",",","begin","to","look","at","thing","anew","after","discover","that","she","be","pregnant",".","then","thing","go","haywire","when","a","model","die","after","a","photo","shoot",".","a","hidden","world","of","darkness","and","disorder",",","mistrust","and","lie","break","into","the","open",".","told","as","a","web","of","interlock","anecdote",",","Headshots","chart","the","course","from","fragile","love","to","betrayal",",","from","complicity","to","self-annihilation",",","and","back","through","twist","that","be","comical",",","poignant",",","and","ridiculous",",","in","a","contemporary","Berlin","that","have","never","be","show","before","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Trapped

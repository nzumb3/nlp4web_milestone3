{"title":"Henry Hornbostel in Architecture and Legacy","plot":"Henry Hornbostel stepped onto the stage and into the spotlight of the American Renaissance when in 1904, he won the prestigious commission to design and build industry titan, Andrew Carnegie's technical school in PIttsburgh, PA, known today as Carnegie Mellon University. Hornbostel's body of work is expansive and grand. His magnificent structures - buildings, bridges and monuments - are a timeless tribute to the French style of Beaux Arts, yet remain American classics. Unique and universal in their appeal, Hornbostel's designs continue to inspire us more than a century removed from his original sketch pad and blue prints. Hornbostel's work, and that of other American Renaissance artists and architects, punctuates the landscape with tangible links to our American story. The built environments that make up many of our American cities were born from the talents and vision of architects such as Henry Hornbostel.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Henri","Hornbostel","step","onto","the","stage","and","into","the","spotlight","of","the","American","Renaiss","when","in","1904",",","he","won","the","prestigi","commiss","to","design","and","build","industri","titan",",","Andrew","Carnegi","'s","technic","school","in","PIttsburgh",",","PA",",","known","today","as","Carnegi","Mellon","Univers",".","Hornbostel","'s","bodi","of","work","is","expans","and","grand",".","His","magnific","structur","-","build",",","bridg","and","monument","-","are","a","timeless","tribut","to","the","French","style","of","Beaux","Arts",",","yet","remain","American","classic",".","Uniqu","and","univers","in","their","appeal",",","Hornbostel","'s","design","continu","to","inspir","us","more","than","a","centuri","remov","from","his","origin","sketch","pad","and","blue","print",".","Hornbostel","'s","work",",","and","that","of","other","American","Renaiss","artist","and","architect",",","punctuat","the","landscap","with","tangibl","link","to","our","American","stori",".","The","built","environ","that","make","up","mani","of","our","American","citi","were","born","from","the","talent","and","vision","of","architect","such","as","Henri","Hornbostel","."],"lemmas":["Henry","Hornbostel","step","onto","the","stage","and","into","the","spotlight","of","the","American","Renaissance","when","in","1904",",","he","win","the","prestigious","commission","to","design","and","build","industry","titan",",","Andrew","Carnegie","'s","technical","school","in","pittsburgh",",","pa",",","know","today","as","Carnegie","Mellon","University",".","Hornbostel","'s","body","of","work","be","expansive","and","grand",".","he","magnificent","structure","-","building",",","bridge","and","monument","-","be","a","timeless","tribute","to","the","french","style","of","Beaux","Arts",",","yet","remain","american","classic",".","unique","and","universal","in","they","appeal",",","Hornbostel","'s","design","continue","to","inspire","we","more","than","a","century","remove","from","he","original","sketch","pad","and","blue","print",".","Hornbostel","'s","work",",","and","that","of","other","American","Renaissance","artist","and","architect",",","punctuate","the","landscape","with","tangible","link","to","we","american","story",".","the","build","environment","that","make","up","many","of","we","american","city","be","bear","from","the","talent","and","vision","of","architect","such","as","Henry","Hornbostel","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Henry Hornbostel stepped","Hornbostel stepped onto","stepped onto the","onto the stage","the stage and","stage and into","and into the","into the spotlight","the spotlight of","spotlight of the","of the American","the American Renaissance","American Renaissance when","Renaissance when in","when in 1904","in 1904 ,","1904 , he",", he won","he won the","won the prestigious","the prestigious commission","prestigious commission to","commission to design","to design and","design and build","and build industry","build industry titan","industry titan ,","titan , Andrew",", Andrew Carnegie","Andrew Carnegie 's","Carnegie 's technical","'s technical school","technical school in","school in PIttsburgh","in PIttsburgh ,","PIttsburgh , PA",", PA ,","PA , known",", known today","known today as","today as Carnegie","as Carnegie Mellon","Carnegie Mellon University","Hornbostel 's body","'s body of","body of work","of work is","work is expansive","is expansive and","expansive and grand","His magnificent structures","magnificent structures -","structures -

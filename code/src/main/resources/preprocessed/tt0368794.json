{"title":"I'm Not There","plot":"Six incarnations of Bob Dylan: an actor, a folk singer, an electrified troubadour, Rimbaud, Billy the Kid, and Woody Guthrie. Put Dylan's music behind their adventures, soliloquies, interviews, marriage, and infidelity. Recreate 1960s documentaries in black and white. Put each at a crossroads, the artist becoming someone else. Jack, the son of Ramblin' Jack Elliott, finds Jesus; handsome Robbie falls in love then abandons Claire. Woody, a lad escaped from foster care, hobos the U.S. singing; Billy awakes in a valley threatened by a six-lane highway; Rimbaud talks. Jude, booed at Newport when he goes electric, fences with reporters, pundits, and fans. He won't be classified.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Drama"],"stems":["Six","incarn","of","Bob","Dylan",":","an","actor",",","a","folk","singer",",","an","electrifi","troubadour",",","Rimbaud",",","Billi","the","Kid",",","and","Woodi","Guthri",".","Put","Dylan","'s","music","behind","their","adventur",",","soliloqui",",","interview",",","marriag",",","and","infidel",".","Recreat","1960s","documentari","in","black","and","white",".","Put","each","at","a","crossroad",",","the","artist","becom","someon","els",".","Jack",",","the","son","of","Ramblin","'","Jack","Elliott",",","find","Jesus",";","handsom","Robbi","fall","in","love","then","abandon","Clair",".","Woodi",",","a","lad","escap","from","foster","care",",","hobo","the","U.S.","sing",";","Billi","awak","in","a","valley","threaten","by","a","six-lan","highway",";","Rimbaud","talk",".","Jude",",","boo","at","Newport","when","he","goe","electr",",","fenc","with","report",",","pundit",",","and","fan",".","He","wo","n't","be","classifi","."],"lemmas":["six","incarnation","of","Bob","Dylan",":","a","actor",",","a","folk","singer",",","a","electrify","troubadour",",","Rimbaud",",","Billy","the","kid",",","and","Woody","Guthrie",".","put","Dylan","'s","music","behind","they","adventure",",","soliloquy",",","interview",",","marriage",",","and","infidelity",".","recreate","1960s","documentary","in","black","and","white",".","put","each","at","a","crossroads",",","the","artist","become","someone","else",".","Jack",",","the","son","of","Ramblin","'","Jack","Elliott",",","find","Jesus",";","handsome","Robbie","fall","in","love","then","abandon","Claire",".","Woody",",","a","lad","escape","from","foster","care",",","hobo","the","U.S.","singing",";","Billy","awake","in","a","valley","threaten","by","a","six-lane","highway",";","Rimbaud","talk",".","Jude",",","boo","at","Newport","when","he","go","electric",",","fence","with","reporter",",","pundit",",","and","fan",".","he","will","not","be","classify","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Six incarnations of","incarnations of Bob","of Bob Dylan","Bob Dylan :","Dylan : an",": an actor","an actor ,","actor , a",", a folk","a folk singer","folk singer ,","singer , an",", an electrified","an electrified troubadour","electrified troubadour ,","troubadour , Rimbaud",", Rimbaud ,","Rimbaud , Billy",", Billy the","Billy the Kid","the Kid ,","Kid , and",", and Woody","and Woody Guthrie","Put Dylan 's","Dylan 's music","'s music behind","music behind their","behind their adventures","their adventures ,","adventures , soliloquies",", soliloquies ,","soliloquies , interviews",", interviews ,","interviews , marriage",", marriage ,","marriage , and",", and infidelity","Recreate 1960s documentaries","1960s documentaries in","documentaries in black","in black and","black and white","Put each at","each at a","at a crossroads","a crossroads ,","crossroads , the",", the artist","the artist becoming","artist becoming someone","becoming someone else","Jack , the",", the son","the son of","son of Ramblin","of Ramblin '","Ramblin ' Jack","' Jack Elliott","Jack Elliott ,","Elliott , finds",", finds Jesus","finds Jesus ;","Jesus ;

{"title":"Diagnosing Damage","plot":"Ten thousand injured children pass every year through the spartan front room of this Trauma Unit in Cape Town. It is an extraordinary patient load for the relatively small staff of doctors and nurses here, who are exposed to the very worst of trauma through the experiences of their little patients, victims often of car accidents, family violence and fires which rage through townships. But this relatively modest hospital room is a place of hope, and has a life cycle of its own. We follow two exceptionally skilled women doctors who are on the front line of this trauma epidemic.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Ten","thousand","injur","children","pass","everi","year","through","the","spartan","front","room","of","this","Trauma","Unit","in","Cape","Town",".","It","is","an","extraordinari","patient","load","for","the","relat","small","staff","of","doctor","and","nurs","here",",","who","are","expos","to","the","veri","worst","of","trauma","through","the","experi","of","their","littl","patient",",","victim","often","of","car","accid",",","famili","violenc","and","fire","which","rage","through","township",".","But","this","relat","modest","hospit","room","is","a","place","of","hope",",","and","has","a","life","cycl","of","it","own",".","We","follow","two","except","skill","women","doctor","who","are","on","the","front","line","of","this","trauma","epidem","."],"lemmas":["ten","thousand","injured","child","pass","every","year","through","the","spartan","front","room","of","this","Trauma","Unit","in","Cape","Town",".","it","be","a","extraordinary","patient","load","for","the","relatively","small","staff","of","doctor","and","nurse","here",",","who","be","expose","to","the","very","worst","of","trauma","through","the","experience","of","they","little","patient",",","victim","often","of","car","accident",",","family","violence","and","fire","which","rage","through","township",".","but","this","relatively","modest","hospital","room","be","a","place","of","hope",",","and","have","a","life","cycle","of","its","own",".","we","follow","two","exceptionally","skilled","woman","doctor","who","be","on","the","front","line","of","this","trauma","epidemic","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["Ten thousand injured","thousand injured children","injured children pass","children pass every","pass every year","every year through","year through the","through the spartan","the spartan front","spartan front room","front room of","room of this","of this Trauma","this Trauma Unit","Trauma Unit in","Unit in Cape","in Cape Town","It is an","is an extraordinary","an extraordinary patient","extraordinary patient load","patient load for","load for the","for the relatively","the relatively small","relatively small staff","small staff of","staff of doctors","of doctors and","doctors and nurses","and nurses here","nurses here ,","here , who",", who are","who are exposed","are exposed to","exposed to the","to the very","the very worst","very worst of","worst of trauma","of trauma through","trauma through the","through the experiences","the experiences of","experiences of their","of their little","their little patients","little patients ,","patients , victims",", victims often","victims often of","often of car","of car accidents","car accidents ,","accidents , family",", family violence","family violence and","violence and fires","and fires which","fires which rage","which rage through","rage through townships","But this relatively","this relatively modest","relatively modest hospital","modest hospital room","hospital room is","room is a","is a place","a place of","place of hope","of hope ,","hope , and",", and has","and has a","has a life","a life cycle","life cycle of","cycle of its","of its own","We follow two","follow two exceptionally","two exceptionally skilled","exceptionally skilled women","skilled women doctors","women doctors who","doctors who are","who are on","are on the","on the front","the front line","front line of","line of this","of this trauma","this trauma epidemic"],"2grams":["Ten thousand","thousand injured","injured children","children pass","pass every","every year","year through","through the","the spartan","spartan front","front room","room of","of this","this Trauma","Trauma Unit","Unit in","in Cape","Cape Town","It is","is an","an extraordinary","extraordinary patient","patient load","load for","for the","the relatively","relatively small","small staff","staff of","of doctors","doctors and","and nurses","nurses here","here ,",", who","who are","are exposed","exposed to","to the","the very","very worst","worst of","of trauma","trauma through","through the","the experiences","experiences of","of their","their little","little patients","patients ,",", victims","victims often","often of","of car","car accidents","accidents ,",", family","family violence","violence and","and fires","fires which","which rage","rage through","through townships","But this","this relatively","relatively modest","modest hospital","hospital room","room is","is a","a place","place of","of hope","hope ,",", and","and has","has a","a life","life cycle","cycle of","of its","its own","We follow","follow two","two exceptionally","exceptionally skilled","skilled women","women doctors","doctors who","who are","are on","on the","the front","front line","line of","of this","this trauma","trauma epidemic"]}

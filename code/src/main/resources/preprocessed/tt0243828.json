{"title":"Come Together","plot":"This teen/twentysomething drama takes us on the afflicted journey of Ewan McKinnis the greeting card writer, whose true love Charlotte Hart has left him alone with his inability to commit to anything but scotch and pot. Upon receiving an invitation to her wedding mere months later, Ewan returns home for the wedding, bearing the decision of winning her back or letting her go, only to have a sixteen year old Lolita, Amy Collins thrust into his path. Amy has her own heartbreak to cope with, and the two, turning a blind eye under intense scrutinisation, become unlikely allies in their search for some ease and some answers.","genres":["Comedy","

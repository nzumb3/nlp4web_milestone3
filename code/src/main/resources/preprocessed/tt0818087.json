{"title":"Bandits","plot":"On the evening of November 18th 1983, seven young Georgians with a dream hijacked a Soviet passenger plane. The terrorists' aim: a dramatic escape into the glittering west. What started out as a naive fantasy quickly became a nightmare whose events leave an indelible mark on the psyche of the Georgian nation. Zaza Rusadze directs \"Bandits\", a film retracing the roots of the escapade, its victims, its survivors and its myth. In an era defined by terror, \"Bandits\" is a timely examination of the human side of terrorism.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","the","even","of","Novemb","18th","1983",",","seven","young","Georgian","with","a","dream","hijack","a","Soviet","passeng","plane",".","The","terrorist","'","aim",":","a","dramat","escap","into","the","glitter","west",".","What","start","out","as","a","naiv","fantasi","quick","becam","a","nightmar","whose","event","leav","an","indel","mark","on","the","psych","of","the","Georgian","nation",".","Zaza","Rusadz","direct","\"","Bandit","\"",",","a","film","retrac","the","root","of","the","escapad",",","it","victim",",","it","survivor","and","it","myth",".","In","an","era","defin","by","terror",",","\"","Bandit","\"","is","a","time","examin","of","the","human","side","of","terror","."],"lemmas":["on","the","evening","of","November","18th","1983",",","seven","young","Georgians","with","a","dream","hijack","a","soviet","passenger","plane",".","the","terrorist","'","aim",":","a","dramatic","escape","into","the","glitter","west",".","what","start","out","as","a","naive","fantasy","quickly","become","a","nightmare","whose","event","leave","a","indelible","mark","on","the","psyche","of","the","georgian","nation",".","Zaza","Rusadze","direct","``","Bandits","''",",","a","film","retrace","the","root","of","the","escapade",",","its","victim",",","its","survivor","and","its","myth",".","in","a","era","define","by","terror",",","``","Bandits","''","be","a","timely","examination","of","the","human","side","of","terrorism","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["On the evening","the evening of","evening of November","of November 18th","November 18th 1983","18th 1983 ,","1983 , seven",", seven young","seven young Georgians","young Georgians with","Georgians with a","with a dream","a dream hijacked","dream hijacked a","hijacked a Soviet","a Soviet passenger","Soviet passenger plane","The terrorists '","terrorists ' aim","' aim :","aim : a",": a dramatic","a dramatic escape","dramatic escape into","escape into the","into the glittering","the glittering west","What started out","started out as","out as a","as a naive","a naive fantasy","naive fantasy quickly","fantasy quickly became","quickly became a","became a nightmare","a nightmare whose","nightmare whose events","whose events leave","events leave an","leave an indelible","an indelible mark","indelible mark on","mark on the","on the psyche","the psyche of","psyche of the","of the Georgian","the Georgian nation","Zaza Rusadze directs","Rusadze directs \"","directs \" Bandits","\" Bandits \"","Bandits \" ,","\" , a",", a film","a film retracing","film retracing the","retracing the roots","the roots of","roots of the","of the escapade","the escapade ,","escapade , its",", its victims","its victims ,","victims , its",", its survivors","its survivors and","survivors and its","and its myth","In an era","an era defined","era defined by","defined by terror","by terror ,","terror , \"",", \" Bandits","\" Bandits \"","Bandits \" is","\" is a","is a timely","a timely examination","timely examination of","examination of the","of the human","the human side","human side of","side of terrorism"],"2grams":["On the","the evening","evening of","of November","November 18th","18th 1983","1983 ,",", seven","seven young","young Georgians","Georgians with","with a","a dream","dream hijacked","hijacked a","a Soviet","Soviet passenger","passenger plane","The terrorists","terrorists '","' aim","aim :",": a","a dramatic","dramatic escape","escape into","into the","the glittering","glittering west","What started","started out","out as","as a","a naive","naive fantasy","fantasy quickly","quickly became","became a","a nightmare","nightmare whose","whose events","events leave","leave an","an indelible","indelible mark","mark on","on the","the psyche","psyche of","of the","the Georgian","Georgian nation","Zaza Rusadze","Rusadze directs","directs \"","\" Bandits","Bandits \"","\" ,",", a","a film","film retracing","retracing the","the roots","roots of","of the","the escapade","escapade ,",", its","its victims","victims ,",", its","its survivors","survivors and","and its","its myth","In an","an era","era defined","defined by","by terror","terror ,",", \"","\" Bandits","Bandits \"","\" is","is a","a timely","timely examination","examination of","of the","the human","human side","side of","of terrorism"]}

{"title":"The Shooter","plot":"Denmark's political scene is a public riot with ecologists and pro-nature activists demonstrating on the streets. The actual government legislature is far from keeping the promises of not to planting oil-rigs in the Arctic See sanctuaries. The potential ecological consequences are incalculable and journalist Julie takes up the battle through a debate with those responsible in the administration. Rasmus is a hotheaded geophysicist, who upon return from the Arctic believes the only valid methods to convince the money-minded government officials are violence and intimidation. Equipped with a gun, he not only takes the journalist as hostage, but the whole of Copenhagen as well. His demand is that the drilling agenda must stop or he will start killing people.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller","

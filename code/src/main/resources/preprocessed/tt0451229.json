{"title":"Thrill Kill Jack in Hale Manor","plot":"Thrill Kill Jack is a mystical, monosyllabic tough-guy entrusted with a powerful hand-made gun crafted around a magical ancient Indian arrowhead. The gun is stolen by Hale, a grandiloquent wizard who runs a freakish mini-empire in a mansion populated by gimps and creeps. Thrill Kill Jack scales the mansion's walls and finds himself going room to room in search of his weapon, encountering endless threats on his life and sanity behind each new door. The film speeds with the required nervous camerawork, outlandish sound effects and staccato editing one expects from the genre. Vats of acid, drill guns, chained-up prisoners, flashing lights, deadly lasers and wild chase scenes populate the film, all used with the appropriate amount of good humor that gently mocks the wild conventions of this school of filmmaking.","genres":["Action","

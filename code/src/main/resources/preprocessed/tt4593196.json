{"title":"Population Zero","plot":"In April 2009 three young men were killed in a remote part of Yellowstone National Park. Authorities Never Found the Murderer. He Found Them. Only hours after three young men were gunned down in cold blood, Dwayne Nelson walked into a ranger station miles away and confessed to the crime. Despite his detailed confession, Dwayne Nelson was allowed to go free because of a loophole in the American Constitution. Award Winning Canadian Documentarian Julian T. Pinder (Trouble in the Peace, Land, Jesus Town) travels to Yellowstone in a cinematic and compelling chase for truth behind a crime that should have rocked the nation. How did the United States Constitution, the supreme law of the United States of America, let a guilty man go free? In his hunt for answers Pinder breaks the first rule of documentary film making by allowing himself to become a subject in the story; risking his life and others when he finds evidence that could re-open the case of the Yellowstone Murders years later. In Pinder's POPULATION ZERO we come to find the only thing more shocking than the crime itself are the bizarre events that followed.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["In","April","2009","three","young","men","were","kill","in","a","remot","part","of","Yellowston","Nation","Park",".","Author","Never","Found","the","Murder",".","He","Found","Them",".","Onli","hour","after","three","young","men","were","gun","down","in","cold","blood",",","Dwayn","Nelson","walk","into","a","ranger","station","mile","away","and","confess","to","the","crime",".","Despit","his","detail","confess",",","Dwayn","Nelson","was","allow","to","go","free","becaus","of","a","loophol","in","the","American","Constitut",".","Award","Win","Canadian","Documentarian","Julian","T.","Pinder","(","Troubl","in","the","Peac",",","Land",",","Jesus","Town",")","travel","to","Yellowston","in","a","cinemat","and","compel","chase","for","truth","behind","a","crime","that","should","have","rock","the","nation",".","How","did","the","Unite","State","Constitut",",","the","suprem","law","of","the","Unite","State","of","America",",","let","a","guilti","man","go","free","?","In","his","hunt","for","answer","Pinder","break","the","first","rule","of","documentari","film","make","by","allow","himself","to","becom","a","subject","in","the","stori",";","risk","his","life","and","other","when","he","find","evid","that","could","re-open","the","case","of","the","Yellowston","Murder","year","later",".","In","Pinder","'s","POPULATION","ZERO","we","come","to","find","the","onli","thing","more","shock","than","the","crime","itself","are","the","bizarr","event","that","follow","."],"lemmas":["in","April","2009","three","young","man","be","kill","in","a","remote","part","of","Yellowstone","National","Park",".","Authorities","Never","Found","the","murderer",".","he","found","them",".","only","hour","after","three","young","man","be","gun","down","in","cold","blood",",","Dwayne","Nelson","walk","into","a","ranger","station","mile","away","and","confess","to","the","crime",".","despite","he","detailed","confession",",","Dwayne","Nelson","be","allow","to","go","free","because","of","a","loophole","in","the","American","Constitution",".","award","win","Canadian","Documentarian","Julian","T.","Pinder","-lrb-","trouble","in","the","Peace",",","Land",",","Jesus","Town","-rrb-","travel","to","Yellowstone","in","a","cinematic","and","compelling","chase","for","truth","behind","a","crime","that","should","have","rock","the","nation",".","how","do","the","United","States","Constitution",",","the","supreme","law","of","the","United","States","of","America",",","let","a","guilty","man","go","free","?","in","he","hunt","for","answer","Pinder","break","the","first","rule","of","documentary","film","making","by","allow","himself","to","become","a","subject","in","the","story",";","risk","he","life","and","other","when","he","find","evidence","that","could","re-open","the","case","of","the","Yellowstone","Murders","year","later",".","in","Pinder","'s","POPULATION","ZERO","we","come","to","find","the","only","thing","more","shocking","than","the","crime","itself","be","the","bizarre","event","that","follow","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In April 2009","April 2009 three","2009 three young","three young men","young men were","men were killed","were killed in","killed in a","in a remote","a remote part","remote part of","part of Yellowstone","of Yellowstone National","Yellowstone National Park","Authorities Never Found","Never Found the","Found the Murderer","He Found Them","Only hours after","hours after three","after three young","three young men","young men were","men were gunned","were gunned down","gunned down in","down in cold","in cold blood","cold blood ,","blood , Dwayne",", Dwayne Nelson","Dwayne Nelson walked","Nelson walked into","walked into a","into a ranger","a ranger station","ranger station miles","station miles away","miles away and","away and confessed","and confessed to","confessed to the","to the crime","Despite his detailed","his detailed confession","detailed confession ,","confession , Dwayne",", Dwayne Nelson","Dwayne Nelson was","Nelson was allowed","was allowed to","allowed to go","to go free","go free because","free because of","because of a","of a loophole","a loophole in","loophole in the","in the American","the American Constitution","Award Winning Canadian","Winning Canadian Documentarian","Canadian Documentarian Julian","Documentarian Julian T.","Julian T.

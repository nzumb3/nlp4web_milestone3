{"title":"Whatever It Was","plot":"There's always that one moment. That moment of temptation. That moment of betrayal. That moment when everything changes. Lives intersect, intertwine, and explode when six strangers come into contact with a man willing to say anything, and be anyone to get what - and who - he wants. This is a story of suspense, romance, and the type of passion that destroys everything it touches. This is a story of relationships that begin with a look, falter with a secret, and die by the truth. This is a story of three couples who find themselves falling out of love and into a tangled future with unknown possibilities and dangers.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["There","'s","alway","that","one","moment",".","That","moment","of","temptat",".","That","moment","of","betray",".","That","moment","when","everyth","chang",".","Live","intersect",",","intertwin",",","and","explod","when","six","stranger","come","into","contact","with","a","man","will","to","say","anyth",",","and","be","anyon","to","get","what","-","and","who","-","he","want",".","This","is","a","stori","of","suspens",",","romanc",",","and","the","type","of","passion","that","destroy","everyth","it","touch",".","This","is","a","stori","of","relationship","that","begin","with","a","look",",","falter","with","a","secret",",","and","die","by","the","truth",".","This","is","a","stori","of","three","coupl","who","find","themselv","fall","out","of","love","and","into","a","tangl","futur","with","unknown","possibl","and","danger","."],"lemmas":["there","be","always","that","one","moment",".","that","moment","of","temptation",".","that","moment","of","betrayal",".","that","moment","when","everything","change",".","life","intersect",",","intertwine",",","and","explode","when","six","stranger","come","into","contact","with","a","man","willing","to","say","anything",",","and","be","anyone","to","get","what","-","and","who","-","he","want",".","this","be","a","story","of","suspense",",","romance",",","and","the","type","of","passion","that","destroy","everything","it","touch",".","this","be","a","story","of","relationship","that","begin","with","a","look",",","falter","with","a","secret",",","and","die","by","the","truth",".","this","be","a","story","of","three","couple","who","find","themselves","fall","out","of","love","and","into","a","tangled","future","with","unknown","possibility","and","danger","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["There 's always","'s always that","always that one","that one moment","That moment of","moment of temptation","That moment of","moment of betrayal","That moment when","moment when everything","when everything changes","Lives intersect ,","intersect , intertwine",", intertwine ,","intertwine , and",", and explode","and explode when","explode when six","when six strangers","six strangers come","strangers come into","come into contact","into contact with","contact with a","with a man","a man willing","man willing to","willing to say","to say anything","say anything ,","anything , and",", and be","and be anyone","be anyone to","anyone to get","to get what","get what -","what -

{"title":"Duke Vin and the Birth of Ska","plot":"London in the 1950's was a cold place in more ways than the obvious. Or so it appeared if you were one of the thousands of newly arrived Jamaicans. Many were overqualified for their menial jobs. Thousands of others quite simply could not get work. Discrimination and racial tensions culminated in fierce riots in both Nottingham and Notting Hill Gate. It was in this environment that the Jamaican soundmen; Duke Vin and Count Suckle arrived in the UK. They both stowed away on a boat from Kingston and brought with them a sound that was sweeping across the small Caribbean island and would later change the face of music in the UK. This was the sound of ska!","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["London","in","the","1950","'s","was","a","cold","place","in","more","way","than","the","obvious",".","Or","so","it","appear","if","you","were","one","of","the","thousand","of","newli","arriv","Jamaican",".","Mani","were","overqualifi","for","their","menial","job",".","Thousand","of","other","quit","simpli","could","not","get","work",".","Discrimin","and","racial","tension","culmin","in","fierc","riot","in","both","Nottingham","and","Not","Hill","Gate",".","It","was","in","this","environ","that","the","Jamaican","soundmen",";","Duke","Vin","and","Count","Suckl","arriv","in","the","UK",".","They","both","stow","away","on","a","boat","from","Kingston","and","brought","with","them","a","sound","that","was","sweep","across","the","small","Caribbean","island","and","would","later","chang","the","face","of","music","in","the","UK",".","This","was","the","sound","of","ska","!"],"lemmas":["London","in","the","1950","'s","be","a","cold","place","in","more","way","than","the","obvious",".","or","so","it","appear","if","you","be","one","of","the","thousand","of","newly","arrive","Jamaicans",".","many","be","overqualify","for","they","menial","job",".","thousand","of","other","quite","simply","could","not","get","work",".","discrimination","and","racial","tension","culminate","in","fierce","riot","in","both","Nottingham","and","Notting","Hill","Gate",".","it","be","in","this","environment","that","the","jamaican","soundmen",";","Duke","Vin","and","Count","Suckle","arrive","in","the","UK",".","they","both","stow","away","on","a","boat","from","Kingston","and","bring","with","they","a","sound","that","be","sweeping","across","the","small","Caribbean","island","and","would","later","change","the","face","of","music","in","the","UK",".","this","be","the","sound","of","ska","!"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["London in the","in the 1950","the 1950 's","1950 's was","'s was a","was a cold","a cold place","cold place in","place in more","in more ways","more ways than","ways than the","than the obvious","Or so it","so it appeared","it appeared if","appeared if you","if you were","you were one","were one of","one of the","of the thousands","the thousands of","thousands of newly","of newly arrived","newly arrived Jamaicans","Many were overqualified","were overqualified for","overqualified for their","for their menial","their menial jobs","Thousands of others","of others quite","others quite simply","quite simply could","simply could not","could not get","not get work","Discrimination and racial","and racial tensions","racial tensions culminated","tensions culminated in","culminated in fierce","in fierce riots","fierce riots in","riots in both","in both Nottingham","both Nottingham and","Nottingham and Notting","and Notting Hill","Notting Hill Gate","It was in","was in this","in this environment","this environment that","environment that the","that the Jamaican","the Jamaican soundmen","Jamaican soundmen ;","soundmen ;

{"title":"Mesocafé","plot":"A few weeks before the 2003 invasion of Iraq, an underground blogger risks his life by travelling from Baghdad to London to campaign for the lifting of UN Sanctions on Iraq. As political intrigue thwarts his heartfelt attempts to highlight the suffering of his people under the sanctions, he takes refuge at Mesocafé, a little Baghdad in West London. With their Arab, Assyrian, Jewish and Kurdish heritage, members of the Iraqi community allow him into their lives, sharing with him their stories and dreams. It is here that he meets the beautiful Bisan.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","few","week","befor","the","2003","invas","of","Iraq",",","an","underground","blogger","risk","his","life","by","travel","from","Baghdad","to","London","to","campaign","for","the","lift","of","UN","Sanction","on","Iraq",".","As","polit","intrigu","thwart","his","heartfelt","attempt","to","highlight","the","suffer","of","his","peopl","under","the","sanction",",","he","take","refug","at","Mesocafé",",","a","littl","Baghdad","in","West","London",".","With","their","Arab",",","Assyrian",",","Jewish","and","Kurdish","heritag",",","member","of","the","Iraqi","communiti","allow","him","into","their","live",",","share","with","him","their","stori","and","dream",".","It","is","here","that","he","meet","the","beauti","Bisan","."],"lemmas":["a","few","week","before","the","2003","invasion","of","Iraq",",","a","underground","blogger","risk","he","life","by","travel","from","Baghdad","to","London","to","campaign","for","the","lifting","of","UN","Sanctions","on","Iraq",".","as","political","intrigue","thwart","he","heartfelt","attempt","to","highlight","the","suffering","of","he","people","under","the","sanction",",","he","take","refuge","at","Mesocafé",",","a","little","Baghdad","in","West","London",".","with","they","Arab",",","Assyrian",",","Jewish","and","Kurdish","heritage",",","member","of","the","iraqi","community","allow","he","into","they","life",",","share","with","he","they","story","and","dream",".","it","be","here","that","he","meet","the","beautiful","Bisan","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["A few weeks","few weeks before","weeks before the","before the 2003","the 2003 invasion","2003 invasion of","invasion of Iraq","of Iraq ,","Iraq , an",", an underground","an underground blogger","underground blogger risks","blogger risks his","risks his life","his life by","life by travelling","by travelling from","travelling from Baghdad","from Baghdad to","Baghdad to London","to London to","London to campaign","to campaign for","campaign for the","for the lifting","the lifting of","lifting of UN","of UN Sanctions","UN Sanctions on","Sanctions on Iraq","As political intrigue","political intrigue thwarts","intrigue thwarts his","thwarts his heartfelt","his heartfelt attempts","heartfelt attempts to","attempts to highlight","to highlight the","highlight the suffering","the suffering of","suffering of his","of his people","his people under","people under the","under the sanctions","the sanctions ,","sanctions , he",", he takes","he takes refuge","takes refuge at","refuge at Mesocafé","at Mesocafé ,","Mesocafé , a",", a little","a little Baghdad","little Baghdad in","Baghdad in West","in West London","With their Arab","their Arab ,","Arab , Assyrian",", Assyrian ,","Assyrian , Jewish",", Jewish and","Jewish and Kurdish","and Kurdish heritage","Kurdish heritage ,","heritage , members",", members of","members of the","of the Iraqi","the Iraqi community","Iraqi community allow","community allow him","allow him into","him into their","into their lives","their lives ,","lives , sharing",", sharing with","sharing with him","with him their","him their stories","their stories and","stories and dreams","It is here","is here that","here that he","that he meets","he meets the","meets the beautiful","the beautiful Bisan"],"2grams":["A few","few weeks","weeks before","before the","the 2003","2003 invasion","invasion of","of Iraq","Iraq ,",", an","an underground","underground blogger","blogger risks","risks his","his life","life by","by travelling","travelling from","from Baghdad","Baghdad to","to London","London to","to campaign","campaign for","for the","the lifting","lifting of","of UN","UN Sanctions","Sanctions on","on Iraq","As political","political intrigue","intrigue thwarts","thwarts his","his heartfelt","heartfelt attempts","attempts to","to highlight","highlight the","the suffering","suffering of","of his","his people","people under","under the","the sanctions","sanctions ,",", he","he takes","takes refuge","refuge at","at Mesocafé","Mesocafé ,",", a","a little","little Baghdad","Baghdad in","in West","West London","With their","their Arab","Arab ,",", Assyrian","Assyrian ,",", Jewish","Jewish and","and Kurdish","Kurdish heritage","heritage ,",", members","members of","of the","the Iraqi","Iraqi community","community allow","allow him","him into","into their","their lives","lives ,",", sharing","sharing with","with him","him their","their stories","stories and","and dreams","It is","is here","here that","that he","he meets","meets the","the beautiful","beautiful Bisan"]}

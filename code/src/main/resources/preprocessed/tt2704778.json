{"title":"Threatened: The Controversial Struggle of the Southern Sea Otter","plot":"After being brought back from the brink of extinction, sea otters are once again in peril. An unprecedented number of sea otter deaths have occurred along the California coast in the last three years. But not everyone wants to support a thriving sea otter population. Otters are at the center of a bitter controversy regarding the Fish & Wildlife Service's recent decision to eliminate their \"No Otter Zone\" from Southern California waters. For a fragile species threatened by pollution, infectious diseases, starvation,and competition with fishermen, this is a crucial time for the Southern Sea Otter, as they struggle for survival.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["After","be","brought","back","from","the","brink","of","extinct",",","sea","otter","are","onc","again","in","peril",".","An","unpreced","number","of","sea","otter","death","have","occur","along","the","California","coast","in","the","last","three","year",".","But","not","everyon","want","to","support","a","thrive","sea","otter","popul",".","Otter","are","at","the","center","of","a","bitter","controversi","regard","the","Fish","&","Wildlif","Servic","'s","recent","decis","to","elimin","their","\"","No","Otter","Zone","\"","from","Southern","California","water",".","For","a","fragil","speci","threaten","by","pollut",",","infecti","diseas",",","starvat",",","and","competit","with","fishermen",",","this","is","a","crucial","time","for","the","Southern","Sea","Otter",",","as","they","struggl","for","surviv","."],"lemmas":["after","be","bring","back","from","the","brink","of","extinction",",","sea","otter","be","once","again","in","peril",".","a","unprecedented","number","of","sea","otter","death","have","occur","along","the","California","coast","in","the","last","three","year",".","but","not","everyone","want","to","support","a","thriving","sea","otter","population",".","otter","be","at","the","center","of","a","bitter","controversy","regard","the","fish","&","Wildlife","Service","'s","recent","decision","to","eliminate","they","``","No","Otter","Zone","''","from","Southern","California","water",".","for","a","fragile","species","threaten","by","pollution",",","infectious","disease",",","starvation",",","and","competition","with","fisherman",",","this","be","a","crucial","time","for","the","Southern","Sea","Otter",",","as","they","struggle","for","survival","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["After

{"title":"The Arbiter","plot":"John (35) is a bright Cambridge scientist, who always comes across as a pleasant fellow. When his fiancée leaves him, he withdraws from his world of academic isolation in order to try out some of his long-gestating theories on how to make the world a better place. On his journey through the English countryside, John is accompanied by his 14-year-old donor child - Ronja, whom he tries to convert to the same radical ideas that he believes in. Murder. Elimination. Cleansing. All justifiable in the mind of a modern day European Psycho.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["John","(","35",")","is","a","bright","Cambridg","scientist",",","who","alway","come","across","as","a","pleasant","fellow",".","When","his","fiancé","leav","him",",","he","withdraw","from","his","world","of","academ","isol","in","order","to","tri","out","some","of","his","long-gest","theori","on","how","to","make","the","world","a","better","place",".","On","his","journey","through","the","English","countrysid",",","John","is","accompani","by","his","14-year-old","donor","child","-","Ronja",",","whom","he","tri","to","convert","to","the","same","radic","idea","that","he","believ","in",".","Murder",".","Elimin",".","Cleans",".","All","justifi","in","the","mind","of","a","modern","day","European","Psycho","."],"lemmas":["John","-lrb-","35","-rrb-","be","a","bright","Cambridge","scientist",",","who","always","come","across","as","a","pleasant","fellow",".","when","he","fiancée","leave","he",",","he","withdraw","from","he","world","of","academic","isolation","in","order","to","try","out","some","of","he","long-gestating","theory","on","how","to","make","the","world","a","better","place",".","on","he","journey","through","the","English","countryside",",","John","be","accompany","by","he","14-year-old","donor","child","-","ronja",",","whom","he","try","to","convert","to","the","same","radical","idea","that","he","believe","in",".","murder",".","elimination",".","cleanse",".","all","justifiable","in","the","mind","of","a","modern","day","European","Psycho","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["John ( 35","( 35 )","35 ) is",") is a","is a bright","a bright Cambridge","bright Cambridge scientist","Cambridge scientist ,","scientist , who",", who always","who always comes","always comes across","comes across as","across as a","as a pleasant","a pleasant fellow","When his fiancée","his fiancée leaves","fiancée leaves him","leaves him ,","him , he",", he withdraws","he withdraws from","withdraws from his","from his world","his world of","world of academic","of academic isolation","academic isolation in","isolation in order","in order to","order to try","to try out","try out some","out some of","some of his","of his long-gestating","his long-gestating theories","long-gestating theories on","theories on how","on how to","how to make","to make the","make the world","the world a","world a better","a better place","On his journey","his journey through","journey through the","through the English","the English countryside","English countryside ,","countryside , John",", John is","John is accompanied","is accompanied by","accompanied by his","by his 14-year-old","his 14-year-old donor","14-year-old donor child","donor child -","child - Ronja","- Ronja ,","Ronja , whom",", whom he","whom he tries","he tries to","tries to convert","to convert to","convert to the","to the same","the same radical","same radical ideas","radical ideas that","ideas that he","that he believes","he believes in","All justifiable in","justifiable in the","in the mind","the mind of","mind of a","of a modern","a modern day","modern day European","day European Psycho"],"2grams":["John (","( 35","35 )",") is","is a","a bright","bright Cambridge","Cambridge scientist","scientist ,",", who","who always","always comes","comes across","across as","as a","a pleasant","pleasant fellow","When his","his fiancée","fiancée leaves","leaves him","him ,",", he","he withdraws","withdraws from","from his","his world","world of","of academic","academic isolation","isolation in","in order","order to","to try","try out","out some","some of","of his","his long-gestating","long-gestating theories","theories on","on how","how to","to make","make the","the world","world a","a better","better place","On his","his journey","journey through","through the","the English","English countryside","countryside ,",", John","John is","is accompanied","accompanied by","by his","his 14-year-old","14-year-old donor","donor child","child -","- Ronja","Ronja ,",", whom","whom he","he tries","tries to","to convert","convert to","to the","the same","same radical","radical ideas","ideas that","that he","he believes","believes in","All justifiable","justifiable in","in the","the mind","mind of","of a","a modern","modern day","day European","European Psycho"]}

{"title":"The Student Body","plot":"In an effort to address the obesity epidemic, notification letters are being sent to students whose body mass do not fall within a narrow range deemed \"acceptable\" by the government; essentially telling children, even as young as kindergarteners, that they are fat. When a determined sixth-grader in Ohio voices her protest against the 'Fat Letters', student journalist Bailey Webber is inspired to take her fight to the highest levels of government. THE STUDENT BODY is a true underdog story of two brave girls who take a stand against bullying, government intrusion and hypocrisy while exploring the complex and controversial truths behind the childhood obesity debate.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["In","an","effort","to","address","the","obes","epidem",",","notif","letter","are","be","sent","to","student","whose","bodi","mass","do","not","fall","within","a","narrow","rang","deem","\"","accept","\"","by","the","govern",";","essenti","tell","children",",","even","as","young","as","kindergarten",",","that","they","are","fat",".","When","a","determin","sixth-grad","in","Ohio","voic","her","protest","against","the","'","Fat","Letter","'",",","student","journalist","Bailey","Webber","is","inspir","to","take","her","fight","to","the","highest","level","of","govern",".","THE","STUDENT","BODi","is","a","true","underdog","stori","of","two","brave","girl","who","take","a","stand","against","bulli",",","govern","intrus","and","hypocrisi","while","explor","the","complex","and","controversi","truth","behind","the","childhood","obes","debat","."],"lemmas":["in","a","effort","to","address","the","obesity","epidemic",",","notification","letter","be","be","send","to","student","whose","body","mass","do","not","fall","within","a","narrow","range","deem","``","acceptable","''","by","the","government",";","essentially","tell","child",",","even","as","young","as","kindergartener",",","that","they","be","fat",".","when","a","determine","sixth-grader","in","Ohio","voice","she","protest","against","the","'","Fat","Letters","'",",","student","journalist","Bailey","Webber","be","inspire","to","take","she","fight","to","the","highest","level","of","government",".","the","STUDENT","BODY","be","a","true","underdog","story","of","two","brave","girl","who","take","a","stand","against","bullying",",","government","intrusion","and","hypocrisy","while","explore","the","complex","and","controversial","truth","behind","the","childhood","obesity","debate","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In an effort","an effort to","effort to address","to address the","address the obesity","the obesity epidemic","obesity epidemic ,","epidemic , notification",", notification letters","notification letters are","letters are being","are being sent","being sent to","sent to students","to students whose","students whose body","whose body mass","body mass do","mass do not","do not fall","not fall within","fall within a","within a narrow","a narrow range","narrow range deemed","range deemed \"","deemed \" acceptable","\" acceptable \"","acceptable \" by","\" by the","by the government","the government ;","government ;

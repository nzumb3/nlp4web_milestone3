Wisconsin Supper Clubs ~ An Old Fashioned Experience shows why supper clubs are such a big part of Wisconsin's food culture and the full experience of supper club dining: a brandy old fashioned sweet at the bar, relish trays at the table, huge portions of steaks, seafood and game, and the friendly, loyal customers who have been dining at their favorite places for so many years.","genres":["Documentary","

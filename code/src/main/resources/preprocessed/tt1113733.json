{"title":"Jerusalem: Stories from the Street","plot":"If Chaucer had lived to write The Canterbury Tales around Jerusalem and the present conflict in the Holy Land, his collection of stories might resemble our documentary, Jerusalem, Stories From the Street. In the same way that Chaucer's England comes to life through the tales of vocal commoners traveling the road to Canterbury, the crisis in the Holy Land comes to life through candid stories told from the streets of Jerusalem. The storytellers in this documentary, though, don't tell tales. Their histories, told with heart and authority, describe life as they know it, in the Holy Land.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["If","Chaucer","had","live","to","write","The","Canterburi","Tale","around","Jerusalem","and","the","present","conflict","in","the","Holi","Land",",","his","collect","of","stori","might","resembl","our","documentari",",","Jerusalem",",","Stori","From","the","Street",".","In","the","same","way","that","Chaucer","'s","England","come","to","life","through","the","tale","of","vocal","common","travel","the","road","to","Canterburi",",","the","crisi","in","the","Holi","Land","come","to","life","through","candid","stori","told","from","the","street","of","Jerusalem",".","The","storytel","in","this","documentari",",","though",",","do","n't","tell","tale",".","Their","histori",",","told","with","heart","and","author",",","describ","life","as","they","know","it",",","in","the","Holi","Land","."],"lemmas":["if","Chaucer","have","live","to","write","The","Canterbury","tale","around","Jerusalem","and","the","present","conflict","in","the","Holy","Land",",","he","collection","of","story","might","resemble","we","documentary",",","Jerusalem",",","Stories","from","the","Street",".","in","the","same","way","that","Chaucer","'s","England","come","to","life","through","the","tale","of","vocal","commoner","travel","the","road","to","Canterbury",",","the","crisis","in","the","Holy","Land","come","to","life","through","candid","story","tell","from","the","street","of","Jerusalem",".","the","storyteller","in","this","documentary",",","though",",","do","not","tell","tale",".","they","history",",","tell","with","heart","and","authority",",","describe","life","as","they","know","it",",","in","the","Holy","Land","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["If

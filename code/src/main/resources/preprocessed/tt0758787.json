{"title":"Things to Do","plot":"After being there for a year, twenty-something Adam Stevenson decides to quit his dead end office job in the big city following \"the incident\", and head back to live with his parents in the small town in which he grew up until he figures out what to do, his life path trajectory interrupted in large part because of the incident. He receives mixed messages from his parents about his return, they who receive him with little fanfare yet who have kept his private telephone line active in his bedroom during his year away. News of his return to his old high school friends and acquaintances has also preceded him, many who heard that he went crazy. The townsperson with who he ends up bonding with the most is his old high school acquaintance, the adolescent minded Mac, with who he was reunited on a chance encounter. Together, they embark on an adolescently directed bucket list, for the satisfaction of completing the tasks, but for Adam also to help him rejuvenate his life so that he can find out what to do in its next phase. That is eventually assisted by his additional encounters with Julie Bartley, the girl on who he and all his fellow classmates had a crush during high school.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["After","be","there","for","a","year",",","twenty-someth","Adam","Stevenson","decid","to","quit","his","dead","end","offic","job","in","the","big","citi","follow","\"","the","incid","\"",",","and","head","back","to","live","with","his","parent","in","the","small","town","in","which","he","grew","up","until","he","figur","out","what","to","do",",","his","life","path","trajectori","interrupt","in","larg","part","becaus","of","the","incid",".","He","receiv","mix","messag","from","his","parent","about","his","return",",","they","who","receiv","him","with","littl","fanfar","yet","who","have","kept","his","privat","telephon","line","activ","in","his","bedroom","dure","his","year","away",".","New","of","his","return","to","his","old","high","school","friend","and","acquaint","has","also","preced","him",",","mani","who","heard","that","he","went","crazi",".","The","townsperson","with","who","he","end","up","bond","with","the","most","is","his","old","high","school","acquaint",",","the","adolesc","mind","Mac",",","with","who","he","was","reunit","on","a","chanc","encount",".","Togeth",",","they","embark","on","an","adolesc","direct","bucket","list",",","for","the","satisfact","of","complet","the","task",",","but","for","Adam","also","to","help","him","rejuven","his","life","so","that","he","can","find","out","what","to","do","in","it","next","phase",".","That","is","eventu","assist","by","his","addit","encount","with","Juli","Bartley",",","the","girl","on","who","he","and","all","his","fellow","classmat","had","a","crush","dure","high","school","."],"lemmas":["after","be","there","for","a","year",",","twenty-something","Adam","Stevenson","decide","to","quit","he","dead","end","office","job","in","the","big","city","follow","``","the","incident","''",",","and","head","back","to","live","with","he","parent","in","the","small","town","in","which","he","grow","up","until","he","figure","out","what","to","do",",","he","life","path","trajectory","interrupt","in","large","part","because","of","the","incident",".","he","receive","mixed","message","from","he","parent","about","he","return",",","they","who","receive","he","with","little","fanfare","yet","who","have","keep","he","private","telephone","line","active","in","he","bedroom","during","he","year","away",".","news","of","he","return","to","he","old","high","school","friend","and","acquaintance","have","also","precede","he",",","many","who","hear","that","he","go","crazy",".","the","townsperson","with","who","he","end","up","bonding","with","the","most","be","he","old","high","school","acquaintance",",","the","adolescent","mind","Mac",",","with","who","he","be","reunite","on","a","chance","encounter",".","together",",","they","embark","on","a","adolescently","direct","bucket","list",",","for","the","satisfaction","of","complete","the","task",",","but","for","Adam","also","to","help","he","rejuvenate","he","life","so","that","he","can","find","out","what","to","do","in","its","next","phase",".","that","be","eventually","assist","by","he","additional","encounter","with","Julie","Bartley",",","the","girl","on","who","he","and","all","he","fellow","classmate","have","a","crush","during","high","school","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After

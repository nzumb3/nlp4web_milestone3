{"title":"Trump: What's the Deal?","plot":"Donald Trump is one of the richest and most famous men in America, but on what foundation has his success been built? From accusations of harassment to repeated flirtations with bankruptcy, his very public business career has been one of artifice and intrigue; a Machiavellian performance played out before the American media. Originally produced in 1991, \"Donald Trump: What's the Deal?\" investigates the unscrupulous reality behind this most public of figures. Swaggering and assured, exaggerated statements have become Trump's trademark, making him as much a celebrity as a businessman; a poster boy for American capitalism. This air of cocky invincibility has, however, repeatedly hidden a questionable and often duplicitous business approach. Ignoring the facade, this remarkable and revealing documentary exposes the unsavory truth of the self-professed 'People's Billionaire'.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Donald","Trump","is","one","of","the","richest","and","most","famous","men","in","America",",","but","on","what","foundat","has","his","success","been","built","?","From","accus","of","harass","to","repeat","flirtat","with","bankruptci",",","his","veri","public","busi","career","has","been","one","of","artific","and","intrigu",";","a","Machiavellian","perform","play","out","befor","the","American","media",".","Origin","produc","in","1991",",","\"","Donald","Trump",":","What","'s","the","Deal","?","\"","investig","the","unscrupul","realiti","behind","this","most","public","of","figur",".","Swagger","and","assur",",","exagger","statement","have","becom","Trump","'s","trademark",",","make","him","as","much","a","celebr","as","a","businessman",";","a","poster","boy","for","American","capit",".","This","air","of","cocki","invinc","has",",","howev",",","repeat","hidden","a","question","and","often","duplicit","busi","approach",".","Ignore","the","facad",",","this","remark","and","reveal","documentari","expos","the","unsavori","truth","of","the","self-profess","'","Peopl","'s","Billionair","'","."],"lemmas":["Donald","Trump","be","one","of","the","richest","and","most","famous","man","in","America",",","but","on","what","foundation","have","he","success","be","build","?","from","accusation","of","harassment","to","repeated","flirtation","with","bankruptcy",",","he","very","public","business","career","have","be","one","of","artifice","and","intrigue",";","a","machiavellian","performance","play","out","before","the","american","media",".","originally","produce","in","1991",",","``","Donald","Trump",":","what","be","the","Deal","?","''","investigate","the","unscrupulous","reality","behind","this","most","public","of","figure",".","swagger","and","assure",",","exaggerated","statement","have","become","Trump","'s","trademark",",","make","he","as","much","a","celebrity","as","a","businessman",";","a","poster","boy","for","american","capitalism",".","this","air","of","cocky","invincibility","have",",","however",",","repeatedly","hide","a","questionable","and","often","duplicitous","business","approach",".","ignore","the","facade",",","this","remarkable","and","revealing","documentary","expose","the","unsavory","truth","of","the","self-professed","'","people","'s","billionaire","'","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Donald Trump is","Trump is one","is one of","one of the","of the richest","the richest and","richest and most","and most famous","most famous men","famous men in","men in America","in America ,","America , but",", but on","but on what","on what foundation","what foundation has","foundation has his","has his success","his success been","success been built","From accusations of","accusations of harassment","of harassment to","harassment to repeated","to repeated flirtations","repeated flirtations with","flirtations with bankruptcy","with bankruptcy ,","bankruptcy , his",", his very","his very public","very public business","public business career","business career has","career has been","has been one","been one of","one of artifice","of artifice and","artifice and intrigue","and intrigue ;","intrigue ; a","; a Machiavellian","a Machiavellian performance","Machiavellian performance played","performance played out","played out before","out before the","before the American","the American media","Originally produced in","produced in 1991","in 1991 ,","1991 , \"",", \" Donald","\" Donald Trump","Donald Trump :","Trump : What",": What 's","What 's the","'s the Deal","the Deal ?","Deal ?

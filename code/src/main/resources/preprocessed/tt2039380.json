{"title":"Star Raiders: The Adventures of Saber Raine","plot":"Rocket ships, Rayguns, and Robots abound in this heart-pounding tale where the stellar adventurer Saber Raine is hired to guide three elite soldiers on a rescue mission to recover a prince and princess who have been abducted from their home world. The trail leads Saber and his allies to a planet deep within uncharted space that is inhabited by strange mutated creatures, leech-like desert marauders, renegade mercenaries, alien outcasts, and cybernetically enhanced soldiers that guard mysterious ruins of an empire long forgotten. Deep within the ruins, Sinjin, a sinister overlord freed from a cryogenic chamber that was his prison for many centuries, is now in league with the Quintari, a malevolent insectoid race known throughout the galaxy as the scourge. In possession of a powerful new energy source, Sinjin plots his revenge on the descendants of those who betrayed him in the past. Can our heroes complete their rescue mission and stop Sinijin from unleashing his fury on the universe?

{"title":"Looper","plot":"Joe is classified as a \"looper\", a job in which his employers use time travel to send men from the future to be killed into the past, where Joe can properly dispose of their bodies. However, to tie up loose ends and erase the evidence of his ever being a looper, Joe knows that one day his future self will be sent back for him to kill. When this day comes, Joe's future self is prepared and escapes, and the two men struggle separately in the past trying to evade capture and attempting to fulfill their own personal agendas.","genres":["Action"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Joe","is","classifi","as","a","\"","looper","\"",",","a","job","in","which","his","employ","use","time","travel","to","send","men","from","the","futur","to","be","kill","into","the","past",",","where","Joe","can","proper","dispos","of","their","bodi",".","Howev",",","to","tie","up","loos","end","and","eras","the","evid","of","his","ever","be","a","looper",",","Joe","know","that","one","day","his","futur","self","will","be","sent","back","for","him","to","kill",".","When","this","day","come",",","Joe","'s","futur","self","is","prepar","and","escap",",","and","the","two","men","struggl","separ","in","the","past","tri","to","evad","captur","and","attempt","to","fulfil","their","own","person","agenda","."],"lemmas":["Joe","be","classify","as","a","``","looper","''",",","a","job","in","which","he","employer","use","time","travel","to","send","man","from","the","future","to","be","kill","into","the","past",",","where","Joe","can","properly","dispose","of","they","body",".","however",",","to","tie","up","loose","end","and","erase","the","evidence","of","he","ever","be","a","looper",",","Joe","know","that","one","day","he","future","self","will","be","send","back","for","he","to","kill",".","when","this","day","come",",","Joe","'s","future","self","be","prepare","and","escape",",","and","the","two","man","struggle","separately","in","the","past","try","to","evade","capture","and","attempt","to","fulfill","they","own","personal","agenda","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Joe is classified","is classified as","classified as a","as a \"","a \" looper","\" looper \"","looper \" ,","\" , a",", a job","a job in","job in which","in which his","which his employers","his employers use","employers use time","use time travel","time travel to","travel to send","to send men","send men from","men from the","from the future","the future to","future to be","to be killed","be killed into","killed into the","into the past","the past ,","past , where",", where Joe","where Joe can","Joe can properly","can properly dispose","properly dispose of","dispose of their","of their bodies","However , to",", to tie","to tie up","tie up loose","up loose ends","loose ends and","ends and erase","and erase the","erase the evidence","the evidence of","evidence of his","of his ever","his ever being","ever being a","being a looper","a looper ,","looper , Joe",", Joe knows","Joe knows that","knows that one","that one day","one day his","day his future","his future self","future self will","self will be","will be sent","be sent back","sent back for","back for him","for him to","him to kill","When this day","this day comes","day comes ,","comes , Joe",", Joe 's","Joe 's future","'s future self","future self is","self is prepared","is prepared and","prepared and escapes","and escapes ,","escapes , and",", and the","and the two","the two men","two men struggle","men struggle separately","struggle separately in","separately in the","in the past","the past trying","past trying to","trying to evade","to evade capture","evade capture and","capture and attempting","and attempting to","attempting to fulfill","to fulfill their","fulfill their own","their own personal","own personal agendas"],"2grams":["Joe is","is classified","classified as","as a","a \"","\" looper","looper \"","\" ,",", a","a job","job in","in which","which his","his employers","employers use","use time","time travel","travel to","to send","send men","men from","from the","the future","future to","to be","be killed","killed into","into the","the past","past ,",", where","where Joe","Joe can","can properly","properly dispose","dispose of","of their","their bodies","However ,",", to","to tie","tie up","up loose","loose ends","ends and","and erase","erase the","the evidence","evidence of","of his","his ever","ever being","being a","a looper","looper ,",", Joe","Joe knows","knows that","that one","one day","day his","his future","future self","self will","will be","be sent","sent back","back for","for him","him to","to kill","When this","this day","day comes","comes ,",", Joe","Joe 's","'s future","future self","self is","is prepared","prepared and","and escapes","escapes ,",", and","and the","the two","two men","men struggle","struggle separately","separately in","in the","the past","past trying","trying to","to evade","evade capture","capture and","and attempting","attempting to","to fulfill","fulfill their","their own","own personal","personal agendas"]}

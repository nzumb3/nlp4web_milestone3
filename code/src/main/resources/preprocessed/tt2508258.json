{"title":"First Period","plot":"New girl Cassie (Brandon Alexander III) and outcast Maggie (Dudley Beene) are easily the most awkward girls in high school. Together, they decide the way to win the hearts of the cute boys and popular girls is to come in first at the school talent show. But rivals Heather, Other Heather, and their popular boyfriends Brett and Dirk will stop at nothing to keep our heroes the laughing stock of the school. It's going to take makeovers, courage, and maybe even a little rapping to beat them in true 80s style.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["New","girl","Cassi","(","Brandon","Alexand","III",")","and","outcast","Maggi","(","Dudley","Been",")","are","easili","the","most","awkward","girl","in","high","school",".","Togeth",",","they","decid","the","way","to","win","the","heart","of","the","cute","boy","and","popular","girl","is","to","come","in","first","at","the","school","talent","show",".","But","rival","Heather",",","Other","Heather",",","and","their","popular","boyfriend","Brett","and","Dirk","will","stop","at","noth","to","keep","our","hero","the","laugh","stock","of","the","school",".","It","'s","go","to","take","makeov",",","courag",",","and","mayb","even","a","littl","rap","to","beat","them","in","true","80s","style","."],"lemmas":["new","girl","Cassie","-lrb-","Brandon","Alexander","III","-rrb-","and","outcast","Maggie","-lrb-","Dudley","Beene","-rrb-","be","easily","the","most","awkward","girl","in","high","school",".","together",",","they","decide","the","way","to","win","the","heart","of","the","cute","boy","and","popular","girl","be","to","come","in","first","at","the","school","talent","show",".","but","rival","Heather",",","Other","Heather",",","and","they","popular","boyfriend","Brett","and","Dirk","will","stop","at","nothing","to","keep","we","hero","the","laughing","stock","of","the","school",".","it","be","go","to","take","makeover",",","courage",",","and","maybe","even","a","little","rapping","to","beat","they","in","true","80","style","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["New girl Cassie","girl Cassie (","Cassie ( Brandon","( Brandon Alexander","Brandon Alexander III","Alexander III )","III ) and",") and outcast","and outcast Maggie","outcast Maggie (","Maggie ( Dudley","( Dudley Beene","Dudley Beene )","Beene ) are",") are easily","are easily the","easily the most","the most awkward","most awkward girls","awkward girls in","girls in high","in high school","Together , they",", they decide","they decide the","decide the way","the way to","way to win","to win the","win the hearts","the hearts of","hearts of the","of the cute","the cute boys","cute boys and","boys and popular","and popular girls","popular girls is","girls is to","is to come","to come in","come in first","in first at","first at the","at the school","the school talent","school talent show","But rivals Heather","rivals Heather ,","Heather , Other",", Other Heather","Other Heather ,","Heather , and",", and their","and their popular","their popular boyfriends","popular boyfriends Brett","boyfriends Brett and","Brett and Dirk","and Dirk will","Dirk will stop","will stop at","stop at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to keep","to keep our","keep our heroes","our heroes the","heroes the laughing","the laughing stock","laughing stock of","stock of the","of the school","It 's going","'s going to","going to take","to take makeovers","take makeovers ,","makeovers , courage",", courage ,","courage , and",", and maybe","and maybe even","maybe even a","even a little","a little rapping","little rapping to","rapping to beat","to beat them","beat them in","them in true","in true 80s","true 80s style"],"2grams":["New girl","girl Cassie","Cassie (","( Brandon","Brandon Alexander","Alexander III","III )",") and","and outcast","outcast Maggie","Maggie (","( Dudley","Dudley Beene","Beene )",") are","are easily","easily the","the most","most awkward","awkward girls","girls in","in high","high school","Together ,",", they","they decide","decide the","the way","way to","to win","win the","the hearts","hearts of","of the","the cute","cute boys","boys and","and popular","popular girls","girls is","is to","to come","come in","in first","first at","at the","the school","school talent","talent show","But rivals","rivals Heather","Heather ,",", Other","Other Heather","Heather ,",", and","and their","their popular","popular boyfriends","boyfriends Brett","Brett and","and Dirk","Dirk will","will stop","stop at","at nothing","nothing to","to keep","keep our","our heroes","heroes the","the laughing","laughing stock","stock of","of the","the school","It 's","'s going","going to","to take","take makeovers","makeovers ,",", courage","courage ,",", and","and maybe","maybe even","even a","a little","little rapping","rapping to","to beat","beat them","them in","in true","true 80s","80s style"]}

{"title":"A Strange Course of Events","plot":"Forty-something Saul is a melancholic dreamer, with a tendency to run whenever things go wrong. He returns to Haifa one day for a reckoning with the father he has not seen in five years. But getting along with an airy-fairy mother-in-law with a penchant for new age, a daughter on the verge of adolescence and a father who's been converted to Yoga is not easy. After a fateful slip, Saul will find his place as son, a father and more.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Forty-someth","Saul","is","a","melanchol","dreamer",",","with","a","tendenc","to","run","whenev","thing","go","wrong",".","He","return","to","Haifa","one","day","for","a","reckon","with","the","father","he","has","not","seen","in","five","year",".","But","get","along","with","an","airy-fairi","mother-in-law","with","a","penchant","for","new","age",",","a","daughter","on","the","verg","of","adolesc","and","a","father","who","'s","been","convert","to","Yoga","is","not","easi",".","After","a","fate","slip",",","Saul","will","find","his","place","as","son",",","a","father","and","more","."],"lemmas":["forty-something","Saul","be","a","melancholic","dreamer",",","with","a","tendency","to","run","whenever","thing","go","wrong",".","he","return","to","Haifa","one","day","for","a","reckoning","with","the","father","he","have","not","see","in","five","year",".","but","get","along","with","a","airy-fairy","mother-in-law","with","a","penchant","for","new","age",",","a","daughter","on","the","verge","of","adolescence","and","a","father","who","be","be","convert","to","yoga","be","not","easy",".","after","a","fateful","slip",",","Saul","will","find","he","place","as","son",",","a","father","and","more","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Forty-something Saul is","Saul is a","is a melancholic","a melancholic dreamer","melancholic dreamer ,","dreamer , with",", with a","with a tendency","a tendency to","tendency to run","to run whenever","run whenever things","whenever things go","things go wrong","He returns to","returns to Haifa","to Haifa one","Haifa one day","one day for","day for a","for a reckoning","a reckoning with","reckoning with the","with the father","the father he","father he has","he has not","has not seen","not seen in","seen in five","in five years","But getting along","getting along with","along with an","with an airy-fairy","an airy-fairy mother-in-law","airy-fairy mother-in-law with","mother-in-law with a","with a penchant","a penchant for","penchant for new","for new age","new age ,","age , a",", a daughter","a daughter on","daughter on the","on the verge","the verge of","verge of adolescence","of adolescence and","adolescence and a","and a father","a father who","father who 's","who 's been","'s been converted","been converted to","converted to Yoga","to Yoga is","Yoga is not","is not easy","After a fateful","a fateful slip","fateful slip ,","slip , Saul",", Saul will","Saul will find","will find his","find his place","his place as","place as son","as son ,","son , a",", a father","a father and","father and more"],"2grams":["Forty-something Saul","Saul is","is a","a melancholic","melancholic dreamer","dreamer ,",", with","with a","a tendency","tendency to","to run","run whenever","whenever things","things go","go wrong","He returns","returns to","to Haifa","Haifa one","one day","day for","for a","a reckoning","reckoning with","with the","the father","father he","he has","has not","not seen","seen in","in five","five years","But getting","getting along","along with","with an","an airy-fairy","airy-fairy mother-in-law","mother-in-law with","with a","a penchant","penchant for","for new","new age","age ,",", a","a daughter","daughter on","on the","the verge","verge of","of adolescence","adolescence and","and a","a father","father who","who 's","'s been","been converted","converted to","to Yoga","Yoga is","is not","not easy","After a","a fateful","fateful slip","slip ,",", Saul","Saul will","will find","find his","his place","place as","as son","son ,",", a","a father","father and","and more"]}

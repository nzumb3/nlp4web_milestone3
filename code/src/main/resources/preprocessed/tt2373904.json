{"title":"I Love Special Olympics","plot":"I LOVE SPECIAL OLYPMICS is a documentary film that chronicles the lives of four people with learning disabilities. The film centres around a Downs Syndrome dancer, Hannah, in her twenties who wants to be the most famous Downs Syndrome person in the world. A World Champion Judo Fighter, Oliver, in his teens and in foster care who struggles to make sense of the world. A Ten Pin Bowler, Jonathan, in his fortes who couldn't walk until he was nine and said his first word at seven and a Basket Ball player, Tom, who just wants to fit in. They all have learning disabilities but this does not define them; what does is that they are all athletes who train all year round to compete in the Special Olympics.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["I","LOVE","SPECIAL","OLYPMICS","is","a","documentari","film","that","chronicl","the","live","of","four","peopl","with","learn","disabl",".","The","film","centr","around","a","Down","Syndrom","dancer",",","Hannah",",","in","her","twenti","who","want","to","be","the","most","famous","Down","Syndrom","person","in","the","world",".","A","World","Champion","Judo","Fighter",",","Oliver",",","in","his","teen","and","in","foster","care","who","struggl","to","make","sens","of","the","world",".","A","Ten","Pin","Bowler",",","Jonathan",",","in","his","fort","who","could","n't","walk","until","he","was","nine","and","said","his","first","word","at","seven","and","a","Basket","Ball","player",",","Tom",",","who","just","want","to","fit","in",".","They","all","have","learn","disabl","but","this","doe","not","defin","them",";","what","doe","is","that","they","are","all","athlet","who","train","all","year","round","to","compet","in","the","Special","Olympic","."],"lemmas":["I","love","special","olypmics","be","a","documentary","film","that","chronicle","the","life","of","four","people","with","learn","disability",".","the","film","centre","around","a","Downs","syndrome","dancer",",","Hannah",",","in","she","twenty","who","want","to","be","the","most","famous","Downs","syndrome","person","in","the","world",".","a","World","Champion","Judo","Fighter",",","Oliver",",","in","he","teens","and","in","foster","care","who","struggle","to","make","sense","of","the","world",".","a","ten","pin","Bowler",",","Jonathan",",","in","he","forte","who","could","not","walk","until","he","be","nine","and","say","he","first","word","at","seven","and","a","Basket","Ball","player",",","Tom",",","who","just","want","to","fit","in",".","they","all","have","learn","disability","but","this","do","not","define","they",";","what","do","be","that","they","be","all","athlete","who","train","all","year","round","to","compete","in","the","special","Olympics","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["I LOVE SPECIAL","LOVE SPECIAL OLYPMICS","SPECIAL OLYPMICS is","OLYPMICS is a","is a documentary","a documentary film","documentary film that","film that chronicles","that chronicles the","chronicles the lives","the lives of","lives of four","of four people","four people with","people with learning","with learning disabilities","The film centres","film centres around","centres around a","around a Downs","a Downs Syndrome","Downs Syndrome dancer","Syndrome dancer ,","dancer , Hannah",", Hannah ,","Hannah , in",", in her","in her twenties","her twenties who","twenties who wants","who wants to","wants to be","to be the","be the most","the most famous","most famous Downs","famous Downs Syndrome","Downs Syndrome person","Syndrome person in","person in the","in the world","A World Champion","World Champion Judo","Champion Judo Fighter","Judo Fighter ,","Fighter , Oliver",", Oliver ,","Oliver , in",", in his","in his teens","his teens and","teens and in","and in foster","in foster care","foster care who","care who struggles","who struggles to","struggles to make","to make sense","make sense of","sense of the","of the world","A Ten Pin","Ten Pin Bowler","Pin Bowler ,","Bowler , Jonathan",", Jonathan ,","Jonathan , in",", in his","in his fortes","his fortes who","fortes who could","who could n't","could n't walk","n't walk until","walk until he","until he was","he was nine","was nine and","nine and said","and said his","said his first","his first word","first word at","word at seven","at seven and","seven and a","and a Basket","a Basket Ball","Basket Ball player","Ball player ,","player , Tom",", Tom ,","Tom , who",", who just","who just wants","just wants to","wants to fit","to fit in","They all have","all have learning","have learning disabilities","learning disabilities but","disabilities but this","but this does","this does not","does not define","not define them","define them ;","them ;

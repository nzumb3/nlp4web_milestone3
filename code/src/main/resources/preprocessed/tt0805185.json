{"title":"Blood Trails","plot":"Anne is an avid bicycle enthusiast. She has a one night stand with a fellow biker, Chris, who is also apparently a cop. He gets rough with her and the memory haunts her. Three days later her boyfriend, Micheal, and her go into the Whistler range of mountains for a biking trip. Chris shows up, stalking and frightening them as they make their way further into the dangerous mountain range. Micheal is killed and Anne spends her time trying to survive, while witnessing the demise of several other innocent \"bystanders\" in the process.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Anne","is","an","avid","bicycl","enthusiast",".","She","has","a","one","night","stand","with","a","fellow","biker",",","Chris",",","who","is","also","appar","a","cop",".","He","get","rough","with","her","and","the","memori","haunt","her",".","Three","day","later","her","boyfriend",",","Micheal",",","and","her","go","into","the","Whistler","rang","of","mountain","for","a","bike","trip",".","Chris","show","up",",","stalk","and","frighten","them","as","they","make","their","way","further","into","the","danger","mountain","rang",".","Micheal","is","kill","and","Anne","spend","her","time","tri","to","surviv",",","while","wit","the","demis","of","sever","other","innoc","\"","bystand","\"","in","the","process","."],"lemmas":["Anne","be","a","avid","bicycle","enthusiast",".","she","have","a","one","night","stand","with","a","fellow","biker",",","Chris",",","who","be","also","apparently","a","cop",".","he","get","rough","with","she","and","the","memory","haunt","she",".","three","day","later","she","boyfriend",",","Micheal",",","and","she","go","into","the","Whistler","range","of","mountain","for","a","biking","trip",".","Chris","show","up",",","stalk","and","frightening","they","as","they","make","they","way","further","into","the","dangerous","mountain","range",".","Micheal","be","kill","and","Anne","spend","she","time","try","to","survive",",","while","witness","the","demise","of","several","other","innocent","``","bystander","''","in","the","process","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Anne is an","is an avid","an avid bicycle","avid bicycle enthusiast","She has a","has a one","a one night","one night stand","night stand with","stand with a","with a fellow","a fellow biker","fellow biker ,","biker , Chris",", Chris ,","Chris , who",", who is","who is also","is also apparently","also apparently a","apparently a cop","He gets rough","gets rough with","rough with her","with her and","her and the","and the memory","the memory haunts","memory haunts her","Three days later","days later her","later her boyfriend","her boyfriend ,","boyfriend , Micheal",", Micheal ,","Micheal , and",", and her","and her go","her go into","go into the","into the Whistler","the Whistler range","Whistler range of","range of mountains","of mountains for","mountains for a","for a biking","a biking trip","Chris shows up","shows up ,","up , stalking",", stalking and","stalking and frightening","and frightening them","frightening them as","them as they","as they make","they make their","make their way","their way further","way further into","further into the","into the dangerous","the dangerous mountain","dangerous mountain range","Micheal is killed","is killed and","killed and Anne","and Anne spends","Anne spends her","spends her time","her time trying","time trying to","trying to survive","to survive ,","survive , while",", while witnessing","while witnessing the","witnessing the demise","the demise of","demise of several","of several other","several other innocent","other innocent \"","innocent \" bystanders","\" bystanders \"","bystanders \" in","\" in the","in the process"],"2grams":["Anne is","is an","an avid","avid bicycle","bicycle enthusiast","She has","has a","a one","one night","night stand","stand with","with a","a fellow","fellow biker","biker ,",", Chris","Chris ,",", who","who is","is also","also apparently","apparently a","a cop","He gets","gets rough","rough with","with her","her and","and the","the memory","memory haunts","haunts her","Three days","days later","later her","her boyfriend","boyfriend ,",", Micheal","Micheal ,",", and","and her","her go","go into","into the","the Whistler","Whistler range","range of","of mountains","mountains for","for a","a biking","biking trip","Chris shows","shows up","up ,",", stalking","stalking and","and frightening","frightening them","them as","as they","they make","make their","their way","way further","further into","into the","the dangerous","dangerous mountain","mountain range","Micheal is","is killed","killed and","and Anne","Anne spends","spends her","her time","time trying","trying to","to survive","survive ,",", while","while witnessing","witnessing the","the demise","demise of","of several","several other","other innocent","innocent \"","\" bystanders","bystanders \"","\" in","in the","the process"]}

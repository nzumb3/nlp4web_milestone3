{"title":"The Last Homecoming","plot":"During the course of what seems to be an idyllic Mediterranean summer, the members of a Greek Cypriot family re-evaluate their relationships, as compelling desires and needs are beginning to unfold. Passions, infidelities and betrayal emerge, while political mumblings are heard in the distance. The year is 1974. Soon their world is about to change forever. Alexandra and Orestes, a handsome young couple, arrive from Athens, to spend the summer holidays with Orestes' family at the beautiful seaside town of northern Cyprus, Kyrenia. Phaedra, Orestes' mother, is a passionate Greek literature teacher who decides to mount a performance of Euripides' \"The Trojan Women\" with the help of the family and the townspeople. Her husband Yiannis is a silent observer, while her old lover Manolis follows closely her every move. The political turbulence of the time is manifested as Manolis, a right-wing nationalist, dreams of the unification of Cyprus and Greece stating that the \"Greekness\" of the island is under threat by Turkey. Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriot gardener and neighbor Aziz and his deaf daughter Nellin are the closest friends of the family, having shared a life-time next to each other. Meanwhile, Stefanos, Orestes' brother, who is a journalist and a political left-wing activist, also arrives at the house. The differences between the two brothers are obvious. Alexandra's restless nature leads to an inevitable attraction between her and Stefanos, while the whole community comes alive with the preparations for the play. As the play climaxes with a triumphant opening night, Stefanos and Alexandra resolve to the urgency of their passion and Manolis takes part in the coup to overthrow the president Makarios, bringing to a climax the complex forces at play. A superbly produced epic drama about love, loss and betrayal.","genres":["Drama","

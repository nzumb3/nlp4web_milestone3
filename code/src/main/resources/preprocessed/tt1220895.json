{"title":"Neutral","plot":"Neutral is made up of a series of loose-knit vignettes which flow from one to another without a traditional story line. Encountering over 70 characters during the course of a day, the film drifts in surreal directions and parades along with playfully absurd comedy. Examples of scenes include the shadows of a boy and girl discussing the favorite shapes they become, a chance encounter between a young woman and the author of her life, and a father taking his family trip far out of the way to return a friend's five pack of diet soda.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Neutral","is","made","up","of","a","seri","of","loose-knit","vignett","which","flow","from","one","to","anoth","without","a","tradit","stori","line",".","Encounter","over","70","charact","dure","the","cours","of","a","day",",","the","film","drift","in","surreal","direct","and","parad","along","with","play","absurd","comedi",".","Exampl","of","scene","includ","the","shadow","of","a","boy","and","girl","discuss","the","favorit","shape","they","becom",",","a","chanc","encount","between","a","young","woman","and","the","author","of","her","life",",","and","a","father","take","his","famili","trip","far","out","of","the","way","to","return","a","friend","'s","five","pack","of","diet","soda","."],"lemmas":["Neutral","be","make","up","of","a","series","of","loose-knit","vignette","which","flow","from","one","to","another","without","a","traditional","story","line",".","encounter","over","70","character","during","the","course","of","a","day",",","the","film","drift","in","surreal","direction","and","parade","along","with","playfully","absurd","comedy",".","example","of","scene","include","the","shadow","of","a","boy","and","girl","discuss","the","favorite","shape","they","become",",","a","chance","encounter","between","a","young","woman","and","the","author","of","she","life",",","and","a","father","take","he","family","trip","far","out","of","the","way","to","return","a","friend","'s","five","pack","of","diet","soda","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Neutral is made","is made up","made up of","up of a","of a series","a series of","series of loose-knit","of loose-knit vignettes","loose-knit vignettes which","vignettes which flow","which flow from","flow from one","from one to","one to another","to another without","another without a","without a traditional","a traditional story","traditional story line","Encountering over 70","over 70 characters","70 characters during","characters during the","during the course","the course of","course of a","of a day","a day ,","day , the",", the film","the film drifts","film drifts in","drifts in surreal","in surreal directions","surreal directions and","directions and parades","and parades along","parades along with","along with playfully","with playfully absurd","playfully absurd comedy","Examples of scenes","of scenes include","scenes include the","include the shadows","the shadows of","shadows of a","of a boy","a boy and","boy and girl","and girl discussing","girl discussing the","discussing the favorite","the favorite shapes","favorite shapes they","shapes they become","they become ,","become , a",", a chance","a chance encounter","chance encounter between","encounter between a","between a young","a young woman","young woman and","woman and the","and the author","the author of","author of her","of her life","her life ,","life , and",", and a","and a father","a father taking","father taking his","taking his family","his family trip","family trip far","trip far out","far out of","out of the","of the way","the way to","way to return","to return a","return a friend","a friend 's","friend 's five","'s five pack","five pack of","pack of diet","of diet soda"],"2grams":["Neutral is","is made","made up","up of","of a","a series","series of","of loose-knit","loose-knit vignettes","vignettes which","which flow","flow from","from one","one to","to another","another without","without a","a traditional","traditional story","story line","Encountering over","over 70","70 characters","characters during","during the","the course","course of","of a","a day","day ,",", the","the film","film drifts","drifts in","in surreal","surreal directions","directions and","and parades","parades along","along with","with playfully","playfully absurd","absurd comedy","Examples of","of scenes","scenes include","include the","the shadows","shadows of","of a","a boy","boy and","and girl","girl discussing","discussing the","the favorite","favorite shapes","shapes they","they become","become ,",", a","a chance","chance encounter","encounter between","between a","a young","young woman","woman and","and the","the author","author of","of her","her life","life ,",", and","and a","a father","father taking","taking his","his family","family trip","trip far","far out","out of","of the","the way","way to","to return","return a","a friend","friend 's","'s five","five pack","pack of","of diet","diet soda"]}

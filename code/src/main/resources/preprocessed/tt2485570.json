{"title":"The Profession","plot":"Tommy is a twenty one year old man, who has never been able to hold down a job for very long, having left school at sixteen. We soon learn that Tommy's financial backing is through the distribution of illegal substances. Over the years he has built up a large list of clients, some he respects, some he doesn't. But the end result always ends in a pay check. We follow Tommy as he goes onto bigger and 'better' things in his drug dealing career, but is it all as glamorous as Tommy first thought?","genres":["Crime"],"stems":["Tommi","is","a","twenti","one","year","old","man",",","who","has","never","been","abl","to","hold","down","a","job","for","veri","long",",","have","left","school","at","sixteen",".","We","soon","learn","that","Tommi","'s","financi","back","is","through","the","distribut","of","illeg","substanc",".","Over","the","year","he","has","built","up","a","larg","list","of","client",",","some","he","respect",",","some","he","doe","n't",".","But","the","end","result","alway","end","in","a","pay","check",".","We","follow","Tommi","as","he","goe","onto","bigger","and","'","better","'","thing","in","his","drug","deal","career",",","but","is","it","all","as","glamor","as","Tommi","first","thought","?"],"lemmas":["Tommy","be","a","twenty","one","year","old","man",",","who","have","never","be","able","to","hold","down","a","job","for","very","long",",","have","leave","school","at","sixteen",".","we","soon","learn","that","Tommy","'s","financial","backing","be","through","the","distribution","of","illegal","substance",".","over","the","year","he","have","build","up","a","large","list","of","client",",","some","he","respect",",","some","he","do","not",".","but","the","end","result","always","end","in","a","pay","check",".","we","follow","Tommy","as","he","go","onto","bigger","and","'","better","'","thing","in","he","drug","dealing","career",",","but","be","it","all","as","glamorous","as","Tommy","first","thought","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Tommy is a","is a twenty","a twenty one","twenty one year","one year old","year old man","old man ,","man , who",", who has","who has never","has never been","never been able","been able to","able to hold","to hold down","hold down a","down a job","a job for","job for very","for very long","very long ,","long , having",", having left","having left school","left school at","school at sixteen","We soon learn","soon learn that","learn that Tommy","that Tommy 's","Tommy 's financial","'s financial backing","financial backing is","backing is through","is through the","through the distribution","the distribution of","distribution of illegal","of illegal substances","Over the years","the years he","years he has","he has built","has built up","built up a","up a large","a large list","large list of","list of clients","of clients ,","clients , some",", some he","some he respects","he respects ,","respects , some",", some he","some he does","he does n't","But the end","the end result","end result always","result always ends","always ends in","ends in a","in a pay","a pay check","We follow Tommy","follow Tommy as","Tommy as he","as he goes","he goes onto","goes onto bigger","onto bigger and","bigger and '","and ' better","' better '","better ' things","' things in","things in his","in his drug","his drug dealing","drug dealing career","dealing career ,","career , but",", but is","but is it","is it all","it all as","all as glamorous","as glamorous as","glamorous as Tommy","as Tommy first","Tommy first thought"],"2grams":["Tommy is","is a","a twenty","twenty one","one year","year old","old man","man ,",", who","who has","has never","never been","been able","able to","to hold","hold down","down a","a job","job for","for very","very long","long ,",", having","having left","left school","school at","at sixteen","We soon","soon learn","learn that","that Tommy","Tommy 's","'s financial","financial backing","backing is","is through","through the","the distribution","distribution of","of illegal","illegal substances","Over the","the years","years he","he has","has built","built up","up a","a large","large list","list of","of clients","clients ,",", some","some he","he respects","respects ,",", some","some he","he does","does n't","But the","the end","end result","result always","always ends","ends in","in a","a pay","pay check","We follow","follow Tommy","Tommy as","as he","he goes","goes onto","onto bigger","bigger and","and '","' better","better '","' things","things in","in his","his drug","drug dealing","dealing career","career ,",", but","but is","is it","it all","all as","as glamorous","glamorous as","as Tommy","Tommy first","first thought"]}

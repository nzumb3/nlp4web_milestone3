{"title":"Fiona's Script","plot":"Composed of almost an all female cast, Fiona's Script is a story of a shy bisexual woman and her struggles with love, friendships, and her carrier. Title character Fiona (Sonia Monejano) is a twenty-something year old Latina who is trying to get over the recent breakup with her long time boyfriend Sebastian (Allan Lazo). For months she has been working on a screenplay but struggles to make anything of it. Feeling drained and uninspired Fiona spends most of her time reading, daydreaming, and trying to write. Fiona receives a wake-up call when she loses her job, this pushes her and gives her enough motivation to try to make her screenplay a reality. With a bit of help and encouragement from friends Fiona makes a harder effort to make her screenplay come to life. During this time she meets a picture perfect woman and immediately starts to sense chemistry. Meeting L makes her a bit uneasy because her ex-boyfriend used to lust over her while they were together. Fiona's gutsy friends give her courage to hook up with L. Although Fiona battles with her emotions, later she finds clarity and makes some courageous decisions.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Compos","of","almost","an","all","femal","cast",",","Fiona","'s","Script","is","a","stori","of","a","shi","bisexu","woman","and","her","struggl","with","love",",","friendship",",","and","her","carrier",".","Titl","charact","Fiona","(","Sonia","Monejano",")","is","a","twenty-someth","year","old","Latina","who","is","tri","to","get","over","the","recent","breakup","with","her","long","time","boyfriend","Sebastian","(","Allan","Lazo",")",".","For","month","she","has","been","work","on","a","screenplay","but","struggl","to","make","anyth","of","it",".","Feel","drain","and","uninspir","Fiona","spend","most","of","her","time","read",",","daydream",",","and","tri","to","write",".","Fiona","receiv","a","wake-up","call","when","she","lose","her","job",",","this","push","her","and","give","her","enough","motiv","to","tri","to","make","her","screenplay","a","realiti",".","With","a","bit","of","help","and","encourag","from","friend","Fiona","make","a","harder","effort","to","make","her","screenplay","come","to","life",".","Dure","this","time","she","meet","a","pictur","perfect","woman","and","immedi","start","to","sens","chemistri",".","Meet","L","make","her","a","bit","uneasi","becaus","her","ex-boyfriend","use","to","lust","over","her","while","they","were","togeth",".","Fiona","'s","gutsi","friend","give","her","courag","to","hook","up","with","L.","Although","Fiona","battl","with","her","emot",",","later","she","find","clariti","and","make","some","courag","decis","."],"lemmas":["compose","of","almost","a","all","female","cast",",","Fiona","'s","Script","be","a","story","of","a","shy","bisexual","woman","and","she","struggle","with","love",",","friendship",",","and","she","carrier",".","title","character","Fiona","-lrb-","Sonia","Monejano","-rrb-","be","a","twenty-something","year","old","Latina","who","be","try","to","get","over","the","recent","breakup","with","she","long","time","boyfriend","Sebastian","-lrb-","Allan","Lazo","-rrb-",".","for","month","she","have","be","work","on","a","screenplay","but","struggle","to","make","anything","of","it",".","feel","drain","and","uninspired","Fiona","spend","most","of","she","time","reading",",","daydream",",","and","try","to","write",".","Fiona","receive","a","wake-up","call","when","she","lose","she","job",",","this","push","she","and","give","she","enough","motivation","to","try","to","make","she","screenplay","a","reality",".","with","a","bit","of","help","and","encouragement","from","friend","Fiona","make","a","harder","effort","to","make","she","screenplay","come","to","life",".","during","this","time","she","meet","a","picture","perfect","woman","and","immediately","start","to","sense","chemistry",".","meet","l","make","she","a","bit","uneasy","because","she","ex-boyfriend","use","to","lust","over","she","while","they","be","together",".","Fiona","'s","gutsy","friend","give","she","courage","to","hook","up","with","L.","although","Fiona","battle","with","she","emotion",",","later","she","find","clarity","and","make","some","courageous","decision","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Composed

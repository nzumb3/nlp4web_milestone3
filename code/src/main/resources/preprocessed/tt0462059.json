{"title":"W.C.","plot":"W.C. centers on the trials and tribulations of two toilet attendants as they deal with argumentative customers, an interfering bar manager, hapless losers and grimy toilets. Jack Watts' dad had him arrested when his gambling problem got out of hand and he dipped his hand in the till of the family bar once too often. Just out of prison, he is told that the toilet attendant's job in the bar has just become vacant; Jack will work there until the money he took is paid back. Katya, who works as the attendant in the girls' toilet, is given the task of showing Jack the ropes. Jack and Katya are both trapped in their jobs. Jack, because of his debt to his family; Katya, on account of her illegal status. She is reluctant to trust him at first, as everyone she has ever met has wanted something from her, but slowly Jack and Katya begin to build a friendship.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"," Music"],"stems":["W.C.","center","on","the","trial","and","tribul","of","two","toilet","attend","as","they","deal","with","argument","custom",",","an","interf","bar","manag",",","hapless","loser","and","grimi","toilet",".","Jack","Watt","'","dad","had","him","arrest","when","his","gambl","problem","got","out","of","hand","and","he","dip","his","hand","in","the","till","of","the","famili","bar","onc","too","often",".","Just","out","of","prison",",","he","is","told","that","the","toilet","attend","'s","job","in","the","bar","has","just","becom","vacant",";","Jack","will","work","there","until","the","money","he","took","is","paid","back",".","Katya",",","who","work","as","the","attend","in","the","girl","'","toilet",",","is","given","the","task","of","show","Jack","the","rope",".","Jack","and","Katya","are","both","trap","in","their","job",".","Jack",",","becaus","of","his","debt","to","his","famili",";","Katya",",","on","account","of","her","illeg","status",".","She","is","reluct","to","trust","him","at","first",",","as","everyon","she","has","ever","met","has","want","someth","from","her",",","but","slowli","Jack","and","Katya","begin","to","build","a","friendship","."],"lemmas":["W.C.","center","on","the","trial","and","tribulation","of","two","toilet","attendant","as","they","deal","with","argumentative","customer",",","a","interfere","bar","manager",",","hapless","loser","and","grimy","toilet",".","Jack","Watts","'","dad","have","he","arrest","when","he","gambling","problem","get","out","of","hand","and","he","dip","he","hand","in","the","till","of","the","family","bar","once","too","often",".","just","out","of","prison",",","he","be","tell","that","the","toilet","attendant","'s","job","in","the","bar","have","just","become","vacant",";","Jack","will","work","there","until","the","money","he","take","be","pay","back",".","Katya",",","who","work","as","the","attendant","in","the","girl","'","toilet",",","be","give","the","task","of","show","Jack","the","rope",".","Jack","and","Katya","be","both","trap","in","they","job",".","Jack",",","because","of","he","debt","to","he","family",";","Katya",",","on","account","of","she","illegal","status",".","she","be","reluctant","to","trust","he","at","first",",","as","everyone","she","have","ever","meet","have","want","something","from","she",",","but","slowly","Jack","and","Katya","begin","to","build","a","friendship","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["W.C. centers on","centers on the","on the trials","the trials and","trials and tribulations","and tribulations of","tribulations of two","of two toilet","two toilet attendants","toilet attendants as","attendants as they","as they deal","they deal with","deal with argumentative","with argumentative customers","argumentative customers ,","customers , an",", an interfering","an interfering bar","interfering bar manager","bar manager ,","manager , hapless",", hapless losers","hapless losers and","losers and grimy","and grimy toilets","Jack Watts '","Watts ' dad","' dad had","dad had him","had him arrested","him arrested when","arrested when his","when his gambling","his gambling problem","gambling problem got","problem got out","got out of","out of hand","of hand and","hand and he","and he dipped","he dipped his","dipped his hand","his hand in","hand in the","in the till","the till of","till of the","of the family","the family bar","family bar once","bar once too","once too often","Just out of","out of prison","of prison ,","prison , he",", he is","he is told","is told that","told that the","that the toilet","the toilet attendant","toilet attendant 's","attendant 's job","'s job in","job in the","in the bar","the bar has","bar has just","has just become","just become vacant","become vacant ;","vacant ;

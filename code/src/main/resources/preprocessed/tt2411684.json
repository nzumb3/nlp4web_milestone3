{"title":"The Campaign","plot":"THE CAMPAIGN takes an inspiring look at California's No on 8 Campaign to defend same-sex marriage and covers the surprising history of relationship recognition in the United States. The story unfolds as a human drama following five ordinary people compelled by a passionate belief in equality. Their stories are placed inside a 60-year national context that explores the push for recognition of same-sex relationships since the 1950s. Ultimately THE CAMPAIGN provides a window into a timeless question: What inspires everyday people to opt in for something bigger than themselves?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["THE","CAMPAIGN","take","an","inspir","look","at","California","'s","No","on","8","Campaign","to","defend","same-sex","marriag","and","cover","the","surpris","histori","of","relationship","recognit","in","the","Unite","State",".","The","stori","unfold","as","a","human","drama","follow","five","ordinari","peopl","compel","by","a","passion","belief","in","equal",".","Their","stori","are","place","insid","a","60-year","nation","context","that","explor","the","push","for","recognit","of","same-sex","relationship","sinc","the","1950s",".","Ultimat","THE","CAMPAIGN","provid","a","window","into","a","timeless","question",":","What","inspir","everyday","peopl","to","opt","in","for","someth","bigger","than","themselv","?"],"lemmas":["the","CAMPAIGN","take","a","inspiring","look","at","California","'s","No","on","8","campaign","to","defend","same-sex","marriage","and","cover","the","surprising","history","of","relationship","recognition","in","the","United","States",".","the","story","unfold","as","a","human","drama","follow","five","ordinary","people","compel","by","a","passionate","belief","in","equality",".","they","story","be","place","inside","a","60-year","national","context","that","explore","the","push","for","recognition","of","same-sex","relationship","since","the","1950s",".","ultimately","the","CAMPAIGN","provide","a","window","into","a","timeless","question",":","what","inspire","everyday","people","to","opt","in","for","something","bigger","than","themselves","?"],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["THE CAMPAIGN takes","CAMPAIGN takes an","takes an inspiring","an inspiring look","inspiring look at","look at California","at California 's","California 's No","'s No on","No on 8","on 8 Campaign","8 Campaign to","Campaign to defend","to defend same-sex","defend same-sex marriage","same-sex marriage and","marriage and covers","and covers the","covers the surprising","the surprising history","surprising history of","history of relationship","of relationship recognition","relationship recognition in","recognition in the","in the United","the United States","The story unfolds","story unfolds as","unfolds as a","as a human","a human drama","human drama following","drama following five","following five ordinary","five ordinary people","ordinary people compelled","people compelled by","compelled by a","by a passionate","a passionate belief","passionate belief in","belief in equality","Their stories are","stories are placed","are placed inside","placed inside a","inside a 60-year","a 60-year national","60-year national context","national context that","context that explores","that explores the","explores the push","the push for","push for recognition","for recognition of","recognition of same-sex","of same-sex relationships","same-sex relationships since","relationships since the","since the 1950s","Ultimately THE CAMPAIGN","THE CAMPAIGN provides","CAMPAIGN provides a","provides a window","a window into","window into a","into a timeless","a timeless question","timeless question :","question : What",": What inspires","What inspires everyday","inspires everyday people","everyday people to","people to opt","to opt in","opt in for","in for something","for something bigger","something bigger than","bigger than themselves"],"2grams":["THE CAMPAIGN","CAMPAIGN takes","takes an","an inspiring","inspiring look","look at","at California","California 's","'s No","No on","on 8","8 Campaign","Campaign to","to defend","defend same-sex","same-sex marriage","marriage and","and covers","covers the","the surprising","surprising history","history of","of relationship","relationship recognition","recognition in","in the","the United","United States","The story","story unfolds","unfolds as","as a","a human","human drama","drama following","following five","five ordinary","ordinary people","people compelled","compelled by","by a","a passionate","passionate belief","belief in","in equality","Their stories","stories are","are placed","placed inside","inside a","a 60-year","60-year national","national context","context that","that explores","explores the","the push","push for","for recognition","recognition of","of same-sex","same-sex relationships","relationships since","since the","the 1950s","Ultimately THE","THE CAMPAIGN","CAMPAIGN provides","provides a","a window","window into","into a","a timeless","timeless question","question :",": What","What inspires","inspires everyday","everyday people","people to","to opt","opt in","in for","for something","something bigger","bigger than","than themselves"]}

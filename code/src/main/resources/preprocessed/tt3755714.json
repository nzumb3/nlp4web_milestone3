{"title":"Ahol az utak véget érnek","plot":"Our filming crew followed the folk band from Magyarpalatka on their tour in Hungary to record the great love of the Hungarians for the music from Mezoseg (Transylvania). Alas, on the second day of the shooting which started off in a rather good atmosphere, tragedy struck: the leader of the band, Béla Kodoba, suddenly died of a stroke. Our film followed him to his homeland, the Transylvanian village of Magyarpalatka, where his family, fellow musicians and friends accompanied him on his last journey in deep sadness. At his funeral Gypsy musicians gathered from all parts of the world to bid farewell to the famous violinist with the moving sounds of music. Instead of a road movie, the film \"Where the Roads Come to an End\" became a film about a final arrival. But it is also a film about a beginning, since it is here where the music of the poor people of Mezoseg gets reborn again and again to go round the world.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Our","film","crew","follow","the","folk","band","from","Magyarpalatka","on","their","tour","in","Hungari","to","record","the","great","love","of","the","Hungarian","for","the","music","from","Mezoseg","(","Transylvania",")",".","Alas",",","on","the","second","day","of","the","shoot","which","start","off","in","a","rather","good","atmospher",",","tragedi","struck",":","the","leader","of","the","band",",","Béla","Kodoba",",","sudden","die","of","a","stroke",".","Our","film","follow","him","to","his","homeland",",","the","Transylvanian","villag","of","Magyarpalatka",",","where","his","famili",",","fellow","musician","and","friend","accompani","him","on","his","last","journey","in","deep","sad",".","At","his","funer","Gypsi","musician","gather","from","all","part","of","the","world","to","bid","farewel","to","the","famous","violinist","with","the","move","sound","of","music",".","Instead","of","a","road","movi",",","the","film","\"","Where","the","Road","Come","to","an","End","\"","becam","a","film","about","a","final","arriv",".","But","it","is","also","a","film","about","a","begin",",","sinc","it","is","here","where","the","music","of","the","poor","peopl","of","Mezoseg","get","reborn","again","and","again","to","go","round","the","world","."],"lemmas":["we","film","crew","follow","the","folk","band","from","Magyarpalatka","on","they","tour","in","Hungary","to","record","the","great","love","of","the","Hungarians","for","the","music","from","Mezoseg","-lrb-","Transylvania","-rrb-",".","alas",",","on","the","second","day","of","the","shooting","which","start","off","in","a","rather","good","atmosphere",",","tragedy","strike",":","the","leader","of","the","band",",","Béla","Kodoba",",","suddenly","die","of","a","stroke",".","we","film","follow","he","to","he","homeland",",","the","transylvanian","village","of","Magyarpalatka",",","where","he","family",",","fellow","musician","and","friend","accompany","he","on","he","last","journey","in","deep","sadness",".","at","he","funeral","gypsy","musician","gather","from","all","part","of","the","world","to","bid","farewell","to","the","famous","violinist","with","the","move","sound","of","music",".","instead","of","a","road","movie",",","the","film","``","where","the","road","come","to","a","end","''","become","a","film","about","a","final","arrival",".","but","it","be","also","a","film","about","a","beginning",",","since","it","be","here","where","the","music","of","the","poor","people","of","Mezoseg","get","reborn","again","and","again","to","go","round","the","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Our

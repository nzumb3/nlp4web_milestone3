{"title":"Existo","plot":"In a post-critical thought dumbed down world, art and theatre is outlawed. Only the bravest most rebellious artists remain. With this comes the underworld art-scene, not unlike the alcohol prohibition years of America; and like then some politicians and elites are underground art seekers in the speakeasy art scene. There are also the boldest of the bold artist that take their art to the surface with public art bombs. These art bombs are met with the full force of law for fear of free thought breaking out and the darkness of democracy returning to the world.","genres":["Comedy"," Sci-Fi"," Musical"],"stems":["In","a","post-crit","thought","dumb","down","world",",","art","and","theatr","is","outlaw",".","Onli","the","bravest","most","rebelli","artist","remain",".","With","this","come","the","underworld","art-scen",",","not","unlik","the","alcohol","prohibit","year","of","America",";","and","like","then","some","politician","and","elit","are","underground","art","seeker","in","the","speakeasi","art","scene",".","There","are","also","the","boldest","of","the","bold","artist","that","take","their","art","to","the","surfac","with","public","art","bomb",".","These","art","bomb","are","met","with","the","full","forc","of","law","for","fear","of","free","thought","break","out","and","the","dark","of","democraci","return","to","the","world","."],"lemmas":["in","a","post-critical","thought","dumb","down","world",",","art","and","theatre","be","outlaw",".","only","the","bravest","most","rebellious","artist","remain",".","with","this","come","the","underworld","art-scene",",","not","unlike","the","alcohol","prohibition","year","of","America",";","and","like","then","some","politician","and","elite","be","underground","art","seeker","in","the","speakeasy","art","scene",".","there","be","also","the","boldest","of","the","bold","artist","that","take","they","art","to","the","surface","with","public","art","bomb",".","these","art","bomb","be","meet","with","the","full","force","of","law","for","fear","of","free","thought","break","out","and","the","darkness","of","democracy","return","to","the","world","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a post-critical","a post-critical thought","post-critical thought dumbed","thought dumbed down","dumbed down world","down world ,","world , art",", art and","art and theatre","and theatre is","theatre is outlawed","Only the bravest","the bravest most","bravest most rebellious","most rebellious artists","rebellious artists remain","With this comes","this comes the","comes the underworld","the underworld art-scene","underworld art-scene ,","art-scene , not",", not unlike","not unlike the","unlike the alcohol","the alcohol prohibition","alcohol prohibition years","prohibition years of","years of America","of America ;","America ; and","; and like","and like then","like then some","then some politicians","some politicians and","politicians and elites","and elites are","elites are underground","are underground art","underground art seekers","art seekers in","seekers in the","in the speakeasy","the speakeasy art","speakeasy art scene","There are also","are also the","also the boldest","the boldest of","boldest of the","of the bold","the bold artist","bold artist that","artist that take","that take their","take their art","their art to","art to the","to the surface","the surface with","surface with public","with public art","public art bombs","These art bombs","art bombs are","bombs are met","are met with","met with the","with the full","the full force","full force of","force of law","of law for","law for fear","for fear of","fear of free","of free thought","free thought breaking","thought breaking out","breaking out and","out and the","and the darkness","the darkness of","darkness of democracy","of democracy returning","democracy returning to","returning to the","to the world"],"2grams":["In a","a post-critical","post-critical thought","thought dumbed","dumbed down","down world","world ,",", art","art and","and theatre","theatre is","is outlawed","Only the","the bravest","bravest most","most rebellious","rebellious artists","artists remain","With this","this comes","comes the","the underworld","underworld art-scene","art-scene ,",", not","not unlike","unlike the","the alcohol","alcohol prohibition","prohibition years","years of","of America","America ;","; and","and like","like then","then some","some politicians","politicians and","and elites","elites are","are underground","underground art","art seekers","seekers in","in the","the speakeasy","speakeasy art","art scene","There are","are also","also the","the boldest","boldest of","of the","the bold","bold artist","artist that","that take","take their","their art","art to","to the","the surface","surface with","with public","public art","art bombs","These art","art bombs","bombs are","are met","met with","with the","the full","full force","force of","of law","law for","for fear","fear of","of free","free thought","thought breaking","breaking out","out and","and the","the darkness","darkness of","of democracy","democracy returning","returning to","to the","the world"]}

{"title":"Housemates","plot":"A supernatural movie about UK-based Nigerian-born African son - Patrick Bolaji (Emeka Ike). He is a qualified research scientist who ended up on unemployment benefits. This personal journey began following redundancy due to government cut backs and a move into a council share apartment at the brink of eviction from his private home when he was unable to meet rent. The council apartment has seen a steady turnover; other renters have typically fled after only 3-days due to haunting by the unhappy ghost of a deceased former tenant - Maya (Jazmine Hammoudeh). Patrick, thoroughly non-religious, without spiritual believes, and no belief in anything like a ghost is unlike most African sons born and raised in Nigeria. But from the first day he moves in, he begins to experience paranormal mishaps that becoming increasingly harder to dismiss as coincidences. As things start to spiral out of control, he doubts his own perceptions and beliefs. In desperation, and on the advice of his best friend Michelle (Sophie Fonteyn), he turns to Bimbo (Victoria Inyama), another UK-based Nigerian woman with weird psychic abilities.","genres":["Mystery"],"stems":["A","supernatur","movi","about","UK-base","Nigerian-born","African","son","-","Patrick","Bolaji","(","Emeka","Ike",")",".","He","is","a","qualifi","research","scientist","who","end","up","on","unemploy","benefit",".","This","person","journey","began","follow","redund","due","to","govern","cut","back","and","a","move","into","a","council","share","apart","at","the","brink","of","evict","from","his","privat","home","when","he","was","unabl","to","meet","rent",".","The","council","apart","has","seen","a","steadi","turnov",";","other","renter","have","typic","fled","after","onli","3-day","due","to","haunt","by","the","unhappi","ghost","of","a","deceas","former","tenant","-","Maya","(","Jazmin","Hammoudeh",")",".","Patrick",",","thorough","non-religi",",","without","spiritu","believ",",","and","no","belief","in","anyth","like","a","ghost","is","unlik","most","African","son","born","and","rais","in","Nigeria",".","But","from","the","first","day","he","move","in",",","he","begin","to","experi","paranorm","mishap","that","becom","increas","harder","to","dismiss","as","coincid",".","As","thing","start","to","spiral","out","of","control",",","he","doubt","his","own","percept","and","belief",".","In","desper",",","and","on","the","advic","of","his","best","friend","Michell","(","Sophi","Fonteyn",")",",","he","turn","to","Bimbo","(","Victoria","Inyama",")",",","anoth","UK-base","Nigerian","woman","with","weird","psychic","abil","."],"lemmas":["a","supernatural","movie","about","uk-based","nigerian-born","african","son","-","Patrick","Bolaji","-lrb-","Emeka","Ike","-rrb-",".","he","be","a","qualified","research","scientist","who","end","up","on","unemployment","benefit",".","this","personal","journey","begin","follow","redundancy","due","to","government","cut","back","and","a","move","into","a","council","share","apartment","at","the","brink","of","eviction","from","he","private","home","when","he","be","unable","to","meet","rent",".","the","council","apartment","have","see","a","steady","turnover",";","other","renter","have","typically","flee","after","only","3-day","due","to","haunting","by","the","unhappy","ghost","of","a","deceased","former","tenant","-","maya","-lrb-","Jazmine","Hammoudeh","-rrb-",".","Patrick",",","thoroughly","non-religious",",","without","spiritual","believe",",","and","no","belief","in","anything","like","a","ghost","be","unlike","most","african","son","bear","and","raise","in","Nigeria",".","but","from","the","first","day","he","move","in",",","he","begin","to","experience","paranormal","mishap","that","become","increasingly","harder","to","dismiss","as","coincidence",".","as","thing","start","to","spiral","out","of","control",",","he","doubt","he","own","perception","and","belief",".","in","desperation",",","and","on","the","advice","of","he","best","friend","Michelle","-lrb-","Sophie","Fonteyn","-rrb-",",","he","turn","to","Bimbo","-lrb-","Victoria","Inyama","-rrb-",",","another","uk-based","nigerian","woman","with","weird","psychic","ability","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A supernatural movie","supernatural movie about","movie about UK-based","about UK-based Nigerian-born","UK-based Nigerian-born African","Nigerian-born African son","African son -","son - Patrick","- Patrick Bolaji","Patrick Bolaji (","Bolaji ( Emeka","( Emeka Ike","Emeka Ike )","He is a","is a qualified","a qualified research","qualified research scientist","research scientist who","scientist who ended","who ended up","ended up on","up on unemployment","on unemployment benefits","This personal journey","personal journey began","journey began following","began following redundancy","following redundancy due","redundancy due to","due to government","to government cut","government cut backs","cut backs and","backs and a","and a move","a move into","move into a","into a council","a council share","council share apartment","share apartment at","apartment at the","at the brink","the brink of","brink of eviction","of eviction from","eviction from his","from his private","his private home","private home when","home when he","when he was","he was unable","was unable to","unable to meet","to meet rent","The council apartment","council apartment has","apartment has seen","has seen a","seen a steady","a steady turnover","steady turnover ;","turnover ;

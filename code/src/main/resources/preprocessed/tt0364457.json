{"title":"The Keeper","plot":"In Redwood County, the dancer Gina is attacked and her boyfriend is killed by a maniac in a motel. Gina is attended by Sergeant Burns and Lieutenant Krebs insists in giving a lift to her when she leaves the hospital. However, he kidnaps Gina and arrests her in a cell in the basement of his isolated house. The deranged policeman has a serious trauma from his childhood with dancers of night-clubs and establishes rules and punctuations for Gina while she is imprisoned. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Krebs is stalked by a local, Ruthie, who has a crush on him and wants to promote his amateurish puppet show with the character Deputy Rock, his alter-ego. Sgt. Burns is trying to find a clue where the missing Gina may be.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["In","Redwood","Counti",",","the","dancer","Gina","is","attack","and","her","boyfriend","is","kill","by","a","maniac","in","a","motel",".","Gina","is","attend","by","Sergeant","Burn","and","Lieuten","Kreb","insist","in","give","a","lift","to","her","when","she","leav","the","hospit",".","Howev",",","he","kidnap","Gina","and","arrest","her","in","a","cell","in","the","basement","of","his","isol","hous",".","The","derang","policeman","has","a","serious","trauma","from","his","childhood","with","dancer","of","night-club","and","establish","rule","and","punctuat","for","Gina","while","she","is","imprison",".","Meanwhil",",","Lieuten","Kreb","is","stalk","by","a","local",",","Ruthi",",","who","has","a","crush","on","him","and","want","to","promot","his","amateurish","puppet","show","with","the","charact","Deputi","Rock",",","his","alter-ego",".","Sgt.","Burn","is","tri","to","find","a","clue","where","the","miss","Gina","may","be","."],"lemmas":["in","Redwood","County",",","the","dancer","Gina","be","attack","and","she","boyfriend","be","kill","by","a","maniac","in","a","motel",".","Gina","be","attend","by","Sergeant","Burns","and","Lieutenant","Krebs","insist","in","give","a","lift","to","she","when","she","leave","the","hospital",".","however",",","he","kidnap","Gina","and","arrest","she","in","a","cell","in","the","basement","of","he","isolate","house",".","the","deranged","policeman","have","a","serious","trauma","from","he","childhood","with","dancer","of","night-club","and","establish","rule","and","punctuation","for","Gina","while","she","be","imprison",".","meanwhile",",","Lieutenant","Krebs","be","stalk","by","a","local",",","Ruthie",",","who","have","a","crush","on","he","and","want","to","promote","he","amateurish","puppet","show","with","the","character","Deputy","Rock",",","he","alter-ego",".","Sgt.","Burns","be","try","to","find","a","clue","where","the","miss","Gina","may","be","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In Redwood County","Redwood County ,","County , the",", the dancer","the dancer Gina","dancer Gina is","Gina is attacked","is attacked and","attacked and her","and her boyfriend","her boyfriend is","boyfriend is killed","is killed by","killed by a","by a maniac","a maniac in","maniac in a","in a motel","Gina is attended","is attended by","attended by Sergeant","by Sergeant Burns","Sergeant Burns and","Burns and Lieutenant","and Lieutenant Krebs","Lieutenant Krebs insists","Krebs insists in","insists in giving","in giving a","giving a lift","a lift to","lift to her","to her when","her when she","when she leaves","she leaves the","leaves the hospital","However , he",", he kidnaps","he kidnaps Gina","kidnaps Gina and","Gina and arrests","and arrests her","arrests her in","her in a","in a cell","a cell in","cell in the","in the basement","the basement of","basement of his","of his isolated","his isolated house","The deranged policeman","deranged policeman has","policeman has a","has a serious","a serious trauma","serious trauma from","trauma from his","from his childhood","his childhood with","childhood with dancers","with dancers of","dancers of night-clubs","of night-clubs and","night-clubs and establishes","and establishes rules","establishes rules and","rules and punctuations","and punctuations for","punctuations for Gina","for Gina while","Gina while she","while she is","she is imprisoned","Meanwhile , Lieutenant",", Lieutenant Krebs","Lieutenant Krebs is","Krebs is stalked","is stalked by","stalked by a","by a local","a local ,","local , Ruthie",", Ruthie ,","Ruthie , who",", who has","who has a","has a crush","a crush on","crush on him","on him and","him and wants","and wants to","wants to promote","to promote his","promote his amateurish","his amateurish puppet","amateurish puppet show","puppet show with","show with the","with the character","the character Deputy","character Deputy Rock","Deputy Rock ,","Rock , his",", his alter-ego","Sgt.

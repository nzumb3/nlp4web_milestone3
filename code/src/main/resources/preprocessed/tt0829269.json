{"title":"Pusk√°s Hungary","plot":"A portrayal of Ferenc Puskas, the kid from Kispest who became the brightest star in the footballing galaxy. He created a legend in his youth as captain of the famous Golden Team but adoration turned to persecution when he fled his homeland in 1956. He went on to travel the world with his soccer skills and achieved almost all that can be achieved on a football pitch. He was adored by Real Madrid supporters and played for the Spanish national squad after making Spain his second home. His career as a player lasted an amazing 20 years and after leading the sport on the field, he moved to the bench from where he coached players all the way to the European Cup Finals. He is still greatly admired in Hungary, Spain, Greece, Australia and across the globe. Puskas spent his life bringing people together from all walks of life as he took on new cultures and learned new languages but always remained a true Hungarian at heart. He loved life and lived it to the full. He became the world's most famous Hungarian and the name of Puskas still means Hungary to so many around the world.","genres":["Biography"," Sport","

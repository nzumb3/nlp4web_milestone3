{"title":"State of Mind: The Psychology of Control","plot":"Are we controlled? To what extent and by whom? What does it mean for humanity's future? The enormous implications of these questions deter most of us who must deal with the daily consequences of the answers. STATE OF MIND digs deeply into the sources to reveal that much of that which we believe to be truth has been deception, deliberately implanted in our consciousness to erect a \"tyranny over the minds of men\". From cradle to grave our parents, peers, institutions and society inform our values and behaviors. But this process has been hijacked. STATE OF MIND examines the science that has evolved over generations to keep us firmly in place and maintain the status quo so that dictators, power brokers and corporate puppeteers may profit from our ignorance and slavery. From the anvil of compulsory schooling to media and entertainment, we are kept in perpetual bondage to the ideas that shape our actions. STATE OF MIND delves into the abyss to bring to light the manipulation and shocking and suppressed examples that reveal the true agendas at work. From the ancient roots of the control of human behavior to its maturity in the mind control experiments of intelligence agencies and other organs of manipulation, STATE OF MIND reveals a plan for the future that drives home the dreadful price of our ignorance. We are prepared for a new paradigm. Will we choose our own paths or have one selected for us? STATE OF MIND unveils the answers that may decide whether humankind will fulfill its destiny or be forever shackled to its own creation.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Are","we","control","?","To","what","extent","and","by","whom","?","What","doe","it","mean","for","human","'s","futur","?","The","enorm","implic","of","these","question","deter","most","of","us","who","must","deal","with","the","daili","consequ","of","the","answer",".","STATE","OF","MIND","dig","deepli","into","the","sourc","to","reveal","that","much","of","that","which","we","believ","to","be","truth","has","been","decept",",","deliber","implant","in","our","conscious","to","erect","a","\"","tyranni","over","the","mind","of","men","\"",".","From","cradl","to","grave","our","parent",",","peer",",","institut","and","societi","inform","our","valu","and","behavior",".","But","this","process","has","been","hijack",".","STATE","OF","MIND","examin","the","scienc","that","has","evolv","over","generat","to","keep","us","firm","in","place","and","maintain","the","status","quo","so","that","dictat",",","power","broker","and","corpor","puppet","may","profit","from","our","ignor","and","slaveri",".","From","the","anvil","of","compulsori","school","to","media","and","entertain",",","we","are","kept","in","perpetu","bondag","to","the","idea","that","shape","our","action",".","STATE","OF","MIND","delv","into","the","abyss","to","bring","to","light","the","manipul","and","shock","and","suppress","exampl","that","reveal","the","true","agenda","at","work",".","From","the","ancient","root","of","the","control","of","human","behavior","to","it","matur","in","the","mind","control","experi","of","intellig","agenc","and","other","organ","of","manipul",",","STATE","OF","MIND","reveal","a","plan","for","the","futur","that","drive","home","the","dread","price","of","our","ignor",".","We","are","prepar","for","a","new","paradigm",".","Will","we","choos","our","own","path","or","have","one","select","for","us","?","STATE","OF","MIND","unveil","the","answer","that","may","decid","whether","humankind","will","fulfil","it","destini","or","be","forev","shackl","to","it","own","creation","."],"lemmas":["be","we","control","?","to","what","extent","and","by","whom","?","what","do","it","mean","for","humanity","'s","future","?","the","enormous","implication","of","these","question","deter","most","of","we","who","must","deal","with","the","daily","consequence","of","the","answer",".","state","of","mind","dig","deeply","into","the","source","to","reveal","that","much","of","that","which","we","believe","to","be","truth","have","be","deception",",","deliberately","implant","in","we","consciousness","to","erect","a","``","tyranny","over","the","mind","of","man","''",".","from","cradle","to","grave","we","parent",",","peer",",","institution","and","society","inform","we","value","and","behavior",".","but","this","process","have","be","hijack",".","state","of","mind","examine","the","science","that","have","evolve","over","generation","to","keep","we","firmly","in","place","and","maintain","the","status","quo","so","that","dictator",",","power","broker","and","corporate","puppeteer","may","profit","from","we","ignorance","and","slavery",".","from","the","anvil","of","compulsory","schooling","to","media","and","entertainment",",","we","be","keep","in","perpetual","bondage","to","the","idea","that","shape","we","action",".","state","of","mind","delve","into","the","abyss","to","bring","to","light","the","manipulation","and","shocking","and","suppress","example","that","reveal","the","true","agenda","at","work",".","from","the","ancient","root","of","the","control","of","human","behavior","to","its","maturity","in","the","mind","control","experiment","of","intelligence","agency","and","other","organ","of","manipulation",",","state","of","mind","reveal","a","plan","for","the","future","that","drive","home","the","dreadful","price","of","we","ignorance",".","we","be","prepare","for","a","new","paradigm",".","will","we","choose","we","own","path","or","have","one","select","for","we","?","state","of","mind","unveil","the","answer","that","may","decide","whether","humankind","will","fulfill","its","destiny","or","be","forever","shackle","to","its","own","creation","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Are

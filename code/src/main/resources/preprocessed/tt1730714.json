{"title":"Rubble Kings","plot":"From 1968 to 1975, gangs ruled New York City. Beyond the idealistic hopes of the civil rights movement lay a unfocused rage. Neither law enforcement nor social agency could end the escalating bloodshed. Peace came only through the most unlikely and courageous of events that would change the world for generations to come by giving birth to hip-hop culture. Rubble Kings, the most comprehensive documentation of life during this era of gang rule to date, tells the story of how a few extraordinary, forgotten people did the impossible, and how their actions impacted the world over.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["From","1968","to","1975",",","gang","rule","New","York","Citi",".","Beyond","the","idealist","hope","of","the","civil","right","movement","lay","a","unfocus","rage",".","Neither","law","enforc","nor","social","agenc","could","end","the","escal","bloodsh",".","Peac","came","onli","through","the","most","unlik","and","courag","of","event","that","would","chang","the","world","for","generat","to","come","by","give","birth","to","hip-hop","cultur",".","Rubbl","King",",","the","most","comprehens","document","of","life","dure","this","era","of","gang","rule","to","date",",","tell","the","stori","of","how","a","few","extraordinari",",","forgotten","peopl","did","the","imposs",",","and","how","their","action","impact","the","world","over","."],"lemmas":["from","1968","to","1975",",","gang","rule","New","York","City",".","beyond","the","idealistic","hope","of","the","civil","rights","movement","lay","a","unfocused","rage",".","neither","law","enforcement","nor","social","agency","could","end","the","escalate","bloodshed",".","Peace","come","only","through","the","most","unlikely","and","courageous","of","event","that","would","change","the","world","for","generation","to","come","by","give","birth","to","hip-hop","culture",".","Rubble","Kings",",","the","most","comprehensive","documentation","of","life","during","this","era","of","gang","rule","to","date",",","tell","the","story","of","how","a","few","extraordinary",",","forget","people","do","the","impossible",",","and","how","they","action","impact","the","world","over","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["From 1968 to","1968 to 1975","to 1975 ,","1975 , gangs",", gangs ruled","gangs ruled New","ruled New York","New York City","Beyond the idealistic","the idealistic hopes","idealistic hopes of","hopes of the","of the civil","the civil rights","civil rights movement","rights movement lay","movement lay a","lay a unfocused","a unfocused rage","Neither law enforcement","law enforcement nor","enforcement nor social","nor social agency","social agency could","agency could end","could end the","end the escalating","the escalating bloodshed","Peace came only","came only through","only through the","through the most","the most unlikely","most unlikely and","unlikely and courageous","and courageous of","courageous of events","of events that","events that would","that would change","would change the","change the world","the world for","world for generations","for generations to","generations to come","to come by","come by giving","by giving birth","giving birth to","birth to hip-hop","to hip-hop culture","Rubble Kings ,","Kings , the",", the most","the most comprehensive","most comprehensive documentation","comprehensive documentation of","documentation of life","of life during","life during this","during this era","this era of","era of gang","of gang rule","gang rule to","rule to date","to date ,","date , tells",", tells the","tells the story","the story of","story of how","of how a","how a few","a few extraordinary","few extraordinary ,","extraordinary , forgotten",", forgotten people","forgotten people did","people did the","did the impossible","the impossible ,","impossible , and",", and how","and how their","how their actions","their actions impacted","actions impacted the","impacted the world","the world over"],"2grams":["From 1968","1968 to","to 1975","1975 ,",", gangs","gangs ruled","ruled New","New York","York City","Beyond the","the idealistic","idealistic hopes","hopes of","of the","the civil","civil rights","rights movement","movement lay","lay a","a unfocused","unfocused rage","Neither law","law enforcement","enforcement nor","nor social","social agency","agency could","could end","end the","the escalating","escalating bloodshed","Peace came","came only","only through","through the","the most","most unlikely","unlikely and","and courageous","courageous of","of events","events that","that would","would change","change the","the world","world for","for generations","generations to","to come","come by","by giving","giving birth","birth to","to hip-hop","hip-hop culture","Rubble Kings","Kings ,",", the","the most","most comprehensive","comprehensive documentation","documentation of","of life","life during","during this","this era","era of","of gang","gang rule","rule to","to date","date ,",", tells","tells the","the story","story of","of how","how a","a few","few extraordinary","extraordinary ,",", forgotten","forgotten people","people did","did the","the impossible","impossible ,",", and","and how","how their","their actions","actions impacted","impacted the","the world","world over"]}

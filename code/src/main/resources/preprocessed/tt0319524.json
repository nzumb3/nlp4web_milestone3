{"title":"How to Deal","plot":"Halley is a young high school student who is disillusioned with love after seeing the many dysfunctional relationships around her. Her parents are now divorced and her father has a new young girlfriend she doesn't care for too much. Her mother is now always alone; and her sister is so overwhelmed by her upcoming wedding that she barely leaves the house anymore. On top of that, the shallowness of all the girls and guys at her school convinces Halley that finding true love is impossible. A tragic accident, however, leads her to meeting Macon, and suddenly Halley finds that true love can occur under unusual circumstances.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Drama"],"stems":["Halley","is","a","young","high","school","student","who","is","disillus","with","love","after","see","the","mani","dysfunct","relationship","around","her",".","Her","parent","are","now","divorc","and","her","father","has","a","new","young","girlfriend","she","doe","n't","care","for","too","much",".","Her","mother","is","now","alway","alon",";","and","her","sister","is","so","overwhelm","by","her","upcom","wed","that","she","bare","leav","the","hous","anymor",".","On","top","of","that",",","the","shallow","of","all","the","girl","and","guy","at","her","school","convinc","Halley","that","find","true","love","is","imposs",".","A","tragic","accid",",","howev",",","lead","her","to","meet","Macon",",","and","sudden","Halley","find","that","true","love","can","occur","under","unusu","circumst","."],"lemmas":["Halley","be","a","young","high","school","student","who","be","disillusion","with","love","after","see","the","many","dysfunctional","relationship","around","she",".","she","parent","be","now","divorce","and","she","father","have","a","new","young","girlfriend","she","do","not","care","for","too","much",".","she","mother","be","now","always","alone",";","and","she","sister","be","so","overwhelm","by","she","upcoming","wedding","that","she","barely","leave","the","house","anymore",".","on","top","of","that",",","the","shallowness","of","all","the","girl","and","guy","at","she","school","convince","Halley","that","find","true","love","be","impossible",".","a","tragic","accident",",","however",",","lead","she","to","meeting","Macon",",","and","suddenly","Halley","find","that","true","love","can","occur","under","unusual","circumstance","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Halley is a","is a young","a young high","young high school","high school student","school student who","student who is","who is disillusioned","is disillusioned with","disillusioned with love","with love after","love after seeing","after seeing the","seeing the many","the many dysfunctional","many dysfunctional relationships","dysfunctional relationships around","relationships around her","Her parents are","parents are now","are now divorced","now divorced and","divorced and her","and her father","her father has","father has a","has a new","a new young","new young girlfriend","young girlfriend she","girlfriend she does","she does n't","does n't care","n't care for","care for too","for too much","Her mother is","mother is now","is now always","now always alone","always alone ;","alone ;

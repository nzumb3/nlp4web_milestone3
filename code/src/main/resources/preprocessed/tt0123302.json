{"title":"Tokyo biyori","plot":"An enchanting look at the lives of a Japanese couple, based on the real-life diary extracts of the husband. He is a slightly offbeat photographer, a profession that grew out of his publishing a book of portraits of Yoko, his pretty wife, to whom he is devoted but doesn't entirely understand. She is highly strung, in fact a little off-balance, particularly as she forces her maternal attentions on neighbour's 8 year-old boy. The story is largely told in retrospect, after Yoko's death, and includes a variety of friends and incidental characters.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["An","enchant","look","at","the","live","of","a","Japanes","coupl",",","base","on","the","real-lif","diari","extract","of","the","husband",".","He","is","a","slight","offbeat","photograph",",","a","profess","that","grew","out","of","his","publish","a","book","of","portrait","of","Yoko",",","his","pretti","wife",",","to","whom","he","is","devot","but","doe","n't","entir","understand",".","She","is","high","strung",",","in","fact","a","littl","off-bal",",","particular","as","she","forc","her","matern","attent","on","neighbour","'s","8","year-old","boy",".","The","stori","is","larg","told","in","retrospect",",","after","Yoko","'s","death",",","and","includ","a","varieti","of","friend","and","incident","charact","."],"lemmas":["a","enchanting","look","at","the","life","of","a","japanese","couple",",","base","on","the","real-life","diary","extract","of","the","husband",".","he","be","a","slightly","offbeat","photographer",",","a","profession","that","grow","out","of","he","publish","a","book","of","portrait","of","Yoko",",","he","pretty","wife",",","to","whom","he","be","devoted","but","do","not","entirely","understand",".","she","be","highly","strung",",","in","fact","a","little","off-balance",",","particularly","as","she","force","she","maternal","attention","on","neighbour","'s","8","year-old","boy",".","the","story","be","largely","tell","in","retrospect",",","after","Yoko","'s","death",",","and","include","a","variety","of","friend","and","incidental","character","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An enchanting look","enchanting look at","look at the","at the lives","the lives of","lives of a","of a Japanese","a Japanese couple","Japanese couple ,","couple , based",", based on","based on the","on the real-life","the real-life diary","real-life diary extracts","diary extracts of","extracts of the","of the husband","He is a","is a slightly","a slightly offbeat","slightly offbeat photographer","offbeat photographer ,","photographer , a",", a profession","a profession that","profession that grew","that grew out","grew out of","out of his","of his publishing","his publishing a","publishing a book","a book of","book of portraits","of portraits of","portraits of Yoko","of Yoko ,","Yoko , his",", his pretty","his pretty wife","pretty wife ,","wife , to",", to whom","to whom he","whom he is","he is devoted","is devoted but","devoted but does","but does n't","does n't entirely","n't entirely understand","She is highly","is highly strung","highly strung ,","strung , in",", in fact","in fact a","fact a little","a little off-balance","little off-balance ,","off-balance , particularly",", particularly as","particularly as she","as she forces","she forces her","forces her maternal","her maternal attentions","maternal attentions on","attentions on neighbour","on neighbour 's","neighbour 's 8","'s 8 year-old","8 year-old boy","The story is","story is largely","is largely told","largely told in","told in retrospect","in retrospect ,","retrospect , after",", after Yoko","after Yoko 's","Yoko 's death","'s death ,","death , and",", and includes","and includes a","includes a variety","a variety of","variety of friends","of friends and","friends and incidental","and incidental characters"],"2grams":["An enchanting","enchanting look","look at","at the","the lives","lives of","of a","a Japanese","Japanese couple","couple ,",", based","based on","on the","the real-life","real-life diary","diary extracts","extracts of","of the","the husband","He is","is a","a slightly","slightly offbeat","offbeat photographer","photographer ,",", a","a profession","profession that","that grew","grew out","out of","of his","his publishing","publishing a","a book","book of","of portraits","portraits of","of Yoko","Yoko ,",", his","his pretty","pretty wife","wife ,",", to","to whom","whom he","he is","is devoted","devoted but","but does","does n't","n't entirely","entirely understand","She is","is highly","highly strung","strung ,",", in","in fact","fact a","a little","little off-balance","off-balance ,",", particularly","particularly as","as she","she forces","forces her","her maternal","maternal attentions","attentions on","on neighbour","neighbour 's","'s 8","8 year-old","year-old boy","The story","story is","is largely","largely told","told in","in retrospect","retrospect ,",", after","after Yoko","Yoko 's","'s death","death ,",", and","and includes","includes a","a variety","variety of","of friends","friends and","and incidental","incidental characters"]}

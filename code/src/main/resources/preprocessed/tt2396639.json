{"title":"Rendezvous in Kiruna","plot":"Ernest Toussaint, a renowned architect, lives for his work and - it could even be said - hides in it. He has a life companion, Victoire, in whom he only takes a distracted interest. One day, the bossy, haughty Ernest receives an unexpected call from the Swedish police, which will - although he does not know it yet - transform his life. Reluctantly enough first, Ernest decides to leave everything behind and to take the road to Kiruna, a small town in Swedish Lapland, where he has been asked to identify the body of ... his son. A son that he has never recognized and not even desired. On his way North he gives a lift to Magnus, a cool and sensitive young man about the same age as his late son...","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Ernest","Toussaint",",","a","renown","architect",",","live","for","his","work","and","-","it","could","even","be","said","-","hide","in","it",".","He","has","a","life","companion",",","Victoir",",","in","whom","he","onli","take","a","distract","interest",".","One","day",",","the","bossi",",","haughti","Ernest","receiv","an","unexpect","call","from","the","Swedish","polic",",","which","will","-","although","he","doe","not","know","it","yet","-","transform","his","life",".","Reluct","enough","first",",","Ernest","decid","to","leav","everyth","behind","and","to","take","the","road","to","Kiruna",",","a","small","town","in","Swedish","Lapland",",","where","he","has","been","ask","to","identifi","the","bodi","of","...","his","son",".","A","son","that","he","has","never","recogn","and","not","even","desir",".","On","his","way","North","he","give","a","lift","to","Magnus",",","a","cool","and","sensit","young","man","about","the","same","age","as","his","late","son","..."],"lemmas":["Ernest","Toussaint",",","a","renowned","architect",",","live","for","he","work","and","-","it","could","even","be","say","-","hide","in","it",".","he","have","a","life","companion",",","Victoire",",","in","whom","he","only","take","a","distract","interest",".","one","day",",","the","bossy",",","haughty","Ernest","receive","a","unexpected","call","from","the","swedish","police",",","which","will","-","although","he","do","not","know","it","yet","-","transform","he","life",".","reluctantly","enough","first",",","Ernest","decide","to","leave","everything","behind","and","to","take","the","road","to","Kiruna",",","a","small","town","in","Swedish","Lapland",",","where","he","have","be","ask","to","identify","the","body","of","...","he","son",".","a","son","that","he","have","never","recognize","and","not","even","desire",".","on","he","way","North","he","give","a","lift","to","Magnus",",","a","cool","and","sensitive","young","man","about","the","same","age","as","he","late","son","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ernest Toussaint ,","Toussaint , a",", a renowned","a renowned architect","renowned architect ,","architect , lives",", lives for","lives for his","for his work","his work and","work and -","and -

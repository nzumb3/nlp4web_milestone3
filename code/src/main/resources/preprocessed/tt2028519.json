{"title":"Mato Oput","plot":"Our film 'Mato Oput' chronicles the efforts of the people of Northern Uganda to foster justice, peace, and reconciliation following a twenty-year civil war. Uganda's civil war was characterized by extreme brutality. Many of the combatants were abducted children who were often forced to commit atrocities against their own families as a way to ensure loyalty. Now that peace has been restored, many of these children, who have become young adults, face the difficult challenge of reintegration with their communities. The film features interviews with a Catholic Bishop, several priests, and a woman who advocates radical forgiveness for the former abductees. The film explains the context of the violence and documents the concrete efforts of the community to heal itself.","genres":["Documentary","

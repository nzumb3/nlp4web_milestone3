{"title":"Bare p√• jobb","plot":"Robert Reiakvam is a documentary filmmaker. He is far from successful and tends to make films no one wants to screen. His next big project is a documentary about debt collectors. After securing a financing agreement from the State Film Fund, he immediately begins filming. His contact with three debt-collecting thugs causes him to change the focus of his film: It turns out debt collectors get no sick pay, no car allowance, and no lunch break. It is not an acknowledged profession. This seems totally unfair. They're just doing their job, after all. Robert gets excited about this brilliant new angle, but in the meantime the State Film Fund has reconsidered. They withdraw their support. The thugs are now so excited about the project that they offer Robert the necessary financing. Robert happily accepts the money, which he considers a gift, but which it turns out is a loan. Robert ends up becoming an unwilling participant in his own film.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Robert","Reiakvam","is","a","documentari","filmmak",".","He","is","far","from","success","and","tend","to","make","film","no","one","want","to","screen",".","His","next","big","project","is","a","documentari","about","debt","collector",".","After","secur","a","financ","agreement","from","the","State","Film","Fund",",","he","immedi","begin","film",".","His","contact","with","three","debt-collect","thug","caus","him","to","chang","the","focus","of","his","film",":","It","turn","out","debt","collector","get","no","sick","pay",",","no","car","allow",",","and","no","lunch","break",".","It","is","not","an","acknowledg","profess",".","This","seem","total","unfair",".","They","re","just","do","their","job",",","after","all",".","Robert","get","excit","about","this","brilliant","new","angl",",","but","in","the","meantim","the","State","Film","Fund","has","reconsid",".","They","withdraw","their","support",".","The","thug","are","now","so","excit","about","the","project","that","they","offer","Robert","the","necessari","financ",".","Robert","happili","accept","the","money",",","which","he","consid","a","gift",",","but","which","it","turn","out","is","a","loan",".","Robert","end","up","becom","an","unwil","particip","in","his","own","film","."],"lemmas":["Robert","Reiakvam","be","a","documentary","filmmaker",".","he","be","far","from","successful","and","tend","to","make","film","no","one","want","to","screen",".","he","next","big","project","be","a","documentary","about","debt","collector",".","after","secure","a","financing","agreement","from","the","State","Film","Fund",",","he","immediately","begin","film",".","he","contact","with","three","debt-collecting","thug","cause","he","to","change","the","focus","of","he","film",":","it","turn","out","debt","collector","get","no","sick","pay",",","no","car","allowance",",","and","no","lunch","break",".","it","be","not","a","acknowledged","profession",".","this","seem","totally","unfair",".","they","be","just","do","they","job",",","after","all",".","Robert","get","excite","about","this","brilliant","new","angle",",","but","in","the","meantime","the","State","Film","Fund","have","reconsider",".","they","withdraw","they","support",".","the","thug","be","now","so","excited","about","the","project","that","they","offer","Robert","the","necessary","financing",".","Robert","happily","accept","the","money",",","which","he","consider","a","gift",",","but","which","it","turn","out","be","a","loan",".","Robert","end","up","become","a","unwilling","participant","in","he","own","film","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Robert

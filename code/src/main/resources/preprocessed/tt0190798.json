When her father goes to the hospital for an operation, her mother comes to stay with her. Her neighbor, an old recluse whose only friend is his dog, begins to come out of his shell and these three lost souls try to give each other the strength to start over.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Maria",",","whose","parent","live","in","the","countri",",","can","not","stand","her","father","'s","authoritarian","way","and","move","to","the","citi",".","She","find","a","job","as","a","cleaner","and","tri","to","surviv","in","a","wretch","apart","in","the","shabbi","part","of","a","big","citi",".","She","is","pregnant",",","and","the","fact","that","her","boyfriend","has","abandon","her","doe","not","help","matter",".","When","her","father","goe","to","the","hospit","for","an","oper",",","her","mother","come","to","stay","with","her",".","Her","neighbor",",","an","old","reclus","whose","onli","friend","is","his","dog",",","begin","to","come","out","of","his","shell","and","these","three","lost","soul","tri","to","give","each","other","the","strength","to","start","over","."],"lemmas":["Maria",",","whose","parent","live","in","the","country",",","can","not","stand","she","father","'s","authoritarian","way","and","move","to","the","city",".","she","find","a","job","as","a","cleaner","and","try","to","survive","in","a","wretched","apartment","in","the","shabby","part","of","a","big","city",".","she","be","pregnant",",","and","the","fact","that","she","boyfriend","have","abandon","she","do","not","help","matter",".","when","she","father","go","to","the","hospital","for","a","operation",",","she","mother","come","to","stay","with","she",".","she","neighbor",",","a","old","recluse","whose","only","friend","be","he","dog",",","begin","to","come","out","of","he","shell","and","these","three","lose","soul","try","to","give","each","other","the","strength","to","start","over","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Maria , whose",", whose parents","whose parents live","parents live in","live in the","in the country","the country ,","country , can",", can not","can not stand","not stand her","stand her father","her father 's","father 's authoritarian","'s authoritarian ways","authoritarian ways and","ways and moves","and moves to","moves to the","to the city","She finds a","finds a job","a job as","job as a","as a cleaner","a cleaner and","cleaner and tries","and tries to","tries to survive","to survive in","survive in a","in a wretched","a wretched apartment","wretched apartment in","apartment in the","in the shabby","the shabby part","shabby part of","part of a","of a big","a big city","She is pregnant","is pregnant ,","pregnant , and",", and the","and the fact","the fact that","fact that her","that her boyfriend","her boyfriend has","boyfriend has abandoned","has abandoned her","abandoned her does","her does not","does not help","not help matters","When her father","her father goes","father goes to","goes to the","to the hospital","the hospital for","hospital for an","for an operation","an operation ,","operation , her",", her mother","her mother comes","mother comes to","comes to stay","to stay with","stay with her","Her neighbor ,","neighbor , an",", an old","an old recluse","old recluse whose","recluse whose only","whose only friend","only friend is","friend is his","is his dog","his dog ,","dog , begins",", begins to","begins to come","to come out","come out of","out of his","of his shell","his shell and","shell and these","and these three","these three lost","three lost souls","lost souls try","souls try to","try to give","to give each","give each other","each other the","other the strength","the strength to","strength to start","to start over"],"2grams":["Maria ,",", whose","whose parents","parents live","live in","in the","the country","country ,",", can","can not","not stand","stand her","her father","father 's","'s authoritarian","authoritarian ways","ways and","and moves","moves to","to the","the city","She finds","finds a","a job","job as","as a","a cleaner","cleaner and","and tries","tries to","to survive","survive in","in a","a wretched","wretched apartment","apartment in","in the","the shabby","shabby part","part of","of a","a big","big city","She is","is pregnant","pregnant ,",", and","and the","the fact","fact that","that her","her boyfriend","boyfriend has","has abandoned","abandoned her","her does","does not","not help","help matters","When her","her father","father goes","goes to","to the","the hospital","hospital for","for an","an operation","operation ,",", her","her mother","mother comes","comes to","to stay","stay with","with her","Her neighbor","neighbor ,",", an","an old","old recluse","recluse whose","whose only","only friend","friend is","is his","his dog","dog ,",", begins","begins to","to come","come out","out of","of his","his shell","shell and","and these","these three","three lost","lost souls","souls try","try to","to give","give each","each other","other the","the strength","strength to","to start","start over"]}

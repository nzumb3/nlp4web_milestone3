{"title":"A Stranger","plot":"When Slavko's old friend Djulaga dies, Slavko feels obliged to go to the funeral. But in his hometown of Mostar, in Bosnia & Herzegovina, this simple social obligation has the potential to get him into all kinds of trouble: with his neighbors or even with local political bigwigs. Yet if he does not go, his wife will think he's a coward, the grieving family will never forgive him - and he might have trouble forgiving himself. This is a compelling tale of everyday life in a fractured society, and a world where paranoia, comedy and drama co-exist. It is also an astute psychological portrait of a man who is forced to cross the invisible line that divides two communities. Above all, it is the story of a man who lost everything that defined him, when his country disintegrated.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["When","Slavko","'s","old","friend","Djulaga","die",",","Slavko","feel","oblig","to","go","to","the","funer",".","But","in","his","hometown","of","Mostar",",","in","Bosnia","&","Herzegovina",",","this","simpl","social","oblig","has","the","potenti","to","get","him","into","all","kind","of","troubl",":","with","his","neighbor","or","even","with","local","polit","bigwig",".","Yet","if","he","doe","not","go",",","his","wife","will","think","he","'s","a","coward",",","the","griev","famili","will","never","forgiv","him","-","and","he","might","have","troubl","forgiv","himself",".","This","is","a","compel","tale","of","everyday","life","in","a","fractur","societi",",","and","a","world","where","paranoia",",","comedi","and","drama","co-exist",".","It","is","also","an","astut","psycholog","portrait","of","a","man","who","is","forc","to","cross","the","invis","line","that","divid","two","communiti",".","Above","all",",","it","is","the","stori","of","a","man","who","lost","everyth","that","defin","him",",","when","his","countri","disintegr","."],"lemmas":["when","Slavko","'s","old","friend","Djulaga","die",",","Slavko","feel","oblige","to","go","to","the","funeral",".","but","in","he","hometown","of","Mostar",",","in","Bosnia","&","Herzegovina",",","this","simple","social","obligation","have","the","potential","to","get","he","into","all","kind","of","trouble",":","with","he","neighbor","or","even","with","local","political","bigwig",".","yet","if","he","do","not","go",",","he","wife","will","think","he","be","a","coward",",","the","grieve","family","will","never","forgive","he","-","and","he","might","have","trouble","forgive","himself",".","this","be","a","compelling","tale","of","everyday","life","in","a","fractured","society",",","and","a","world","where","paranoia",",","comedy","and","drama","co-exist",".","it","be","also","a","astute","psychological","portrait","of","a","man","who","be","force","to","cross","the","invisible","line","that","divide","two","community",".","above","all",",","it","be","the","story","of","a","man","who","lose","everything","that","define","he",",","when","he","country","disintegrate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["When Slavko 's","Slavko 's old","'s old friend","old friend Djulaga","friend Djulaga dies","Djulaga dies ,","dies , Slavko",", Slavko feels","Slavko feels obliged","feels obliged to","obliged to go","to go to","go to the","to the funeral","But in his","in his hometown","his hometown of","hometown of Mostar","of Mostar ,","Mostar , in",", in Bosnia","in Bosnia &","Bosnia & Herzegovina","& Herzegovina ,","Herzegovina , this",", this simple","this simple social","simple social obligation","social obligation has","obligation has the","has the potential","the potential to","potential to get","to get him","get him into","him into all","into all kinds","all kinds of","kinds of trouble","of trouble :","trouble : with",": with his","with his neighbors","his neighbors or","neighbors or even","or even with","even with local","with local political","local political bigwigs","Yet if he","if he does","he does not","does not go","not go ,","go , his",", his wife","his wife will","wife will think","will think he","think he 's","he 's a","'s a coward","a coward ,","coward , the",", the grieving","the grieving family","grieving family will","family will never","will never forgive","never forgive him","forgive him -","him -

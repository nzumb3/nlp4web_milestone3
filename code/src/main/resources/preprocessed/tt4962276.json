Determined to prove his innocence; she carried out her own investigation and finds the actual robber; Danny Frimpong (John Dumelo) a calm and collected sophisticated genius of a thief who has a personal vendetta against the bank he robbed Neptune Bank International. He robbed the bank using urbane technology which enabled him to enter, steal and exit the bank leaving everyone mystified as to how the theft was carried out, no witnesses, no evidence, yet the money is gone. She meets Danny and threatens him but later offers him a deal; and it's to rob the bank again with similar methods as the first so the authorities know the actual robber is still out there, then Danny will not lose what matters to him most and the reason for the bank robbery. She plans to relocate with the stolen money and start a new life with Ben when he is acquitted so as to get away from the stigma attached to ex-convicts and their families. They are successful in the robbing the bank, Effie now sets her sights on a jewellery warehouse and she wants Danny to rob it. With a lot of jewellery and money at stake, each one of them tries to outwit each other with medleys of smart thinking as they plan and execute the robberies.

{"title":"500 Years Later","plot":"Crime, drugs, HIV/AIDS, poor education, inferiority complex, low expectation, poverty, corruption, poor health, and underdevelopment plagues people of African descent globally - Why? 500 years later from the onset of Slavery and subsequent Colonialism, Africans are still struggling for basic freedom-Why? Filmed in five continents, and over twenty countries, 500 Years Later engages the authentic retrospective voice, told from the African vantage-point of those whom history has sought to silence by examining the collective atrocities that uprooted Africans from their culture and homeland. 500 Years Later is a timeless compelling journey, infused with the spirit and music of liberation that chronicles the struggle of a people who have fought and continue to fight for the most essential human right - freedom.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Crime",",","drug",",","HIV/AIDS",",","poor","educ",",","inferior","complex",",","low","expect",",","poverti",",","corrupt",",","poor","health",",","and","underdevelop","plagu","peopl","of","African","descent","global","-","Whi","?","500","year","later","from","the","onset","of","Slaveri","and","subsequ","Coloni",",","African","are","still","struggl","for","basic","freedom-Whi","?","Film","in","five","contin",",","and","over","twenti","countri",",","500","Year","Later","engag","the","authent","retrospect","voic",",","told","from","the","African","vantage-point","of","those","whom","histori","has","sought","to","silenc","by","examin","the","collect","atroc","that","uproot","African","from","their","cultur","and","homeland",".","500","Year","Later","is","a","timeless","compel","journey",",","infus","with","the","spirit","and","music","of","liber","that","chronicl","the","struggl","of","a","peopl","who","have","fought","and","continu","to","fight","for","the","most","essenti","human","right","-","freedom","."],"lemmas":["Crime",",","drug",",","hiv/aids",",","poor","education",",","inferiority","complex",",","low","expectation",",","poverty",",","corruption",",","poor","health",",","and","underdevelopment","plague","people","of","african","descent","globally","-","why","?","500","year","later","from","the","onset","of","slavery","and","subsequent","Colonialism",",","Africans","be","still","struggle","for","basic","freedom-why","?","film","in","five","continent",",","and","over","twenty","country",",","500","year","later","engage","the","authentic","retrospective","voice",",","tell","from","the","african","vantage-point","of","those","whom","history","have","seek","to","silence","by","examine","the","collective","atrocity","that","uproot","african","from","they","culture","and","homeland",".","500","year","later","be","a","timeless","compelling","journey",",","infuse","with","the","spirit","and","music","of","liberation","that","chronicle","the","struggle","of","a","people","who","have","fight","and","continue","to","fight","for","the","most","essential","human","right","-","freedom","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["Crime , drugs",", drugs ,","drugs , HIV/AIDS",", HIV/AIDS ,","HIV/AIDS , poor",", poor education","poor education ,","education , inferiority",", inferiority complex","inferiority complex ,","complex , low",", low expectation","low expectation ,","expectation , poverty",", poverty ,","poverty , corruption",", corruption ,","corruption , poor",", poor health","poor health ,","health , and",", and underdevelopment","and underdevelopment plagues","underdevelopment plagues people","plagues people of","people of African","of African descent","African descent globally","descent globally -","globally -

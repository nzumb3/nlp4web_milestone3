{"title":"Blood of the Witch: The Complete Film","plot":"Originally conceived as a trilogy of short silent films, Blood of the Witch: The Complete Film is a new edit of all three films put together into one stand-alone piece. It follows the ill-fated Abby Thelma on a quest to speak to her deceased father that turns both surreal and frightening. Director Casey T. Malone's lo-fi silent epic features an increasingly strange cast of characters who are all banded together on a Halloweenish journey through a world of dreams and autumn tropes.","genres":["Adventure"," Fantasy"," Animation"],"stems":["Origin","conceiv","as","a","trilog","of","short","silent","film",",","Blood","of","the","Witch",":","The","Complet","Film","is","a","new","edit","of","all","three","film","put","togeth","into","one","stand-alon","piec",".","It","follow","the","ill-fat","Abbi","Thelma","on","a","quest","to","speak","to","her","deceas","father","that","turn","both","surreal","and","frighten",".","Director","Casey","T.","Malon","'s","lo-fi","silent","epic","featur","an","increas","strang","cast","of","charact","who","are","all","band","togeth","on","a","Halloweenish","journey","through","a","world","of","dream","and","autumn","trope","."],"lemmas":["originally","conceive","as","a","trilogy","of","short","silent","film",",","Blood","of","the","witch",":","the","complete","Film","be","a","new","edit","of","all","three","film","put","together","into","one","stand-alone","piece",".","it","follow","the","ill-fated","Abby","Thelma","on","a","quest","to","speak","to","she","deceased","father","that","turn","both","surreal","and","frightening",".","Director","Casey","T.","Malone","'s","lo-fi","silent","epic","feature","a","increasingly","strange","cast","of","character","who","be","all","band","together","on","a","halloweenish","journey","through","a","world","of","dream","and","autumn","trope","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Originally conceived as","conceived as a","as a trilogy","a trilogy of","trilogy of short","of short silent","short silent films","silent films ,","films , Blood",", Blood of","Blood of the","of the Witch","the Witch :","Witch : The",": The Complete","The Complete Film","Complete Film is","Film is a","is a new","a new edit","new edit of","edit of all","of all three","all three films","three films put","films put together","put together into","together into one","into one stand-alone","one stand-alone piece","It follows the","follows the ill-fated","the ill-fated Abby","ill-fated Abby Thelma","Abby Thelma on","Thelma on a","on a quest","a quest to","quest to speak","to speak to","speak to her","to her deceased","her deceased father","deceased father that","father that turns","that turns both","turns both surreal","both surreal and","surreal and frightening","Director Casey T.","Casey T.

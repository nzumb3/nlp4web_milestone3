{"title":"Sotto voce","plot":"During the Algerian war, the road to Beni Boussaid on the Morocco-Algeria border is obstructed by the Morice line, a 430-mile long belt that is electrified and heavily mined. Moussa, a Moroccan friend of the revolution, helps refugees across the mountains. However, he must go through Beni Boussaid when he finds out that the path he usually takes is no longer safe. Hans, a Communist militant of the GDR, loses a leg on the way, while trying to remove a mine from a passageway. Normally, the wounded and sick are put to rest, but Hans is not a Muslim and cannot be a martyr.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Dure","the","Algerian","war",",","the","road","to","Beni","Boussaid","on","the","Morocco-Algeria","border","is","obstruct","by","the","Moric","line",",","a","430-mile","long","belt","that","is","electrifi","and","heavili","mine",".","Moussa",",","a","Moroccan","friend","of","the","revolut",",","help","refuge","across","the","mountain",".","Howev",",","he","must","go","through","Beni","Boussaid","when","he","find","out","that","the","path","he","usual","take","is","no","longer","safe",".","Han",",","a","Communist","milit","of","the","GDR",",","lose","a","leg","on","the","way",",","while","tri","to","remov","a","mine","from","a","passageway",".","Normal",",","the","wound","and","sick","are","put","to","rest",",","but","Han","is","not","a","Muslim","and","can","not","be","a","martyr","."],"lemmas":["during","the","Algerian","war",",","the","road","to","Beni","Boussaid","on","the","Morocco-Algeria","border","be","obstruct","by","the","Morice","line",",","a","430-mile","long","belt","that","be","electrify","and","heavily","mine",".","Moussa",",","a","moroccan","friend","of","the","revolution",",","help","refugee","across","the","mountain",".","however",",","he","must","go","through","Beni","Boussaid","when","he","find","out","that","the","path","he","usually","take","be","no","longer","safe",".","Hans",",","a","Communist","militant","of","the","GDR",",","lose","a","leg","on","the","way",",","while","try","to","remove","a","mine","from","a","passageway",".","normally",",","the","wounded","and","sick","be","put","to","rest",",","but","Hans","be","not","a","muslim","and","can","not","be","a","martyr","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["During the Algerian","the Algerian war","Algerian war ,","war , the",", the road","the road to","road to Beni","to Beni Boussaid","Beni Boussaid on","Boussaid on the","on the Morocco-Algeria","the Morocco-Algeria border","Morocco-Algeria border is","border is obstructed","is obstructed by","obstructed by the","by the Morice","the Morice line","Morice line ,","line , a",", a 430-mile","a 430-mile long","430-mile long belt","long belt that","belt that is","that is electrified","is electrified and","electrified and heavily","and heavily mined","Moussa , a",", a Moroccan","a Moroccan friend","Moroccan friend of","friend of the","of the revolution","the revolution ,","revolution , helps",", helps refugees","helps refugees across","refugees across the","across the mountains","However , he",", he must","he must go","must go through","go through Beni","through Beni Boussaid","Beni Boussaid when","Boussaid when he","when he finds","he finds out","finds out that","out that the","that the path","the path he","path he usually","he usually takes","usually takes is","takes is no","is no longer","no longer safe","Hans , a",", a Communist","a Communist militant","Communist militant of","militant of the","of the GDR","the GDR ,","GDR , loses",", loses a","loses a leg","a leg on","leg on the","on the way","the way ,","way , while",", while trying","while trying to","trying to remove","to remove a","remove a mine","a mine from","mine from a","from a passageway","Normally , the",", the wounded","the wounded and","wounded and sick","and sick are","sick are put","are put to","put to rest","to rest ,","rest , but",", but Hans","but Hans is","Hans is not","is not a","not a Muslim","a Muslim and","Muslim and can","and can not","can not be","not be a","be a martyr"],"2grams":["During the","the Algerian","Algerian war","war ,",", the","the road","road to","to Beni","Beni Boussaid","Boussaid on","on the","the Morocco-Algeria","Morocco-Algeria border","border is","is obstructed","obstructed by","by the","the Morice","Morice line","line ,",", a","a 430-mile","430-mile long","long belt","belt that","that is","is electrified","electrified and","and heavily","heavily mined","Moussa ,",", a","a Moroccan","Moroccan friend","friend of","of the","the revolution","revolution ,",", helps","helps refugees","refugees across","across the","the mountains","However ,",", he","he must","must go","go through","through Beni","Beni Boussaid","Boussaid when","when he","he finds","finds out","out that","that the","the path","path he","he usually","usually takes","takes is","is no","no longer","longer safe","Hans ,",", a","a Communist","Communist militant","militant of","of the","the GDR","GDR ,",", loses","loses a","a leg","leg on","on the","the way","way ,",", while","while trying","trying to","to remove","remove a","a mine","mine from","from a","a passageway","Normally ,",", the","the wounded","wounded and","and sick","sick are","are put","put to","to rest","rest ,",", but","but Hans","Hans is","is not","not a","a Muslim","Muslim and","and can","can not","not be","be a","a martyr"]}

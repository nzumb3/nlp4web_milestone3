{"title":"The Why","plot":"The Why is an experiential meditation on death, on loves lost, the duality of mind, and ultimately the nature of attachment and memory turned obsession. It takes place simultaneously in life, and in the nowhere place (a place of memory). The film revolves around three characters at the moment of death, where they find themselves existing in a place absent of love, absent of hate and absent of reason. The tighter they hold on to the illusion of what was- the farther out they spiral into a dark, surreal, suspended animation of the mind.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","Whi","is","an","experienti","medit","on","death",",","on","love","lost",",","the","dualiti","of","mind",",","and","ultim","the","natur","of","attach","and","memori","turn","obsess",".","It","take","place","simultan","in","life",",","and","in","the","nowher","place","(","a","place","of","memori",")",".","The","film","revolv","around","three","charact","at","the","moment","of","death",",","where","they","find","themselv","exist","in","a","place","absent","of","love",",","absent","of","hate","and","absent","of","reason",".","The","tighter","they","hold","on","to","the","illus","of","what","was","-","the","farther","out","they","spiral","into","a","dark",",","surreal",",","suspend","anim","of","the","mind","."],"lemmas":["the","why","be","a","experiential","meditation","on","death",",","on","love","lose",",","the","duality","of","mind",",","and","ultimately","the","nature","of","attachment","and","memory","turn","obsession",".","it","take","place","simultaneously","in","life",",","and","in","the","nowhere","place","-lrb-","a","place","of","memory","-rrb-",".","the","film","revolve","around","three","character","at","the","moment","of","death",",","where","they","find","themselves","exist","in","a","place","absent","of","love",",","absent","of","hate","and","absent","of","reason",".","the","tighter","they","hold","on","to","the","illusion","of","what","be","-","the","farther","out","they","spiral","into","a","dark",",","surreal",",","suspended","animation","of","the","mind","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["The Why is","Why is an","is an experiential","an experiential meditation","experiential meditation on","meditation on death","on death ,","death , on",", on loves","on loves lost","loves lost ,","lost , the",", the duality","the duality of","duality of mind","of mind ,","mind , and",", and ultimately","and ultimately the","ultimately the nature","the nature of","nature of attachment","of attachment and","attachment and memory","and memory turned","memory turned obsession","It takes place","takes place simultaneously","place simultaneously in","simultaneously in life","in life ,","life , and",", and in","and in the","in the nowhere","the nowhere place","nowhere place (","place ( a","( a place","a place of","place of memory","of memory )","The film revolves","film revolves around","revolves around three","around three characters","three characters at","characters at the","at the moment","the moment of","moment of death","of death ,","death , where",", where they","where they find","they find themselves","find themselves existing","themselves existing in","existing in a","in a place","a place absent","place absent of","absent of love","of love ,","love , absent",", absent of","absent of hate","of hate and","hate and absent","and absent of","absent of reason","The tighter they","tighter they hold","they hold on","hold on to","on to the","to the illusion","the illusion of","illusion of what","of what was","what was -","was - the","- the farther","the farther out","farther out they","out they spiral","they spiral into","spiral into a","into a dark","a dark ,","dark , surreal",", surreal ,","surreal , suspended",", suspended animation","suspended animation of","animation of the","of the mind"],"2grams":["The Why","Why is","is an","an experiential","experiential meditation","meditation on","on death","death ,",", on","on loves","loves lost","lost ,",", the","the duality","duality of","of mind","mind ,",", and","and ultimately","ultimately the","the nature","nature of","of attachment","attachment and","and memory","memory turned","turned obsession","It takes","takes place","place simultaneously","simultaneously in","in life","life ,",", and","and in","in the","the nowhere","nowhere place","place (","( a","a place","place of","of memory","memory )","The film","film revolves","revolves around","around three","three characters","characters at","at the","the moment","moment of","of death","death ,",", where","where they","they find","find themselves","themselves existing","existing in","in a","a place","place absent","absent of","of love","love ,",", absent","absent of","of hate","hate and","and absent","absent of","of reason","The tighter","tighter they","they hold","hold on","on to","to the","the illusion","illusion of","of what","what was","was -","- the","the farther","farther out","out they","they spiral","spiral into","into a","a dark","dark ,",", surreal","surreal ,",", suspended","suspended animation","animation of","of the","the mind"]}

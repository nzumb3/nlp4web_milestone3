{"title":"The Midnight Drives","plot":"Andy (Colt), a divorcee who has custody of his two young children over a winter half term, chooses to travel with them to Cornwall in an attempt to recapture the magic of his own childhood holidays. Divorce has left Andy in a lonely place, estranged from his kids, frustrated by his inability to communicate, and determined not to waste a single precious minute of his long-awaited holiday; but as the week wears on, the pressures begin to mount. Despite Andy's best efforts, the holiday slides inexorably towards disaster, thanks to a combination of eccentric guesthouse owners, doomed day-trips, a mysteriously elusive maze and the vagaries of the Cornish weather. But while the days are dogged by disaster, at night Andy and his kids discover a new sense of connection through a series of spontaneous, dreamlike excursions they come to call The Midnight Drives...","genres":["Drama"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Andi","(","Colt",")",",","a","divorce","who","has","custodi","of","his","two","young","children","over","a","winter","half","term",",","choos","to","travel","with","them","to","Cornwal","in","an","attempt","to","recaptur","the","magic","of","his","own","childhood","holiday",".","Divorc","has","left","Andi","in","a","lone","place",",","estrang","from","his","kid",",","frustrat","by","his","inabl","to","communic",",","and","determin","not","to","wast","a","singl","precious","minut","of","his","long-await","holiday",";","but","as","the","week","wear","on",",","the","pressur","begin","to","mount",".","Despit","Andi","'s","best","effort",",","the","holiday","slide","inexor","toward","disast",",","thank","to","a","combin","of","eccentr","guesthous","owner",",","doom","day-trip",",","a","mysteri","elus","maze","and","the","vagari","of","the","Cornish","weather",".","But","while","the","day","are","dog","by","disast",",","at","night","Andi","and","his","kid","discov","a","new","sens","of","connect","through","a","seri","of","spontan",",","dreamlik","excurs","they","come","to","call","The","Midnight","Drive","..."],"lemmas":["Andy","-lrb-","Colt","-rrb-",",","a","divorcee","who","have","custody","of","he","two","young","child","over","a","winter","half","term",",","choose","to","travel","with","they","to","Cornwall","in","a","attempt","to","recapture","the","magic","of","he","own","childhood","holiday",".","divorce","have","leave","Andy","in","a","lonely","place",",","estrange","from","he","kid",",","frustrate","by","he","inability","to","communicate",",","and","determine","not","to","waste","a","single","precious","minute","of","he","long-awaited","holiday",";","but","as","the","week","wear","on",",","the","pressure","begin","to","mount",".","despite","Andy","'s","best","effort",",","the","holiday","slide","inexorably","towards","disaster",",","thanks","to","a","combination","of","eccentric","guesthouse","owner",",","doomed","day-trip",",","a","mysteriously","elusive","maze","and","the","vagary","of","the","Cornish","weather",".","but","while","the","day","be","dog","by","disaster",",","at","night","Andy","and","he","kid","discover","a","new","sense","of","connection","through","a","series","of","spontaneous",",","dreamlike","excursion","they","come","to","call","the","midnight","drive","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Andy ( Colt","( Colt )","Colt ) ,",") , a",", a divorcee","a divorcee who","divorcee who has","who has custody","has custody of","custody of his","of his two","his two young","two young children","young children over","children over a","over a winter","a winter half","winter half term","half term ,","term , chooses",", chooses to","chooses to travel","to travel with","travel with them","with them to","them to Cornwall","to Cornwall in","Cornwall in an","in an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to recapture","to recapture the","recapture the magic","the magic of","magic of his","of his own","his own childhood","own childhood holidays","Divorce has left","has left Andy","left Andy in","Andy in a","in a lonely","a lonely place","lonely place ,","place , estranged",", estranged from","estranged from his","from his kids","his kids ,","kids , frustrated",", frustrated by","frustrated by his","by his inability","his inability to","inability to communicate","to communicate ,","communicate , and",", and determined","and determined not","determined not to","not to waste","to waste a","waste a single","a single precious","single precious minute","precious minute of","minute of his","of his long-awaited","his long-awaited holiday","long-awaited holiday ;","holiday ;

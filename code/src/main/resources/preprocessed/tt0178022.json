{"title":"Siam Sunset","plot":"A British design executive, who seemingly has everything going for him has his life totally changed when a refrigerator falls from an aircraft and lands on his wife. He decides to getaway from it all by taking a trip to Australia. On his bus, he meets a wild group of eccentrics, including a woman who has stolen cash from her drug-dealing boy friend. As the movie moves along, we learn further that the executive is constantly accident-prone and drawn into unlikely situations. The film's title refers to a new design color that Roache is trying to develop.","genres":["Adventure"," Romance"," Comedy"],"stems":["A","British","design","execut",",","who","seem","has","everyth","go","for","him","has","his","life","total","chang","when","a","refriger","fall","from","an","aircraft","and","land","on","his","wife",".","He","decid","to","getaway","from","it","all","by","take","a","trip","to","Australia",".","On","his","bus",",","he","meet","a","wild","group","of","eccentr",",","includ","a","woman","who","has","stolen","cash","from","her","drug-deal","boy","friend",".","As","the","movi","move","along",",","we","learn","further","that","the","execut","is","constant","accident-pron","and","drawn","into","unlik","situat",".","The","film","'s","titl","refer","to","a","new","design","color","that","Roach","is","tri","to","develop","."],"lemmas":["a","british","design","executive",",","who","seemingly","have","everything","go","for","he","have","he","life","totally","change","when","a","refrigerator","fall","from","a","aircraft","and","land","on","he","wife",".","he","decide","to","getaway","from","it","all","by","take","a","trip","to","Australia",".","on","he","bus",",","he","meet","a","wild","group","of","eccentric",",","include","a","woman","who","have","steal","cash","from","she","drug-dealing","boy","friend",".","as","the","movie","move","along",",","we","learn","further","that","the","executive","be","constantly","accident-prone","and","draw","into","unlikely","situation",".","the","film","'s","title","refer","to","a","new","design","color","that","Roache","be","try","to","develop","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A British design","British design executive","design executive ,","executive , who",", who seemingly","who seemingly has","seemingly has everything","has everything going","everything going for","going for him","for him has","him has his","has his life","his life totally","life totally changed","totally changed when","changed when a","when a refrigerator","a refrigerator falls","refrigerator falls from","falls from an","from an aircraft","an aircraft and","aircraft and lands","and lands on","lands on his","on his wife","He decides to","decides to getaway","to getaway from","getaway from it","from it all","it all by","all by taking","by taking a","taking a trip","a trip to","trip to Australia","On his bus","his bus ,","bus , he",", he meets","he meets a","meets a wild","a wild group","wild group of","group of eccentrics","of eccentrics ,","eccentrics , including",", including a","including a woman","a woman who","woman who has","who has stolen","has stolen cash","stolen cash from","cash from her","from her drug-dealing","her drug-dealing boy","drug-dealing boy friend","As the movie","the movie moves","movie moves along","moves along ,","along , we",", we learn","we learn further","learn further that","further that the","that the executive","the executive is","executive is constantly","is constantly accident-prone","constantly accident-prone and","accident-prone and drawn","and drawn into","drawn into unlikely","into unlikely situations","The film 's","film 's title","'s title refers","title refers to","refers to a","to a new","a new design","new design color","design color that","color that Roache","that Roache is","Roache is trying","is trying to","trying to develop"],"2grams":["A British","British design","design executive","executive ,",", who","who seemingly","seemingly has","has everything","everything going","going for","for him","him has","has his","his life","life totally","totally changed","changed when","when a","a refrigerator","refrigerator falls","falls from","from an","an aircraft","aircraft and","and lands","lands on","on his","his wife","He decides","decides to","to getaway","getaway from","from it","it all","all by","by taking","taking a","a trip","trip to","to Australia","On his","his bus","bus ,",", he","he meets","meets a","a wild","wild group","group of","of eccentrics","eccentrics ,",", including","including a","a woman","woman who","who has","has stolen","stolen cash","cash from","from her","her drug-dealing","drug-dealing boy","boy friend","As the","the movie","movie moves","moves along","along ,",", we","we learn","learn further","further that","that the","the executive","executive is","is constantly","constantly accident-prone","accident-prone and","and drawn","drawn into","into unlikely","unlikely situations","The film","film 's","'s title","title refers","refers to","to a","a new","new design","design color","color that","that Roache","Roache is","is trying","trying to","to develop"]}

{"title":"The Amazing Spider-Man","plot":"Peter Parker (Garfield) is an outcast high schooler who was abandoned by his parents as a boy, leaving him to be raised by his Uncle Ben (Sheen) and Aunt May (Field). Like most teenagers, Peter is trying to figure out who he is and how he got to be the person he is today. Peter is also finding his way with his first high school crush, Gwen Stacy (Stone), and together, they struggle with love, commitment, and secrets. As Peter discovers a mysterious briefcase that belonged to his father, he begins a quest to understand his parents' disappearance - leading him directly to Oscorp and the lab of Dr. Curt Connors (Ifans), his father's former partner. As Spider-Man is set on a collision course with Connors' alter-ego, The Lizard, Peter will make life-altering choices to use his powers and shape his destiny to become a hero.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Adventure"],"stems":["Peter","Parker","(","Garfield",")","is","an","outcast","high","schooler","who","was","abandon","by","his","parent","as","a","boy",",","leav","him","to","be","rais","by","his","Uncle","Ben","(","Sheen",")","and","Aunt","May","(","Field",")",".","Like","most","teenag",",","Peter","is","tri","to","figur","out","who","he","is","and","how","he","got","to","be","the","person","he","is","today",".","Peter","is","also","find","his","way","with","his","first","high","school","crush",",","Gwen","Staci","(","Stone",")",",","and","togeth",",","they","struggl","with","love",",","commit",",","and","secret",".","As","Peter","discov","a","mysteri","briefcas","that","belong","to","his","father",",","he","begin","a","quest","to","understand","his","parent","'","disappear","-","lead","him","direct","to","Oscorp","and","the","lab","of","Dr.","Curt","Connor","(","Ifan",")",",","his","father","'s","former","partner",".","As","Spider-Man","is","set","on","a","collis","cours","with","Connor","'","alter-ego",",","The","Lizard",",","Peter","will","make","life-alt","choic","to","use","his","power","and","shape","his","destini","to","becom","a","hero","."],"lemmas":["Peter","Parker","-lrb-","Garfield","-rrb-","be","a","outcast","high","schooler","who","be","abandon","by","he","parent","as","a","boy",",","leave","he","to","be","raise","by","he","Uncle","Ben","-lrb-","Sheen","-rrb-","and","Aunt","May","-lrb-","Field","-rrb-",".","like","most","teenager",",","Peter","be","try","to","figure","out","who","he","be","and","how","he","get","to","be","the","person","he","be","today",".","Peter","be","also","find","he","way","with","he","first","high","school","crush",",","Gwen","Stacy","-lrb-","Stone","-rrb-",",","and","together",",","they","struggle","with","love",",","commitment",",","and","secret",".","as","Peter","discover","a","mysterious","briefcase","that","belong","to","he","father",",","he","begin","a","quest","to","understand","he","parent","'","disappearance","-","lead","he","directly","to","Oscorp","and","the","lab","of","Dr.","Curt","Connors","-lrb-","Ifans","-rrb-",",","he","father","'s","former","partner",".","as","Spider-Man","be","set","on","a","collision","course","with","Connors","'","alter-ego",",","the","Lizard",",","Peter","will","make","life-altering","choice","to","use","he","power","and","shape","he","destiny","to","become","a","hero","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Peter Parker (","Parker ( Garfield","( Garfield )","Garfield ) is",") is an","is an outcast","an outcast high","outcast high schooler","high schooler who","schooler who was","who was abandoned","was abandoned by","abandoned by his","by his parents","his parents as","parents as a","as a boy","a boy ,","boy , leaving",", leaving him","leaving him to","him to be","to be raised","be raised by","raised by his","by his Uncle","his Uncle Ben","Uncle Ben (","Ben ( Sheen","( Sheen )","Sheen ) and",") and Aunt","and Aunt May","Aunt May (","May ( Field","( Field )","Like most teenagers","most teenagers ,","teenagers , Peter",", Peter is","Peter is trying","is trying to","trying to figure","to figure out","figure out who","out who he","who he is","he is and","is and how","and how he","how he got","he got to","got to be","to be the","be the person","the person he","person he is","he is today","Peter is also","is also finding","also finding his","finding his way","his way with","way with his","with his first","his first high","first high school","high school crush","school crush ,","crush , Gwen",", Gwen Stacy","Gwen Stacy (","Stacy ( Stone","( Stone )","Stone ) ,",") , and",", and together","and together ,","together , they",", they struggle","they struggle with","struggle with love","with love ,","love , commitment",", commitment ,","commitment , and",", and secrets","As Peter discovers","Peter discovers a","discovers a mysterious","a mysterious briefcase","mysterious briefcase that","briefcase that belonged","that belonged to","belonged to his","to his father","his father ,","father , he",", he begins","he begins a","begins a quest","a quest to","quest to understand","to understand his","understand his parents","his parents '","parents ' disappearance","' disappearance -","disappearance -

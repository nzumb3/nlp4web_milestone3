{"title":"Laptop","plot":"People in primitive times connected through people. And then there was a time when people wrote letters to connect, and letters took long to arrive. With advancement in technology, snail mail has taken a backseat, and connecting with people is now at our fingertips. From time immemorial, lives have been connected with other lives... Kolkata is a city which is an amalgamation of primitive life and the best of the techno-savvy world. On one side you still have more than half of its population living below the poverty line, combating illiteracy, while on the other side, you have a sizeable urban population that is connected by mobile phones and computers. It is in this world that we start our story, in which a single commodity - a laptop, connects so many lives and so many stories, as it changes hands and changes lives.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Peopl","in","primit","time","connect","through","peopl",".","And","then","there","was","a","time","when","peopl","wrote","letter","to","connect",",","and","letter","took","long","to","arriv",".","With","advanc","in","technolog",",","snail","mail","has","taken","a","backseat",",","and","connect","with","peopl","is","now","at","our","fingertip",".","From","time","immemori",",","live","have","been","connect","with","other","live","...","Kolkata","is","a","citi","which","is","an","amalgam","of","primit","life","and","the","best","of","the","techno-savvi","world",".","On","one","side","you","still","have","more","than","half","of","it","popul","live","below","the","poverti","line",",","combat","illiteraci",",","while","on","the","other","side",",","you","have","a","sizeabl","urban","popul","that","is","connect","by","mobil","phone","and","comput",".","It","is","in","this","world","that","we","start","our","stori",",","in","which","a","singl","commod","-","a","laptop",",","connect","so","mani","live","and","so","mani","stori",",","as","it","chang","hand","and","chang","live","."],"lemmas":["people","in","primitive","time","connect","through","people",".","and","then","there","be","a","time","when","people","write","letter","to","connect",",","and","letter","take","long","to","arrive",".","with","advancement","in","technology",",","snail","mail","have","take","a","backseat",",","and","connect","with","people","be","now","at","we","fingertip",".","from","time","immemorial",",","life","have","be","connect","with","other","life","...","Kolkata","be","a","city","which","be","a","amalgamation","of","primitive","life","and","the","best","of","the","techno-savvy","world",".","on","one","side","you","still","have","more","than","half","of","its","population","live","below","the","poverty","line",",","combate","illiteracy",",","while","on","the","other","side",",","you","have","a","sizeable","urban","population","that","be","connect","by","mobile","phone","and","computer",".","it","be","in","this","world","that","we","start","we","story",",","in","which","a","single","commodity","-","a","laptop",",","connect","so","many","life","and","so","many","story",",","as","it","change","hand","and","change","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["People in primitive","in primitive times","primitive times connected","times connected through","connected through people","And then there","then there was","there was a","was a time","a time when","time when people","when people wrote","people wrote letters","wrote letters to","letters to connect","to connect ,","connect , and",", and letters","and letters took","letters took long","took long to","long to arrive","With advancement in","advancement in technology","in technology ,","technology , snail",", snail mail","snail mail has","mail has taken","has taken a","taken a backseat","a backseat ,","backseat , and",", and connecting","and connecting with","connecting with people","with people is","people is now","is now at","now at our","at our fingertips","From time immemorial","time immemorial ,","immemorial , lives",", lives have","lives have been","have been connected","been connected with","connected with other","with other lives","other lives ...","lives ...

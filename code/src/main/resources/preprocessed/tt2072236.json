{"title":"Soundbreaker","plot":"Finland's most daring musician, the accordionist, composer, performer Kimmo Pohjonen, revolutionizes the accordion and shatters traditional musical standards. Extraordinary sounds explode from his custom built accordion and its bellows including electronic effects, accordion samples, voice, farm machines, animals and string quartet. Pohjonen bridges the gap between experimental, rock, folk and classic genres in fact creating an entirely new accordion music world. His performances are reminiscent of the violence of Roman gladiators and the castigation of medieval monks. The film is a journey of an exceptional artist grounded in basic human truths. The Cinematography and drama reveal a distinctive Scandinavian viewpoint. From the startling opening - the hero walks across an expanse of ice and drops through a hole into frigid water - right to the very end; a dramatic pace draws the viewer in, revealing the inner struggle of this iconoclast.","genres":["Biography"," Music"," Documentary"],"stems":["Finland","'s","most","dare","musician",",","the","accordionist",",","compos",",","perform","Kimmo","Pohjonen",",","revolution","the","accordion","and","shatter","tradit","music","standard",".","Extraordinari","sound","explod","from","his","custom","built","accordion","and","it","bellow","includ","electron","effect",",","accordion","sampl",",","voic",",","farm","machin",",","anim","and","string","quartet",".","Pohjonen","bridg","the","gap","between","experiment",",","rock",",","folk","and","classic","genr","in","fact","creat","an","entir","new","accordion","music","world",".","His","perform","are","reminisc","of","the","violenc","of","Roman","gladiat","and","the","castig","of","mediev","monk",".","The","film","is","a","journey","of","an","except","artist","ground","in","basic","human","truth",".","The","Cinematographi","and","drama","reveal","a","distinct","Scandinavian","viewpoint",".","From","the","startl","open","-","the","hero","walk","across","an","expans","of","ice","and","drop","through","a","hole","into","frigid","water","-","right","to","the","veri","end",";","a","dramat","pace","draw","the","viewer","in",",","reveal","the","inner","struggl","of","this","iconoclast","."],"lemmas":["Finland","'s","most","daring","musician",",","the","accordionist",",","composer",",","performer","Kimmo","Pohjonen",",","revolutionize","the","accordion","and","shatter","traditional","musical","standard",".","extraordinary","sound","explode","from","he","custom","build","accordion","and","its","bellows","include","electronic","effect",",","accordion","sample",",","voice",",","farm","machine",",","animal","and","string","quartet",".","Pohjonen","bridge","the","gap","between","experimental",",","rock",",","folk","and","classic","genre","in","fact","create","a","entirely","new","accordion","music","world",".","he","performance","be","reminiscent","of","the","violence","of","roman","gladiator","and","the","castigation","of","medieval","monk",".","the","film","be","a","journey","of","a","exceptional","artist","ground","in","basic","human","truth",".","the","cinematography","and","drama","reveal","a","distinctive","Scandinavian","viewpoint",".","from","the","startling","opening","-","the","hero","walk","across","a","expanse","of","ice","and","drop","through","a","hole","into","frigid","water","-","right","to","the","very","end",";","a","dramatic","pace","draw","the","viewer","in",",","reveal","the","inner","struggle","of","this","iconoclast","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Finland 's most","'s most daring","most daring musician","daring musician ,","musician , the",", the accordionist","the accordionist ,","accordionist , composer",", composer ,","composer , performer",", performer Kimmo","performer Kimmo Pohjonen","Kimmo Pohjonen ,","Pohjonen , revolutionizes",", revolutionizes the","revolutionizes the accordion","the accordion and","accordion and shatters","and shatters traditional","shatters traditional musical","traditional musical standards","Extraordinary sounds explode","sounds explode from","explode from his","from his custom","his custom built","custom built accordion","built accordion and","accordion and its","and its bellows","its bellows including","bellows including electronic","including electronic effects","electronic effects ,","effects , accordion",", accordion samples","accordion samples ,","samples , voice",", voice ,","voice , farm",", farm machines","farm machines ,","machines , animals",", animals and","animals and string","and string quartet","Pohjonen bridges the","bridges the gap","the gap between","gap between experimental","between experimental ,","experimental , rock",", rock ,","rock , folk",", folk and","folk and classic","and classic genres","classic genres in","genres in fact","in fact creating","fact creating an","creating an entirely","an entirely new","entirely new accordion","new accordion music","accordion music world","His performances are","performances are reminiscent","are reminiscent of","reminiscent of the","of the violence","the violence of","violence of Roman","of Roman gladiators","Roman gladiators and","gladiators and the","and the castigation","the castigation of","castigation of medieval","of medieval monks","The film is","film is a","is a journey","a journey of","journey of an","of an exceptional","an exceptional artist","exceptional artist grounded","artist grounded in","grounded in basic","in basic human","basic human truths","The Cinematography and","Cinematography and drama","and drama reveal","drama reveal a","reveal a distinctive","a distinctive Scandinavian","distinctive Scandinavian viewpoint","From the startling","the startling opening","startling opening -","opening -

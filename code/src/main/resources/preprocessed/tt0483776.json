{"title":"Popcorn","plot":"Danny has found the girl of his dreams, but he's too insecure to make a move. When he lands a job at a local movie theater where she works, he finds out that his first day is her last. After failing miserably at getting her attention, he enlists the help of the chief projectionist, who has watched one too many movies, and no longer sees the difference between film fiction and real life. It's cinema, but not as you know it.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Danni","has","found","the","girl","of","his","dream",",","but","he","'s","too","insecur","to","make","a","move",".","When","he","land","a","job","at","a","local","movi","theater","where","she","work",",","he","find","out","that","his","first","day","is","her","last",".","After","fail","miser","at","get","her","attent",",","he","enlist","the","help","of","the","chief","projectionist",",","who","has","watch","one","too","mani","movi",",","and","no","longer","see","the","differ","between","film","fiction","and","real","life",".","It","'s","cinema",",","but","not","as","you","know","it","."],"lemmas":["Danny","have","find","the","girl","of","he","dream",",","but","he","be","too","insecure","to","make","a","move",".","when","he","land","a","job","at","a","local","movie","theater","where","she","work",",","he","find","out","that","he","first","day","be","she","last",".","after","fail","miserably","at","get","she","attention",",","he","enlist","the","help","of","the","chief","projectionist",",","who","have","watch","one","too","many","movie",",","and","no","longer","see","the","difference","between","film","fiction","and","real","life",".","it","be","cinema",",","but","not","as","you","know","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Danny has found","has found the","found the girl","the girl of","girl of his","of his dreams","his dreams ,","dreams , but",", but he","but he 's","he 's too","'s too insecure","too insecure to","insecure to make","to make a","make a move","When he lands","he lands a","lands a job","a job at","job at a","at a local","a local movie","local movie theater","movie theater where","theater where she","where she works","she works ,","works , he",", he finds","he finds out","finds out that","out that his","that his first","his first day","first day is","day is her","is her last","After failing miserably","failing miserably at","miserably at getting","at getting her","getting her attention","her attention ,","attention , he",", he enlists","he enlists the","enlists the help","the help of","help of the","of the chief","the chief projectionist","chief projectionist ,","projectionist , who",", who has","who has watched","has watched one","watched one too","one too many","too many movies","many movies ,","movies , and",", and no","and no longer","no longer sees","longer sees the","sees the difference","the difference between","difference between film","between film fiction","film fiction and","fiction and real","and real life","It 's cinema","'s cinema ,","cinema , but",", but not","but not as","not as you","as you know","you know it"],"2grams":["Danny has","has found","found the","the girl","girl of","of his","his dreams","dreams ,",", but","but he","he 's","'s too","too insecure","insecure to","to make","make a","a move","When he","he lands","lands a","a job","job at","at a","a local","local movie","movie theater","theater where","where she","she works","works ,",", he","he finds","finds out","out that","that his","his first","first day","day is","is her","her last","After failing","failing miserably","miserably at","at getting","getting her","her attention","attention ,",", he","he enlists","enlists the","the help","help of","of the","the chief","chief projectionist","projectionist ,",", who","who has","has watched","watched one","one too","too many","many movies","movies ,",", and","and no","no longer","longer sees","sees the","the difference","difference between","between film","film fiction","fiction and","and real","real life","It 's","'s cinema","cinema ,",", but","but not","not as","as you","you know","know it"]}

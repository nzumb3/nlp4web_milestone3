{"title":"Drink Tea Ghost Man","plot":"Edmund, a young English telemarketer, is willing to risk his job for just one thing, or anything, actually. On a whim, he lands in Hong Kong, the exotic city of opportunity, hustlers, bizarre expats and Annie, the one true love of his life. She's seductive, intense and in love with Laurent, a French neo-Marxist. Caught up in a landscape of tropical islands, bustling markets, and towering skyscrapers the down-and-out suburbanite will stop at nothing to win the heart of his Bohemian Princess. That is, until he meets Siu Ling. She's conservative, Asian, available, and the one true love of his life... Edmund is 'about to make a very important decision'. Drink Tea Ghost Man (Yum Cha Gweilo) is a satire on early-life crisis, superficial love, and the search for meaning.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Edmund",",","a","young","English","telemarket",",","is","will","to","risk","his","job","for","just","one","thing",",","or","anyth",",","actual",".","On","a","whim",",","he","land","in","Hong","Kong",",","the","exot","citi","of","opportun",",","hustler",",","bizarr","expat","and","Annie",",","the","one","true","love","of","his","life",".","She","'s","seduct",",","intens","and","in","love","with","Laurent",",","a","French","neo-Marxist",".","Caught","up","in","a","landscap","of","tropic","island",",","bustl","market",",","and","tower","skyscrap","the","down-and-out","suburbanit","will","stop","at","noth","to","win","the","heart","of","his","Bohemian","Princess",".","That","is",",","until","he","meet","Siu","Ling",".","She","'s","conserv",",","Asian",",","avail",",","and","the","one","true","love","of","his","life","...","Edmund","is","'","about","to","make","a","veri","import","decis","'",".","Drink","Tea","Ghost","Man","(","Yum","Cha","Gweilo",")","is","a","satir","on","early-lif","crisi",",","superfici","love",",","and","the","search","for","mean","."],"lemmas":["Edmund",",","a","young","English","telemarketer",",","be","willing","to","risk","he","job","for","just","one","thing",",","or","anything",",","actually",".","on","a","whim",",","he","land","in","Hong","Kong",",","the","exotic","city","of","opportunity",",","hustler",",","bizarre","expat","and","Annie",",","the","one","true","love","of","he","life",".","she","be","seductive",",","intense","and","in","love","with","Laurent",",","a","french","neo-marxist",".","catch","up","in","a","landscape","of","tropical","island",",","bustling","market",",","and","tower","skyscraper","the","down-and-out","suburbanite","will","stop","at","nothing","to","win","the","heart","of","he","Bohemian","Princess",".","that","be",",","until","he","meet","Siu","Ling",".","she","be","conservative",",","asian",",","available",",","and","the","one","true","love","of","he","life","...","Edmund","be","'","about","to","make","a","very","important","decision","'",".","drink","Tea","ghost","man","-lrb-","yum","cha","gweilo","-rrb-","be","a","satire","on","early-life","crisis",",","superficial","love",",","and","the","search","for","meaning","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Edmund , a",", a young","a young English","young English telemarketer","English telemarketer ,","telemarketer , is",", is willing","is willing to","willing to risk","to risk his","risk his job","his job for","job for just","for just one","just one thing","one thing ,","thing , or",", or anything","or anything ,","anything , actually","On a whim","a whim ,","whim , he",", he lands","he lands in","lands in Hong","in Hong Kong","Hong Kong ,","Kong , the",", the exotic","the exotic city","exotic city of","city of opportunity","of opportunity ,","opportunity , hustlers",", hustlers ,","hustlers , bizarre",", bizarre expats","bizarre expats and","expats and Annie","and Annie ,","Annie , the",", the one","the one true","one true love","true love of","love of his","of his life","She 's seductive","'s seductive ,","seductive , intense",", intense and","intense and in","and in love","in love with","love with Laurent","with Laurent ,","Laurent , a",", a French","a French neo-Marxist","Caught up in","up in a","in a landscape","a landscape of","landscape of tropical","of tropical islands","tropical islands ,","islands , bustling",", bustling markets","bustling markets ,","markets , and",", and towering","and towering skyscrapers","towering skyscrapers the","skyscrapers the down-and-out","the down-and-out suburbanite","down-and-out suburbanite will","suburbanite will stop","will stop at","stop at nothing","at nothing to","nothing to win","to win the","win the heart","the heart of","heart of his","of his Bohemian","his Bohemian Princess","That is ,","is , until",", until he","until he meets","he meets Siu","meets Siu Ling","She 's conservative","'s conservative ,","conservative , Asian",", Asian ,","Asian , available",", available ,","available , and",", and the","and the one","the one true","one true love","true love of","love of his","of his life","his life ...","life ...

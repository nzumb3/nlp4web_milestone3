{"title":"The Wounded Brick","plot":"What does housing mean for a human being and for our modern society? The demographical, sociological, and economical upheavals in the modern world compel us to put this term radically in question. We leave the ivory tower and look at real life: We meet earthquake victims in the Italian Abruzzo who lost their homes and therefore an important part of their social and cultural identity. This experience became an impulse and pivotal point for mediart01 to begin a very personal search for the nature of housing and to find out its existentialistic meaning both for the individual and our modern society. We meet famous architects, urban planners and sociologists, who talk about their efforts to design housing according to people's needs. They fight against economical and political interests and speculation. Finally all their stories seem to be connected: Architecture is life and housing is the human soul.","genres":["Biography","

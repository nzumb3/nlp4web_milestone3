{"title":"The Ghost of Roger Casement","plot":"Roger Casement was an Irish born diplomat who worked for the British government. He was knighted by the crown for his services but was convicted for his role in the Easter Uprising during World War I. When his \"black diaries\" were made public revealing his homosexuality all public support faded and he was executed and soon written out of Irish History. The diaries are now being subjected to intense scrutiny as possible forgeries and the man's role in history is being reevaluated.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Roger","Casement","was","an","Irish","born","diplomat","who","work","for","the","British","govern",".","He","was","knight","by","the","crown","for","his","servic","but","was","convict","for","his","role","in","the","Easter","Uprise","dure","World","War","I",".","When","his","\"","black","diari","\"","were","made","public","reveal","his","homosexu","all","public","support","fade","and","he","was","execut","and","soon","written","out","of","Irish","Histori",".","The","diari","are","now","be","subject","to","intens","scrutini","as","possibl","forgeri","and","the","man","'s","role","in","histori","is","be","reevalu","."],"lemmas":["Roger","Casement","be","a","irish","born","diplomat","who","work","for","the","british","government",".","he","be","knight","by","the","crown","for","he","service","but","be","convict","for","he","role","in","the","Easter","Uprising","during","World","War","I",".","when","he","``","black","diary","''","be","make","public","reveal","he","homosexuality","all","public","support","fade","and","he","be","execute","and","soon","write","out","of","irish","history",".","the","diary","be","now","be","subject","to","intense","scrutiny","as","possible","forgery","and","the","man","'s","role","in","history","be","be","reevaluate","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Roger Casement was","Casement was an","was an Irish","an Irish born","Irish born diplomat","born diplomat who","diplomat who worked","who worked for","worked for the","for the British","the British government","He was knighted","was knighted by","knighted by the","by the crown","the crown for","crown for his","for his services","his services but","services but was","but was convicted","was convicted for","convicted for his","for his role","his role in","role in the","in the Easter","the Easter Uprising","Easter Uprising during","Uprising during World","during World War","World War I","When his \"","his \" black","\" black diaries","black diaries \"","diaries \" were","\" were made","were made public","made public revealing","public revealing his","revealing his homosexuality","his homosexuality all","homosexuality all public","all public support","public support faded","support faded and","faded and he","and he was","he was executed","was executed and","executed and soon","and soon written","soon written out","written out of","out of Irish","of Irish History","The diaries are","diaries are now","are now being","now being subjected","being subjected to","subjected to intense","to intense scrutiny","intense scrutiny as","scrutiny as possible","as possible forgeries","possible forgeries and","forgeries and the","and the man","the man 's","man 's role","'s role in","role in history","in history is","history is being","is being reevaluated"],"2grams":["Roger Casement","Casement was","was an","an Irish","Irish born","born diplomat","diplomat who","who worked","worked for","for the","the British","British government","He was","was knighted","knighted by","by the","the crown","crown for","for his","his services","services but","but was","was convicted","convicted for","for his","his role","role in","in the","the Easter","Easter Uprising","Uprising during","during World","World War","War I","When his","his \"","\" black","black diaries","diaries \"","\" were","were made","made public","public revealing","revealing his","his homosexuality","homosexuality all","all public","public support","support faded","faded and","and he","he was","was executed","executed and","and soon","soon written","written out","out of","of Irish","Irish History","The diaries","diaries are","are now","now being","being subjected","subjected to","to intense","intense scrutiny","scrutiny as","as possible","possible forgeries","forgeries and","and the","the man","man 's","'s role","role in","in history","history is","is being","being reevaluated"]}

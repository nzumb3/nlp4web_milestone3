{"title":"AirTime","plot":"A chapter in the life of two friends in Tel Aviv. This peeking into their homes begins when Shir, Noy's younger sister, comes to visit him from the Kibbutz, when he'd rather throw her onto Mike - the perfect host. At his apartment, she is introduced to his anonymous blog on the Internet - an ongoing story in the first person, about a special air-hostess who lives in the shadows of the city, a bit like the author who invented her. Shir suggests giving her face to the storyteller, thus forcing Mike out of his self-afflicted anonymity.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","chapter","in","the","life","of","two","friend","in","Tel","Aviv",".","This","peek","into","their","home","begin","when","Shir",",","Noy","'s","younger","sister",",","come","to","visit","him","from","the","Kibbutz",",","when","he","'d","rather","throw","her","onto","Mike","-","the","perfect","host",".","At","his","apart",",","she","is","introduc","to","his","anonym","blog","on","the","Internet","-","an","ongo","stori","in","the","first","person",",","about","a","special","air-hostess","who","live","in","the","shadow","of","the","citi",",","a","bit","like","the","author","who","invent","her",".","Shir","suggest","give","her","face","to","the","storytel",",","thus","forc","Mike","out","of","his","self-afflict","anonym","."],"lemmas":["a","chapter","in","the","life","of","two","friend","in","Tel","Aviv",".","this","peek","into","they","home","begin","when","Shir",",","Noy","'s","younger","sister",",","come","to","visit","he","from","the","Kibbutz",",","when","he","would","rather","throw","she","onto","Mike","-","the","perfect","host",".","at","he","apartment",",","she","be","introduce","to","he","anonymous","blog","on","the","internet","-","a","ongoing","story","in","the","first","person",",","about","a","special","air-hostess","who","live","in","the","shadow","of","the","city",",","a","bit","like","the","author","who","invent","she",".","Shir","suggest","give","she","face","to","the","storyteller",",","thus","force","Mike","out","of","he","self-afflicted","anonymity","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A chapter in","chapter in the","in the life","the life of","life of two","of two friends","two friends in","friends in Tel","in Tel Aviv","This peeking into","peeking into their","into their homes","their homes begins","homes begins when","begins when Shir","when Shir ,","Shir , Noy",", Noy 's","Noy 's younger","'s younger sister","younger sister ,","sister , comes",", comes to","comes to visit","to visit him","visit him from","him from the","from the Kibbutz","the Kibbutz ,","Kibbutz , when",", when he","when he 'd","he 'd rather","'d rather throw","rather throw her","throw her onto","her onto Mike","onto Mike -","Mike - the","- the perfect","the perfect host","At his apartment","his apartment ,","apartment , she",", she is","she is introduced","is introduced to","introduced to his","to his anonymous","his anonymous blog","anonymous blog on","blog on the","on the Internet","the Internet -","Internet - an","- an ongoing","an ongoing story","ongoing story in","story in the","in the first","the first person","first person ,","person , about",", about a","about a special","a special air-hostess","special air-hostess who","air-hostess who lives","who lives in","lives in the","in the shadows","the shadows of","shadows of the","of the city","the city ,","city , a",", a bit","a bit like","bit like the","like the author","the author who","author who invented","who invented her","Shir suggests giving","suggests giving her","giving her face","her face to","face to the","to the storyteller","the storyteller ,","storyteller , thus",", thus forcing","thus forcing Mike","forcing Mike out","Mike out of","out of his","of his self-afflicted","his self-afflicted anonymity"],"2grams":["A chapter","chapter in","in the","the life","life of","of two","two friends","friends in","in Tel","Tel Aviv","This peeking","peeking into","into their","their homes","homes begins","begins when","when Shir","Shir ,",", Noy","Noy 's","'s younger","younger sister","sister ,",", comes","comes to","to visit","visit him","him from","from the","the Kibbutz","Kibbutz ,",", when","when he","he 'd","'d rather","rather throw","throw her","her onto","onto Mike","Mike -","- the","the perfect","perfect host","At his","his apartment","apartment ,",", she","she is","is introduced","introduced to","to his","his anonymous","anonymous blog","blog on","on the","the Internet","Internet -","- an","an ongoing","ongoing story","story in","in the","the first","first person","person ,",", about","about a","a special","special air-hostess","air-hostess who","who lives","lives in","in the","the shadows","shadows of","of the","the city","city ,",", a","a bit","bit like","like the","the author","author who","who invented","invented her","Shir suggests","suggests giving","giving her","her face","face to","to the","the storyteller","storyteller ,",", thus","thus forcing","forcing Mike","Mike out","out of","of his","his self-afflicted","self-afflicted anonymity"]}

{"title":"65_RedRoses","plot":"This personal and touching journey takes an unflinching look into the life of Eva Markvoort as she battles a fatal genetic disease called Cystic Fibrosis (CF). At 23, Eva needs a double lung transplant to live. Unable to be around other CF patients, Eva turns to the internet where she forms a strong friendship with two American girls named Meg and Kina. The girls also have CF and are in different stages of transplant. Now at a critical turning point in their lives, the film travels the distance the friends cannot go themselves, capturing the compelling and often heartbreaking realities they face just trying to take each breath.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","person","and","touch","journey","take","an","unflinch","look","into","the","life","of","Eva","Markvoort","as","she","battl","a","fatal","genet","diseas","call","Cystic","Fibrosi","(","CF",")",".","At","23",",","Eva","need","a","doubl","lung","transplant","to","live",".","Unabl","to","be","around","other","CF","patient",",","Eva","turn","to","the","internet","where","she","form","a","strong","friendship","with","two","American","girl","name","Meg","and","Kina",".","The","girl","also","have","CF","and","are","in","differ","stage","of","transplant",".","Now","at","a","critic","turn","point","in","their","live",",","the","film","travel","the","distanc","the","friend","can","not","go","themselv",",","captur","the","compel","and","often","heartbreak","realiti","they","face","just","tri","to","take","each","breath","."],"lemmas":["this","personal","and","touching","journey","take","a","unflinching","look","into","the","life","of","Eva","Markvoort","as","she","battle","a","fatal","genetic","disease","call","cystic","fibrosis","-lrb-","cf","-rrb-",".","at","23",",","Eva","need","a","double","lung","transplant","to","live",".","unable","to","be","around","other","cf","patient",",","Eva","turn","to","the","internet","where","she","form","a","strong","friendship","with","two","american","girl","name","Meg","and","Kina",".","the","girl","also","have","cf","and","be","in","different","stage","of","transplant",".","now","at","a","critical","turning","point","in","they","life",",","the","film","travel","the","distance","the","friend","can","not","go","themselves",",","capture","the","compelling","and","often","heartbreaking","reality","they","face","just","try","to","take","each","breath","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["This

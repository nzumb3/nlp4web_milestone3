{"title":"Shark Loves the Amazon","plot":"The daily struggles and hopes of the more than twenty million Brazilians who live in the Amazon, mostly in cities, are rarely present in analyses and images that inform perceptions of the region outside Brazil. The Amazon is generally portrayed as a land of mystery populated by indigenous people surrounded by exotic fauna and flora in a environment threatened by encroaching mining, farming and other economic activities. Mark London offers a different, decidedly less romantic and more realistic perspective in \"Shark Loves the Amazon\"- a documentary he produced after three decade of extensive travels and two books he wrote about the region with journalist Brian Kelly. The film depicts the hard realities of a region attempting to find the path to a sustainable model of development that promotes economic activity while preserving Earth's last great forest and its unparalleled concentration of biodiversity.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","daili","struggl","and","hope","of","the","more","than","twenti","million","Brazilian","who","live","in","the","Amazon",",","most","in","citi",",","are","rare","present","in","analys","and","imag","that","inform","percept","of","the","region","outsid","Brazil",".","The","Amazon","is","general","portray","as","a","land","of","mysteri","popul","by","indigen","peopl","surround","by","exot","fauna","and","flora","in","a","environ","threaten","by","encroach","mine",",","farm","and","other","econom","activ",".","Mark","London","offer","a","differ",",","decid","less","romant","and","more","realist","perspect","in","\"","Shark","Love","the","Amazon","\"","-","a","documentari","he","produc","after","three","decad","of","extens","travel","and","two","book","he","wrote","about","the","region","with","journalist","Brian","Kelli",".","The","film","depict","the","hard","realiti","of","a","region","attempt","to","find","the","path","to","a","sustain","model","of","develop","that","promot","econom","activ","while","preserv","Earth","'s","last","great","forest","and","it","unparallel","concentr","of","biodivers","."],"lemmas":["the","daily","struggle","and","hope","of","the","more","than","twenty","million","brazilian","who","live","in","the","Amazon",",","mostly","in","city",",","be","rarely","present","in","analysis","and","image","that","inform","perception","of","the","region","outside","Brazil",".","the","Amazon","be","generally","portray","as","a","land","of","mystery","populate","by","indigenous","people","surround","by","exotic","fauna","and","flora","in","a","environment","threaten","by","encroach","mining",",","farming","and","other","economic","activity",".","Mark","London","offer","a","different",",","decidedly","less","romantic","and","more","realistic","perspective","in","``","shark","love","the","Amazon","''","-","a","documentary","he","produce","after","three","decade","of","extensive","travels","and","two","book","he","write","about","the","region","with","journalist","Brian","Kelly",".","the","film","depict","the","hard","reality","of","a","region","attempt","to","find","the","path","to","a","sustainable","model","of","development","that","promote","economic","activity","while","preserve","Earth","'s","last","great","forest","and","its","unparalleled","concentration","of","biodiversity","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["The daily struggles","daily struggles and","struggles and hopes","and hopes of","hopes of the","of the more","the more than","more than twenty","than twenty million","twenty million Brazilians","million Brazilians who","Brazilians who live","who live in","live in the","in the Amazon","the Amazon ,","Amazon , mostly",", mostly in","mostly in cities","in cities ,","cities , are",", are rarely","are rarely present","rarely present in","present in analyses","in analyses and","analyses and images","and images that","images that inform","that inform perceptions","inform perceptions of","perceptions of the","of the region","the region outside","region outside Brazil","The Amazon is","Amazon is generally","is generally portrayed","generally portrayed as","portrayed as a","as a land","a land of","land of mystery","of mystery populated","mystery populated by","populated by indigenous","by indigenous people","indigenous people surrounded","people surrounded by","surrounded by exotic","by exotic fauna","exotic fauna and","fauna and flora","and flora in","flora in a","in a environment","a environment threatened","environment threatened by","threatened by encroaching","by encroaching mining","encroaching mining ,","mining , farming",", farming and","farming and other","and other economic","other economic activities","Mark London offers","London offers a","offers a different","a different ,","different , decidedly",", decidedly less","decidedly less romantic","less romantic and","romantic and more","and more realistic","more realistic perspective","realistic perspective in","perspective in \"","in \" Shark","\" Shark Loves","Shark Loves the","Loves the Amazon","the Amazon \"","Amazon \" -","\" -

{"title":"The Answer Man","plot":"Everyone wants to meet Arlen Faber, the world famous author of the best-selling spiritual book \"Me and God,\" but crotchety, disgruntled Arlen simply wants to be left alone - and so far he's been successful in keeping his identity a secret. But all that changes when troubled bookstore owner Kris Lucas discovers his home address and barters books for Arlen's words of wisdom, and a back injury leads the reclusive writer to begin dating chiropractor and overprotective single mother Elizabeth. As Arlen's relationships with his newfound friends begin to grow, he must come to terms with his past and the realization that he doesn't hold all the answers.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Everyon","want","to","meet","Arlen","Faber",",","the","world","famous","author","of","the","best-sel","spiritu","book","\"","Me","and","God",",","\"","but","crotcheti",",","disgruntl","Arlen","simpli","want","to","be","left","alon","-","and","so","far","he","'s","been","success","in","keep","his","ident","a","secret",".","But","all","that","chang","when","troubl","bookstor","owner","Kris","Luca","discov","his","home","address","and","barter","book","for","Arlen","'s","word","of","wisdom",",","and","a","back","injuri","lead","the","reclus","writer","to","begin","date","chiropractor","and","overprotect","singl","mother","Elizabeth",".","As","Arlen","'s","relationship","with","his","newfound","friend","begin","to","grow",",","he","must","come","to","term","with","his","past","and","the","realiz","that","he","doe","n't","hold","all","the","answer","."],"lemmas":["everyone","want","to","meet","Arlen","Faber",",","the","world","famous","author","of","the","best-selling","spiritual","book","``","I","and","God",",","''","but","crotchety",",","disgruntled","Arlen","simply","want","to","be","leave","alone","-","and","so","far","he","be","be","successful","in","keep","he","identity","a","secret",".","but","all","that","change","when","troubled","bookstore","owner","Kris","Lucas","discover","he","home","address","and","barter","book","for","Arlen","'s","word","of","wisdom",",","and","a","back","injury","lead","the","reclusive","writer","to","begin","date","chiropractor","and","overprotective","single","mother","Elizabeth",".","as","Arlen","'s","relationship","with","he","newfound","friend","begin","to","grow",",","he","must","come","to","term","with","he","past","and","the","realization","that","he","do","not","hold","all","the","answer","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Everyone wants to","wants to meet","to meet Arlen","meet Arlen Faber","Arlen Faber ,","Faber , the",", the world","the world famous","world famous author","famous author of","author of the","of the best-selling","the best-selling spiritual","best-selling spiritual book","spiritual book \"","book \" Me","\" Me and","Me and God","and God ,","God , \"",", \" but","\" but crotchety","but crotchety ,","crotchety , disgruntled",", disgruntled Arlen","disgruntled Arlen simply","Arlen simply wants","simply wants to","wants to be","to be left","be left alone","left alone -","alone -

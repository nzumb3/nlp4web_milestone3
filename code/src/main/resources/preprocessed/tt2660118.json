Despite pleas from her friends, she begins to hatch a plan, but a fateful run in at her local lanes makes her wonder what she really wants - the 7... or the 10?","genres":["Comedy"," Sport"," Romance"],"stems":["SPLIT","is","a","peek","into","the","life","of","Cassi",",","an","over-achiev","with","a","thing","for","bowler","whose","life","take","an","unexpect","turn","when","she","read","a","strang","omin","statist","in","the","local","newspap","as","her","30th","birthday","loom",".","Chronic","absent","and","infam","eccentr",",","her","recent","deceas",",","profession","bowler","father","has","left","her","with","not","onli","a","freeload","mother","on","her","couch",",","but","an","undi","notion","in","her","head","that","in","order","to","live","up","to","her","own","\"","abov","averag","\"","standard",",","she","has","just","under","a","month","to","meet","and","marri","the","man","of","her","dream",".","Despit","plea","from","her","friend",",","she","begin","to","hatch","a","plan",",","but","a","fate","run","in","at","her","local","lane","make","her","wonder","what","she","realli","want","-","the","7","...","or","the","10","?"],"lemmas":["split","be","a","peek","into","the","life","of","Cassie",",","a","over-achiever","with","a","thing","for","bowler","whose","life","take","a","unexpected","turn","when","she","read","a","strangely","ominous","statistic","in","the","local","newspaper","as","she","30th","birthday","loom",".","chronically","absent","and","infamously","eccentric",",","she","recently","decease",",","professional","bowler","father","have","leave","she","with","not","only","a","freeloading","mother","on","she","couch",",","but","a","undying","notion","in","she","head","that","in","order","to","live","up","to","she","own","``","above","average","''","standard",",","she","have","just","under","a","month","to","meet","and","marry","the","man","of","she","dream",".","despite","plea","from","she","friend",",","she","begin","to","hatch","a","plan",",","but","a","fateful","run","in","at","she","local","lane","make","she","wonder","what","she","really","want","-","the","7","...","or","the","10","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["SPLIT is a","is a peek","a peek into","peek into the","into the life","the life of","life of Cassie","of Cassie ,","Cassie , an",", an over-achiever","an over-achiever with","over-achiever with a","with a thing","a thing for","thing for bowlers","for bowlers whose","bowlers whose life","whose life takes","life takes an","takes an unexpected","an unexpected turn","unexpected turn when","turn when she","when she reads","she reads a","reads a strangely","a strangely ominous","strangely ominous statistic","ominous statistic in","statistic in the","in the local","the local newspaper","local newspaper as","newspaper as her","as her 30th","her 30th birthday","30th birthday looms","Chronically absent and","absent and infamously","and infamously eccentric","infamously eccentric ,","eccentric , her",", her recently","her recently deceased","recently deceased ,","deceased , professional",", professional bowler","professional bowler father","bowler father has","father has left","has left her","left her with","her with not","with not only","not only a","only a freeloading","a freeloading mother","freeloading mother on","mother on her","on her couch","her couch ,","couch , but",", but an","but an undying","an undying notion","undying notion in","notion in her","in her head","her head that","head that in","that in order","in order to","order to live","to live up","live up to","up to her","to her own","her own \"","own \" above","\" above average","above average \"","average \" standards","\" standards ,","standards , she",", she has","she has just","has just under","just under a","under a month","a month to","month to meet","to meet and","meet and marry","and marry the","marry the man","the man of","man of her","of her dreams","Despite pleas from","pleas from her","from her friends","her friends ,","friends , she",", she begins","she begins to","begins to hatch","to hatch a","hatch a plan","a plan ,","plan , but",", but a","but a fateful","a fateful run","fateful run in","run in at","in at her","at her local","her local lanes","local lanes makes","lanes makes her","makes her wonder","her wonder what","wonder what she","what she really","she really wants","really wants -","wants -

{"title":"After the Byzantine Empire","plot":"Is there a future of the Orthodox idea in the contemporary world? Can Russia, the spiritual heir of the Byzantine Empire repeat its fate? The filmmakers are seeking for the answers of these questions. They apply the metaphoric language of images and the unique documentary materials. The film was shot in Turkey and Syria, former parts of the Byzantine Empire, in Moscow, St. Petersburg and Leningrad region. There're no a traditional host or an explanatory text in the film in order the viewers could become the onlookers to form their own opinion.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["Is","there","a","futur","of","the","Orthodox","idea","in","the","contemporari","world","?","Can","Russia",",","the","spiritu","heir","of","the","Byzantin","Empire","repeat","it","fate","?","The","filmmak","are","seek","for","the","answer","of","these","question",".","They","appli","the","metaphor","languag","of","imag","and","the","uniqu","documentari","materi",".","The","film","was","shot","in","Turkey","and","Syria",",","former","part","of","the","Byzantin","Empire",",","in","Moscow",",","St.","Petersburg","and","Leningrad","region",".","There","re","no","a","tradit","host","or","an","explanatori","text","in","the","film","in","order","the","viewer","could","becom","the","onlook","to","form","their","own","opinion","."],"lemmas":["be","there","a","future","of","the","Orthodox","idea","in","the","contemporary","world","?","can","Russia",",","the","spiritual","heir","of","the","byzantine","Empire","repeat","its","fate","?","the","filmmaker","be","seek","for","the","answer","of","these","question",".","they","apply","the","metaphoric","language","of","image","and","the","unique","documentary","material",".","the","film","be","shoot","in","Turkey","and","Syria",",","former","part","of","the","byzantine","Empire",",","in","Moscow",",","St.","Petersburg","and","Leningrad","region",".","there","be","no","a","traditional","host","or","a","explanatory","text","in","the","film","in","order","the","viewer","could","become","the","onlooker","to","form","they","own","opinion","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Is there a","there a future","a future of","future of the","of the Orthodox","the Orthodox idea","Orthodox idea in","idea in the","in the contemporary","the contemporary world","Can Russia ,","Russia , the",", the spiritual","the spiritual heir","spiritual heir of","heir of the","of the Byzantine","the Byzantine Empire","Byzantine Empire repeat","Empire repeat its","repeat its fate","The filmmakers are","filmmakers are seeking","are seeking for","seeking for the","for the answers","the answers of","answers of these","of these questions","They apply the","apply the metaphoric","the metaphoric language","metaphoric language of","language of images","of images and","images and the","and the unique","the unique documentary","unique documentary materials","The film was","film was shot","was shot in","shot in Turkey","in Turkey and","Turkey and Syria","and Syria ,","Syria , former",", former parts","former parts of","parts of the","of the Byzantine","the Byzantine Empire","Byzantine Empire ,","Empire , in",", in Moscow","in Moscow ,","Moscow , St.",", St. Petersburg","St. Petersburg and","Petersburg and Leningrad","and Leningrad region","There 're no","'re no a","no a traditional","a traditional host","traditional host or","host or an","or an explanatory","an explanatory text","explanatory text in","text in the","in the film","the film in","film in order","in order the","order the viewers","the viewers could","viewers could become","could become the","become the onlookers","the onlookers to","onlookers to form","to form their","form their own","their own opinion"],"2grams":["Is there","there a","a future","future of","of the","the Orthodox","Orthodox idea","idea in","in the","the contemporary","contemporary world","Can Russia","Russia ,",", the","the spiritual","spiritual heir","heir of","of the","the Byzantine","Byzantine Empire","Empire repeat","repeat its","its fate","The filmmakers","filmmakers are","are seeking","seeking for","for the","the answers","answers of","of these","these questions","They apply","apply the","the metaphoric","metaphoric language","language of","of images","images and","and the","the unique","unique documentary","documentary materials","The film","film was","was shot","shot in","in Turkey","Turkey and","and Syria","Syria ,",", former","former parts","parts of","of the","the Byzantine","Byzantine Empire","Empire ,",", in","in Moscow","Moscow ,",", St.","St. Petersburg","Petersburg and","and Leningrad","Leningrad region","There 're","'re no","no a","a traditional","traditional host","host or","or an","an explanatory","explanatory text","text in","in the","the film","film in","in order","order the","the viewers","viewers could","could become","become the","the onlookers","onlookers to","to form","form their","their own","own opinion"]}

{"title":"The Stray","plot":"Summer school, what a bummer! That is what Mason, Aidan, Maddie, Melinda and Luke are thinking on the first day of school. Bored, the five of them are daydreaming about what they might be doing if they weren't in school. But when a cute little stray pup they name Chewy wanders into their school, the days are anything but boring. The four of them must unite to help keep Chewy out sight of the principal, Ms. Thistle. What ensues is an elaborate game of hide- and-seek as they not only try to keep Chewy from being discovered, but also clean up the messes he leaves behind. The kids come up with one creative hiding place after another, even enlisting the help of school staff members to keep Chewy's presence under wraps. This game of hide-and-seek can't last forever, or can it? Or will Ms. Thistle catch on to their little secret, and capture them red handed in possession of The Stray?","genres":["Family"],"stems":["Summer","school",",","what","a","bummer","!","That","is","what","Mason",",","Aidan",",","Maddi",",","Melinda","and","Luke","are","think","on","the","first","day","of","school",".","Bore",",","the","five","of","them","are","daydream","about","what","they","might","be","do","if","they","were","n't","in","school",".","But","when","a","cute","littl","stray","pup","they","name","Chewi","wander","into","their","school",",","the","day","are","anyth","but","bore",".","The","four","of","them","must","unit","to","help","keep","Chewi","out","sight","of","the","princip",",","Ms.","Thistl",".","What","ensu","is","an","elabor","game","of","hide","-","and-seek","as","they","not","onli","tri","to","keep","Chewi","from","be","discov",",","but","also","clean","up","the","mess","he","leav","behind",".","The","kid","come","up","with","one","creativ","hide","place","after","anoth",",","even","enlist","the","help","of","school","staff","member","to","keep","Chewi","'s","presenc","under","wrap",".","This","game","of","hide-and-seek","ca","n't","last","forev",",","or","can","it","?","Or","will","Ms.","Thistl","catch","on","to","their","littl","secret",",","and","captur","them","red","hand","in","possess","of","The","Stray","?"],"lemmas":["summer","school",",","what","a","bummer","!","that","be","what","Mason",",","Aidan",",","Maddie",",","Melinda","and","Luke","be","think","on","the","first","day","of","school",".","bored",",","the","five","of","they","be","daydream","about","what","they","might","be","do","if","they","be","not","in","school",".","but","when","a","cute","little","stray","pup","they","name","chewy","wander","into","they","school",",","the","day","be","anything","but","boring",".","the","four","of","they","must","unite","to","help","keep","Chewy","out","sight","of","the","principal",",","Ms.","Thistle",".","what","ensue","be","a","elaborate","game","of","hide","-","and-seek","as","they","not","only","try","to","keep","Chewy","from","be","discover",",","but","also","clean","up","the","mess","he","leave","behind",".","the","kid","come","up","with","one","creative","hiding","place","after","another",",","even","enlist","the","help","of","school","staff","member","to","keep","Chewy","'s","presence","under","wrap",".","this","game","of","hide-and-seek","can","not","last","forever",",","or","can","it","?","or","will","Ms.","Thistle","catch","on","to","they","little","secret",",","and","capture","they","red","handed","in","possession","of","the","Stray","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Summer school ,","school , what",", what a","what a bummer","That is what","is what Mason","what Mason ,","Mason , Aidan",", Aidan ,","Aidan , Maddie",", Maddie ,","Maddie , Melinda",", Melinda and","Melinda and Luke","and Luke are","Luke are thinking","are thinking on","thinking on the","on the first","the first day","first day of","day of school","Bored , the",", the five","the five of","five of them","of them are","them are daydreaming","are daydreaming about","daydreaming about what","about what they","what they might","they might be","might be doing","be doing if","doing if they","if they were","they were n't","were n't in","n't in school","But when a","when a cute","a cute little","cute little stray","little stray pup","stray pup they","pup they name","they name Chewy","name Chewy wanders","Chewy wanders into","wanders into their","into their school","their school ,","school , the",", the days","the days are","days are anything","are anything but","anything but boring","The four of","four of them","of them must","them must unite","must unite to","unite to help","to help keep","help keep Chewy","keep Chewy out","Chewy out sight","out sight of","sight of the","of the principal","the principal ,","principal , Ms.",", Ms. Thistle","What ensues is","ensues is an","is an elaborate","an elaborate game","elaborate game of","game of hide","of hide -","hide -

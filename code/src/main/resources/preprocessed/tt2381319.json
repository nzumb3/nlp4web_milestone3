{"title":"Afternoon of a Faun: Tanaquil Le Clercq","plot":"Of all the great ballerinas, Tanaquil Le Clercq may have been the most transcendent. With a body unlike any before hers, she mesmerized viewers and choreographers alike - her elongated, race-horse physique became the new prototype for the great George Balanchine. Her unique style, humor and authenticity redefined ballet for all dancers who followed. Amazingly, she was the muse to not one great artist but two; both George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins loved her as a dancer and a woman. Balanchine married her and Robbins created his famous version of Afternoon of a Faun for Tanny. Tanaquil Le Clercq was the foremost dancer of her day until it suddenly all stopped. On a tour of Europe, she was struck down by polio and paralyzed. She never danced again.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Of","all","the","great","ballerina",",","Tanaquil","Le","Clercq","may","have","been","the","most","transcend",".","With","a","bodi","unlik","ani","befor","her",",","she","mesmer","viewer","and","choreograph","alik","-","her","elong",",","race-hors","physiqu","becam","the","new","prototyp","for","the","great","Georg","Balanchin",".","Her","uniqu","style",",","humor","and","authent","redefin","ballet","for","all","dancer","who","follow",".","Amaze",",","she","was","the","muse","to","not","one","great","artist","but","two",";","both","Georg","Balanchin","and","Jerom","Robbin","love","her","as","a","dancer","and","a","woman",".","Balanchin","marri","her","and","Robbin","creat","his","famous","version","of","Afternoon","of","a","Faun","for","Tanni",".","Tanaquil","Le","Clercq","was","the","foremost","dancer","of","her","day","until","it","sudden","all","stop",".","On","a","tour","of","Europ",",","she","was","struck","down","by","polio","and","paralyz",".","She","never","danc","again","."],"lemmas":["of","all","the","great","ballerina",",","Tanaquil","Le","Clercq","may","have","be","the","most","transcendent",".","with","a","body","unlike","any","before","hers",",","she","mesmerize","viewer","and","choreographer","alike","-","she","elongate",",","race-horse","physique","become","the","new","prototype","for","the","great","George","Balanchine",".","she","unique","style",",","humor","and","authenticity","redefine","ballet","for","all","dancer","who","follow",".","amazingly",",","she","be","the","muse","to","not","one","great","artist","but","two",";","both","George","Balanchine","and","Jerome","Robbins","love","she","as","a","dancer","and","a","woman",".","Balanchine","marry","she","and","Robbins","create","he","famous","version","of","afternoon","of","a","Faun","for","Tanny",".","Tanaquil","Le","Clercq","be","the","foremost","dancer","of","she","day","until","it","suddenly","all","stop",".","on","a","tour","of","Europe",",","she","be","strike","down","by","polio","and","paralyzed",".","she","never","dance","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Of all the","all the great","the great ballerinas","great ballerinas ,","ballerinas , Tanaquil",", Tanaquil Le","Tanaquil Le Clercq","Le Clercq may","Clercq may have","may have been","have been the","been the most","the most transcendent","With a body","a body unlike","body unlike any","unlike any before","any before hers","before hers ,","hers , she",", she mesmerized","she mesmerized viewers","mesmerized viewers and","viewers and choreographers","and choreographers alike","choreographers alike -","alike - her","- her elongated","her elongated ,","elongated , race-horse",", race-horse physique","race-horse physique became","physique became the","became the new","the new prototype","new prototype for","prototype for the","for the great","the great George","great George Balanchine","Her unique style","unique style ,","style , humor",", humor and","humor and authenticity","and authenticity redefined","authenticity redefined ballet","redefined ballet for","ballet for all","for all dancers","all dancers who","dancers who followed","Amazingly , she",", she was","she was the","was the muse","the muse to","muse to not","to not one","not one great","one great artist","great artist but","artist but two","but two ;","two ;

{"title":"Miracle on Everest","plot":"2006 was one of the most deadly Everest seasons on record. Record numbers of climbers took advantage of clear weather and attempted to reach the summit. Among their number was Lincoln Hall, an experienced climber who had failed to reach the peak 22 years earlier. This time, Hall made it to the top, but shortly afterwards began to behave irrationally, and collapsed. He was declared dead, his family was informed and the news hit the headlines. But later that night, something happened which scientists cannot explain. Hall was found alive, sitting cross legged on the mountainside. With never before seen footage, exclusive interviews and amazing reconstruction, Miracle on Everest is one of the great survival stories.","genres":["Adventure","

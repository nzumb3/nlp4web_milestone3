{"title":"Stories from Tahrir","plot":"In early 2011, I experienced the 18-day Egyptian revolution filtered through TV, Internet, and news reports. As an Egyptian American, and an experienced filmmaker, I felt a duty to help share the real stories of the people behind the revolution. So I created a documentary, which has been the official selection of half a dozen film festivals, and has won several awards. But the story isn't over. In November of 2011 I went back to Egypt, where I participated in the protests in Tahrir square, and interviewed people struggling to define a future Egypt, for a new documentary, 'Stories From Tahrir.' I spoke with activists, candidates, and the victims of decades of repression, who have never had a chance to share their stories until now.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," History"],"stems":["In","earli","2011",",","I","experienc","the","18-day","Egyptian","revolut","filter","through","TV",",","Internet",",","and","news","report",".","As","an","Egyptian","American",",","and","an","experienc","filmmak",",","I","felt","a","duti","to","help","share","the","real","stori","of","the","peopl","behind","the","revolut",".","So","I","creat","a","documentari",",","which","has","been","the","offici","select","of","half","a","dozen","film","festiv",",","and","has","won","sever","award",".","But","the","stori","is","n't","over",".","In","Novemb","of","2011","I","went","back","to","Egypt",",","where","I","particip","in","the","protest","in","Tahrir","squar",",","and","interview","peopl","struggl","to","defin","a","futur","Egypt",",","for","a","new","documentari",",","'","Stori","From","Tahrir",".","'","I","spoke","with","activist",",","candid",",","and","the","victim","of","decad","of","repress",",","who","have","never","had","a","chanc","to","share","their","stori","until","now","."],"lemmas":["in","early","2011",",","I","experience","the","18-day","Egyptian","revolution","filter","through","tv",",","Internet",",","and","news","report",".","as","a","Egyptian","American",",","and","a","experienced","filmmaker",",","I","feel","a","duty","to","help","share","the","real","story","of","the","people","behind","the","revolution",".","so","I","create","a","documentary",",","which","have","be","the","official","selection","of","half","a","dozen","film","festival",",","and","have","win","several","award",".","but","the","story","be","not","over",".","in","November","of","2011","I","go","back","to","Egypt",",","where","I","participate","in","the","protest","in","Tahrir","square",",","and","interview","people","struggle","to","define","a","future","Egypt",",","for","a","new","documentary",",","'","Stories","from","Tahrir",".","'","I","speak","with","activist",",","candidate",",","and","the","victim","of","decade","of","repression",",","who","have","never","have","a","chance","to","share","they","story","until","now","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In early 2011","early 2011 ,","2011 , I",", I experienced","I experienced the","experienced the 18-day","the 18-day Egyptian","18-day Egyptian revolution","Egyptian revolution filtered","revolution filtered through","filtered through TV","through TV ,","TV , Internet",", Internet ,","Internet , and",", and news","and news reports","As an Egyptian","an Egyptian American","Egyptian American ,","American , and",", and an","and an experienced","an experienced filmmaker","experienced filmmaker ,","filmmaker , I",", I felt","I felt a","felt a duty","a duty to","duty to help","to help share","help share the","share the real","the real stories","real stories of","stories of the","of the people","the people behind","people behind the","behind the revolution","So I created","I created a","created a documentary","a documentary ,","documentary , which",", which has","which has been","has been the","been the official","the official selection","official selection of","selection of half","of half a","half a dozen","a dozen film","dozen film festivals","film festivals ,","festivals , and",", and has","and has won","has won several","won several awards","But the story","the story is","story is n't","is n't over","In November of","November of 2011","of 2011 I","2011 I went","I went back","went back to","back to Egypt","to Egypt ,","Egypt , where",", where I","where I participated","I participated in","participated in the","in the protests","the protests in","protests in Tahrir","in Tahrir square","Tahrir square ,","square , and",", and interviewed","and interviewed people","interviewed people struggling","people struggling to","struggling to define","to define a","define a future","a future Egypt","future Egypt ,","Egypt , for",", for a","for a new","a new documentary","new documentary ,","documentary , '",", ' Stories","' Stories From","Stories From Tahrir","From Tahrir .","Tahrir .

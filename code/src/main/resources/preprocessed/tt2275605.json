{"title":"Contatto","plot":"Probably failing to convince, doctors told Felice Tagliaferri that he had lost his sight at the age of 13 without realizing it. After success as a Judoka he undertook a lucky career as sculptor. In 2000, his mentor Nicola Zamboni accepted him as an apprentice and after few years, Felice started exhibiting his work throughout Italy. In this film, Felice Tagliaferri illustrates his life as a sculptor and his more recent teaching activity to persons with disabilities. Contatto is a story of resilience and perseverance in its most simple and effective form.","genres":["Biography"," News"," Documentary"],"stems":["Probabl","fail","to","convinc",",","doctor","told","Felic","Tagliaferri","that","he","had","lost","his","sight","at","the","age","of","13","without","realiz","it",".","After","success","as","a","Judoka","he","undertook","a","lucki","career","as","sculptor",".","In","2000",",","his","mentor","Nicola","Zamboni","accept","him","as","an","apprentic","and","after","few","year",",","Felic","start","exhibit","his","work","throughout","Itali",".","In","this","film",",","Felic","Tagliaferri","illustr","his","life","as","a","sculptor","and","his","more","recent","teach","activ","to","person","with","disabl",".","Contatto","is","a","stori","of","resili","and","persever","in","it","most","simpl","and","effect","form","."],"lemmas":["probably","fail","to","convince",",","doctor","tell","Felice","Tagliaferri","that","he","have","lose","he","sight","at","the","age","of","13","without","realize","it",".","after","success","as","a","judoka","he","undertake","a","lucky","career","as","sculptor",".","in","2000",",","he","mentor","Nicola","Zamboni","accept","he","as","a","apprentice","and","after","few","year",",","Felice","start","exhibit","he","work","throughout","Italy",".","in","this","film",",","Felice","Tagliaferri","illustrate","he","life","as","a","sculptor","and","he","more","recent","teaching","activity","to","person","with","disability",".","Contatto","be","a","story","of","resilience","and","perseverance","in","its","most","simple","and","effective","form","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Probably failing to","failing to convince","to convince ,","convince , doctors",", doctors told","doctors told Felice","told Felice Tagliaferri","Felice Tagliaferri that","Tagliaferri that he","that he had","he had lost","had lost his","lost his sight","his sight at","sight at the","at the age","the age of","age of 13","of 13 without","13 without realizing","without realizing it","After success as","success as a","as a Judoka","a Judoka he","Judoka he undertook","he undertook a","undertook a lucky","a lucky career","lucky career as","career as sculptor","In 2000 ,","2000 , his",", his mentor","his mentor Nicola","mentor Nicola Zamboni","Nicola Zamboni accepted","Zamboni accepted him","accepted him as","him as an","as an apprentice","an apprentice and","apprentice and after","and after few","after few years","few years ,","years , Felice",", Felice started","Felice started exhibiting","started exhibiting his","exhibiting his work","his work throughout","work throughout Italy","In this film","this film ,","film , Felice",", Felice Tagliaferri","Felice Tagliaferri illustrates","Tagliaferri illustrates his","illustrates his life","his life as","life as a","as a sculptor","a sculptor and","sculptor and his","and his more","his more recent","more recent teaching","recent teaching activity","teaching activity to","activity to persons","to persons with","persons with disabilities","Contatto is a","is a story","a story of","story of resilience","of resilience and","resilience and perseverance","and perseverance in","perseverance in its","in its most","its most simple","most simple and","simple and effective","and effective form"],"2grams":["Probably failing","failing to","to convince","convince ,",", doctors","doctors told","told Felice","Felice Tagliaferri","Tagliaferri that","that he","he had","had lost","lost his","his sight","sight at","at the","the age","age of","of 13","13 without","without realizing","realizing it","After success","success as","as a","a Judoka","Judoka he","he undertook","undertook a","a lucky","lucky career","career as","as sculptor","In 2000","2000 ,",", his","his mentor","mentor Nicola","Nicola Zamboni","Zamboni accepted","accepted him","him as","as an","an apprentice","apprentice and","and after","after few","few years","years ,",", Felice","Felice started","started exhibiting","exhibiting his","his work","work throughout","throughout Italy","In this","this film","film ,",", Felice","Felice Tagliaferri","Tagliaferri illustrates","illustrates his","his life","life as","as a","a sculptor","sculptor and","and his","his more","more recent","recent teaching","teaching activity","activity to","to persons","persons with","with disabilities","Contatto is","is a","a story","story of","of resilience","resilience and","and perseverance","perseverance in","in its","its most","most simple","simple and","and effective","effective form"]}

{"title":"Cold Prey","plot":"Jannicke, Morten Tobias, Eirik, Mikal and Ingunn are on a snowboarding vacation in Jotunheimen. They are forced to take shelter in an abandoned hotel when Morten Tobias breaks his leg and their car is too far away for them to reach within nightfall. They quickly discover that the hotel was closed in the seventies due to the disappearance of the managers' son. Unknown to them, someone is still living in the hotel, and getting home, or even surviving the stay, isn't as easy as they believe.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Jannick",",","Morten","Tobia",",","Eirik",",","Mikal","and","Ingunn","are","on","a","snowboard","vacat","in","Jotunheimen",".","They","are","forc","to","take","shelter","in","an","abandon","hotel","when","Morten","Tobia","break","his","leg","and","their","car","is","too","far","away","for","them","to","reach","within","nightfal",".","They","quick","discov","that","the","hotel","was","close","in","the","seventi","due","to","the","disappear","of","the","manag","'","son",".","Unknown","to","them",",","someon","is","still","live","in","the","hotel",",","and","get","home",",","or","even","surviv","the","stay",",","is","n't","as","easi","as","they","believ","."],"lemmas":["Jannicke",",","Morten","Tobias",",","Eirik",",","Mikal","and","Ingunn","be","on","a","snowboard","vacation","in","Jotunheimen",".","they","be","force","to","take","shelter","in","a","abandoned","hotel","when","Morten","Tobias","break","he","leg","and","they","car","be","too","far","away","for","they","to","reach","within","nightfall",".","they","quickly","discover","that","the","hotel","be","close","in","the","seventy","due","to","the","disappearance","of","the","manager","'","son",".","unknown","to","they",",","someone","be","still","live","in","the","hotel",",","and","get","home",",","or","even","survive","the","stay",",","be","not","as","easy","as","they","believe","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jannicke , Morten",", Morten Tobias","Morten Tobias ,","Tobias , Eirik",", Eirik ,","Eirik , Mikal",", Mikal and","Mikal and Ingunn","and Ingunn are","Ingunn are on","are on a","on a snowboarding","a snowboarding vacation","snowboarding vacation in","vacation in Jotunheimen","They are forced","are forced to","forced to take","to take shelter","take shelter in","shelter in an","in an abandoned","an abandoned hotel","abandoned hotel when","hotel when Morten","when Morten Tobias","Morten Tobias breaks","Tobias breaks his","breaks his leg","his leg and","leg and their","and their car","their car is","car is too","is too far","too far away","far away for","away for them","for them to","them to reach","to reach within","reach within nightfall","They quickly discover","quickly discover that","discover that the","that the hotel","the hotel was","hotel was closed","was closed in","closed in the","in the seventies","the seventies due","seventies due to","due to the","to the disappearance","the disappearance of","disappearance of the","of the managers","the managers '","managers ' son","Unknown to them","to them ,","them , someone",", someone is","someone is still","is still living","still living in","living in the","in the hotel","the hotel ,","hotel , and",", and getting","and getting home","getting home ,","home , or",", or even","or even surviving","even surviving the","surviving the stay","the stay ,","stay , is",", is n't","is n't as","n't as easy","as easy as","easy as they","as they believe"],"2grams":["Jannicke ,",", Morten","Morten Tobias","Tobias ,",", Eirik","Eirik ,",", Mikal","Mikal and","and Ingunn","Ingunn are","are on","on a","a snowboarding","snowboarding vacation","vacation in","in Jotunheimen","They are","are forced","forced to","to take","take shelter","shelter in","in an","an abandoned","abandoned hotel","hotel when","when Morten","Morten Tobias","Tobias breaks","breaks his","his leg","leg and","and their","their car","car is","is too","too far","far away","away for","for them","them to","to reach","reach within","within nightfall","They quickly","quickly discover","discover that","that the","the hotel","hotel was","was closed","closed in","in the","the seventies","seventies due","due to","to the","the disappearance","disappearance of","of the","the managers","managers '","' son","Unknown to","to them","them ,",", someone","someone is","is still","still living","living in","in the","the hotel","hotel ,",", and","and getting","getting home","home ,",", or","or even","even surviving","surviving the","the stay","stay ,",", is","is n't","n't as","as easy","easy as","as they","they believe"]}

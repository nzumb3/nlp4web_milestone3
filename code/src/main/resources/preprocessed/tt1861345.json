{"title":"Hereves","plot":"Enclosed for decades by the ineffectiveness of governments and supranational organizations, the conflict that keeps 200,000 Western Saharan refugees in a corner of the Algerian desert has created generations of people who have never had the opportunity of treading the land that their parents used to work and that they still love and claim for themselves. \"Hereves\" is a discovery return trip to the Saharawi refugee camps narrated from the eyes of two girls who have two sceneries in common: the arid sand of the Tinduf desert and the Mediterranean mildness of Mallorca Island. With this trip, \"Hereves\" gathers up the testimony of different generations of women who live in and outside the camps and depicts a portrait of the present and the future that they will inherit in a country which has had no land for 33 years.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Enclose","for","decad","by","the","ineffect","of","govern","and","supran","organ",",","the","conflict","that","keep","200,000","Western","Saharan","refuge","in","a","corner","of","the","Algerian","desert","has","creat","generat","of","peopl","who","have","never","had","the","opportun","of","tread","the","land","that","their","parent","use","to","work","and","that","they","still","love","and","claim","for","themselv",".","\"","Herev","\"","is","a","discoveri","return","trip","to","the","Saharawi","refuge","camp","narrat","from","the","eye","of","two","girl","who","have","two","sceneri","in","common",":","the","arid","sand","of","the","Tinduf","desert","and","the","Mediterranean","mild","of","Mallorca","Island",".","With","this","trip",",","\"","Herev","\"","gather","up","the","testimoni","of","differ","generat","of","women","who","live","in","and","outsid","the","camp","and","depict","a","portrait","of","the","present","and","the","futur","that","they","will","inherit","in","a","countri","which","has","had","no","land","for","33","year","."],"lemmas":["enclose","for","decade","by","the","ineffectiveness","of","government","and","supranational","organization",",","the","conflict","that","keep","200,000","Western","Saharan","refugee","in","a","corner","of","the","Algerian","desert","have","create","generation","of","people","who","have","never","have","the","opportunity","of","tread","the","land","that","they","parent","use","to","work","and","that","they","still","love","and","claim","for","themselves",".","``","Hereves","''","be","a","discovery","return","trip","to","the","Saharawi","refugee","camp","narrate","from","the","eye","of","two","girl","who","have","two","scenery","in","common",":","the","arid","sand","of","the","Tinduf","desert","and","the","mediterranean","mildness","of","Mallorca","Island",".","with","this","trip",",","``","Hereves","''","gather","up","the","testimony","of","different","generation","of","woman","who","live","in","and","outside","the","camp","and","depict","a","portrait","of","the","present","and","the","future","that","they","will","inherit","in","a","country","which","have","have","no","land","for","33","year","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Enclosed

{"title":"The Boy Who Cried Warming","plot":"The feature length documentary \"The Boy Who Cried Warming\" approaches the subject of Climate Change from a more scientific point of view than previous films on the subject. The film evaluates on many of the common held misconceptions associated with Global Warming, offers a scientific overview of Carbon Dioxide on our planet, and takes an in depth look at various Carbon Trading legislation and its potential negative effects on the economies of the world. What makes our film truly unique is the fact that we offer new interplanetary data on the topic of climate change. Also unique to \"The Boy Who Cried Warming\" is that the story of the film runs parallel to the Aesop fable \"The Boy Who Cried Wolf.\" This is shown through the movie to portray that the shepherds of global warming most known are usually those who cry the loudest and make the boldest predictions. This film strikes the perfect informational and entertainment balance, and proves to be a truly pivotal message as science itself hangs imperil.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","featur","length","documentari","\"","The","Boy","Who","Cri","Warm","\"","approach","the","subject","of","Climat","Chang","from","a","more","scientif","point","of","view","than","previous","film","on","the","subject",".","The","film","evalu","on","mani","of","the","common","held","misconcept","associ","with","Global","Warm",",","offer","a","scientif","overview","of","Carbon","Dioxid","on","our","planet",",","and","take","an","in","depth","look","at","various","Carbon","Trade","legisl","and","it","potenti","negat","effect","on","the","economi","of","the","world",".","What","make","our","film","truli","uniqu","is","the","fact","that","we","offer","new","interplanetari","data","on","the","topic","of","climat","chang",".","Also","uniqu","to","\"","The","Boy","Who","Cri","Warm","\"","is","that","the","stori","of","the","film","run","parallel","to","the","Aesop","fabl","\"","The","Boy","Who","Cri","Wolf",".","\"","This","is","shown","through","the","movi","to","portray","that","the","shepherd","of","global","warm","most","known","are","usual","those","who","cri","the","loudest","and","make","the","boldest","predict",".","This","film","strike","the","perfect","inform","and","entertain","balanc",",","and","prove","to","be","a","truli","pivot","messag","as","scienc","itself","hang","imperil","."],"lemmas":["the","feature","length","documentary","``","the","boy","who","cry","warming","''","approach","the","subject","of","climate","Change","from","a","more","scientific","point","of","view","than","previous","film","on","the","subject",".","the","film","evaluate","on","many","of","the","common","held","misconception","associate","with","Global","Warming",",","offer","a","scientific","overview","of","Carbon","Dioxide","on","we","planet",",","and","take","a","in","depth","look","at","various","Carbon","Trading","legislation","and","its","potential","negative","effect","on","the","economy","of","the","world",".","what","make","we","film","truly","unique","be","the","fact","that","we","offer","new","interplanetary","datum","on","the","topic","of","climate","change",".","also","unique","to","``","the","boy","who","cry","warming","''","be","that","the","story","of","the","film","run","parallel","to","the","Aesop","fable","``","the","boy","who","cry","Wolf",".","''","this","be","show","through","the","movie","to","portray","that","the","shepherd","of","global","warming","most","know","be","usually","those","who","cry","the","loudest","and","make","the","boldest","prediction",".","this","film","strike","the","perfect","informational","and","entertainment","balance",",","and","prove","to","be","a","truly","pivotal","message","as","science","itself","hang","imperil","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

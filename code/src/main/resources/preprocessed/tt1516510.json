Katja has just broke up her relationship with Lars - her old love from the theater school yet and she's involved into an affair with the director of the play, she's acting in. Katja, born from a polish mother and a German father, is also in conflict with her religious parents, who's perception of the reality is different to her own. Finally Katja meets one French dreamer who shows her the other point of view for the life. The death of the Pope will give Katja a symbolic impulse.

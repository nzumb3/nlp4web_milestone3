{"title":"The Empire Project","plot":"A hidden synagogue in the mountains of Indonesia. A Dutch-style village in the Sri Lankan rainforest. A white separatist enclave in the South African desert. These are just a few of the communities brought to light in Empire, an immersive documentary project that examines the still-unfolding legacy of Dutch colonialism. Shot in ten countries over four years, Empire employs a broad range of storytelling techniques-including nonfiction filmmaking, multi- channel video projection, and experience design-to unearth the contemporary aftershocks of the world's first brush with global capitalism. By turns epic and intimate in its approach, Empire explores the ways in which the conditions of past continue to define our lives in the present.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","hidden","synagogu","in","the","mountain","of","Indonesia",".","A","Dutch-styl","villag","in","the","Sri","Lankan","rainforest",".","A","white","separatist","enclav","in","the","South","African","desert",".","These","are","just","a","few","of","the","communiti","brought","to","light","in","Empire",",","an","immers","documentari","project","that","examin","the","still-unfold","legaci","of","Dutch","coloni",".","Shot","in","ten","countri","over","four","year",",","Empire","employ","a","broad","rang","of","storytel","techniques-includ","nonfict","filmmak",",","multi","-","channel","video","project",",","and","experi","design-to","unearth","the","contemporari","aftershock","of","the","world","'s","first","brush","with","global","capit",".","By","turn","epic","and","intim","in","it","approach",",","Empire","explor","the","way","in","which","the","condit","of","past","continu","to","defin","our","live","in","the","present","."],"lemmas":["a","hidden","synagogue","in","the","mountain","of","Indonesia",".","a","dutch-style","village","in","the","Sri","Lankan","rainforest",".","a","white","separatist","enclave","in","the","south","african","desert",".","these","be","just","a","few","of","the","community","bring","to","light","in","Empire",",","a","immersive","documentary","project","that","examine","the","still-unfolding","legacy","of","dutch","colonialism",".","shot","in","ten","country","over","four","year",",","Empire","employ","a","broad","range","of","storytelling","techniques-including","nonfiction","filmmaking",",","multus","-","channel","video","projection",",","and","experience","design-to","unearth","the","contemporary","aftershock","of","the","world","'s","first","brush","with","global","capitalism",".","by","turn","epic","and","intimate","in","its","approach",",","Empire","explore","the","way","in","which","the","condition","of","past","continue","to","define","we","life","in","the","present","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["A hidden synagogue","hidden synagogue in","synagogue in the","in the mountains","the mountains of","mountains of Indonesia","A Dutch-style village","Dutch-style village in","village in the","in the Sri","the Sri Lankan","Sri Lankan rainforest","A white separatist","white separatist enclave","separatist enclave in","enclave in the","in the South","the South African","South African desert","These are just","are just a","just a few","a few of","few of the","of the communities","the communities brought","communities brought to","brought to light","to light in","light in Empire","in Empire ,","Empire , an",", an immersive","an immersive documentary","immersive documentary project","documentary project that","project that examines","that examines the","examines the still-unfolding","the still-unfolding legacy","still-unfolding legacy of","legacy of Dutch","of Dutch colonialism","Shot in ten","in ten countries","ten countries over","countries over four","over four years","four years ,","years , Empire",", Empire employs","Empire employs a","employs a broad","a broad range","broad range of","range of storytelling","of storytelling techniques-including","storytelling techniques-including nonfiction","techniques-including nonfiction filmmaking","nonfiction filmmaking ,","filmmaking , multi",", multi -","multi -

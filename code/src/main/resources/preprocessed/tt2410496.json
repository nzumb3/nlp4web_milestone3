{"title":"Si pr√®s si loin","plot":"Bolivia in the 50's : on the Island of the Sun, in the midst of Lake Titicaca, Alberto Perrin films the indigenous community recently emancipated through the agrarian reform and the 1952 revolution. 2010: Carmen Perrin, his daughter, returns to the inhabitants the films shot by her father. No nostalgia, because the ancestral rites and the spirit of liberty continues to enliven the community, despite the pressure of tourism. A memory is emerging, gestures are invented, ties are woven in the landscape sanctuary. Cinema re-edit the time.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Bolivia","in","the","50","'s",":","on","the","Island","of","the","Sun",",","in","the","midst","of","Lake","Titicaca",",","Alberto","Perrin","film","the","indigen","communiti","recent","emancip","through","the","agrarian","reform","and","the","1952","revolut",".","2010",":","Carmen","Perrin",",","his","daughter",",","return","to","the","inhabit","the","film","shot","by","her","father",".","No","nostalgia",",","becaus","the","ancestr","rite","and","the","spirit","of","liberti","continu","to","enliven","the","communiti",",","despit","the","pressur","of","tourism",".","A","memori","is","emerg",",","gestur","are","invent",",","tie","are","woven","in","the","landscap","sanctuari",".","Cinema","re-edit","the","time","."],"lemmas":["Bolivia","in","the","50","'s",":","on","the","Island","of","the","Sun",",","in","the","midst","of","Lake","Titicaca",",","Alberto","Perrin","film","the","indigenous","community","recently","emancipate","through","the","agrarian","reform","and","the","1952","revolution",".","2010",":","Carmen","Perrin",",","he","daughter",",","return","to","the","inhabitant","the","film","shoot","by","she","father",".","no","nostalgia",",","because","the","ancestral","rite","and","the","spirit","of","liberty","continue","to","enliven","the","community",",","despite","the","pressure","of","tourism",".","a","memory","be","emerge",",","gesture","be","invent",",","tie","be","weave","in","the","landscape","sanctuary",".","Cinema","re-edit","the","time","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bolivia in the","in the 50","the 50 's","50 's :","'s : on",": on the","on the Island","the Island of","Island of the","of the Sun","the Sun ,","Sun , in",", in the","in the midst","the midst of","midst of Lake","of Lake Titicaca","Lake Titicaca ,","Titicaca , Alberto",", Alberto Perrin","Alberto Perrin films","Perrin films the","films the indigenous","the indigenous community","indigenous community recently","community recently emancipated","recently emancipated through","emancipated through the","through the agrarian","the agrarian reform","agrarian reform and","reform and the","and the 1952","the 1952 revolution","2010 : Carmen",": Carmen Perrin","Carmen Perrin ,","Perrin , his",", his daughter","his daughter ,","daughter , returns",", returns to","returns to the","to the inhabitants","the inhabitants the","inhabitants the films","the films shot","films shot by","shot by her","by her father","No nostalgia ,","nostalgia , because",", because the","because the ancestral","the ancestral rites","ancestral rites and","rites and the","and the spirit","the spirit of","spirit of liberty","of liberty continues","liberty continues to","continues to enliven","to enliven the","enliven the community","the community ,","community , despite",", despite the","despite the pressure","the pressure of","pressure of tourism","A memory is","memory is emerging","is emerging ,","emerging , gestures",", gestures are","gestures are invented","are invented ,","invented , ties",", ties are","ties are woven","are woven in","woven in the","in the landscape","the landscape sanctuary","Cinema re-edit the","re-edit the time"],"2grams":["Bolivia in","in the","the 50","50 's","'s :",": on","on the","the Island","Island of","of the","the Sun","Sun ,",", in","in the","the midst","midst of","of Lake","Lake Titicaca","Titicaca ,",", Alberto","Alberto Perrin","Perrin films","films the","the indigenous","indigenous community","community recently","recently emancipated","emancipated through","through the","the agrarian","agrarian reform","reform and","and the","the 1952","1952 revolution","2010 :",": Carmen","Carmen Perrin","Perrin ,",", his","his daughter","daughter ,",", returns","returns to","to the","the inhabitants","inhabitants the","the films","films shot","shot by","by her","her father","No nostalgia","nostalgia ,",", because","because the","the ancestral","ancestral rites","rites and","and the","the spirit","spirit of","of liberty","liberty continues","continues to","to enliven","enliven the","the community","community ,",", despite","despite the","the pressure","pressure of","of tourism","A memory","memory is","is emerging","emerging ,",", gestures","gestures are","are invented","invented ,",", ties","ties are","are woven","woven in","in the","the landscape","landscape sanctuary","Cinema re-edit","re-edit the","the time"]}

{"title":"Trinetra","plot":"Raja is an aspiring singer and gets a chance to sing in Dubai through Mr. Singhania. He informs his pregnant wife, Seema, and they look forward to a more prosperous life. Before that could happen, Raja finds out that Singhania is going to use him to carry drugs in his suitcase, he objects to this, and is brutally killed in the presence of his wife. His wife flees the assailants, and gives birth to a baby boy near the temple of Bhagwan Shri Shankar and names the boy Shiva. Unmarried and childless Maria Fernandes sees the child and an apparently dead Seema, and takes the child. But Seems is still alive, and is angered at being separated from her son. She swears to avenge Raja's death, and sets about to kill the assailants one by one. She manages to kill one of them, but before she could proceed on with her gruesome task, she is arrested by the police and sentenced to jail for several years. How will Seema avenge the death of Raja? Will she escape from prison, or wait till she is withered and old after the end of her sentence?","genres":["Action"],"stems":["Raja","is","an","aspir","singer","and","get","a","chanc","to","sing","in","Dubai","through","Mr.","Singhania",".","He","inform","his","pregnant","wife",",","Seema",",","and","they","look","forward","to","a","more","prosper","life",".","Befor","that","could","happen",",","Raja","find","out","that","Singhania","is","go","to","use","him","to","carri","drug","in","his","suitcas",",","he","object","to","this",",","and","is","brutal","kill","in","the","presenc","of","his","wife",".","His","wife","flee","the","assail",",","and","give","birth","to","a","babi","boy","near","the","templ","of","Bhagwan","Shri","Shankar","and","name","the","boy","Shiva",".","Unmarri","and","childless","Maria","Fernand","see","the","child","and","an","appar","dead","Seema",",","and","take","the","child",".","But","Seem","is","still","aliv",",","and","is","anger","at","be","separ","from","her","son",".","She","swear","to","aveng","Raja","'s","death",",","and","set","about","to","kill","the","assail","one","by","one",".","She","manag","to","kill","one","of","them",",","but","befor","she","could","proceed","on","with","her","gruesom","task",",","she","is","arrest","by","the","polic","and","sentenc","to","jail","for","sever","year",".","How","will","Seema","aveng","the","death","of","Raja","?","Will","she","escap","from","prison",",","or","wait","till","she","is","wither","and","old","after","the","end","of","her","sentenc","?"],"lemmas":["Raja","be","a","aspiring","singer","and","get","a","chance","to","sing","in","Dubai","through","Mr.","Singhania",".","he","inform","he","pregnant","wife",",","Seema",",","and","they","look","forward","to","a","more","prosperous","life",".","before","that","could","happen",",","Raja","find","out","that","Singhania","be","go","to","use","he","to","carry","drug","in","he","suitcase",",","he","object","to","this",",","and","be","brutally","kill","in","the","presence","of","he","wife",".","he","wife","flee","the","assailant",",","and","give","birth","to","a","baby","boy","near","the","temple","of","Bhagwan","Shri","Shankar","and","name","the","boy","shiva",".","unmarried","and","childless","Maria","Fernandes","see","the","child","and","a","apparently","dead","Seema",",","and","take","the","child",".","but","seem","be","still","alive",",","and","be","anger","at","be","separate","from","she","son",".","she","swear","to","avenge","Raja","'s","death",",","and","set","about","to","kill","the","assailant","one","by","one",".","she","manage","to","kill","one","of","they",",","but","before","she","could","proceed","on","with","she","gruesome","task",",","she","be","arrest","by","the","police","and","sentence","to","jail","for","several","year",".","how","will","Seema","avenge","the","death","of","Raja","?","will","she","escape","from","prison",",","or","wait","till","she","be","withered","and","old","after","the","end","of","she","sentence","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Raja

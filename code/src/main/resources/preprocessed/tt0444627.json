{"title":"I Am Guilty","plot":"Armin Steeb is adrift: just finished with school, living with his middle-class parents, clueless about finding work. He tries connecting with a girl, he engages in risky sex with strangers in public toilets, he goes to job interviews. He also sends an anonymous letter to a local Munich newspaper, claiming responsibility for a fatal road accident. He fitfully pursues notoriety as he goes through life nearly without affect. What will it take to get Armin to smile?","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["Armin","Steeb","is","adrift",":","just","finish","with","school",",","live","with","his","middle-class","parent",",","clueless","about","find","work",".","He","tri","connect","with","a","girl",",","he","engag","in","riski","sex","with","stranger","in","public","toilet",",","he","goe","to","job","interview",".","He","also","send","an","anonym","letter","to","a","local","Munich","newspap",",","claim","respons","for","a","fatal","road","accid",".","He","fit","pursu","notorieti","as","he","goe","through","life","near","without","affect",".","What","will","it","take","to","get","Armin","to","smile","?"],"lemmas":["Armin","Steeb","be","adrift",":","just","finish","with","school",",","live","with","he","middle-class","parent",",","clueless","about","find","work",".","he","try","connect","with","a","girl",",","he","engage","in","risky","sex","with","stranger","in","public","toilet",",","he","go","to","job","interview",".","he","also","send","a","anonymous","letter","to","a","local","Munich","newspaper",",","claim","responsibility","for","a","fatal","road","accident",".","he","fitfully","pursue","notoriety","as","he","go","through","life","nearly","without","affect",".","what","will","it","take","to","get","Armin","to","smile","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Armin Steeb is","Steeb is adrift","is adrift :","adrift : just",": just finished","just finished with","finished with school","with school ,","school , living",", living with","living with his","with his middle-class","his middle-class parents","middle-class parents ,","parents , clueless",", clueless about","clueless about finding","about finding work","He tries connecting","tries connecting with","connecting with a","with a girl","a girl ,","girl , he",", he engages","he engages in","engages in risky","in risky sex","risky sex with","sex with strangers","with strangers in","strangers in public","in public toilets","public toilets ,","toilets , he",", he goes","he goes to","goes to job","to job interviews","He also sends","also sends an","sends an anonymous","an anonymous letter","anonymous letter to","letter to a","to a local","a local Munich","local Munich newspaper","Munich newspaper ,","newspaper , claiming",", claiming responsibility","claiming responsibility for","responsibility for a","for a fatal","a fatal road","fatal road accident","He fitfully pursues","fitfully pursues notoriety","pursues notoriety as","notoriety as he","as he goes","he goes through","goes through life","through life nearly","life nearly without","nearly without affect","What will it","will it take","it take to","take to get","to get Armin","get Armin to","Armin to smile"],"2grams":["Armin Steeb","Steeb is","is adrift","adrift :",": just","just finished","finished with","with school","school ,",", living","living with","with his","his middle-class","middle-class parents","parents ,",", clueless","clueless about","about finding","finding work","He tries","tries connecting","connecting with","with a","a girl","girl ,",", he","he engages","engages in","in risky","risky sex","sex with","with strangers","strangers in","in public","public toilets","toilets ,",", he","he goes","goes to","to job","job interviews","He also","also sends","sends an","an anonymous","anonymous letter","letter to","to a","a local","local Munich","Munich newspaper","newspaper ,",", claiming","claiming responsibility","responsibility for","for a","a fatal","fatal road","road accident","He fitfully","fitfully pursues","pursues notoriety","notoriety as","as he","he goes","goes through","through life","life nearly","nearly without","without affect","What will","will it","it take","take to","to get","get Armin","Armin to","to smile"]}

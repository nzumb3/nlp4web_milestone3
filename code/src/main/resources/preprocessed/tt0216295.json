{"title":"The Junction","plot":"Using the backdrop of the banality and ordinariness of everyday life in a small provincial town, the film analyses the relationship between two women friends, who struggle to find their way in post-communist Poland. The small events of their lives represent universal feelings of being trapped and lost in a new world, in contrast to the successes of the dark side of democracy - drug dealing, crime and pornography. By its very nature, the film creates a picture of provincial Poland after democracy, but its charm is in the understated relationship between the two friends and the people around them and in the mosaic structure that builds up the film piece by piece.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Using","the","backdrop","of","the","banal","and","ordinari","of","everyday","life","in","a","small","provinci","town",",","the","film","analys","the","relationship","between","two","women","friend",",","who","struggl","to","find","their","way","in","post-communist","Poland",".","The","small","event","of","their","live","repres","univers","feel","of","be","trap","and","lost","in","a","new","world",",","in","contrast","to","the","success","of","the","dark","side","of","democraci","-","drug","deal",",","crime","and","pornographi",".","By","it","veri","natur",",","the","film","creat","a","pictur","of","provinci","Poland","after","democraci",",","but","it","charm","is","in","the","underst","relationship","between","the","two","friend","and","the","peopl","around","them","and","in","the","mosaic","structur","that","build","up","the","film","piec","by","piec","."],"lemmas":["use","the","backdrop","of","the","banality","and","ordinariness","of","everyday","life","in","a","small","provincial","town",",","the","film","analysis","the","relationship","between","two","woman","friend",",","who","struggle","to","find","they","way","in","post-communist","Poland",".","the","small","event","of","they","life","represent","universal","feeling","of","be","trap","and","lose","in","a","new","world",",","in","contrast","to","the","success","of","the","dark","side","of","democracy","-","drug","dealing",",","crime","and","pornography",".","by","its","very","nature",",","the","film","create","a","picture","of","provincial","Poland","after","democracy",",","but","its","charm","be","in","the","understate","relationship","between","the","two","friend","and","the","people","around","they","and","in","the","mosaic","structure","that","build","up","the","film","piece","by","piece","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Using the backdrop","the backdrop of","backdrop of the","of the banality","the banality and","banality and ordinariness","and ordinariness of","ordinariness of everyday","of everyday life","everyday life in","life in a","in a small","a small provincial","small provincial town","provincial town ,","town , the",", the film","the film analyses","film analyses the","analyses the relationship","the relationship between","relationship between two","between two women","two women friends","women friends ,","friends , who",", who struggle","who struggle to","struggle to find","to find their","find their way","their way in","way in post-communist","in post-communist Poland","The small events","small events of","events of their","of their lives","their lives represent","lives represent universal","represent universal feelings","universal feelings of","feelings of being","of being trapped","being trapped and","trapped and lost","and lost in","lost in a","in a new","a new world","new world ,","world , in",", in contrast","in contrast to","contrast to the","to the successes","the successes of","successes of the","of the dark","the dark side","dark side of","side of democracy","of democracy -","democracy -

{"title":"Faces Overlooked","plot":"'Faces Overlooked' exposes the epidemic of hunger affecting one of the most unlikely places in the country. Marin County, in the Bay Area, is the wealthiest community in California; however, over 28,000 residents live with food insecurity. The people who provide services to the affluent often fall short in meeting their own needs. This film sheds light on those who are painfully overlooked.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["'","Face","Overlook","'","expos","the","epidem","of","hunger","affect","one","of","the","most","unlik","place","in","the","countri",".","Marin","Counti",",","in","the","Bay","Area",",","is","the","wealthiest","communiti","in","California",";","howev",",","over","28,000","resid","live","with","food","insecur",".","The","peopl","who","provid","servic","to","the","affluent","often","fall","short","in","meet","their","own","need",".","This","film","shed","light","on","those","who","are","pain","overlook","."],"lemmas":["'","face","overlook","'","expose","the","epidemic","of","hunger","affect","one","of","the","most","unlikely","place","in","the","country",".","Marin","County",",","in","the","Bay","Area",",","be","the","wealthiest","community","in","California",";","however",",","over","28,000","resident","live","with","food","insecurity",".","the","people","who","provide","service","to","the","affluent","often","fall","short","in","meet","they","own","need",".","this","film","shed","light","on","those","who","be","painfully","overlook","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Faces Overlooked","Faces Overlooked '","Overlooked ' exposes","' exposes the","exposes the epidemic","the epidemic of","epidemic of hunger","of hunger affecting","hunger affecting one","affecting one of","one of the","of the most","the most unlikely","most unlikely places","unlikely places in","places in the","in the country","Marin County ,","County , in",", in the","in the Bay","the Bay Area","Bay Area ,","Area , is",", is the","is the wealthiest","the wealthiest community","wealthiest community in","community in California","in California ;","California ; however","; however ,","however , over",", over 28,000","over 28,000 residents","28,000 residents live","residents live with","live with food","with food insecurity","The people who","people who provide","who provide services","provide services to","services to the","to the affluent","the affluent often","affluent often fall","often fall short","fall short in","short in meeting","in meeting their","meeting their own","their own needs","This film sheds","film sheds light","sheds light on","light on those","on those who","those who are","who are painfully","are painfully overlooked"],"2grams":["' Faces","Faces Overlooked","Overlooked '","' exposes","exposes the","the epidemic","epidemic of","of hunger","hunger affecting","affecting one","one of","of the","the most","most unlikely","unlikely places","places in","in the","the country","Marin County","County ,",", in","in the","the Bay","Bay Area","Area ,",", is","is the","the wealthiest","wealthiest community","community in","in California","California ;","; however","however ,",", over","over 28,000","28,000 residents","residents live","live with","with food","food insecurity","The people","people who","who provide","provide services","services to","to the","the affluent","affluent often","often fall","fall short","short in","in meeting","meeting their","their own","own needs","This film","film sheds","sheds light","light on","on those","those who","who are","are painfully","painfully overlooked"]}

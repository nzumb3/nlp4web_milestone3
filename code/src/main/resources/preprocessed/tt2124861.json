{"title":"Mud and Guts: The Search for Water in La Gonave, Haiti","plot":"Filmed on the impoverished island of La Gonave, Haiti, MUD AND GUTS documents the efforts of a small team of men determined to provide fresh water to a desperately thirsty people. In La Gonave, only 25% of families have unpolluted water to drink. Disease is rampant. As many as one in five children will die before their 5th birthday. MUD AND GUTS offers a close-up look at the trials, tribulations, and triumphs these men encounter as they bring laughter, fresh water, and hope to the Haitians living in La Gonave.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Film","on","the","impoverish","island","of","La","Gonav",",","Haiti",",","MUD","AND","GUTS","document","the","effort","of","a","small","team","of","men","determin","to","provid","fresh","water","to","a","desper","thirsti","peopl",".","In","La","Gonav",",","onli","25","%","of","famili","have","unpollut","water","to","drink",".","Diseas","is","rampant",".","As","mani","as","one","in","five","children","will","die","befor","their","5th","birthday",".","MUD","AND","GUTS","offer","a","close-up","look","at","the","trial",",","tribul",",","and","triumph","these","men","encount","as","they","bring","laughter",",","fresh","water",",","and","hope","to","the","Haitian","live","in","La","Gonav","."],"lemmas":["film","on","the","impoverished","island","of","La","Gonave",",","Haiti",",","mud","and","guts","document","the","effort","of","a","small","team","of","man","determine","to","provide","fresh","water","to","a","desperately","thirsty","people",".","in","La","Gonave",",","only","25","%","of","family","have","unpolluted","water","to","drink",".","Disease","be","rampant",".","as","many","as","one","in","five","child","will","die","before","they","5th","birthday",".","mud","and","guts","offer","a","close-up","look","at","the","trial",",","tribulation",",","and","triumph","these","man","encounter","as","they","bring","laughter",",","fresh","water",",","and","hope","to","the","Haitians","live","in","La","Gonave","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Filmed on the","on the impoverished","the impoverished island","impoverished island of","island of La","of La Gonave","La Gonave ,","Gonave , Haiti",", Haiti ,","Haiti , MUD",", MUD AND","MUD AND GUTS","AND GUTS documents","GUTS documents the","documents the efforts","the efforts of","efforts of a","of a small","a small team","small team of","team of men","of men determined","men determined to","determined to provide","to provide fresh","provide fresh water","fresh water to","water to a","to a desperately","a desperately thirsty","desperately thirsty people","In La Gonave","La Gonave ,","Gonave , only",", only 25","only 25 %","25 % of","% of families","of families have","families have unpolluted","have unpolluted water","unpolluted water to","water to drink","Disease is rampant","As many as","many as one","as one in","one in five","in five children","five children will","children will die","will die before","die before their","before their 5th","their 5th birthday","MUD AND GUTS","AND GUTS offers","GUTS offers a","offers a close-up","a close-up look","close-up look at","look at the","at the trials","the trials ,","trials , tribulations",", tribulations ,","tribulations , and",", and triumphs","and triumphs these","triumphs these men","these men encounter","men encounter as","encounter as they","as they bring","they bring laughter","bring laughter ,","laughter , fresh",", fresh water","fresh water ,","water , and",", and hope","and hope to","hope to the","to the Haitians","the Haitians living","Haitians living in","living in La","in La Gonave"],"2grams":["Filmed on","on the","the impoverished","impoverished island","island of","of La","La Gonave","Gonave ,",", Haiti","Haiti ,",", MUD","MUD AND","AND GUTS","GUTS documents","documents the","the efforts","efforts of","of a","a small","small team","team of","of men","men determined","determined to","to provide","provide fresh","fresh water","water to","to a","a desperately","desperately thirsty","thirsty people","In La","La Gonave","Gonave ,",", only","only 25","25 %","% of","of families","families have","have unpolluted","unpolluted water","water to","to drink","Disease is","is rampant","As many","many as","as one","one in","in five","five children","children will","will die","die before","before their","their 5th","5th birthday","MUD AND","AND GUTS","GUTS offers","offers a","a close-up","close-up look","look at","at the","the trials","trials ,",", tribulations","tribulations ,",", and","and triumphs","triumphs these","these men","men encounter","encounter as","as they","they bring","bring laughter","laughter ,",", fresh","fresh water","water ,",", and","and hope","hope to","to the","the Haitians","Haitians living","living in","in La","La Gonave"]}

{"title":"The Fourth Dimension","plot":"Grolsch Film Works and VICE Films present 'The Fourth Dimension', a film that gives us a glimpse of enlightenment through the eyes of three one-of-a-kind characters. The three filmmakers - Fedorchenko, Korine and Kwiecinski - have created three unique stories that offer up their vision of this higher plane of existence, the Fourth Dimension. Each filmmaker takes his character on a journey that changes the way they see the world and themselves. And each filmmaker will offer a different perspective on what the Fourth Dimension is.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Comedy"],"stems":["Grolsch","Film","Work","and","VICE","Film","present","'","The","Fourth","Dimens","'",",","a","film","that","give","us","a","glimps","of","enlighten","through","the","eye","of","three","one-of-a-kind","charact",".","The","three","filmmak","-","Fedorchenko",",","Korin","and","Kwiecinski","-","have","creat","three","uniqu","stori","that","offer","up","their","vision","of","this","higher","plane","of","exist",",","the","Fourth","Dimens",".","Each","filmmak","take","his","charact","on","a","journey","that","chang","the","way","they","see","the","world","and","themselv",".","And","each","filmmak","will","offer","a","differ","perspect","on","what","the","Fourth","Dimens","is","."],"lemmas":["Grolsch","Film","Works","and","VICE","film","present","'","the","fourth","dimension","'",",","a","film","that","give","we","a","glimpse","of","enlightenment","through","the","eye","of","three","one-of-a-kind","character",".","the","three","filmmaker","-","Fedorchenko",",","Korine","and","Kwiecinski","-","have","create","three","unique","story","that","offer","up","they","vision","of","this","higher","plane","of","existence",",","the","fourth","dimension",".","each","filmmaker","take","he","character","on","a","journey","that","change","the","way","they","see","the","world","and","themselves",".","and","each","filmmaker","will","offer","a","different","perspective","on","what","the","fourth","dimension","be","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Grolsch Film Works","Film Works and","Works and VICE","and VICE Films","VICE Films present","Films present '","present ' The","' The Fourth","The Fourth Dimension","Fourth Dimension '","Dimension ' ,","' , a",", a film","a film that","film that gives","that gives us","gives us a","us a glimpse","a glimpse of","glimpse of enlightenment","of enlightenment through","enlightenment through the","through the eyes","the eyes of","eyes of three","of three one-of-a-kind","three one-of-a-kind characters","The three filmmakers","three filmmakers -","filmmakers - Fedorchenko","- Fedorchenko ,","Fedorchenko , Korine",", Korine and","Korine and Kwiecinski","and Kwiecinski -","Kwiecinski - have","- have created","have created three","created three unique","three unique stories","unique stories that","stories that offer","that offer up","offer up their","up their vision","their vision of","vision of this","of this higher","this higher plane","higher plane of","plane of existence","of existence ,","existence , the",", the Fourth","the Fourth Dimension","Each filmmaker takes","filmmaker takes his","takes his character","his character on","character on a","on a journey","a journey that","journey that changes","that changes the","changes the way","the way they","way they see","they see the","see the world","the world and","world and themselves","And each filmmaker","each filmmaker will","filmmaker will offer","will offer a","offer a different","a different perspective","different perspective on","perspective on what","on what the","what the Fourth","the Fourth Dimension","Fourth Dimension is"],"2grams":["Grolsch Film","Film Works","Works and","and VICE","VICE Films","Films present","present '","' The","The Fourth","Fourth Dimension","Dimension '","' ,",", a","a film","film that","that gives","gives us","us a","a glimpse","glimpse of","of enlightenment","enlightenment through","through the","the eyes","eyes of","of three","three one-of-a-kind","one-of-a-kind characters","The three","three filmmakers","filmmakers -","- Fedorchenko","Fedorchenko ,",", Korine","Korine and","and Kwiecinski","Kwiecinski -","- have","have created","created three","three unique","unique stories","stories that","that offer","offer up","up their","their vision","vision of","of this","this higher","higher plane","plane of","of existence","existence ,",", the","the Fourth","Fourth Dimension","Each filmmaker","filmmaker takes","takes his","his character","character on","on a","a journey","journey that","that changes","changes the","the way","way they","they see","see the","the world","world and","and themselves","And each","each filmmaker","filmmaker will","will offer","offer a","a different","different perspective","perspective on","on what","what the","the Fourth","Fourth Dimension","Dimension is"]}

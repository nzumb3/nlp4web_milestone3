{"title":"Raven's Cabin","plot":"Bound, gagged and blindfolded, several teens are grabbed in the middle of the night and taken to Redback, a youth behavior modification facility deep in the Australian bush. They're completely cut off from the rest of the world; isolated and tested in the unforgiving camp. Rumors travel through the camp that a few years earlier a girl reportedly hanged herself. But that's just a rumor. Only the dead girl and her murderer know the truth and the dead don't talk... unless they find someone who can hear them.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Bound",",","gag","and","blindfold",",","sever","teen","are","grab","in","the","middl","of","the","night","and","taken","to","Redback",",","a","youth","behavior","modif","facil","deep","in","the","Australian","bush",".","They","re","complet","cut","off","from","the","rest","of","the","world",";","isol","and","test","in","the","unforgiv","camp",".","Rumor","travel","through","the","camp","that","a","few","year","earlier","a","girl","report","hang","herself",".","But","that","'s","just","a","rumor",".","Onli","the","dead","girl","and","her","murder","know","the","truth","and","the","dead","do","n't","talk","...","unless","they","find","someon","who","can","hear","them","."],"lemmas":["bind",",","gag","and","blindfold",",","several","teens","be","grab","in","the","middle","of","the","night","and","take","to","Redback",",","a","youth","behavior","modification","facility","deep","in","the","australian","bush",".","they","be","completely","cut","off","from","the","rest","of","the","world",";","isolate","and","test","in","the","unforgiving","camp",".","rumor","travel","through","the","camp","that","a","few","year","earlier","a","girl","reportedly","hang","herself",".","but","that","be","just","a","rumor",".","only","the","dead","girl","and","she","murderer","know","the","truth","and","the","dead","do","not","talk","...","unless","they","find","someone","who","can","hear","they","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Bound , gagged",", gagged and","gagged and blindfolded","and blindfolded ,","blindfolded , several",", several teens","several teens are","teens are grabbed","are grabbed in","grabbed in the","in the middle","the middle of","middle of the","of the night","the night and","night and taken","and taken to","taken to Redback","to Redback ,","Redback , a",", a youth","a youth behavior","youth behavior modification","behavior modification facility","modification facility deep","facility deep in","deep in the","in the Australian","the Australian bush","They 're completely","'re completely cut","completely cut off","cut off from","off from the","from the rest","the rest of","rest of the","of the world","the world ;","world ; isolated","; isolated and","isolated and tested","and tested in","tested in the","in the unforgiving","the unforgiving camp","Rumors travel through","travel through the","through the camp","the camp that","camp that a","that a few","a few years","few years earlier","years earlier a","earlier a girl","a girl reportedly","girl reportedly hanged","reportedly hanged herself","But that 's","that 's just","'s just a","just a rumor","Only the dead","the dead girl","dead girl and","girl and her","and her murderer","her murderer know","murderer know the","know the truth","the truth and","truth and the","and the dead","the dead do","dead do n't","do n't talk","n't talk ...","talk ... unless","... unless they","unless they find","they find someone","find someone who","someone who can","who can hear","can hear them"],"2grams":["Bound ,",", gagged","gagged and","and blindfolded","blindfolded ,",", several","several teens","teens are","are grabbed","grabbed in","in the","the middle","middle of","of the","the night","night and","and taken","taken to","to Redback","Redback ,",", a","a youth","youth behavior","behavior modification","modification facility","facility deep","deep in","in the","the Australian","Australian bush","They 're","'re completely","completely cut","cut off","off from","from the","the rest","rest of","of the","the world","world ;","; isolated","isolated and","and tested","tested in","in the","the unforgiving","unforgiving camp","Rumors travel","travel through","through the","the camp","camp that","that a","a few","few years","years earlier","earlier a","a girl","girl reportedly","reportedly hanged","hanged herself","But that","that 's","'s just","just a","a rumor","Only the","the dead","dead girl","girl and","and her","her murderer","murderer know","know the","the truth","truth and","and the","the dead","dead do","do n't","n't talk","talk ...","... unless","unless they","they find","find someone","someone who","who can","can hear","hear them"]}

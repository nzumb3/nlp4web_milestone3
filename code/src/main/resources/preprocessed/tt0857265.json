{"title":"Sleuth","plot":"Two extremely clever British men are in a game of trickery and deceit. Andrew Wyke, an aging famous author who lives alone in a high-tech mansion, after his wife Maggie has left him for a younger man; and Milo Tindle, an aspiring actor, equipped with charm and wit, who demonstrates both qualities once again. When Wyke invites Tindle to his mansion, Tindle seeks to convince the former into letting his wife go by signing the divorce paper. However, Wyke seems far more interested in playing mind games with his wife's new lover, and lures him into a series of actions he thoroughly planned in seeking revenge on his unfaithful spouse.","genres":["Crime"," Mystery"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","extrem","clever","British","men","are","in","a","game","of","trickeri","and","deceit",".","Andrew","Wyke",",","an","age","famous","author","who","live","alon","in","a","high-tech","mansion",",","after","his","wife","Maggi","has","left","him","for","a","younger","man",";","and","Milo","Tindl",",","an","aspir","actor",",","equip","with","charm","and","wit",",","who","demonstr","both","qualiti","onc","again",".","When","Wyke","invit","Tindl","to","his","mansion",",","Tindl","seek","to","convinc","the","former","into","let","his","wife","go","by","sign","the","divorc","paper",".","Howev",",","Wyke","seem","far","more","interest","in","play","mind","game","with","his","wife","'s","new","lover",",","and","lure","him","into","a","seri","of","action","he","thorough","plan","in","seek","reveng","on","his","unfaith","spous","."],"lemmas":["two","extremely","clever","british","man","be","in","a","game","of","trickery","and","deceit",".","Andrew","Wyke",",","a","aging","famous","author","who","live","alone","in","a","high-tech","mansion",",","after","he","wife","Maggie","have","leave","he","for","a","younger","man",";","and","Milo","Tindle",",","a","aspiring","actor",",","equip","with","charm","and","wit",",","who","demonstrate","both","quality","once","again",".","when","Wyke","invite","Tindle","to","he","mansion",",","Tindle","seek","to","convince","the","former","into","let","he","wife","go","by","sign","the","divorce","paper",".","however",",","Wyke","seem","far","more","interested","in","play","mind","game","with","he","wife","'s","new","lover",",","and","lure","he","into","a","series","of","action","he","thoroughly","plan","in","seek","revenge","on","he","unfaithful","spouse","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two extremely clever","extremely clever British","clever British men","British men are","men are in","are in a","in a game","a game of","game of trickery","of trickery and","trickery and deceit","Andrew Wyke ,","Wyke , an",", an aging","an aging famous","aging famous author","famous author who","author who lives","who lives alone","lives alone in","alone in a","in a high-tech","a high-tech mansion","high-tech mansion ,","mansion , after",", after his","after his wife","his wife Maggie","wife Maggie has","Maggie has left","has left him","left him for","him for a","for a younger","a younger man","younger man ;","man ;

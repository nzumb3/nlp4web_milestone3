{"title":"Doggie B","plot":"Doggie Boogie dances into the hearts of its family audience as they cheer for a devoted Bichon pup, Pijo, who helps his owner and her dog dancing uncle achieve their dreams. Cassie's wish to become a Vet is crushed by her mother, who has become a slave to the world of personal injury law and is forcing Cassie to follow in the family legacy. Peter Wolfe, her dog-dancing Uncle, dreams of winning a national dog dance championship but is blocked by his guilt over a tragic dance accident. Gertrude Spinner, a ten-time dog dance champion and keeper of the legendary Dog Dance Bible, will do anything to stop them. Supported by a colorful cast and enchanting dogs, Pijo uses the lessons of Barkananda (\"healing bliss\") to provide Cassie and Peter with a fresh start as they dance through life's twists and turns. He breathes life into everyone's dreams as he dances away with their hearts.","genres":["Family"],"stems":["Doggi","Boogi","danc","into","the","heart","of","it","famili","audienc","as","they","cheer","for","a","devot","Bichon","pup",",","Pijo",",","who","help","his","owner","and","her","dog","danc","uncl","achiev","their","dream",".","Cassi","'s","wish","to","becom","a","Vet","is","crush","by","her","mother",",","who","has","becom","a","slave","to","the","world","of","person","injuri","law","and","is","forc","Cassi","to","follow","in","the","famili","legaci",".","Peter","Wolf",",","her","dog-danc","Uncle",",","dream","of","win","a","nation","dog","danc","championship","but","is","block","by","his","guilt","over","a","tragic","danc","accid",".","Gertrud","Spinner",",","a","ten-tim","dog","danc","champion","and","keeper","of","the","legendari","Dog","Danc","Bibl",",","will","do","anyth","to","stop","them",".","Support","by","a","color","cast","and","enchant","dog",",","Pijo","use","the","lesson","of","Barkananda","(","\"","heal","bliss","\"",")","to","provid","Cassi","and","Peter","with","a","fresh","start","as","they","danc","through","life","'s","twist","and","turn",".","He","breath","life","into","everyon","'s","dream","as","he","danc","away","with","their","heart","."],"lemmas":["Doggie","Boogie","dance","into","the","heart","of","its","family","audience","as","they","cheer","for","a","devoted","Bichon","pup",",","Pijo",",","who","help","he","owner","and","she","dog","dancing","uncle","achieve","they","dream",".","Cassie","'s","wish","to","become","a","vet","be","crush","by","she","mother",",","who","have","become","a","slave","to","the","world","of","personal","injury","law","and","be","force","Cassie","to","follow","in","the","family","legacy",".","Peter","Wolfe",",","she","dog-dancing","Uncle",",","dream","of","win","a","national","dog","dance","championship","but","be","block","by","he","guilt","over","a","tragic","dance","accident",".","Gertrude","Spinner",",","a","ten-time","dog","dance","champion","and","keeper","of","the","legendary","Dog","Dance","Bible",",","will","do","anything","to","stop","they",".","support","by","a","colorful","cast","and","enchant","dog",",","Pijo","use","the","lesson","of","Barkananda","-lrb-","``","healing","bliss","''","-rrb-","to","provide","Cassie","and","Peter","with","a","fresh","start","as","they","dance","through","life","'s","twist","and","turn",".","he","breathe","life","into","everyone","'s","dream","as","he","dance","away","with","they","heart","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Doggie

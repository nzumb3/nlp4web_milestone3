{"title":"Six Geniuses from Budapest","plot":"It is the story of six extraordinary Hungarians who grew up in Budapest, Hungary during the waning days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. All were gifted and determined to succeed : Leo Szilard, Eugene Paul Wigner, Edward Teller, Janos Lajos Neumann Margittai (John von Neumann), Endre Erno Friedmann (Robert Capa) and Mihaly Kertesz Kaminer (Michael Curtiz). They had to leave their country and eventually Europe due to the tumult of war and anti-Semitism. . All six ended up in America where they became world famous in their own fields and left a permanent mark on the history of the 20th century through their artistry, inventions and sheer brilliance. These six men, all from the same schools and districts in Budapest, left a permanent footprint on culture, science and politics that remains indelible into the current century.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["It","is","the","stori","of","six","extraordinari","Hungarian","who","grew","up","in","Budapest",",","Hungari","dure","the","wane","day","of","the","Austro-Hungarian","Empire",".","All","were","gift","and","determin","to","succeed",":","Leo","Szilard",",","Eugen","Paul","Wigner",",","Edward","Teller",",","Jano","Lajo","Neumann","Margittai","(","John","von","Neumann",")",",","Endre","Erno","Friedmann","(","Robert","Capa",")","and","Mihali","Kertesz","Kamin","(","Michael","Curtiz",")",".","They","had","to","leav","their","countri","and","eventu","Europ","due","to","the","tumult","of","war","and","anti-Semit",".",".","All","six","end","up","in","America","where","they","becam","world","famous","in","their","own","field","and","left","a","perman","mark","on","the","histori","of","the","20th","centuri","through","their","artistri",",","invent","and","sheer","brillianc",".","These","six","men",",","all","from","the","same","school","and","district","in","Budapest",",","left","a","perman","footprint","on","cultur",",","scienc","and","polit","that","remain","indel","into","the","current","centuri","."],"lemmas":["it","be","the","story","of","six","extraordinary","Hungarians","who","grow","up","in","Budapest",",","Hungary","during","the","wane","day","of","the","Austro-Hungarian","Empire",".","all","be","gifted","and","determine","to","succeed",":","Leo","Szilard",",","Eugene","Paul","Wigner",",","Edward","Teller",",","Janos","Lajos","Neumann","Margittai","-lrb-","John","von","Neumann","-rrb-",",","Endre","Erno","Friedmann","-lrb-","Robert","Capa","-rrb-","and","Mihaly","Kertesz","Kaminer","-lrb-","Michael","Curtiz","-rrb-",".","they","have","to","leave","they","country","and","eventually","Europe","due","to","the","tumult","of","war","and","anti-semitism",".",".","all","six","end","up","in","America","where","they","become","world","famous","in","they","own","field","and","leave","a","permanent","mark","on","the","history","of","the","20th","century","through","they","artistry",",","invention","and","sheer","brilliance",".","these","six","man",",","all","from","the","same","school","and","district","in","Budapest",",","leave","a","permanent","footprint","on","culture",",","science","and","politics","that","remain","indelible","into","the","current","century","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["It

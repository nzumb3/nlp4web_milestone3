{"title":"Dimension Folders","plot":"An astrophysicist professor - who firmly believes that higher dimensions exist - discovers an alien civilization in the Galaxy. He sends messages to the aliens and surprisingly they answer him instantly. He has only one explanation: they are in the 5th dimension - they exist OUTSIDE OF TIME, exactly as he described in his theory. The news spreads in seconds and more intelligent services are after him to erase - or possess - his dangerous discovery. With two of his helpers the professor flees across the Vancouver Island rain forests to reach Vancouver where publicity can protect his discovery.","genres":["Action"," Sci-Fi"," Drama"],"stems":["An","astrophysicist","professor","-","who","firm","believ","that","higher","dimens","exist","-","discov","an","alien","civil","in","the","Galaxi",".","He","send","messag","to","the","alien","and","surpris","they","answer","him","instant",".","He","has","onli","one","explan",":","they","are","in","the","5th","dimens","-","they","exist","OUTSIDE","OF","TIME",",","exact","as","he","describ","in","his","theori",".","The","news","spread","in","second","and","more","intellig","servic","are","after","him","to","eras","-","or","possess","-","his","danger","discoveri",".","With","two","of","his","helper","the","professor","flee","across","the","Vancouv","Island","rain","forest","to","reach","Vancouv","where","public","can","protect","his","discoveri","."],"lemmas":["a","astrophysicist","professor","-","who","firmly","believe","that","higher","dimension","exist","-","discover","a","alien","civilization","in","the","Galaxy",".","he","send","message","to","the","alien","and","surprisingly","they","answer","he","instantly",".","he","have","only","one","explanation",":","they","be","in","the","5th","dimension","-","they","exist","OUTSIDE","of","TIME",",","exactly","as","he","describe","in","he","theory",".","the","news","spread","in","seconds","and","more","intelligent","service","be","after","he","to","erase","-","or","possess","-","he","dangerous","discovery",".","with","two","of","he","helper","the","professor","flee","across","the","Vancouver","Island","rain","forest","to","reach","Vancouver","where","publicity","can","protect","he","discovery","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["An astrophysicist professor","astrophysicist professor -","professor - who","- who firmly","who firmly believes","firmly believes that","believes that higher","that higher dimensions","higher dimensions exist","dimensions exist -","exist - discovers","- discovers an","discovers an alien","an alien civilization","alien civilization in","civilization in the","in the Galaxy","He sends messages","sends messages to","messages to the","to the aliens","the aliens and","aliens and surprisingly","and surprisingly they","surprisingly they answer","they answer him","answer him instantly","He has only","has only one","only one explanation","one explanation :","explanation : they",": they are","they are in","are in the","in the 5th","the 5th dimension","5th dimension -","dimension - they","- they exist","they exist OUTSIDE","exist OUTSIDE OF","OUTSIDE OF TIME","OF TIME ,","TIME , exactly",", exactly as","exactly as he","as he described","he described in","described in his","in his theory","The news spreads","news spreads in","spreads in seconds","in seconds and","seconds and more","and more intelligent","more intelligent services","intelligent services are","services are after","are after him","after him to","him to erase","to erase -","erase - or","- or possess","or possess -","possess - his","- his dangerous","his dangerous discovery","With two of","two of his","of his helpers","his helpers the","helpers the professor","the professor flees","professor flees across","flees across the","across the Vancouver","the Vancouver Island","Vancouver Island rain","Island rain forests","rain forests to","forests to reach","to reach Vancouver","reach Vancouver where","Vancouver where publicity","where publicity can","publicity can protect","can protect his","protect his discovery"],"2grams":["An astrophysicist","astrophysicist professor","professor -","- who","who firmly","firmly believes","believes that","that higher","higher dimensions","dimensions exist","exist -","- discovers","discovers an","an alien","alien civilization","civilization in","in the","the Galaxy","He sends","sends messages","messages to","to the","the aliens","aliens and","and surprisingly","surprisingly they","they answer","answer him","him instantly","He has","has only","only one","one explanation","explanation :",": they","they are","are in","in the","the 5th","5th dimension","dimension -","- they","they exist","exist OUTSIDE","OUTSIDE OF","OF TIME","TIME ,",", exactly","exactly as","as he","he described","described in","in his","his theory","The news","news spreads","spreads in","in seconds","seconds and","and more","more intelligent","intelligent services","services are","are after","after him","him to","to erase","erase -","- or","or possess","possess -","- his","his dangerous","dangerous discovery","With two","two of","of his","his helpers","helpers the","the professor","professor flees","flees across","across the","the Vancouver","Vancouver Island","Island rain","rain forests","forests to","to reach","reach Vancouver","Vancouver where","where publicity","publicity can","can protect","protect his","his discovery"]}

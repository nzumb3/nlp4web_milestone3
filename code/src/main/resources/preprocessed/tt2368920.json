{"title":"Touch of the Light","plot":"Based on true events related to the life of Taiwanese piano prodigy Huang Yu-Siang (Siang played by himself), this is a story of inspiration, discovery and love. Born to a rural family in Taiwan unprepared for the birth of a blind son, Siang was a curious and precocious child. Touch and sound was everything to him. With the love of his mother and support of his family, he grew up with no barriers - that is until he had to face the real world as he left his family behind in order to attend university where he had to compete on the same playing field as the sighted students and to find his own way. He soon crossed paths with Jie (Sandrine Pinna), a beautiful but frustrated cold drinks vendor who dreams of being a dancer, but whose struggles against the harsh realities of her life render her helpless. However, when she witnesses Siang's fearless determination and understood his optimism and inner peace, she is inspired and determined to hold on to her dream. Touch of the Light - a story of dreams, determination, love, and believing in yourself.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Base","on","true","event","relat","to","the","life","of","Taiwanes","piano","prodigi","Huang","Yu-Siang","(","Siang","play","by","himself",")",",","this","is","a","stori","of","inspir",",","discoveri","and","love",".","Born","to","a","rural","famili","in","Taiwan","unprepar","for","the","birth","of","a","blind","son",",","Siang","was","a","curious","and","precoci","child",".","Touch","and","sound","was","everyth","to","him",".","With","the","love","of","his","mother","and","support","of","his","famili",",","he","grew","up","with","no","barrier","-","that","is","until","he","had","to","face","the","real","world","as","he","left","his","famili","behind","in","order","to","attend","univers","where","he","had","to","compet","on","the","same","play","field","as","the","sight","student","and","to","find","his","own","way",".","He","soon","cross","path","with","Jie","(","Sandrin","Pinna",")",",","a","beauti","but","frustrat","cold","drink","vendor","who","dream","of","be","a","dancer",",","but","whose","struggl","against","the","harsh","realiti","of","her","life","render","her","helpless",".","Howev",",","when","she","wit","Siang","'s","fearless","determin","and","understood","his","optim","and","inner","peac",",","she","is","inspir","and","determin","to","hold","on","to","her","dream",".","Touch","of","the","Light","-","a","stori","of","dream",",","determin",",","love",",","and","believ","in","yourself","."],"lemmas":["base","on","true","event","relate","to","the","life","of","taiwanese","piano","prodigy","Huang","Yu-Siang","-lrb-","Siang","play","by","himself","-rrb-",",","this","be","a","story","of","inspiration",",","discovery","and","love",".","bear","to","a","rural","family","in","Taiwan","unprepared","for","the","birth","of","a","blind","son",",","Siang","be","a","curious","and","precocious","child",".","touch","and","sound","be","everything","to","he",".","with","the","love","of","he","mother","and","support","of","he","family",",","he","grow","up","with","no","barrier","-","that","be","until","he","have","to","face","the","real","world","as","he","leave","he","family","behind","in","order","to","attend","university","where","he","have","to","compete","on","the","same","playing","field","as","the","sighted","student","and","to","find","he","own","way",".","he","soon","cross","path","with","jie","-lrb-","Sandrine","Pinna","-rrb-",",","a","beautiful","but","frustrated","cold","drink","vendor","who","dream","of","be","a","dancer",",","but","whose","struggle","against","the","harsh","reality","of","she","life","render","she","helpless",".","however",",","when","she","witness","Siang","'s","fearless","determination","and","understand","he","optimism","and","inner","peace",",","she","be","inspire","and","determine","to","hold","on","to","she","dream",".","touch","of","the","Light","-","a","story","of","dream",",","determination",",","love",",","and","believe","in","yourself","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Based on true","on true events","true events related","events related to","related to the","to the life","the life of","life of Taiwanese","of Taiwanese piano","Taiwanese piano prodigy","piano prodigy Huang","prodigy Huang Yu-Siang","Huang Yu-Siang (","Yu-Siang ( Siang","( Siang played","Siang played by","played by himself","by himself )","himself ) ,",") , this",", this is","this is a","is a story","a story of","story of inspiration","of inspiration ,","inspiration , discovery",", discovery and","discovery and love","Born to a","to a rural","a rural family","rural family in","family in Taiwan","in Taiwan unprepared","Taiwan unprepared for","unprepared for the","for the birth","the birth of","birth of a","of a blind","a blind son","blind son ,","son , Siang",", Siang was","Siang was a","was a curious","a curious and","curious and precocious","and precocious child","Touch and sound","and sound was","sound was everything","was everything to","everything to him","With the love","the love of","love of his","of his mother","his mother and","mother and support","and support of","support of his","of his family","his family ,","family , he",", he grew","he grew up","grew up with","up with no","with no barriers","no barriers -","barriers -

{"title":"Le Cirque: A Table in Heaven","plot":"At the end of 2005, New York's famed restaurateur, Sirio Maccioni, closed Le Cirque, destination of the rich and famous. During 2006, he and his three sons, open a new Le Cirque, taking four months longer and $4 million more than planned. The film follows this process, the new restaurant's opening, and the emotional impact of two New York Times reviews over the next few months. Maccioni, in his 70s, seems tired, chained to his work for his sons's sake; then, the restaurant opens and his indefatigable charm returns. It's a roller coaster ride. At the film's end, Maccioni, with a small Gucci bag on his hip, receives communion in a church in his home town of Montecatini Italy.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["At","the","end","of","2005",",","New","York","'s","fame","restaurateur",",","Sirio","Maccioni",",","close","Le","Cirqu",",","destin","of","the","rich","and","famous",".","Dure","2006",",","he","and","his","three","son",",","open","a","new","Le","Cirqu",",","take","four","month","longer","and","$","4","million","more","than","plan",".","The","film","follow","this","process",",","the","new","restaur","'s","open",",","and","the","emot","impact","of","two","New","York","Time","review","over","the","next","few","month",".","Maccioni",",","in","his","70s",",","seem","tire",",","chain","to","his","work","for","his","son","'s","sake",";","then",",","the","restaur","open","and","his","indefatig","charm","return",".","It","'s","a","roller","coaster","ride",".","At","the","film","'s","end",",","Maccioni",",","with","a","small","Gucci","bag","on","his","hip",",","receiv","communion","in","a","church","in","his","home","town","of","Montecatini","Itali","."],"lemmas":["at","the","end","of","2005",",","New","York","'s","famed","restaurateur",",","Sirio","Maccioni",",","close","Le","Cirque",",","destination","of","the","rich","and","famous",".","during","2006",",","he","and","he","three","son",",","open","a","new","Le","Cirque",",","take","four","month","longer","and","$","4","million","more","than","plan",".","the","film","follow","this","process",",","the","new","restaurant","'s","opening",",","and","the","emotional","impact","of","two","New","York","Times","review","over","the","next","few","month",".","Maccioni",",","in","he","70",",","seem","tired",",","chained","to","he","work","for","he","son","'s","sake",";","then",",","the","restaurant","open","and","he","indefatigable","charm","return",".","it","be","a","roller","coaster","ride",".","at","the","film","'s","end",",","Maccioni",",","with","a","small","Gucci","bag","on","he","hip",",","receive","communion","in","a","church","in","he","home","town","of","Montecatini","Italy","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["At the end","the end of","end of 2005","of 2005 ,","2005 , New",", New York","New York 's","York 's famed","'s famed restaurateur","famed restaurateur ,","restaurateur , Sirio",", Sirio Maccioni","Sirio Maccioni ,","Maccioni , closed",", closed Le","closed Le Cirque","Le Cirque ,","Cirque , destination",", destination of","destination of the","of the rich","the rich and","rich and famous","During 2006 ,","2006 , he",", he and","he and his","and his three","his three sons","three sons ,","sons , open",", open a","open a new","a new Le","new Le Cirque","Le Cirque ,","Cirque , taking",", taking four","taking four months","four months longer","months longer and","longer and $","and $ 4","$ 4 million","4 million more","million more than","more than planned","The film follows","film follows this","follows this process","this process ,","process , the",", the new","the new restaurant","new restaurant 's","restaurant 's opening","'s opening ,","opening , and",", and the","and the emotional","the emotional impact","emotional impact of","impact of two","of two New","two New York","New York Times","York Times reviews","Times reviews over","reviews over the","over the next","the next few","next few months","Maccioni , in",", in his","in his 70s","his 70s ,","70s , seems",", seems tired","seems tired ,","tired , chained",", chained to","chained to his","to his work","his work for","work for his","for his sons","his sons 's","sons 's sake","'s sake ;","sake ;

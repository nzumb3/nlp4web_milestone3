{"title":"Chameleon","plot":"Jessica and Natasha, co-workers at a men's clothing store, are getting ready to close when they notice the headline of the daily newspaper; It's another report regarding a string of unsolved cannibalistic serial killings in the city. Natasha stays behind to lock up shop, while Jessica now can't help but feel a little nervous about her eerie walk alone to her bus stop. Her imagination runs wild as every sound and shadow is surely something dangerous in the darkness. Is this just another case of frightful paranoia? Or is there really something out there that Jessica has every right to fear?","genres":["Horror"],"stems":["Jessica","and","Natasha",",","co-work","at","a","men","'s","cloth","store",",","are","get","readi","to","close","when","they","notic","the","headlin","of","the","daili","newspap",";","It","'s","anoth","report","regard","a","string","of","unsolv","cannibalist","serial","kill","in","the","citi",".","Natasha","stay","behind","to","lock","up","shop",",","while","Jessica","now","ca","n't","help","but","feel","a","littl","nervous","about","her","eeri","walk","alon","to","her","bus","stop",".","Her","imagin","run","wild","as","everi","sound","and","shadow","is","sure","someth","danger","in","the","dark",".","Is","this","just","anoth","case","of","fright","paranoia","?","Or","is","there","realli","someth","out","there","that","Jessica","has","everi","right","to","fear","?"],"lemmas":["Jessica","and","Natasha",",","co-worker","at","a","man","'s","clothing","store",",","be","get","ready","to","close","when","they","notice","the","headline","of","the","daily","newspaper",";","it","be","another","report","regard","a","string","of","unsolved","cannibalistic","serial","killing","in","the","city",".","Natasha","stay","behind","to","lock","up","shop",",","while","Jessica","now","can","not","help","but","feel","a","little","nervous","about","she","eerie","walk","alone","to","she","bus","stop",".","she","imagination","run","wild","as","every","sound","and","shadow","be","surely","something","dangerous","in","the","darkness",".","be","this","just","another","case","of","frightful","paranoia","?","or","be","there","really","something","out","there","that","Jessica","have","every","right","to","fear","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jessica and Natasha","and Natasha ,","Natasha , co-workers",", co-workers at","co-workers at a","at a men","a men 's","men 's clothing","'s clothing store","clothing store ,","store , are",", are getting","are getting ready","getting ready to","ready to close","to close when","close when they","when they notice","they notice the","notice the headline","the headline of","headline of the","of the daily","the daily newspaper","daily newspaper ;","newspaper ; It","; It 's","It 's another","'s another report","another report regarding","report regarding a","regarding a string","a string of","string of unsolved","of unsolved cannibalistic","unsolved cannibalistic serial","cannibalistic serial killings","serial killings in","killings in the","in the city","Natasha stays behind","stays behind to","behind to lock","to lock up","lock up shop","up shop ,","shop , while",", while Jessica","while Jessica now","Jessica now ca","now ca n't","ca n't help","n't help but","help but feel","but feel a","feel a little","a little nervous","little nervous about","nervous about her","about her eerie","her eerie walk","eerie walk alone","walk alone to","alone to her","to her bus","her bus stop","Her imagination runs","imagination runs wild","runs wild as","wild as every","as every sound","every sound and","sound and shadow","and shadow is","shadow is surely","is surely something","surely something dangerous","something dangerous in","dangerous in the","in the darkness","Is this just","this just another","just another case","another case of","case of frightful","of frightful paranoia","Or is there","is there really","there really something","really something out","something out there","out there that","there that Jessica","that Jessica has","Jessica has every","has every right","every right to","right to fear"],"2grams":["Jessica and","and Natasha","Natasha ,",", co-workers","co-workers at","at a","a men","men 's","'s clothing","clothing store","store ,",", are","are getting","getting ready","ready to","to close","close when","when they","they notice","notice the","the headline","headline of","of the","the daily","daily newspaper","newspaper ;","; It","It 's","'s another","another report","report regarding","regarding a","a string","string of","of unsolved","unsolved cannibalistic","cannibalistic serial","serial killings","killings in","in the","the city","Natasha stays","stays behind","behind to","to lock","lock up","up shop","shop ,",", while","while Jessica","Jessica now","now ca","ca n't","n't help","help but","but feel","feel a","a little","little nervous","nervous about","about her","her eerie","eerie walk","walk alone","alone to","to her","her bus","bus stop","Her imagination","imagination runs","runs wild","wild as","as every","every sound","sound and","and shadow","shadow is","is surely","surely something","something dangerous","dangerous in","in the","the darkness","Is this","this just","just another","another case","case of","of frightful","frightful paranoia","Or is","is there","there really","really something","something out","out there","there that","that Jessica","Jessica has","has every","every right","right to","to fear"]}

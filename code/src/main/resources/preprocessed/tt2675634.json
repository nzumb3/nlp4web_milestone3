{"title":"My Kashmir","plot":"My Kashmir is a film about being young in Kashmir, India, one of the most contentious and militarized regions in the world. For two college students Javaid and Iqbal, a childhood rife with curfews, crossfires and crackdowns has given way to a generation questioning their lack of freedom, while carving a peaceful path to their future.Theirs are the voices of young people who hold the key to Kashmir's future. Kashmir is a place celebrated for its legendary beauty and culture. This is also the place where tens of thousands have died in the midst of years of conflict and deadlock between India, Pakistan and separatist Kashmiris as each lays claim to the region. By bringing to light the human stories of these young Kashmiris who are invested in peace, the film explores the voices of a generation that has grown up in one of South Asia's oldest and deadliest conflicts, presenting a unique perspective and raising crucial dialogue about the future of Kashmir, the cost of militarization, human rights violations, and the desire for justice.","genres":["Documentary","

{"title":"Nicht schon wieder Rudi!","plot":"55 year old Bernd is looking forward to a quiet weekend at the lake with his best friend Klaus, 56 and his brother Peter, 53. But when Peter decides to bring along Casanova Murat, 37 hopes for a harmonic get together wane thanks to Bernd's dislike for him. He calms down a bit when Klaus opens up about his plan to extract revenge on Murat for breaking his daughter's heart. Upon arrival at the cabin tensions are high. So, in order to make the best of the trip, Bernd decides to go fishing. However, after an accident with the water swing on the pond, an unconscious Klaus is saved from drowning by Murat, landing Murat on Bernd's good side. The next morning Klaus regains consciousness asking for his dog Rudy. Rudy is dead and has been for two years. In order not to upset Klaus the four men go on a wild goose chase searching for Rudy, while they get tangled up deeper and deeper in their web of lies. They try to reason with their friend but their friendship has to survive a hard test. Or is all of this just part of an elaborate plan to teach Murat a lesson?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["55","year","old","Bernd","is","look","forward","to","a","quiet","weekend","at","the","lake","with","his","best","friend","Klaus",",","56","and","his","brother","Peter",",","53",".","But","when","Peter","decid","to","bring","along","Casanova","Murat",",","37","hope","for","a","harmon","get","togeth","wane","thank","to","Bernd","'s","dislik","for","him",".","He","calm","down","a","bit","when","Klaus","open","up","about","his","plan","to","extract","reveng","on","Murat","for","break","his","daughter","'s","heart",".","Upon","arriv","at","the","cabin","tension","are","high",".","So",",","in","order","to","make","the","best","of","the","trip",",","Bernd","decid","to","go","fish",".","Howev",",","after","an","accid","with","the","water","swing","on","the","pond",",","an","unconsci","Klaus","is","save","from","drown","by","Murat",",","land","Murat","on","Bernd","'s","good","side",".","The","next","morn","Klaus","regain","conscious","ask","for","his","dog","Rudi",".","Rudi","is","dead","and","has","been","for","two","year",".","In","order","not","to","upset","Klaus","the","four","men","go","on","a","wild","goos","chase","search","for","Rudi",",","while","they","get","tangl","up","deeper","and","deeper","in","their","web","of","lie",".","They","tri","to","reason","with","their","friend","but","their","friendship","has","to","surviv","a","hard","test",".","Or","is","all","of","this","just","part","of","an","elabor","plan","to","teach","Murat","a","lesson","?"],"lemmas":["55","year","old","Bernd","be","look","forward","to","a","quiet","weekend","at","the","lake","with","he","best","friend","Klaus",",","56","and","he","brother","Peter",",","53",".","but","when","Peter","decide","to","bring","along","Casanova","Murat",",","37","hope","for","a","harmonic","get","together","wane","thanks","to","Bernd","'s","dislike","for","he",".","he","calm","down","a","bit","when","Klaus","open","up","about","he","plan","to","extract","revenge","on","Murat","for","break","he","daughter","'s","heart",".","upon","arrival","at","the","cabin","tension","be","high",".","so",",","in","order","to","make","the","best","of","the","trip",",","Bernd","decide","to","go","fishing",".","however",",","after","a","accident","with","the","water","swing","on","the","pond",",","a","unconscious","Klaus","be","save","from","drown","by","Murat",",","land","Murat","on","Bernd","'s","good","side",".","the","next","morning","Klaus","regain","consciousness","ask","for","he","dog","Rudy",".","Rudy","be","dead","and","have","be","for","two","year",".","in","order","not","to","upset","Klaus","the","four","man","go","on","a","wild","goose","chase","search","for","Rudy",",","while","they","get","tangle","up","deeper","and","deeper","in","they","web","of","lie",".","they","try","to","reason","with","they","friend","but","they","friendship","have","to","survive","a","hard","test",".","or","be","all","of","this","just","part","of","a","elaborate","plan","to","teach","Murat","a","lesson","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["55

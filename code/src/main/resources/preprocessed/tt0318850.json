{"title":"The Young Black Stallion","plot":"A prequel to the 1979 classic The Black Stallion--a family drama that presents the horse's adventures with a young girl named Neera, who has been separated from her father in Arabia by WWII. Left alone in the desert, she befriends the wild colt whom she names Shetan. Once reunited with her father, however, Neera remains haunted by the images of the lost horse in the desert--one of a few stallions of legend, rumored to be born of the sands, sired by the night sky, drinkers of the wind.","genres":["Adventure"," Family"," Drama"],"stems":["A","prequel","to","the","1979","classic","The","Black","Stallion","--","a","famili","drama","that","present","the","hors","'s","adventur","with","a","young","girl","name","Neera",",","who","has","been","separ","from","her","father","in","Arabia","by","WWII",".","Left","alon","in","the","desert",",","she","befriend","the","wild","colt","whom","she","name","Shetan",".","Once","reunit","with","her","father",",","howev",",","Neera","remain","haunt","by","the","imag","of","the","lost","hors","in","the","desert","--","one","of","a","few","stallion","of","legend",",","rumor","to","be","born","of","the","sand",",","sire","by","the","night","sky",",","drinker","of","the","wind","."],"lemmas":["a","prequel","to","the","1979","classic","the","black","stallion","--","a","family","drama","that","present","the","horse","'s","adventure","with","a","young","girl","name","Neera",",","who","have","be","separate","from","she","father","in","Arabia","by","WWII",".","leave","alone","in","the","desert",",","she","befriend","the","wild","colt","whom","she","name","Shetan",".","once","reunite","with","she","father",",","however",",","Neera","remain","haunt","by","the","image","of","the","lost","horse","in","the","desert","--","one","of","a","few","stallion","of","legend",",","rumor","to","be","bear","of","the","sand",",","sire","by","the","night","sky",",","drinker","of","the","wind","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["A prequel to","prequel to the","to the 1979","the 1979 classic","1979 classic The","classic The Black","The Black Stallion","Black Stallion --","Stallion -- a","-- a family","a family drama","family drama that","drama that presents","that presents the","presents the horse","the horse 's","horse 's adventures","'s adventures with","adventures with a","with a young","a young girl","young girl named","girl named Neera","named Neera ,","Neera , who",", who has","who has been","has been separated","been separated from","separated from her","from her father","her father in","father in Arabia","in Arabia by","Arabia by WWII","Left alone in","alone in the","in the desert","the desert ,","desert , she",", she befriends","she befriends the","befriends the wild","the wild colt","wild colt whom","colt whom she","whom she names","she names Shetan","Once reunited with","reunited with her","with her father","her father ,","father , however",", however ,","however , Neera",", Neera remains","Neera remains haunted","remains haunted by","haunted by the","by the images","the images of","images of the","of the lost","the lost horse","lost horse in","horse in the","in the desert","the desert --","desert -- one","-- one of","one of a","of a few","a few stallions","few stallions of","stallions of legend","of legend ,","legend , rumored",", rumored to","rumored to be","to be born","be born of","born of the","of the sands","the sands ,","sands , sired",", sired by","sired by the","by the night","the night sky","night sky ,","sky , drinkers",", drinkers of","drinkers of the","of the wind"],"2grams":["A prequel","prequel to","to the","the 1979","1979 classic","classic The","The Black","Black Stallion","Stallion --","-- a","a family","family drama","drama that","that presents","presents the","the horse","horse 's","'s adventures","adventures with","with a","a young","young girl","girl named","named Neera","Neera ,",", who","who has","has been","been separated","separated from","from her","her father","father in","in Arabia","Arabia by","by WWII","Left alone","alone in","in the","the desert","desert ,",", she","she befriends","befriends the","the wild","wild colt","colt whom","whom she","she names","names Shetan","Once reunited","reunited with","with her","her father","father ,",", however","however ,",", Neera","Neera remains","remains haunted","haunted by","by the","the images","images of","of the","the lost","lost horse","horse in","in the","the desert","desert --","-- one","one of","of a","a few","few stallions","stallions of","of legend","legend ,",", rumored","rumored to","to be","be born","born of","of the","the sands","sands ,",", sired","sired by","by the","the night","night sky","sky ,",", drinkers","drinkers of","of the","the wind"]}

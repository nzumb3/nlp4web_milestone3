{"title":"Spirit","plot":"Raghunandan is an ex-Bank of England employee who resigned his lucrative job because he was bored with the rather sedentary and mundane nature of his work. he chose journalism as his next career and worked in different cities in India. He now works for a TV news channel as an interviewer in a popular show named \"Show the Spirit\". In the mean time, he is in the process of writing an English novel too. He is essentially a loner but is a compulsive alcoholic and has an expensive collection of vintage drinks at home. It was his excessive drinking that resulted in his divorce some years back, but he shares a healthy friendship with his ex-wife Meera and her current husband Alexy. The couple have custody of Raghunandan's and Meera's son Aditya a.k.a Sunny, who is deaf and mute. Raghunandan's fatal addiction towards alcohol takes a heavy toll on his personal and professional life. However, good sense dawns, albeit late, when he comes across a man who is worse than him because of his drinking problem.","genres":["Comedy","

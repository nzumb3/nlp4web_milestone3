{"title":"Underground","plot":"The story follows an underground weapons manufacturer in Belgrade during WWII and evolves into fairly surreal situations. A black marketeer who smuggles the weapons to partisans doesn't mention to the workers that the war is over, and they keep producing. Years later, they break out of their underground \"shelter\" --- only to convince themselves that the war is still going on.","genres":["Comedy"," War"," Drama"],"stems":["The","stori","follow","an","underground","weapon","manufactur","in","Belgrad","dure","WWII","and","evolv","into","fair","surreal","situat",".","A","black","market","who","smuggl","the","weapon","to","partisan","doe","n't","mention","to","the","worker","that","the","war","is","over",",","and","they","keep","produc",".","Year","later",",","they","break","out","of","their","underground","\"","shelter","\"","---","onli","to","convinc","themselv","that","the","war","is","still","go","on","."],"lemmas":["the","story","follow","a","underground","weapon","manufacturer","in","Belgrade","during","WWII","and","evolve","into","fairly","surreal","situation",".","a","black","marketeer","who","smuggle","the","weapon","to","partisan","do","not","mention","to","the","worker","that","the","war","be","over",",","and","they","keep","produce",".","year","later",",","they","break","out","of","they","underground","``","shelter","''","---","only","to","convince","themselves","that","the","war","be","still","go","on","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["The story follows","story follows an","follows an underground","an underground weapons","underground weapons manufacturer","weapons manufacturer in","manufacturer in Belgrade","in Belgrade during","Belgrade during WWII","during WWII and","WWII and evolves","and evolves into","evolves into fairly","into fairly surreal","fairly surreal situations","A black marketeer","black marketeer who","marketeer who smuggles","who smuggles the","smuggles the weapons","the weapons to","weapons to partisans","to partisans does","partisans does n't","does n't mention","n't mention to","mention to the","to the workers","the workers that","workers that the","that the war","the war is","war is over","is over ,","over , and",", and they","and they keep","they keep producing","Years later ,","later , they",", they break","they break out","break out of","out of their","of their underground","their underground \"","underground \" shelter","\" shelter \"","shelter \" ---","\" --- only","--- only to","only to convince","to convince themselves","convince themselves that","themselves that the","that the war","the war is","war is still","is still going","still going on"],"2grams":["The story","story follows","follows an","an underground","underground weapons","weapons manufacturer","manufacturer in","in Belgrade","Belgrade during","during WWII","WWII and","and evolves","evolves into","into fairly","fairly surreal","surreal situations","A black","black marketeer","marketeer who","who smuggles","smuggles the","the weapons","weapons to","to partisans","partisans does","does n't","n't mention","mention to","to the","the workers","workers that","that the","the war","war is","is over","over ,",", and","and they","they keep","keep producing","Years later","later ,",", they","they break","break out","out of","of their","their underground","underground \"","\" shelter","shelter \"","\" ---","--- only","only to","to convince","convince themselves","themselves that","that the","the war","war is","is still","still going","going on"]}

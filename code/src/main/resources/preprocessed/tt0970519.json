{"title":"Imagination","plot":"Dr. Reineger is a child neuro-psychologist who has become confident that the twin Anna has a form of autism called Asperger's Syndrome, rendering her unable to cope with reality. As for her blind sister, Sarah, the Doctor cannot say for sure why her visions map so closely to Anna's. At home, their father leaves the family. To escape the pain, the girls sink deeper and deeper into their imaginations. When a major earthquake takes their mother's life, Reineger is left with helping the now-orphaned twins cope, while at the same time dealing with his own struggle concerning the girls' prophetic visions. The girls escape the institution. The subsequent search party can't track them. Have they indeed transcended the physical realm?","genres":["Animation","

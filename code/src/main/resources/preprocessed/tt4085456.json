{"title":"Snowman","plot":"From childhood, Kevin Fogolin dreamed of living and working in the mountains. After breaking the shackles of small-town expectations, his dream comes crashing down in a helicopter avalanche bombing mission gone horribly wrong. In the aftermath, Kevin and his childhood friend, freeskiing icon Mike Douglas, are forced to confront the risks and rewards of following their passion for the mountains. Set in British Columbia's rugged Coast Mountain range, SNOWMAN is a familiar tale of dreaming big and a life where the greatest risk is not daring to dream at all.","genres":["Action"," Documentary"," Adventure"],"stems":["From","childhood",",","Kevin","Fogolin","dream","of","live","and","work","in","the","mountain",".","After","break","the","shackl","of","small-town","expect",",","his","dream","come","crash","down","in","a","helicopt","avalanch","bomb","mission","gone","horribl","wrong",".","In","the","aftermath",",","Kevin","and","his","childhood","friend",",","freeski","icon","Mike","Dougla",",","are","forc","to","confront","the","risk","and","reward","of","follow","their","passion","for","the","mountain",".","Set","in","British","Columbia","'s","rug","Coast","Mountain","rang",",","SNOWMAN","is","a","familiar","tale","of","dream","big","and","a","life","where","the","greatest","risk","is","not","dare","to","dream","at","all","."],"lemmas":["from","childhood",",","Kevin","Fogolin","dream","of","live","and","work","in","the","mountain",".","after","break","the","shackle","of","small-town","expectation",",","he","dream","come","crash","down","in","a","helicopter","avalanche","bombing","mission","go","horribly","wrong",".","in","the","aftermath",",","Kevin","and","he","childhood","friend",",","freeskie","icon","Mike","Douglas",",","be","force","to","confront","the","risk","and","reward","of","follow","they","passion","for","the","mountain",".","set","in","British","Columbia","'s","rugged","Coast","Mountain","range",",","SNOWMAN","be","a","familiar","tale","of","dream","big","and","a","life","where","the","greatest","risk","be","not","daring","to","dream","at","all","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["From childhood ,","childhood , Kevin",", Kevin Fogolin","Kevin Fogolin dreamed","Fogolin dreamed of","dreamed of living","of living and","living and working","and working in","working in the","in the mountains","After breaking the","breaking the shackles","the shackles of","shackles of small-town","of small-town expectations","small-town expectations ,","expectations , his",", his dream","his dream comes","dream comes crashing","comes crashing down","crashing down in","down in a","in a helicopter","a helicopter avalanche","helicopter avalanche bombing","avalanche bombing mission","bombing mission gone","mission gone horribly","gone horribly wrong","In the aftermath","the aftermath ,","aftermath , Kevin",", Kevin and","Kevin and his","and his childhood","his childhood friend","childhood friend ,","friend , freeskiing",", freeskiing icon","freeskiing icon Mike","icon Mike Douglas","Mike Douglas ,","Douglas , are",", are forced","are forced to","forced to confront","to confront the","confront the risks","the risks and","risks and rewards","and rewards of","rewards of following","of following their","following their passion","their passion for","passion for the","for the mountains","Set in British","in British Columbia","British Columbia 's","Columbia 's rugged","'s rugged Coast","rugged Coast Mountain","Coast Mountain range","Mountain range ,","range , SNOWMAN",", SNOWMAN is","SNOWMAN is a","is a familiar","a familiar tale","familiar tale of","tale of dreaming","of dreaming big","dreaming big and","big and a","and a life","a life where","life where the","where the greatest","the greatest risk","greatest risk is","risk is not","is not daring","not daring to","daring to dream","to dream at","dream at all"],"2grams":["From childhood","childhood ,",", Kevin","Kevin Fogolin","Fogolin dreamed","dreamed of","of living","living and","and working","working in","in the","the mountains","After breaking","breaking the","the shackles","shackles of","of small-town","small-town expectations","expectations ,",", his","his dream","dream comes","comes crashing","crashing down","down in","in a","a helicopter","helicopter avalanche","avalanche bombing","bombing mission","mission gone","gone horribly","horribly wrong","In the","the aftermath","aftermath ,",", Kevin","Kevin and","and his","his childhood","childhood friend","friend ,",", freeskiing","freeskiing icon","icon Mike","Mike Douglas","Douglas ,",", are","are forced","forced to","to confront","confront the","the risks","risks and","and rewards","rewards of","of following","following their","their passion","passion for","for the","the mountains","Set in","in British","British Columbia","Columbia 's","'s rugged","rugged Coast","Coast Mountain","Mountain range","range ,",", SNOWMAN","SNOWMAN is","is a","a familiar","familiar tale","tale of","of dreaming","dreaming big","big and","and a","a life","life where","where the","the greatest","greatest risk","risk is","is not","not daring","daring to","to dream","dream at","at all"]}

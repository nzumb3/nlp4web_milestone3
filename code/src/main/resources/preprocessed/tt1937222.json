{"title":"Least Among Saints","plot":"Writer, director and actor Martin Papazian's debut film LEAST AMONG SAINTS movingly illustrates a man's hard-fought road towards reconciling with his better self. Coming home to a broken marriage and uncertain future, veteran Anthony Hayward (Papazian) thinks he's at the end of his rope. But when his troubled ten year-old neighbor, Wade (Tristan Lake Leabu), calls out for help, Anthony can't seem to turn away. To the dismay of the boy's embattled social worker (Laura San Giacomo), Anthony sets out on a fool's quest to help this heartbroken but hard to reach child find his long-lost father, who might not even exist. Yet in the midst of this new mission - the first that seems to matter since his return -- Anthony begins to come to grips with both the costs of war and the universal power of human connection. As the film builds to an emotional climax, Papazian finds both the gravity and the grace in ordinary, flawed characters pushed to extraordinary acts of compassion and decency.","genres":["Crime","

{"title":"Dragonslayer","plot":"Directed by Tristan Patterson and executive produced by indie-maverick Christine Vachon, DRAGONSLAYER is the Grand Jury Prize winner for Best Documentary Feature at SXSW 2011, and is the second feature to be released theatrically by Drag City following Harmony Korine's Trash Humpers. DRAGONSLAYER documents the transgressions of a lost skate punk falling in love in the stagnant suburbs of Fullerton, California in the aftermath of America's economic collapse. Taking the viewer through a golden SoCal haze of broken homes, abandoned swimming pools and stray glimpses of unusual beauty, DRAGONSLAYER captures the life and times of Josh \"Skreech\" Sandoval, a local skate legend and new father, as his endless summer finally collides with the future. Set to the alternately roaring and dreamy soundtrack of bands from the indie labels Mexican Summer and Kemado Records-including Best Coast, Bipolar Bear, Children, Dungen, Eddy Current and the Suppression Ring, Golden Triangle, Jacuzzi Boys, Little Girls, Real Estate, The Soft Pack, Saviours, as well as DEATH and Thee Oh Sees -DRAGONSLAYER is a punk-rock manifesto to youth, love and learning to survive after the decline of western civilization.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Direct","by","Tristan","Patterson","and","execut","produc","by","indie-maverick","Christin","Vachon",",","DRAGONSLAYER","is","the","Grand","Juri","Prize","winner","for","Best","Documentari","Featur","at","SXSW","2011",",","and","is","the","second","featur","to","be","releas","theatric","by","Drag","Citi","follow","Harmoni","Korin","'s","Trash","Humper",".","DRAGONSLAYER","document","the","transgress","of","a","lost","skate","punk","fall","in","love","in","the","stagnant","suburb","of","Fullerton",",","California","in","the","aftermath","of","America","'s","econom","collaps",".","Take","the","viewer","through","a","golden","SoCal","haze","of","broken","home",",","abandon","swim","pool","and","stray","glimps","of","unusu","beauti",",","DRAGONSLAYER","captur","the","life","and","time","of","Josh","\"","Skreech","\"","Sandov",",","a","local","skate","legend","and","new","father",",","as","his","endless","summer","final","collid","with","the","futur",".","Set","to","the","altern","roar","and","dreami","soundtrack","of","band","from","the","indi","label","Mexican","Summer","and","Kemado","Records-includ","Best","Coast",",","Bipolar","Bear",",","Children",",","Dungen",",","Eddi","Current","and","the","Suppress","Ring",",","Golden","Triangl",",","Jacuzzi","Boy",",","Littl","Girl",",","Real","Estate",",","The","Soft","Pack",",","Saviour",",","as","well","as","DEATH","and","Thee","Oh","See","-","DRAGONSLAYER","is","a","punk-rock","manifesto","to","youth",",","love","and","learn","to","surviv","after","the","declin","of","western","civil","."],"lemmas":["Directed","by","Tristan","Patterson","and","executive","produce","by","indie-maverick","Christine","Vachon",",","DRAGONSLAYER","be","the","Grand","Jury","Prize","winner","for","best","Documentary","Feature","at","SXSW","2011",",","and","be","the","second","feature","to","be","release","theatrically","by","Drag","City","follow","Harmony","Korine","'s","Trash","Humpers",".","DRAGONSLAYER","document","the","transgression","of","a","lose","skate","punk","fall","in","love","in","the","stagnant","suburb","of","Fullerton",",","California","in","the","aftermath","of","America","'s","economic","collapse",".","take","the","viewer","through","a","golden","socal","haze","of","broken","home",",","abandoned","swimming","pool","and","stray","glimpse","of","unusual","beauty",",","dragonslayer","capture","the","life","and","time","of","Josh","``","Skreech","''","Sandoval",",","a","local","skate","legend","and","new","father",",","as","he","endless","summer","finally","collide","with","the","future",".","set","to","the","alternately","roar","and","dreamy","soundtrack","of","band","from","the","indie","label","Mexican","Summer","and","Kemado","records-including","best","Coast",",","Bipolar","Bear",",","Children",",","Dungen",",","Eddy","Current","and","the","suppression","ring",",","Golden","Triangle",",","jacuzzi","boy",",","little","girl",",","Real","Estate",",","The","Soft","pack",",","Saviours",",","as","well","as","DEATH","and","Thee","oh","see","-","dragonslayer","be","a","punk-rock","manifesto","to","youth",",","love","and","learning","to","survive","after","the","decline","of","western","civilization","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Directed

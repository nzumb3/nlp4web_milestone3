This brings her to the darker side of Boston, where her real mother is a well-known nightclub singer. Like Orpheus, Scarlet faces dangerous tests before she is able to face her mother. In one way or another, every major character is the film is chasing a rainbow.","genres":["Drama"," Musical"],"stems":["Chase","Rainbow","is","in","the","tradit","of","New","York",",","New","York",";","Cabaret",";","and","West","Side","Stori",".","But","it","deeper","influenc","come","from","Orpheus","by","Claudio","Monteverdi",",","which","is","consid","to","be","the","first","opera","in","music","histori",".","In","the","opera",",","Orpheus","descend","into","Hade","to","save","his","wife","and","bring","her","back","to","life",".","In","Chase","Rainbow",",","a","girl","(","Scarlet",")","find","she","was","adopt","and","goe","on","a","search","for","her","parent",".","This","bring","her","to","the","darker","side","of","Boston",",","where","her","real","mother","is","a","well-known","nightclub","singer",".","Like","Orpheus",",","Scarlet","face","danger","test","befor","she","is","abl","to","face","her","mother",".","In","one","way","or","anoth",",","everi","major","charact","is","the","film","is","chase","a","rainbow","."],"lemmas":["chase","rainbow","be","in","the","tradition","of","New","York",",","New","York",";","Cabaret",";","and","West","Side","Story",".","but","its","deeper","influence","come","from","Orpheus","by","Claudio","Monteverdi",",","which","be","consider","to","be","the","first","opera","in","music","history",".","in","the","opera",",","Orpheus","descend","into","Hades","to","save","he","wife","and","bring","she","back","to","life",".","in","Chasing","Rainbows",",","a","girl","-lrb-","scarlet","-rrb-","find","she","be","adopt","and","go","on","a","search","for","she","parent",".","this","bring","she","to","the","darker","side","of","Boston",",","where","she","real","mother","be","a","well-known","nightclub","singer",".","like","Orpheus",",","scarlet","face","dangerous","test","before","she","be","able","to","face","she","mother",".","in","one","way","or","another",",","every","major","character","be","the","film","be","chase","a","rainbow","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Chasing Rainbows is","Rainbows is in","is in the","in the tradition","the tradition of","tradition of New","of New York","New York ,","York , New",", New York","New York ;","York ;

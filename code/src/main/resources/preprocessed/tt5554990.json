{"title":"Rollercoaster Love","plot":"Certain stories are damn true and love is damn unstable: suddenly it brings you up and then it throws you down at the same speed, slamming you around, makes you want to scream, shaking your stomach... However, you want to try again. Like those tangles of iron, bolts and rails that we call roller coasters, for which we go along sometimes mileage queues. The parallelism between schizophrenia of love and iconic attractions from amusement parks is quite obvious: Rollercoaster Love is about that and the seemingly endless queue crossed by David, yet tried by his \"last ride\", before returning up on a roller coaster ride.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Certain","stori","are","damn","true","and","love","is","damn","unstabl",":","sudden","it","bring","you","up","and","then","it","throw","you","down","at","the","same","speed",",","slam","you","around",",","make","you","want","to","scream",",","shake","your","stomach","...","Howev",",","you","want","to","tri","again",".","Like","those","tangl","of","iron",",","bolt","and","rail","that","we","call","roller","coaster",",","for","which","we","go","along","sometim","mileag","queue",".","The","parallel","between","schizophrenia","of","love","and","icon","attract","from","amus","park","is","quit","obvious",":","Rollercoast","Love","is","about","that","and","the","seem","endless","queue","cross","by","David",",","yet","tri","by","his","\"","last","ride","\"",",","befor","return","up","on","a","roller","coaster","ride","."],"lemmas":["certain","story","be","damn","true","and","love","be","damn","unstable",":","suddenly","it","bring","you","up","and","then","it","throw","you","down","at","the","same","speed",",","slam","you","around",",","make","you","want","to","scream",",","shake","you","stomach","...","however",",","you","want","to","try","again",".","like","those","tangle","of","iron",",","bolt","and","rail","that","we","call","roller","coaster",",","for","which","we","go","along","sometimes","mileage","queue",".","the","parallelism","between","schizophrenia","of","love","and","iconic","attraction","from","amusement","park","be","quite","obvious",":","Rollercoaster","Love","be","about","that","and","the","seemingly","endless","queue","cross","by","David",",","yet","try","by","he","``","last","ride","''",",","before","return","up","on","a","roller","coaster","ride","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Certain stories are","stories are damn","are damn true","damn true and","true and love","and love is","love is damn","is damn unstable","damn unstable :","unstable : suddenly",": suddenly it","suddenly it brings","it brings you","brings you up","you up and","up and then","and then it","then it throws","it throws you","throws you down","you down at","down at the","at the same","the same speed","same speed ,","speed , slamming",", slamming you","slamming you around","you around ,","around , makes",", makes you","makes you want","you want to","want to scream","to scream ,","scream , shaking",", shaking your","shaking your stomach","your stomach ...","stomach ...

{"title":"Botched","plot":"Ritchie Donovan is a professional thief whose luck has just run out. The only survivor from a heist that goes terribly wrong, Ritchie is forced to take the rap and is sent to Russia to steal a priceless antique cross locked in a safe on the penthouse floor of a Moscow skyscraper. Things start badly and go rapidly downhill when, during the robbery, Ritchie and his Russian accomplices are forced to take hostages because they are trapped by the police on the unused 13th floor.","genres":["Comedy"," Horror"],"stems":["Ritchi","Donovan","is","a","profession","thief","whose","luck","has","just","run","out",".","The","onli","survivor","from","a","heist","that","goe","terribl","wrong",",","Ritchi","is","forc","to","take","the","rap","and","is","sent","to","Russia","to","steal","a","priceless","antiqu","cross","lock","in","a","safe","on","the","penthous","floor","of","a","Moscow","skyscrap",".","Thing","start","bad","and","go","rapid","downhil","when",",","dure","the","robberi",",","Ritchi","and","his","Russian","accomplic","are","forc","to","take","hostag","becaus","they","are","trap","by","the","polic","on","the","unus","13th","floor","."],"lemmas":["Ritchie","Donovan","be","a","professional","thief","whose","luck","have","just","run","out",".","the","only","survivor","from","a","heist","that","go","terribly","wrong",",","Ritchie","be","force","to","take","the","rap","and","be","send","to","Russia","to","steal","a","priceless","antique","cross","lock","in","a","safe","on","the","penthouse","floor","of","a","Moscow","skyscraper",".","thing","start","badly","and","go","rapidly","downhill","when",",","during","the","robbery",",","Ritchie","and","he","russian","accomplice","be","force","to","take","hostage","because","they","be","trap","by","the","police","on","the","unused","13th","floor","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Ritchie Donovan is","Donovan is a","is a professional","a professional thief","professional thief whose","thief whose luck","whose luck has","luck has just","has just run","just run out","The only survivor","only survivor from","survivor from a","from a heist","a heist that","heist that goes","that goes terribly","goes terribly wrong","terribly wrong ,","wrong , Ritchie",", Ritchie is","Ritchie is forced","is forced to","forced to take","to take the","take the rap","the rap and","rap and is","and is sent","is sent to","sent to Russia","to Russia to","Russia to steal","to steal a","steal a priceless","a priceless antique","priceless antique cross","antique cross locked","cross locked in","locked in a","in a safe","a safe on","safe on the","on the penthouse","the penthouse floor","penthouse floor of","floor of a","of a Moscow","a Moscow skyscraper","Things start badly","start badly and","badly and go","and go rapidly","go rapidly downhill","rapidly downhill when","downhill when ,","when , during",", during the","during the robbery","the robbery ,","robbery , Ritchie",", Ritchie and","Ritchie and his","and his Russian","his Russian accomplices","Russian accomplices are","accomplices are forced","are forced to","forced to take","to take hostages","take hostages because","hostages because they","because they are","they are trapped","are trapped by","trapped by the","by the police","the police on","police on the","on the unused","the unused 13th","unused 13th floor"],"2grams":["Ritchie Donovan","Donovan is","is a","a professional","professional thief","thief whose","whose luck","luck has","has just","just run","run out","The only","only survivor","survivor from","from a","a heist","heist that","that goes","goes terribly","terribly wrong","wrong ,",", Ritchie","Ritchie is","is forced","forced to","to take","take the","the rap","rap and","and is","is sent","sent to","to Russia","Russia to","to steal","steal a","a priceless","priceless antique","antique cross","cross locked","locked in","in a","a safe","safe on","on the","the penthouse","penthouse floor","floor of","of a","a Moscow","Moscow skyscraper","Things start","start badly","badly and","and go","go rapidly","rapidly downhill","downhill when","when ,",", during","during the","the robbery","robbery ,",", Ritchie","Ritchie and","and his","his Russian","Russian accomplices","accomplices are","are forced","forced to","to take","take hostages","hostages because","because they","they are","are trapped","trapped by","by the","the police","police on","on the","the unused","unused 13th","13th floor"]}

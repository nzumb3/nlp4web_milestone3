After years of following other people's journey's he decided to paddle the length of the Missouri River on a stand up paddleboard. There seemed no better way to travel than by water and no better river to navigate. The dream couldn't be ignored so in the spring of 2013 he quit his job in the financial district of Chicago, built a wooden paddleboard and headed west to Three Forks, Montana to set out on a journey of a lifetime.

{"title":"Dead End","plot":"For the past 20 years, Frank Harrington has grudgingly driven his family to celebrate Christmas with his mother-in-law. This year, he takes a shortcut. It's the biggest mistake of his life: The nightmare begins. A mysterious woman in white wanders through the forest, leaving death in her wake. A terrifying black car - its driver invisible - carries the victims into the heart of the night. Every road sign points to a destination they never reach. The survivors succumb to panic, to madness; deeply buried secrets burst to the surface, and Christmas turns into a living hell.","genres":["Adventure"," Mystery"," Horror"],"stems":["For","the","past","20","year",",","Frank","Harrington","has","grudg","driven","his","famili","to","celebr","Christma","with","his","mother-in-law",".","This","year",",","he","take","a","shortcut",".","It","'s","the","biggest","mistak","of","his","life",":","The","nightmar","begin",".","A","mysteri","woman","in","white","wander","through","the","forest",",","leav","death","in","her","wake",".","A","terrifi","black","car","-","it","driver","invis","-","carri","the","victim","into","the","heart","of","the","night",".","Everi","road","sign","point","to","a","destin","they","never","reach",".","The","survivor","succumb","to","panic",",","to","mad",";","deepli","buri","secret","burst","to","the","surfac",",","and","Christma","turn","into","a","live","hell","."],"lemmas":["for","the","past","20","year",",","Frank","Harrington","have","grudgingly","drive","he","family","to","celebrate","Christmas","with","he","mother-in-law",".","this","year",",","he","take","a","shortcut",".","it","be","the","biggest","mistake","of","he","life",":","the","nightmare","begin",".","a","mysterious","woman","in","white","wander","through","the","forest",",","leave","death","in","she","wake",".","a","terrifying","black","car","-","its","driver","invisible","-","carry","the","victim","into","the","heart","of","the","night",".","every","road","sign","point","to","a","destination","they","never","reach",".","the","survivor","succumb","to","panic",",","to","madness",";","deeply","bury","secret","burst","to","the","surface",",","and","Christmas","turn","into","a","live","hell","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["For the past","the past 20","past 20 years","20 years ,","years , Frank",", Frank Harrington","Frank Harrington has","Harrington has grudgingly","has grudgingly driven","grudgingly driven his","driven his family","his family to","family to celebrate","to celebrate Christmas","celebrate Christmas with","Christmas with his","with his mother-in-law","This year ,","year , he",", he takes","he takes a","takes a shortcut","It 's the","'s the biggest","the biggest mistake","biggest mistake of","mistake of his","of his life","his life :","life : The",": The nightmare","The nightmare begins","A mysterious woman","mysterious woman in","woman in white","in white wanders","white wanders through","wanders through the","through the forest","the forest ,","forest , leaving",", leaving death","leaving death in","death in her","in her wake","A terrifying black","terrifying black car","black car -","car - its","- its driver","its driver invisible","driver invisible -","invisible - carries","- carries the","carries the victims","the victims into","victims into the","into the heart","the heart of","heart of the","of the night","Every road sign","road sign points","sign points to","points to a","to a destination","a destination they","destination they never","they never reach","The survivors succumb","survivors succumb to","succumb to panic","to panic ,","panic , to",", to madness","to madness ;","madness ; deeply","; deeply buried","deeply buried secrets","buried secrets burst","secrets burst to","burst to the","to the surface","the surface ,","surface , and",", and Christmas","and Christmas turns","Christmas turns into","turns into a","into a living","a living hell"],"2grams":["For the","the past","past 20","20 years","years ,",", Frank","Frank Harrington","Harrington has","has grudgingly","grudgingly driven","driven his","his family","family to","to celebrate","celebrate Christmas","Christmas with","with his","his mother-in-law","This year","year ,",", he","he takes","takes a","a shortcut","It 's","'s the","the biggest","biggest mistake","mistake of","of his","his life","life :",": The","The nightmare","nightmare begins","A mysterious","mysterious woman","woman in","in white","white wanders","wanders through","through the","the forest","forest ,",", leaving","leaving death","death in","in her","her wake","A terrifying","terrifying black","black car","car -","- its","its driver","driver invisible","invisible -","- carries","carries the","the victims","victims into","into the","the heart","heart of","of the","the night","Every road","road sign","sign points","points to","to a","a destination","destination they","they never","never reach","The survivors","survivors succumb","succumb to","to panic","panic ,",", to","to madness","madness ;","; deeply","deeply buried","buried secrets","secrets burst","burst to","to the","the surface","surface ,",", and","and Christmas","Christmas turns","turns into","into a","a living","living hell"]}

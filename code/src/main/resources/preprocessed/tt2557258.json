{"title":"The White Room","plot":"In a world of mounting uncertainty obsessed with knowing the future, we find Alberto (Óscar Jaenada), a Colombian immigrant working as a massage therapist in London. With the looming mayoral election bringing seething ethnic tensions to the boil, Alberto - mild mannered, almost shy - blends into the multicultural city. He came to Britain to pay for his mother's operation back home, but the streets of London are not paved with gold, and he finds himself trapped in a vicious circle. Fervently religious, living in hiding, and tortured by visions from his past, he becomes convinced that God has a destiny marked out for him. This is a taught, poignant, East London-based thriller with a captivating supernatural twist.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["In","a","world","of","mount","uncertainti","obsess","with","know","the","futur",",","we","find","Alberto","(","Óscar","Jaenada",")",",","a","Colombian","immigr","work","as","a","massag","therapist","in","London",".","With","the","loom","mayor","elect","bring","seeth","ethnic","tension","to","the","boil",",","Alberto","-","mild","manner",",","almost","shi","-","blend","into","the","multicultur","citi",".","He","came","to","Britain","to","pay","for","his","mother","'s","oper","back","home",",","but","the","street","of","London","are","not","pave","with","gold",",","and","he","find","himself","trap","in","a","vicious","circl",".","Fervent","religi",",","live","in","hide",",","and","tortur","by","vision","from","his","past",",","he","becom","convinc","that","God","has","a","destini","mark","out","for","him",".","This","is","a","taught",",","poignant",",","East","London-bas","thriller","with","a","captiv","supernatur","twist","."],"lemmas":["in","a","world","of","mount","uncertainty","obsess","with","know","the","future",",","we","find","Alberto","-lrb-","Óscar","Jaenada","-rrb-",",","a","colombian","immigrant","working","as","a","massage","therapist","in","London",".","with","the","loom","mayoral","election","bring","seething","ethnic","tension","to","the","boil",",","Alberto","-","mild","mannered",",","almost","shy","-","blend","into","the","multicultural","city",".","he","come","to","Britain","to","pay","for","he","mother","'s","operation","back","home",",","but","the","street","of","London","be","not","pave","with","gold",",","and","he","find","himself","trap","in","a","vicious","circle",".","fervently","religious",",","live","in","hiding",",","and","tortured","by","vision","from","he","past",",","he","become","convinced","that","God","have","a","destiny","mark","out","for","he",".","this","be","a","teach",",","poignant",",","east","london-based","thriller","with","a","captivating","supernatural","twist","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In a world","a world of","world of mounting","of mounting uncertainty","mounting uncertainty obsessed","uncertainty obsessed with","obsessed with knowing","with knowing the","knowing the future","the future ,","future , we",", we find","we find Alberto","find Alberto (","Alberto ( Óscar","( Óscar Jaenada","Óscar Jaenada )","Jaenada ) ,",") , a",", a Colombian","a Colombian immigrant","Colombian immigrant working","immigrant working as","working as a","as a massage","a massage therapist","massage therapist in","therapist in London","With the looming","the looming mayoral","looming mayoral election","mayoral election bringing","election bringing seething","bringing seething ethnic","seething ethnic tensions","ethnic tensions to","tensions to the","to the boil","the boil ,","boil , Alberto",", Alberto -","Alberto -

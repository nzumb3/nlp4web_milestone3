{"title":"Mr. Robin kkosigi","plot":"Korean Kim Min-june, while pondering over her recent break-up, bumps her car into American businessman Robin Heiden, who, as luck would have it, is her new boss. Unknowingly she pretends to not speak English, thinking this would be the last she would see of him. Robin Heiden has come to Korea to take over a company and she is convinced that he hates her. Between the obvious sparks, we see a bet emerge, where Min-june dares herself to seduce him and make him apologize for his behavior. Will she succeed in seducing him or will she once again get her heart broken?","genres":["Romance"],"stems":["Korean","Kim","Min-jun",",","while","ponder","over","her","recent","break-up",",","bump","her","car","into","American","businessman","Robin","Heiden",",","who",",","as","luck","would","have","it",",","is","her","new","boss",".","Unknow","she","pretend","to","not","speak","English",",","think","this","would","be","the","last","she","would","see","of","him",".","Robin","Heiden","has","come","to","Korea","to","take","over","a","compani","and","she","is","convinc","that","he","hate","her",".","Between","the","obvious","spark",",","we","see","a","bet","emerg",",","where","Min-jun","dare","herself","to","seduc","him","and","make","him","apolog","for","his","behavior",".","Will","she","succeed","in","seduc","him","or","will","she","onc","again","get","her","heart","broken","?"],"lemmas":["Korean","Kim","Min-june",",","while","ponder","over","she","recent","break-up",",","bump","she","car","into","american","businessman","Robin","Heiden",",","who",",","as","luck","would","have","it",",","be","she","new","boss",".","unknowingly","she","pretend","to","not","speak","English",",","think","this","would","be","the","last","she","would","see","of","he",".","Robin","Heiden","have","come","to","Korea","to","take","over","a","company","and","she","be","convinced","that","he","hate","she",".","between","the","obvious","spark",",","we","see","a","bet","emerge",",","where","min-june","dare","herself","to","seduce","he","and","make","he","apologize","for","he","behavior",".","will","she","succeed","in","seduce","he","or","will","she","once","again","get","she","heart","break","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Korean Kim Min-june","Kim Min-june ,","Min-june , while",", while pondering","while pondering over","pondering over her","over her recent","her recent break-up","recent break-up ,","break-up , bumps",", bumps her","bumps her car","her car into","car into American","into American businessman","American businessman Robin","businessman Robin Heiden","Robin Heiden ,","Heiden , who",", who ,","who , as",", as luck","as luck would","luck would have","would have it","have it ,","it , is",", is her","is her new","her new boss","Unknowingly she pretends","she pretends to","pretends to not","to not speak","not speak English","speak English ,","English , thinking",", thinking this","thinking this would","this would be","would be the","be the last","the last she","last she would","she would see","would see of","see of him","Robin Heiden has","Heiden has come","has come to","come to Korea","to Korea to","Korea to take","to take over","take over a","over a company","a company and","company and she","and she is","she is convinced","is convinced that","convinced that he","that he hates","he hates her","Between the obvious","the obvious sparks","obvious sparks ,","sparks , we",", we see","we see a","see a bet","a bet emerge","bet emerge ,","emerge , where",", where Min-june","where Min-june dares","Min-june dares herself","dares herself to","herself to seduce","to seduce him","seduce him and","him and make","and make him","make him apologize","him apologize for","apologize for his","for his behavior","Will she succeed","she succeed in","succeed in seducing","in seducing him","seducing him or","him or will","or will she","will she once","she once again","once again get","again get her","get her heart","her heart broken"],"2grams":["Korean Kim","Kim Min-june","Min-june ,",", while","while pondering","pondering over","over her","her recent","recent break-up","break-up ,",", bumps","bumps her","her car","car into","into American","American businessman","businessman Robin","Robin Heiden","Heiden ,",", who","who ,",", as","as luck","luck would","would have","have it","it ,",", is","is her","her new","new boss","Unknowingly she","she pretends","pretends to","to not","not speak","speak English","English ,",", thinking","thinking this","this would","would be","be the","the last","last she","she would","would see","see of","of him","Robin Heiden","Heiden has","has come","come to","to Korea","Korea to","to take","take over","over a","a company","company and","and she","she is","is convinced","convinced that","that he","he hates","hates her","Between the","the obvious","obvious sparks","sparks ,",", we","we see","see a","a bet","bet emerge","emerge ,",", where","where Min-june","Min-june dares","dares herself","herself to","to seduce","seduce him","him and","and make","make him","him apologize","apologize for","for his","his behavior","Will she","she succeed","succeed in","in seducing","seducing him","him or","or will","will she","she once","once again","again get","get her","her heart","heart broken"]}

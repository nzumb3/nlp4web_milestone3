{"title":"Domestic Differences","plot":"Beginning with an April 1994 address by Nelson Mandela the week prior to the first democratic elections in South Africa, this documentary takes an intimate look at the lives of an affluent white family, the Silbermans, and their live-in black domestic employee, Frances Mncam. The personal portraits are combined with an examination of the effects of the pending historic general election. A brief discussion of the political parties in the election, and the political climate in general, is included, but the focus is on the personal lives and opinions.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Begin","with","an","April","1994","address","by","Nelson","Mandela","the","week","prior","to","the","first","democrat","elect","in","South","Africa",",","this","documentari","take","an","intim","look","at","the","live","of","an","affluent","white","famili",",","the","Silberman",",","and","their","live-in","black","domest","employe",",","Franc","Mncam",".","The","person","portrait","are","combin","with","an","examin","of","the","effect","of","the","pend","histor","general","elect",".","A","brief","discuss","of","the","polit","parti","in","the","elect",",","and","the","polit","climat","in","general",",","is","includ",",","but","the","focus","is","on","the","person","live","and","opinion","."],"lemmas":["begin","with","a","April","1994","address","by","Nelson","Mandela","the","week","prior","to","the","first","democratic","election","in","South","Africa",",","this","documentary","take","a","intimate","look","at","the","life","of","a","affluent","white","family",",","the","Silbermans",",","and","they","live-in","black","domestic","employee",",","Frances","Mncam",".","the","personal","portrait","be","combine","with","a","examination","of","the","effect","of","the","pend","historic","general","election",".","a","brief","discussion","of","the","political","party","in","the","election",",","and","the","political","climate","in","general",",","be","include",",","but","the","focus","be","on","the","personal","life","and","opinion","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Beginning with an","with an April","an April 1994","April 1994 address","1994 address by","address by Nelson","by Nelson Mandela","Nelson Mandela the","Mandela the week","the week prior","week prior to","prior to the","to the first","the first democratic","first democratic elections","democratic elections in","elections in South","in South Africa","South Africa ,","Africa , this",", this documentary","this documentary takes","documentary takes an","takes an intimate","an intimate look","intimate look at","look at the","at the lives","the lives of","lives of an","of an affluent","an affluent white","affluent white family","white family ,","family , the",", the Silbermans","the Silbermans ,","Silbermans , and",", and their","and their live-in","their live-in black","live-in black domestic","black domestic employee","domestic employee ,","employee , Frances",", Frances Mncam","The personal portraits","personal portraits are","portraits are combined","are combined with","combined with an","with an examination","an examination of","examination of the","of the effects","the effects of","effects of the","of the pending","the pending historic","pending historic general","historic general election","A brief discussion","brief discussion of","discussion of the","of the political","the political parties","political parties in","parties in the","in the election","the election ,","election , and",", and the","and the political","the political climate","political climate in","climate in general","in general ,","general , is",", is included","is included ,","included , but",", but the","but the focus","the focus is","focus is on","is on the","on the personal","the personal lives","personal lives and","lives and opinions"],"2grams":["Beginning with","with an","an April","April 1994","1994 address","address by","by Nelson","Nelson Mandela","Mandela the","the week","week prior","prior to","to the","the first","first democratic","democratic elections","elections in","in South","South Africa","Africa ,",", this","this documentary","documentary takes","takes an","an intimate","intimate look","look at","at the","the lives","lives of","of an","an affluent","affluent white","white family","family ,",", the","the Silbermans","Silbermans ,",", and","and their","their live-in","live-in black","black domestic","domestic employee","employee ,",", Frances","Frances Mncam","The personal","personal portraits","portraits are","are combined","combined with","with an","an examination","examination of","of the","the effects","effects of","of the","the pending","pending historic","historic general","general election","A brief","brief discussion","discussion of","of the","the political","political parties","parties in","in the","the election","election ,",", and","and the","the political","political climate","climate in","in general","general ,",", is","is included","included ,",", but","but the","the focus","focus is","is on","on the","the personal","personal lives","lives and","and opinions"]}

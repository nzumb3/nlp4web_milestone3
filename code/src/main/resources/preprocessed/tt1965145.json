{"title":"Teneriffa EXIT","plot":"You don't play with crocodiles. Two people on a stroll at the end of an night, at the end of the Berlin myth of Prenzlauer Berg: they are sexy, they are young, they are forlorn. It could be a wild summer. There will be two happy days in Berlin. The movie tells the tale of a place, the tale of a love, the tale of longing for a new beginning. More than an extraordinary independent movie, a universal big-city novel which could, without that affectionate local color, take place in every metropolis. Exodus or exitus: 'Tenerife EXIT' plays between and with them both.","genres":["Drama"," Romance"],"stems":["You","do","n't","play","with","crocodil",".","Two","peopl","on","a","stroll","at","the","end","of","an","night",",","at","the","end","of","the","Berlin","myth","of","Prenzlauer","Berg",":","they","are","sexi",",","they","are","young",",","they","are","forlorn",".","It","could","be","a","wild","summer",".","There","will","be","two","happi","day","in","Berlin",".","The","movi","tell","the","tale","of","a","place",",","the","tale","of","a","love",",","the","tale","of","long","for","a","new","begin",".","More","than","an","extraordinari","independ","movi",",","a","univers","big-citi","novel","which","could",",","without","that","affection","local","color",",","take","place","in","everi","metropoli",".","Exodus","or","exitus",":","'","Tenerif","EXIT","'","play","between","and","with","them","both","."],"lemmas":["you","do","not","play","with","crocodile",".","two","people","on","a","stroll","at","the","end","of","a","night",",","at","the","end","of","the","Berlin","myth","of","Prenzlauer","Berg",":","they","be","sexy",",","they","be","young",",","they","be","forlorn",".","it","could","be","a","wild","summer",".","there","will","be","two","happy","day","in","Berlin",".","the","movie","tell","the","tale","of","a","place",",","the","tale","of","a","love",",","the","tale","of","longing","for","a","new","beginning",".","more","than","a","extraordinary","independent","movie",",","a","universal","big-city","novel","which","could",",","without","that","affectionate","local","color",",","take","place","in","every","metropolis",".","Exodus","or","exitus",":","'","Tenerife","EXIT","'","play","between","and","with","they","both","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["You do n't","do n't play","n't play with","play with crocodiles","Two people on","people on a","on a stroll","a stroll at","stroll at the","at the end","the end of","end of an","of an night","an night ,","night , at",", at the","at the end","the end of","end of the","of the Berlin","the Berlin myth","Berlin myth of","myth of Prenzlauer","of Prenzlauer Berg","Prenzlauer Berg :","Berg : they",": they are","they are sexy","are sexy ,","sexy , they",", they are","they are young","are young ,","young , they",", they are","they are forlorn","It could be","could be a","be a wild","a wild summer","There will be","will be two","be two happy","two happy days","happy days in","days in Berlin","The movie tells","movie tells the","tells the tale","the tale of","tale of a","of a place","a place ,","place , the",", the tale","the tale of","tale of a","of a love","a love ,","love , the",", the tale","the tale of","tale of longing","of longing for","longing for a","for a new","a new beginning","More than an","than an extraordinary","an extraordinary independent","extraordinary independent movie","independent movie ,","movie , a",", a universal","a universal big-city","universal big-city novel","big-city novel which","novel which could","which could ,","could , without",", without that","without that affectionate","that affectionate local","affectionate local color","local color ,","color , take",", take place","take place in","place in every","in every metropolis","Exodus or exitus","or exitus :","exitus : '",": ' Tenerife","' Tenerife EXIT","Tenerife EXIT '","EXIT ' plays","' plays between","plays between and","between and with","and with them","with them both"],"2grams":["You do","do n't","n't play","play with","with crocodiles","Two people","people on","on a","a stroll","stroll at","at the","the end","end of","of an","an night","night ,",", at","at the","the end","end of","of the","the Berlin","Berlin myth","myth of","of Prenzlauer","Prenzlauer Berg","Berg :",": they","they are","are sexy","sexy ,",", they","they are","are young","young ,",", they","they are","are forlorn","It could","could be","be a","a wild","wild summer","There will","will be","be two","two happy","happy days","days in","in Berlin","The movie","movie tells","tells the","the tale","tale of","of a","a place","place ,",", the","the tale","tale of","of a","a love","love ,",", the","the tale","tale of","of longing","longing for","for a","a new","new beginning","More than","than an","an extraordinary","extraordinary independent","independent movie","movie ,",", a","a universal","universal big-city","big-city novel","novel which","which could","could ,",", without","without that","that affectionate","affectionate local","local color","color ,",", take","take place","place in","in every","every metropolis","Exodus or","or exitus","exitus :",": '","' Tenerife","Tenerife EXIT","EXIT '","' plays","plays between","between and","and with","with them","them both"]}

{"title":"Trucker","plot":"Diane's free-wheeling life of drunken one-night-stands as a professional trucker hits a road block when Peter, her son, is dropped at her doorstep. Her former husband Len, whom she abandoned eleven years ago along with their new-born son, has cancer and no one else to turn to while he's in the hospital. Peter, resentful and wary, wants, even needs a mother who'll want him at this worrisome time but knows better than to expect this from Diane. With deliveries waiting and a mortgage to be paid, there's only one inevitable thing ahead for Diane and Peter - a road trip together.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Dian","'s","free-wheel","life","of","drunken","one-night-stand","as","a","profession","trucker","hit","a","road","block","when","Peter",",","her","son",",","is","drop","at","her","doorstep",".","Her","former","husband","Len",",","whom","she","abandon","eleven","year","ago","along","with","their","new-born","son",",","has","cancer","and","no","one","els","to","turn","to","while","he","'s","in","the","hospit",".","Peter",",","resent","and","wari",",","want",",","even","need","a","mother","who","ll","want","him","at","this","worrisom","time","but","know","better","than","to","expect","this","from","Dian",".","With","deliveri","wait","and","a","mortgag","to","be","paid",",","there","'s","onli","one","inevit","thing","ahead","for","Dian","and","Peter","-","a","road","trip","togeth","."],"lemmas":["Diane","'s","free-wheeling","life","of","drunken","one-night-stand","as","a","professional","trucker","hit","a","road","block","when","Peter",",","she","son",",","be","drop","at","she","doorstep",".","she","former","husband","Len",",","whom","she","abandon","eleven","year","ago","along","with","they","new-born","son",",","have","cancer","and","no","one","else","to","turn","to","while","he","be","in","the","hospital",".","Peter",",","resentful","and","wary",",","want",",","even","need","a","mother","who","will","want","he","at","this","worrisome","time","but","know","better","than","to","expect","this","from","Diane",".","with","delivery","wait","and","a","mortgage","to","be","pay",",","there","be","only","one","inevitable","thing","ahead","for","Diane","and","Peter","-","a","road","trip","together","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Diane 's free-wheeling","'s free-wheeling life","free-wheeling life of","life of drunken","of drunken one-night-stands","drunken one-night-stands as","one-night-stands as a","as a professional","a professional trucker","professional trucker hits","trucker hits a","hits a road","a road block","road block when","block when Peter","when Peter ,","Peter , her",", her son","her son ,","son , is",", is dropped","is dropped at","dropped at her","at her doorstep","Her former husband","former husband Len","husband Len ,","Len , whom",", whom she","whom she abandoned","she abandoned eleven","abandoned eleven years","eleven years ago","years ago along","ago along with","along with their","with their new-born","their new-born son","new-born son ,","son , has",", has cancer","has cancer and","cancer and no","and no one","no one else","one else to","else to turn","to turn to","turn to while","to while he","while he 's","he 's in","'s in the","in the hospital","Peter , resentful",", resentful and","resentful and wary","and wary ,","wary , wants",", wants ,","wants , even",", even needs","even needs a","needs a mother","a mother who","mother who 'll","who 'll want","'ll want him","want him at","him at this","at this worrisome","this worrisome time","worrisome time but","time but knows","but knows better","knows better than","better than to","than to expect","to expect this","expect this from","this from Diane","With deliveries waiting","deliveries waiting and","waiting and a","and a mortgage","a mortgage to","mortgage to be","to be paid","be paid ,","paid , there",", there 's","there 's only","'s only one","only one inevitable","one inevitable thing","inevitable thing ahead","thing ahead for","ahead for Diane","for Diane and","Diane and Peter","and Peter -","Peter -

{"title":"Ride Crazy: The Single Man March","plot":"'Ride Crazy: The Single Man March' is a documentary that follows Camilo Atehortua, a Marine who served for seven months in Iraq and suffers from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, on a 520 mile pilgrimage to the Iwo Jima Memorial. The entire trip is done on his bicycle. The entire trip is done alone. He encounters many obstacles along the way, including a brutal Nor'easter and he gives us a first-hand look at the devastation caused by Hurricane Sandy. Set to a vibrant soundtrack by The Electrical Fire, 'The Single Man March' is a very real display of courage and strength, as nothing will stop Camilo from completing his ride and making his brothers and sisters in the USMC proud.","genres":["Adventure"," Music","

{"title":"Blind Spot: Moments Unseen","plot":"Blind Spot follows the epic journey of three visually-impaired adventurers who cross the Argentinean Andes by horseback. Set against the sweeping mountain vistas of Patagonian wilderness, Blind Spot challenges the conventional perception of blindness by awakening our senses to the overlooked. Blind Spot takes us on a horse-powered road-trip of self-discovery, new found perspective and personal triumph; because there is more to seeing than sight.","genres":["Adventure"," Documentary"],"stems":["Blind","Spot","follow","the","epic","journey","of","three","visually-impair","adventur","who","cross","the","Argentinean","Andes","by","horseback",".","Set","against","the","sweep","mountain","vista","of","Patagonian","wilder",",","Blind","Spot","challeng","the","convent","percept","of","blind","by","awaken","our","sens","to","the","overlook",".","Blind","Spot","take","us","on","a","horse-pow","road-trip","of","self-discoveri",",","new","found","perspect","and","person","triumph",";","becaus","there","is","more","to","see","than","sight","."],"lemmas":["Blind","Spot","follow","the","epic","journey","of","three","visually-impaired","adventurer","who","cross","the","argentinean","ande","by","horseback",".","set","against","the","sweeping","mountain","vista","of","patagonian","wilderness",",","Blind","Spot","challenge","the","conventional","perception","of","blindness","by","awaken","we","sens","to","the","overlook",".","Blind","Spot","take","we","on","a","horse-powered","road-trip","of","self-discovery",",","new","find","perspective","and","personal","triumph",";","because","there","be","more","to","see","than","sight","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Blind Spot follows","Spot follows the","follows the epic","the epic journey","epic journey of","journey of three","of three visually-impaired","three visually-impaired adventurers","visually-impaired adventurers who","adventurers who cross","who cross the","cross the Argentinean","the Argentinean Andes","Argentinean Andes by","Andes by horseback","Set against the","against the sweeping","the sweeping mountain","sweeping mountain vistas","mountain vistas of","vistas of Patagonian","of Patagonian wilderness","Patagonian wilderness ,","wilderness , Blind",", Blind Spot","Blind Spot challenges","Spot challenges the","challenges the conventional","the conventional perception","conventional perception of","perception of blindness","of blindness by","blindness by awakening","by awakening our","awakening our senses","our senses to","senses to the","to the overlooked","Blind Spot takes","Spot takes us","takes us on","us on a","on a horse-powered","a horse-powered road-trip","horse-powered road-trip of","road-trip of self-discovery","of self-discovery ,","self-discovery , new",", new found","new found perspective","found perspective and","perspective and personal","and personal triumph","personal triumph ;","triumph ; because","; because there","because there is","there is more","is more to","more to seeing","to seeing than","seeing than sight"],"2grams":["Blind Spot","Spot follows","follows the","the epic","epic journey","journey of","of three","three visually-impaired","visually-impaired adventurers","adventurers who","who cross","cross the","the Argentinean","Argentinean Andes","Andes by","by horseback","Set against","against the","the sweeping","sweeping mountain","mountain vistas","vistas of","of Patagonian","Patagonian wilderness","wilderness ,",", Blind","Blind Spot","Spot challenges","challenges the","the conventional","conventional perception","perception of","of blindness","blindness by","by awakening","awakening our","our senses","senses to","to the","the overlooked","Blind Spot","Spot takes","takes us","us on","on a","a horse-powered","horse-powered road-trip","road-trip of","of self-discovery","self-discovery ,",", new","new found","found perspective","perspective and","and personal","personal triumph","triumph ;","; because","because there","there is","is more","more to","to seeing","seeing than","than sight"]}

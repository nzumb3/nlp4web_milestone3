{"title":"Reencuentros: 2501 migrantes","plot":"The secluded, mountainous town of Teococuilco is virtually a ghost town. In search of work, 2500 of the town's previous inhabitants have left for other parts of Mexico and the United States. These migrant workers endured torturous days of travel through a barren desert to cross the border and work for years without seeing their loved ones. To honor the mostly overlooked lives of these migrant workers, the renowned Mexican artist Alejandro Santiago spent several years and close to a million dollars to fashion individual clay figures representing the workers. Alejandro hired a team of workers to aid him in the creation of this massive project, and through the sculptures, they honor the migrants who have left Teococuilco. 2501 MIGRANTS: A JOURNEY is a documentary that relates the story of an under-represented people who endure harsh circumstances in the hope of finding a better life on the other side of the border.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","seclud",",","mountain","town","of","Teococuilco","is","virtual","a","ghost","town",".","In","search","of","work",",","2500","of","the","town","'s","previous","inhabit","have","left","for","other","part","of","Mexico","and","the","Unite","State",".","These","migrant","worker","endur","tortur","day","of","travel","through","a","barren","desert","to","cross","the","border","and","work","for","year","without","see","their","love","one",".","To","honor","the","most","overlook","live","of","these","migrant","worker",",","the","renown","Mexican","artist","Alejandro","Santiago","spent","sever","year","and","close","to","a","million","dollar","to","fashion","individu","clay","figur","repres","the","worker",".","Alejandro","hire","a","team","of","worker","to","aid","him","in","the","creation","of","this","massiv","project",",","and","through","the","sculptur",",","they","honor","the","migrant","who","have","left","Teococuilco",".","2501","MIGRANTS",":","A","JOURNEi","is","a","documentari","that","relat","the","stori","of","an","under-repres","peopl","who","endur","harsh","circumst","in","the","hope","of","find","a","better","life","on","the","other","side","of","the","border","."],"lemmas":["the","secluded",",","mountainous","town","of","Teococuilco","be","virtually","a","ghost","town",".","in","search","of","work",",","2500","of","the","town","'s","previous","inhabitant","have","leave","for","other","part","of","Mexico","and","the","United","States",".","these","migrant","worker","endure","torturous","day","of","travel","through","a","barren","desert","to","cross","the","border","and","work","for","year","without","see","they","love","one",".","to","honor","the","mostly","overlook","life","of","these","migrant","worker",",","the","renowned","Mexican","artist","Alejandro","Santiago","spend","several","year","and","close","to","a","million","dollar","to","fashion","individual","clay","figure","represent","the","worker",".","Alejandro","hire","a","team","of","worker","to","aid","he","in","the","creation","of","this","massive","project",",","and","through","the","sculpture",",","they","honor","the","migrant","who","have","leave","Teococuilco",".","2501","MIGRANTS",":","a","journey","be","a","documentary","that","relate","the","story","of","a","under-represented","people","who","endure","harsh","circumstance","in","the","hope","of","find","a","better","life","on","the","other","side","of","the","border","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The

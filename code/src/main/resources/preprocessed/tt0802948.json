{"title":"An American Crime","plot":"Based on a true story that shocked the nation in 1965, the film recounts one of the most shocking crimes ever committed against a single victim. Sylvia and Jennie Fae Likens, the two daughters of traveling carnival workers are left for an extended stay at the Indianapolis home of single mother Gertrude Baniszewski and her six children. Times are tough, and Gertrude's financial needs cause her to make this arrangement before realizing how the burden will push her unstable nature to a breaking point. What transpires in the next three months is both riveting and horrific.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Base","on","a","true","stori","that","shock","the","nation","in","1965",",","the","film","recount","one","of","the","most","shock","crime","ever","commit","against","a","singl","victim",".","Sylvia","and","Jenni","Fae","Liken",",","the","two","daughter","of","travel","carniv","worker","are","left","for","an","extend","stay","at","the","Indianapoli","home","of","singl","mother","Gertrud","Baniszewski","and","her","six","children",".","Time","are","tough",",","and","Gertrud","'s","financi","need","caus","her","to","make","this","arrang","befor","realiz","how","the","burden","will","push","her","unstabl","natur","to","a","break","point",".","What","transpir","in","the","next","three","month","is","both","rivet","and","horrif","."],"lemmas":["base","on","a","true","story","that","shock","the","nation","in","1965",",","the","film","recount","one","of","the","most","shocking","crime","ever","commit","against","a","single","victim",".","Sylvia","and","Jennie","Fae","Likens",",","the","two","daughter","of","travel","carnival","worker","be","leave","for","a","extended","stay","at","the","Indianapolis","home","of","single","mother","Gertrude","Baniszewski","and","she","six","child",".","time","be","tough",",","and","Gertrude","'s","financial","need","cause","she","to","make","this","arrangement","before","realize","how","the","burden","will","push","she","unstable","nature","to","a","breaking","point",".","what","transpire","in","the","next","three","month","be","both","riveting","and","horrific","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Based on a","on a true","a true story","true story that","story that shocked","that shocked the","shocked the nation","the nation in","nation in 1965","in 1965 ,","1965 , the",", the film","the film recounts","film recounts one","recounts one of","one of the","of the most","the most shocking","most shocking crimes","shocking crimes ever","crimes ever committed","ever committed against","committed against a","against a single","a single victim","Sylvia and Jennie","and Jennie Fae","Jennie Fae Likens","Fae Likens ,","Likens , the",", the two","the two daughters","two daughters of","daughters of traveling","of traveling carnival","traveling carnival workers","carnival workers are","workers are left","are left for","left for an","for an extended","an extended stay","extended stay at","stay at the","at the Indianapolis","the Indianapolis home","Indianapolis home of","home of single","of single mother","single mother Gertrude","mother Gertrude Baniszewski","Gertrude Baniszewski and","Baniszewski and her","and her six","her six children","Times are tough","are tough ,","tough , and",", and Gertrude","and Gertrude 's","Gertrude 's financial","'s financial needs","financial needs cause","needs cause her","cause her to","her to make","to make this","make this arrangement","this arrangement before","arrangement before realizing","before realizing how","realizing how the","how the burden","the burden will","burden will push","will push her","push her unstable","her unstable nature","unstable nature to","nature to a","to a breaking","a breaking point","What transpires in","transpires in the","in the next","the next three","next three months","three months is","months is both","is both riveting","both riveting and","riveting and horrific"],"2grams":["Based on","on a","a true","true story","story that","that shocked","shocked the","the nation","nation in","in 1965","1965 ,",", the","the film","film recounts","recounts one","one of","of the","the most","most shocking","shocking crimes","crimes ever","ever committed","committed against","against a","a single","single victim","Sylvia and","and Jennie","Jennie Fae","Fae Likens","Likens ,",", the","the two","two daughters","daughters of","of traveling","traveling carnival","carnival workers","workers are","are left","left for","for an","an extended","extended stay","stay at","at the","the Indianapolis","Indianapolis home","home of","of single","single mother","mother Gertrude","Gertrude Baniszewski","Baniszewski and","and her","her six","six children","Times are","are tough","tough ,",", and","and Gertrude","Gertrude 's","'s financial","financial needs","needs cause","cause her","her to","to make","make this","this arrangement","arrangement before","before realizing","realizing how","how the","the burden","burden will","will push","push her","her unstable","unstable nature","nature to","to a","a breaking","breaking point","What transpires","transpires in","in the","the next","next three","three months","months is","is both","both riveting","riveting and","and horrific"]}

{"title":"Sam Houston: American Statesman, Soldier, and Pioneer","plot":"Sam Houston (1793-1863) is remembered today primarily for his activities in Texas, but n fact he was also a giant of the frontier and a dominant American political figure in the 1800s. This path breaking film is the first to document Sam Houston's remarkable life, in which viewers will find surprising points of identification: the teen-aged runaway who fled his controlling family to live with the Indians, the rejected husband who learned too late that his wife did not love him, the alcoholic forced to choose between ruin and sobriety -very modern sounding challenges. Yet Sam Houston lived out a triumphant American story: the only person ever to govern two states, conquering general, two-term President of the Republic of Texas, U.S. House member, U.S. Senator, and at the end a southerner banished from power and hated for his devotion to the Union. No one who learns Sam Houston's story will ever see American history the same way again.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sam","Houston","(","1793-1863",")","is","rememb","today","primarili","for","his","activ","in","Texa",",","but","n","fact","he","was","also","a","giant","of","the","frontier","and","a","domin","American","polit","figur","in","the","1800s",".","This","path","break","film","is","the","first","to","document","Sam","Houston","'s","remark","life",",","in","which","viewer","will","find","surpris","point","of","identif",":","the","teen-ag","runaway","who","fled","his","control","famili","to","live","with","the","Indian",",","the","reject","husband","who","learn","too","late","that","his","wife","did","not","love","him",",","the","alcohol","forc","to","choos","between","ruin","and","sobrieti","-","veri","modern","sound","challeng",".","Yet","Sam","Houston","live","out","a","triumphant","American","stori",":","the","onli","person","ever","to","govern","two","state",",","conquer","general",",","two-term","Presid","of","the","Republ","of","Texa",",","U.S.","Hous","member",",","U.S.","Senat",",","and","at","the","end","a","southern","banish","from","power","and","hate","for","his","devot","to","the","Union",".","No","one","who","learn","Sam","Houston","'s","stori","will","ever","see","American","histori","the","same","way","again","."],"lemmas":["Sam","Houston","-lrb-","1793-1863","-rrb-","be","remembered","today","primarily","for","he","activity","in","Texas",",","but","n","fact","he","be","also","a","giant","of","the","frontier","and","a","dominant","american","political","figure","in","the","1800",".","this","path","breaking","film","be","the","first","to","document","Sam","Houston","'s","remarkable","life",",","in","which","viewer","will","find","surprising","point","of","identification",":","the","teen-aged","runaway","who","flee","he","control","family","to","live","with","the","Indians",",","the","reject","husband","who","learn","too","late","that","he","wife","do","not","love","he",",","the","alcoholic","force","to","choose","between","ruin","and","sobriety","-","very","modern","sound","challenge",".","yet","Sam","Houston","live","out","a","triumphant","american","story",":","the","only","person","ever","to","govern","two","state",",","conquer","general",",","two-term","President","of","the","Republic","of","Texas",",","U.S.","House","member",",","U.S.","Senator",",","and","at","the","end","a","southerner","banish","from","power","and","hate","for","he","devotion","to","the","Union",".","no","one","who","learn","Sam","Houston","'s","story","will","ever","see","american","history","the","same","way","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Sam Houston (","Houston ( 1793-1863","( 1793-1863 )","1793-1863 ) is",") is remembered","is remembered today","remembered today primarily","today primarily for","primarily for his","for his activities","his activities in","activities in Texas","in Texas ,","Texas , but",", but n","but n fact","n fact he","fact he was","he was also","was also a","also a giant","a giant of","giant of the","of the frontier","the frontier and","frontier and a","and a dominant","a dominant American","dominant American political","American political figure","political figure in","figure in the","in the 1800s","This path breaking","path breaking film","breaking film is","film is the","is the first","the first to","first to document","to document Sam","document Sam Houston","Sam Houston 's","Houston 's remarkable","'s remarkable life","remarkable life ,","life , in",", in which","in which viewers","which viewers will","viewers will find","will find surprising","find surprising points","surprising points of","points of identification","of identification :","identification : the",": the teen-aged","the teen-aged runaway","teen-aged runaway who","runaway who fled","who fled his","fled his controlling","his controlling family","controlling family to","family to live","to live with","live with the","with the Indians","the Indians ,","Indians , the",", the rejected","the rejected husband","rejected husband who","husband who learned","who learned too","learned too late","too late that","late that his","that his wife","his wife did","wife did not","did not love","not love him","love him ,","him , the",", the alcoholic","the alcoholic forced","alcoholic forced to","forced to choose","to choose between","choose between ruin","between ruin and","ruin and sobriety","and sobriety -","sobriety -

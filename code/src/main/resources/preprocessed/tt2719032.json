{"title":"And, There You Are","plot":"Ray Dalton [Roy Kirkland] is a successful businessman, snappy dresser, drives a Lexus on 22s and never meets a stranger, but love seems to be the hardest object to acquire. Ray gets lots of advice from relatives, friends and even professionals, but continues his search for the one right man. You see, Ray only dates straight guys who, unfortunately for Ray, all have girlfriends, which get in the way. This quirky slice of life comedy, based on actual events, is packed with great characters, sexy men and even a few girls. Theres always another man around the next corner, and Ray turns lots of corners! Harrison Simon, Danielle Lalk, Davey Sheffield costar. When it comes to men, Ray's got it going on--only he's got it going on with all the wrong men. Maybe if he just stopped dating straight men with girlfriends, he could find his one true love, but for Ray they're just too tempting. But how will he ever find true happiness when he's looking in all the wrong places? This lighthearted film is a gay comic dating adventure, where the straight men aren't so straight, but it doesn't make finding love any easier. This is the only Roy Kirkland video. Stars also making their debut in this video: Danielle Lalk, Davey Sheffield, Harrison Simon.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance","

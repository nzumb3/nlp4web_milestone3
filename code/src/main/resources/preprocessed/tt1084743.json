{"title":"Kids of the Majestic","plot":"Every day, a sea of passengers floods the Majestic Railway Station of Bangalore City. Beneath the commotion of commuters, a group of orphans live beneath the station, collecting the trash that the passengers have left behind. KIDS OF THE MAJESTIC is a documentary by filmmaker Dylan Verrechia and Harvard Medical School graduate Suhas Radhakrishna that follows a group of such orphans: Rafik, a smiling young drug addict; Mental Manja, nicknamed \"mental\" because he didn't speak until he was 10; Arun-Badur, the artist and the writer; Baba, who at 8 has travelled throughout India alone; and Joti, mother-to-be at 16, who was abused at 9. The filmmakers befriended these children who, uneasily and slowly, opened up to them, sharing their life stories as no one before has ever heard. This documentary upholds a strong moral content by not only depicting the reality and hardship of these children, but also the positive aspect of this social group that works within its community.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Everi","day",",","a","sea","of","passeng","flood","the","Majest","Railway","Station","of","Bangalor","Citi",".","Beneath","the","commot","of","commut",",","a","group","of","orphan","live","beneath","the","station",",","collect","the","trash","that","the","passeng","have","left","behind",".","KIDS","OF","THE","MAJESTIC","is","a","documentari","by","filmmak","Dylan","Verrechia","and","Harvard","Medic","School","graduat","Suha","Radhakrishna","that","follow","a","group","of","such","orphan",":","Rafik",",","a","smile","young","drug","addict",";","Mental","Manja",",","nicknam","\"","mental","\"","becaus","he","did","n't","speak","until","he","was","10",";","Arun-Badur",",","the","artist","and","the","writer",";","Baba",",","who","at","8","has","travel","throughout","India","alon",";","and","Joti",",","mother-to-b","at","16",",","who","was","abus","at","9",".","The","filmmak","befriend","these","children","who",",","uneasili","and","slowli",",","open","up","to","them",",","share","their","life","stori","as","no","one","befor","has","ever","heard",".","This","documentari","uphold","a","strong","moral","content","by","not","onli","depict","the","realiti","and","hardship","of","these","children",",","but","also","the","posit","aspect","of","this","social","group","that","work","within","it","communiti","."],"lemmas":["every","day",",","a","sea","of","passenger","flood","the","Majestic","Railway","Station","of","Bangalore","City",".","beneath","the","commotion","of","commuter",",","a","group","of","orphan","live","beneath","the","station",",","collect","the","trash","that","the","passenger","have","leave","behind",".","kid","of","the","majestic","be","a","documentary","by","filmmaker","Dylan","Verrechia","and","Harvard","Medical","School","graduate","Suhas","Radhakrishna","that","follow","a","group","of","such","orphan",":","Rafik",",","a","smile","young","drug","addict",";","Mental","Manja",",","nickname","``","mental","''","because","he","do","not","speak","until","he","be","10",";","Arun-Badur",",","the","artist","and","the","writer",";","Baba",",","who","at","8","have","travel","throughout","India","alone",";","and","Joti",",","mother-to-be","at","16",",","who","be","abuse","at","9",".","the","filmmaker","befriend","these","child","who",",","uneasily","and","slowly",",","open","up","to","they",",","share","they","life","story","as","no","one","before","have","ever","hear",".","this","documentary","uphold","a","strong","moral","content","by","not","only","depict","the","reality","and","hardship","of","these","child",",","but","also","the","positive","aspect","of","this","social","group","that","work","within","its","community","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Every day ,","day , a",", a sea","a sea of","sea of passengers","of passengers floods","passengers floods the","floods the Majestic","the Majestic Railway","Majestic Railway Station","Railway Station of","Station of Bangalore","of Bangalore City","Beneath the commotion","the commotion of","commotion of commuters","of commuters ,","commuters , a",", a group","a group of","group of orphans","of orphans live","orphans live beneath","live beneath the","beneath the station","the station ,","station , collecting",", collecting the","collecting the trash","the trash that","trash that the","that the passengers","the passengers have","passengers have left","have left behind","KIDS OF THE","OF THE MAJESTIC","THE MAJESTIC is","MAJESTIC is a","is a documentary","a documentary by","documentary by filmmaker","by filmmaker Dylan","filmmaker Dylan Verrechia","Dylan Verrechia and","Verrechia and Harvard","and Harvard Medical","Harvard Medical School","Medical School graduate","School graduate Suhas","graduate Suhas Radhakrishna","Suhas Radhakrishna that","Radhakrishna that follows","that follows a","follows a group","a group of","group of such","of such orphans","such orphans :","orphans : Rafik",": Rafik ,","Rafik , a",", a smiling","a smiling young","smiling young drug","young drug addict","drug addict ;","addict ;

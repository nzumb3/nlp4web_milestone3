{"title":"Holy Man: The USA vs Douglas White","plot":"Holy Man is the story of Douglas White, an 88 year old Lakota Sioux medicine man from Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota, who spent 17 years in federal prison for a crime he did not commit. During the making of this film, filmmakers uncovered new evidence of White's innocence and brought the case back to Federal Court. Holy Man offers a rare glimpse into the mysterious world of Lakota religion, their intimate connection to the land, and a provocative expose of the systemic injustice that Native Americans face in the criminal justice system.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Holi","Man","is","the","stori","of","Dougla","White",",","an","88","year","old","Lakota","Sioux","medicin","man","from","Pine","Ridg","Indian","Reserv","in","South","Dakota",",","who","spent","17","year","in","feder","prison","for","a","crime","he","did","not","commit",".","Dure","the","make","of","this","film",",","filmmak","uncov","new","evid","of","White","'s","innoc","and","brought","the","case","back","to","Feder","Court",".","Holi","Man","offer","a","rare","glimps","into","the","mysteri","world","of","Lakota","religion",",","their","intim","connect","to","the","land",",","and","a","provoc","expos","of","the","system","injustic","that","Nativ","American","face","in","the","crimin","justic","system","."],"lemmas":["Holy","Man","be","the","story","of","Douglas","White",",","a","88","year","old","Lakota","Sioux","medicine","man","from","Pine","Ridge","Indian","Reservation","in","South","Dakota",",","who","spend","17","year","in","federal","prison","for","a","crime","he","do","not","commit",".","during","the","making","of","this","film",",","filmmaker","uncover","new","evidence","of","White","'s","innocence","and","bring","the","case","back","to","Federal","Court",".","Holy","Man","offer","a","rare","glimpse","into","the","mysterious","world","of","lakota","religion",",","they","intimate","connection","to","the","land",",","and","a","provocative","expose","of","the","systemic","injustice","that","native","Americans","face","in","the","criminal","justice","system","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["Holy Man is","Man is the","is the story","the story of","story of Douglas","of Douglas White","Douglas White ,","White , an",", an 88","an 88 year","88 year old","year old Lakota","old Lakota Sioux","Lakota Sioux medicine","Sioux medicine man","medicine man from","man from Pine","from Pine Ridge","Pine Ridge Indian","Ridge Indian Reservation","Indian Reservation in","Reservation in South","in South Dakota","South Dakota ,","Dakota , who",", who spent","who spent 17","spent 17 years","17 years in","years in federal","in federal prison","federal prison for","prison for a","for a crime","a crime he","crime he did","he did not","did not commit","During the making","the making of","making of this","of this film","this film ,","film , filmmakers",", filmmakers uncovered","filmmakers uncovered new","uncovered new evidence","new evidence of","evidence of White","of White 's","White 's innocence","'s innocence and","innocence and brought","and brought the","brought the case","the case back","case back to","back to Federal","to Federal Court","Holy Man offers","Man offers a","offers a rare","a rare glimpse","rare glimpse into","glimpse into the","into the mysterious","the mysterious world","mysterious world of","world of Lakota","of Lakota religion","Lakota religion ,","religion , their",", their intimate","their intimate connection","intimate connection to","connection to the","to the land","the land ,","land , and",", and a","and a provocative","a provocative expose","provocative expose of","expose of the","of the systemic","the systemic injustice","systemic injustice that","injustice that Native","that Native Americans","Native Americans face","Americans face in","face in the","in the criminal","the criminal justice","criminal justice system"],"2grams":["Holy Man","Man is","is the","the story","story of","of Douglas","Douglas White","White ,",", an","an 88","88 year","year old","old Lakota","Lakota Sioux","Sioux medicine","medicine man","man from","from Pine","Pine Ridge","Ridge Indian","Indian Reservation","Reservation in","in South","South Dakota","Dakota ,",", who","who spent","spent 17","17 years","years in","in federal","federal prison","prison for","for a","a crime","crime he","he did","did not","not commit","During the","the making","making of","of this","this film","film ,",", filmmakers","filmmakers uncovered","uncovered new","new evidence","evidence of","of White","White 's","'s innocence","innocence and","and brought","brought the","the case","case back","back to","to Federal","Federal Court","Holy Man","Man offers","offers a","a rare","rare glimpse","glimpse into","into the","the mysterious","mysterious world","world of","of Lakota","Lakota religion","religion ,",", their","their intimate","intimate connection","connection to","to the","the land","land ,",", and","and a","a provocative","provocative expose","expose of","of the","the systemic","systemic injustice","injustice that","that Native","Native Americans","Americans face","face in","in the","the criminal","criminal justice","justice system"]}

{"title":"A Coming Day","plot":"Feeling the dangers of a police state slowly closing in on them, James and Joan Monroe decide to flee the persecution with their teenage sons John and Charlie. When their escape plans are sabotaged by treachery, James and Joan become prisoners, apparently doomed to a prison camp death. Forced to carry on by themselves, John and Charlie meet Isaiah, who leads them along a clandestine route for Christian refugees. They are joined by Maria, a teenage orphan on the run due to secrets of her own. As James and Joan struggle to live their faith as prisoners, the teenage refugees must deal with betrayal, loneliness, and the necessity of trust in each other to make good their own escape. Each is confronted with circumstances that force them to choose submission to the world, or triumph over it through life in Jesus Christ.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Feel","the","danger","of","a","polic","state","slowli","close","in","on","them",",","Jame","and","Joan","Monro","decid","to","flee","the","persecut","with","their","teenag","son","John","and","Charli",".","When","their","escap","plan","are","sabotag","by","treacheri",",","Jame","and","Joan","becom","prison",",","appar","doom","to","a","prison","camp","death",".","Forc","to","carri","on","by","themselv",",","John","and","Charli","meet","Isaiah",",","who","lead","them","along","a","clandestin","rout","for","Christian","refuge",".","They","are","join","by","Maria",",","a","teenag","orphan","on","the","run","due","to","secret","of","her","own",".","As","Jame","and","Joan","struggl","to","live","their","faith","as","prison",",","the","teenag","refuge","must","deal","with","betray",",","loneli",",","and","the","necess","of","trust","in","each","other","to","make","good","their","own","escap",".","Each","is","confront","with","circumst","that","forc","them","to","choos","submiss","to","the","world",",","or","triumph","over","it","through","life","in","Jesus","Christ","."],"lemmas":["feel","the","danger","of","a","police","state","slowly","close","in","on","they",",","James","and","Joan","Monroe","decide","to","flee","the","persecution","with","they","teenage","son","John","and","Charlie",".","when","they","escape","plan","be","sabotage","by","treachery",",","James","and","Joan","become","prisoner",",","apparently","doom","to","a","prison","camp","death",".","force","to","carry","on","by","themselves",",","John","and","Charlie","meet","Isaiah",",","who","lead","they","along","a","clandestine","route","for","christian","refugee",".","they","be","join","by","Maria",",","a","teenage","orphan","on","the","run","due","to","secret","of","she","own",".","as","James","and","Joan","struggle","to","live","they","faith","as","prisoner",",","the","teenage","refugee","must","deal","with","betrayal",",","loneliness",",","and","the","necessity","of","trust","in","each","other","to","make","good","they","own","escape",".","each","be","confront","with","circumstance","that","force","they","to","choose","submission","to","the","world",",","or","triumph","over","it","through","life","in","Jesus","Christ","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Feeling

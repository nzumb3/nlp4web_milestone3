{"title":"War Zone","plot":"Bertolt Brecht lives! Maggie Hadleigh-West walks crowded urban streets carrying a video camera and microphone, trailed by one or two women also with cameras. Whenever a man harasses her, with ogling or words, she turns the camera on him, moves in close, and questions his behavior. The questions are not for dialogue but for making him as uncomfortable as he's made her. More than 50 such encounters are included: the men react with bravado, embarrassment, or anger. None apologize. Interspersed are her voice-over stories of growing up and dealing with men, as well as interviews with several women who talk about how they handle similar harassment and what they feel about it.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Bertolt","Brecht","live","!","Maggi","Hadleigh-West","walk","crowd","urban","street","carri","a","video","camera","and","microphon",",","trail","by","one","or","two","women","also","with","camera",".","Whenev","a","man","harass","her",",","with","ogl","or","word",",","she","turn","the","camera","on","him",",","move","in","close",",","and","question","his","behavior",".","The","question","are","not","for","dialogu","but","for","make","him","as","uncomfort","as","he","'s","made","her",".","More","than","50","such","encount","are","includ",":","the","men","react","with","bravado",",","embarrass",",","or","anger",".","None","apolog",".","Interspers","are","her","voice-ov","stori","of","grow","up","and","deal","with","men",",","as","well","as","interview","with","sever","women","who","talk","about","how","they","handl","similar","harass","and","what","they","feel","about","it","."],"lemmas":["Bertolt","Brecht","live","!","Maggie","Hadleigh-West","walk","crowded","urban","street","carry","a","video","camera","and","microphone",",","trail","by","one","or","two","woman","also","with","camera",".","whenever","a","man","harass","she",",","with","ogle","or","word",",","she","turn","the","camera","on","he",",","move","in","close",",","and","question","he","behavior",".","the","question","be","not","for","dialogue","but","for","make","he","as","uncomfortable","as","he","be","make","she",".","more","than","50","such","encounter","be","include",":","the","man","react","with","bravado",",","embarrassment",",","or","anger",".","none","apologize",".","intersperse","be","she","voice-over","story","of","grow","up","and","deal","with","man",",","as","well","as","interview","with","several","woman","who","talk","about","how","they","handle","similar","harassment","and","what","they","feel","about","it","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bertolt

{"title":"How to Kill Your Neighbor's Dog","plot":"Shy, chain-smoking, insomniac Peter McGowan is an L.A. playwright with a string of hits that preceded his current ten years of failed productions. His mother-in-law is sinking into senility, a stranger is meandering the neighborhood claiming to be him, neighbors have a new dog that barks all night; his wife wants to have a child, and he does not: he's become impotent. He's working on a new play when a single mom moves in next door with her 8-year-old daughter. His wife immediately invites the girl into the McGowan household. Will this child stir Peter's paternal feelings? Will she also help him get his dialogue right? And what of his doppelganger and the neighbor's dog?","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Shi",",","chain-smok",",","insomniac","Peter","McGowan","is","an","L.A.","playwright","with","a","string","of","hit","that","preced","his","current","ten","year","of","fail","product",".","His","mother-in-law","is","sink","into","senil",",","a","stranger","is","meander","the","neighborhood","claim","to","be","him",",","neighbor","have","a","new","dog","that","bark","all","night",";","his","wife","want","to","have","a","child",",","and","he","doe","not",":","he","'s","becom","impot",".","He","'s","work","on","a","new","play","when","a","singl","mom","move","in","next","door","with","her","8-year-old","daughter",".","His","wife","immedi","invit","the","girl","into","the","McGowan","household",".","Will","this","child","stir","Peter","'s","patern","feel","?","Will","she","also","help","him","get","his","dialogu","right","?","And","what","of","his","doppelgang","and","the","neighbor","'s","dog","?"],"lemmas":["shy",",","chain-smoking",",","insomniac","Peter","McGowan","be","a","L.A.","playwright","with","a","string","of","hit","that","precede","he","current","ten","year","of","failed","production",".","he","mother-in-law","be","sink","into","senility",",","a","stranger","be","meander","the","neighborhood","claim","to","be","he",",","neighbor","have","a","new","dog","that","bark","all","night",";","he","wife","want","to","have","a","child",",","and","he","do","not",":","he","be","become","impotent",".","he","be","work","on","a","new","play","when","a","single","mom","move","in","next","door","with","she","8-year-old","daughter",".","he","wife","immediately","invite","the","girl","into","the","McGowan","household",".","will","this","child","stir","Peter","'s","paternal","feeling","?","will","she","also","help","he","get","he","dialogue","right","?","and","what","of","he","doppelganger","and","the","neighbor","'s","dog","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Shy , chain-smoking",", chain-smoking ,","chain-smoking , insomniac",", insomniac Peter","insomniac Peter McGowan","Peter McGowan is","McGowan is an","is an L.A.","an L.A. playwright","L.A. playwright with","playwright with a","with a string","a string of","string of hits","of hits that","hits that preceded","that preceded his","preceded his current","his current ten","current ten years","ten years of","years of failed","of failed productions","His mother-in-law is","mother-in-law is sinking","is sinking into","sinking into senility","into senility ,","senility , a",", a stranger","a stranger is","stranger is meandering","is meandering the","meandering the neighborhood","the neighborhood claiming","neighborhood claiming to","claiming to be","to be him","be him ,","him , neighbors",", neighbors have","neighbors have a","have a new","a new dog","new dog that","dog that barks","that barks all","barks all night","all night ;","night ;

{"title":"Fellini: I'm a Born Liar","plot":"A look at Fellini's creative process. In extensive interviews, Fellini talks a bit about his background and then discusses how he works and how he creates. Several actors, a producer, a writer, and a production manager talk about working with Fellini. Archive footage of Fellini and others on the set plus clips from his films provide commentary and illustration for the points interviewees make. Fellini is fully in charge; actors call themselves puppets. He dismisses improvisation and calls for \"availability.\" His sets and his films create images that look like reality but are not; we see the differences and the results.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["A","look","at","Fellini","'s","creativ","process",".","In","extens","interview",",","Fellini","talk","a","bit","about","his","background","and","then","discuss","how","he","work","and","how","he","creat",".","Sever","actor",",","a","produc",",","a","writer",",","and","a","product","manag","talk","about","work","with","Fellini",".","Archive","footag","of","Fellini","and","other","on","the","set","plus","clip","from","his","film","provid","commentari","and","illustr","for","the","point","interviewe","make",".","Fellini","is","fulli","in","charg",";","actor","call","themselv","puppet",".","He","dismiss","improvis","and","call","for","\"","avail",".","\"","His","set","and","his","film","creat","imag","that","look","like","realiti","but","are","not",";","we","see","the","differ","and","the","result","."],"lemmas":["a","look","at","Fellini","'s","creative","process",".","in","extensive","interview",",","Fellini","talk","a","bit","about","he","background","and","then","discuss","how","he","work","and","how","he","create",".","several","actor",",","a","producer",",","a","writer",",","and","a","production","manager","talk","about","work","with","Fellini",".","Archive","footage","of","Fellini","and","other","on","the","set","plus","clip","from","he","film","provide","commentary","and","illustration","for","the","point","interviewee","make",".","Fellini","be","fully","in","charge",";","actor","call","themselves","puppet",".","he","dismiss","improvisation","and","call","for","``","availability",".","''","he","set","and","he","film","create","image","that","look","like","reality","but","be","not",";","we","see","the","difference","and","the","result","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A look at","look at Fellini","at Fellini 's","Fellini 's creative","'s creative process","In extensive interviews","extensive interviews ,","interviews , Fellini",", Fellini talks","Fellini talks a","talks a bit","a bit about","bit about his","about his background","his background and","background and then","and then discusses","then discusses how","discusses how he","how he works","he works and","works and how","and how he","how he creates","Several actors ,","actors , a",", a producer","a producer ,","producer , a",", a writer","a writer ,","writer , and",", and a","and a production","a production manager","production manager talk","manager talk about","talk about working","about working with","working with Fellini","Archive footage of","footage of Fellini","of Fellini and","Fellini and others","and others on","others on the","on the set","the set plus","set plus clips","plus clips from","clips from his","from his films","his films provide","films provide commentary","provide commentary and","commentary and illustration","and illustration for","illustration for the","for the points","the points interviewees","points interviewees make","Fellini is fully","is fully in","fully in charge","in charge ;","charge ;

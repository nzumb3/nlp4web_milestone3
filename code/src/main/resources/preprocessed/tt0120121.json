{"title":"The Shooter","plot":"The story is of a small town in the early west and of a 'shooter' of reputation that drifts into it and stands up to the controlling family that runs it. But far from a John Wayne, this hero is caught and brutally beaten and left to die, only to be saved by a prostitute that has also suffered under the hand of this group of desperados. The only one possible to stand up to the shooter is another solitary man who joins with the notorious family although he is deputized as the town's sherif.","genres":["Western"],"stems":["The","stori","is","of","a","small","town","in","the","earli","west","and","of","a","'","shooter","'","of","reput","that","drift","into","it","and","stand","up","to","the","control","famili","that","run","it",".","But","far","from","a","John","Wayn",",","this","hero","is","caught","and","brutal","beaten","and","left","to","die",",","onli","to","be","save","by","a","prostitut","that","has","also","suffer","under","the","hand","of","this","group","of","desperado",".","The","onli","one","possibl","to","stand","up","to","the","shooter","is","anoth","solitari","man","who","join","with","the","notori","famili","although","he","is","deput","as","the","town","'s","sherif","."],"lemmas":["the","story","be","of","a","small","town","in","the","early","west","and","of","a","'","shooter","'","of","reputation","that","drift","into","it","and","stand","up","to","the","control","family","that","run","it",".","but","far","from","a","John","Wayne",",","this","hero","be","catch","and","brutally","beat","and","leave","to","die",",","only","to","be","save","by","a","prostitute","that","have","also","suffer","under","the","hand","of","this","group","of","desperado",".","the","only","one","possible","to","stand","up","to","the","shooter","be","another","solitary","man","who","join","with","the","notorious","family","although","he","be","deputize","as","the","town","'s","sherif","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["The story is","story is of","is of a","of a small","a small town","small town in","town in the","in the early","the early west","early west and","west and of","and of a","of a '","a ' shooter","' shooter '","shooter ' of","' of reputation","of reputation that","reputation that drifts","that drifts into","drifts into it","into it and","it and stands","and stands up","stands up to","up to the","to the controlling","the controlling family","controlling family that","family that runs","that runs it","But far from","far from a","from a John","a John Wayne","John Wayne ,","Wayne , this",", this hero","this hero is","hero is caught","is caught and","caught and brutally","and brutally beaten","brutally beaten and","beaten and left","and left to","left to die","to die ,","die , only",", only to","only to be","to be saved","be saved by","saved by a","by a prostitute","a prostitute that","prostitute that has","that has also","has also suffered","also suffered under","suffered under the","under the hand","the hand of","hand of this","of this group","this group of","group of desperados","The only one","only one possible","one possible to","possible to stand","to stand up","stand up to","up to the","to the shooter","the shooter is","shooter is another","is another solitary","another solitary man","solitary man who","man who joins","who joins with","joins with the","with the notorious","the notorious family","notorious family although","family although he","although he is","he is deputized","is deputized as","deputized as the","as the town","the town 's","town 's sherif"],"2grams":["The story","story is","is of","of a","a small","small town","town in","in the","the early","early west","west and","and of","of a","a '","' shooter","shooter '","' of","of reputation","reputation that","that drifts","drifts into","into it","it and","and stands","stands up","up to","to the","the controlling","controlling family","family that","that runs","runs it","But far","far from","from a","a John","John Wayne","Wayne ,",", this","this hero","hero is","is caught","caught and","and brutally","brutally beaten","beaten and","and left","left to","to die","die ,",", only","only to","to be","be saved","saved by","by a","a prostitute","prostitute that","that has","has also","also suffered","suffered under","under the","the hand","hand of","of this","this group","group of","of desperados","The only","only one","one possible","possible to","to stand","stand up","up to","to the","the shooter","shooter is","is another","another solitary","solitary man","man who","who joins","joins with","with the","the notorious","notorious family","family although","although he","he is","is deputized","deputized as","as the","the town","town 's","'s sherif"]}

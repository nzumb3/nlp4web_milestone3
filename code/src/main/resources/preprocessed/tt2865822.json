{"title":"All the World in a Design School","plot":"Eclectic students and faculty from all over the planet meet at one of the the world's top industrial design school in Scandinavia's faraway north just below the Arctic Circle. This documentary explores everyday life, unique study methods and dynamic design processes at Umeå Institute of Design during the school's 25th anniversary when traditionally welcoming and generous Sweden, with its export-driven economy, imposes steep tuition fees for non-Europeans, the very students that have been instrumental in making the school what it is today.","genres":["Documentary"," News"," Drama"],"stems":["Eclectic","student","and","faculti","from","all","over","the","planet","meet","at","one","of","the","the","world","'s","top","industri","design","school","in","Scandinavia","'s","faraway","north","just","below","the","Arctic","Circl",".","This","documentari","explor","everyday","life",",","uniqu","studi","method","and","dynam","design","process","at","Umeå","Institut","of","Design","dure","the","school","'s","25th","anniversari","when","tradit","welcom","and","generous","Sweden",",","with","it","export-driven","economi",",","impos","steep","tuition","fee","for","non-European",",","the","veri","student","that","have","been","instrument","in","make","the","school","what","it","is","today","."],"lemmas":["eclectic","student","and","faculty","from","all","over","the","planet","meet","at","one","of","the","the","world","'s","top","industrial","design","school","in","Scandinavia","'s","faraway","north","just","below","the","Arctic","Circle",".","this","documentary","explore","everyday","life",",","unique","study","method","and","dynamic","design","process","at","Umeå","Institute","of","Design","during","the","school","'s","25th","anniversary","when","traditionally","welcome","and","generous","Sweden",",","with","its","export-driven","economy",",","impose","steep","tuition","fee","for","non-european",",","the","very","student","that","have","be","instrumental","in","make","the","school","what","it","be","today","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Eclectic students and","students and faculty","and faculty from","faculty from all","from all over","all over the","over the planet","the planet meet","planet meet at","meet at one","at one of","one of the","of the the","the the world","the world 's","world 's top","'s top industrial","top industrial design","industrial design school","design school in","school in Scandinavia","in Scandinavia 's","Scandinavia 's faraway","'s faraway north","faraway north just","north just below","just below the","below the Arctic","the Arctic Circle","This documentary explores","documentary explores everyday","explores everyday life","everyday life ,","life , unique",", unique study","unique study methods","study methods and","methods and dynamic","and dynamic design","dynamic design processes","design processes at","processes at Umeå","at Umeå Institute","Umeå Institute of","Institute of Design","of Design during","Design during the","during the school","the school 's","school 's 25th","'s 25th anniversary","25th anniversary when","anniversary when traditionally","when traditionally welcoming","traditionally welcoming and","welcoming and generous","and generous Sweden","generous Sweden ,","Sweden , with",", with its","with its export-driven","its export-driven economy","export-driven economy ,","economy , imposes",", imposes steep","imposes steep tuition","steep tuition fees","tuition fees for","fees for non-Europeans","for non-Europeans ,","non-Europeans , the",", the very","the very students","very students that","students that have","that have been","have been instrumental","been instrumental in","instrumental in making","in making the","making the school","the school what","school what it","what it is","it is today"],"2grams":["Eclectic students","students and","and faculty","faculty from","from all","all over","over the","the planet","planet meet","meet at","at one","one of","of the","the the","the world","world 's","'s top","top industrial","industrial design","design school","school in","in Scandinavia","Scandinavia 's","'s faraway","faraway north","north just","just below","below the","the Arctic","Arctic Circle","This documentary","documentary explores","explores everyday","everyday life","life ,",", unique","unique study","study methods","methods and","and dynamic","dynamic design","design processes","processes at","at Umeå","Umeå Institute","Institute of","of Design","Design during","during the","the school","school 's","'s 25th","25th anniversary","anniversary when","when traditionally","traditionally welcoming","welcoming and","and generous","generous Sweden","Sweden ,",", with","with its","its export-driven","export-driven economy","economy ,",", imposes","imposes steep","steep tuition","tuition fees","fees for","for non-Europeans","non-Europeans ,",", the","the very","very students","students that","that have","have been","been instrumental","instrumental in","in making","making the","the school","school what","what it","it is","is today"]}

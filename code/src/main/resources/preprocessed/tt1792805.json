{"title":"I Feel...","plot":"Jasmijn is a seven year old girl, who loves hugging trees and having conversations with animals. Anything she touches seems to breathe a sense of aliveness. Robert is ten years old, and the only place where he feels at ease is in nature. He climbs trees as high as he can escaping the everyday reality that is not always easy. 'I feel...' is about children who experience their environment differently compared to most of us. They travel their own way against the mainstream and dare to see the world with a pureness of vision over and over again.","genres":["Documentary"," Mystery"],"stems":["Jasmijn","is","a","seven","year","old","girl",",","who","love","hug","tree","and","have","convers","with","anim",".","Anyth","she","touch","seem","to","breath","a","sens","of","aliv",".","Robert","is","ten","year","old",",","and","the","onli","place","where","he","feel","at","eas","is","in","natur",".","He","climb","tree","as","high","as","he","can","escap","the","everyday","realiti","that","is","not","alway","easi",".","'","I","feel","...","'","is","about","children","who","experi","their","environ","differ","compar","to","most","of","us",".","They","travel","their","own","way","against","the","mainstream","and","dare","to","see","the","world","with","a","pure","of","vision","over","and","over","again","."],"lemmas":["Jasmijn","be","a","seven","year","old","girl",",","who","love","hug","tree","and","have","conversation","with","animal",".","Anything","she","touch","seem","to","breathe","a","sense","of","aliveness",".","Robert","be","ten","year","old",",","and","the","only","place","where","he","feel","at","ease","be","in","nature",".","he","climb","tree","as","high","as","he","can","escape","the","everyday","reality","that","be","not","always","easy",".","'","I","feel","...","'","be","about","child","who","experience","they","environment","differently","compare","to","most","of","we",".","they","travel","they","own","way","against","the","mainstream","and","dare","to","see","the","world","with","a","pureness","of","vision","over","and","over","again","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Jasmijn is a","is a seven","a seven year","seven year old","year old girl","old girl ,","girl , who",", who loves","who loves hugging","loves hugging trees","hugging trees and","trees and having","and having conversations","having conversations with","conversations with animals","Anything she touches","she touches seems","touches seems to","seems to breathe","to breathe a","breathe a sense","a sense of","sense of aliveness","Robert is ten","is ten years","ten years old","years old ,","old , and",", and the","and the only","the only place","only place where","place where he","where he feels","he feels at","feels at ease","at ease is","ease is in","is in nature","He climbs trees","climbs trees as","trees as high","as high as","high as he","as he can","he can escaping","can escaping the","escaping the everyday","the everyday reality","everyday reality that","reality that is","that is not","is not always","not always easy","always easy .","easy .

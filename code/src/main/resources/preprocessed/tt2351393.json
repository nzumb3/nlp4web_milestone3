{"title":"The Exorcist in the 21st Century","plot":"The Exorcist in the 21st Century takes the viewer into the unknown and sinister world of exorcism in the Catholic Church. We meet one of the few exorcists in Europe, the Vatican approved José Antonio Fortea. He travels around the world on a mission to enlighten the masses about demonic possession. Constanza, a Colombian woman, is desperately looking for Fr. Forteas help. She claims to have been possessed by demons for nearly 15 years and she goes through a ritual of exorcism before she sees the Spanish exorcist as a last hope for spiritual liberation. The film follows both their journeys and gives a unique insight into one of the world most secret and mystical rites - the catholic ritual of exorcism.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Exorcist","in","the","21st","Centuri","take","the","viewer","into","the","unknown","and","sinist","world","of","exorc","in","the","Cathol","Church",".","We","meet","one","of","the","few","exorcist","in","Europ",",","the","Vatican","approv","José","Antonio","Fortea",".","He","travel","around","the","world","on","a","mission","to","enlighten","the","mass","about","demon","possess",".","Constanza",",","a","Colombian","woman",",","is","desper","look","for","Fr",".","Fortea","help",".","She","claim","to","have","been","possess","by","demon","for","near","15","year","and","she","goe","through","a","ritual","of","exorc","befor","she","see","the","Spanish","exorcist","as","a","last","hope","for","spiritu","liber",".","The","film","follow","both","their","journey","and","give","a","uniqu","insight","into","one","of","the","world","most","secret","and","mystic","rite","-","the","cathol","ritual","of","exorc","."],"lemmas":["the","Exorcist","in","the","21st","Century","take","the","viewer","into","the","unknown","and","sinister","world","of","exorcism","in","the","Catholic","Church",".","we","meet","one","of","the","few","exorcist","in","Europe",",","the","Vatican","approve","José","Antonio","Fortea",".","he","travel","around","the","world","on","a","mission","to","enlighten","the","mass","about","demonic","possession",".","Constanza",",","a","colombian","woman",",","be","desperately","look","for","Fr",".","fortea","help",".","she","claim","to","have","be","possess","by","demon","for","nearly","15","year","and","she","go","through","a","ritual","of","exorcism","before","she","see","the","spanish","exorcist","as","a","last","hope","for","spiritual","liberation",".","the","film","follow","both","they","journey","and","give","a","unique","insight","into","one","of","the","world","most","secret","and","mystical","rite","-","the","catholic","ritual","of","exorcism","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Exorcist in","Exorcist in the","in the 21st","the 21st Century","21st Century takes","Century takes the","takes the viewer","the viewer into","viewer into the","into the unknown","the unknown and","unknown and sinister","and sinister world","sinister world of","world of exorcism","of exorcism in","exorcism in the","in the Catholic","the Catholic Church","We meet one","meet one of","one of the","of the few","the few exorcists","few exorcists in","exorcists in Europe","in Europe ,","Europe , the",", the Vatican","the Vatican approved","Vatican approved José","approved José Antonio","José Antonio Fortea","He travels around","travels around the","around the world","the world on","world on a","on a mission","a mission to","mission to enlighten","to enlighten the","enlighten the masses","the masses about","masses about demonic","about demonic possession","Constanza , a",", a Colombian","a Colombian woman","Colombian woman ,","woman , is",", is desperately","is desperately looking","desperately looking for","looking for Fr","She claims to","claims to have","to have been","have been possessed","been possessed by","possessed by demons","by demons for","demons for nearly","for nearly 15","nearly 15 years","15 years and","years and she","and she goes","she goes through","goes through a","through a ritual","a ritual of","ritual of exorcism","of exorcism before","exorcism before she","before she sees","she sees the","sees the Spanish","the Spanish exorcist","Spanish exorcist as","exorcist as a","as a last","a last hope","last hope for","hope for spiritual","for spiritual liberation","The film follows","film follows both","follows both their","both their journeys","their journeys and","journeys and gives","and gives a","gives a unique","a unique insight","unique insight into","insight into one","into one of","one of the","of the world","the world most","world most secret","most secret and","secret and mystical","and mystical rites","mystical rites -","rites -

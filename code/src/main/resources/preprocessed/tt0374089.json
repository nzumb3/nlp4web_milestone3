{"title":"Nomad: The Warrior","plot":"Rebirth of a nation. Not since Genghis Khan has anyone united the Kazakh tribes. Jungar tribesmen of Mongolia rule Kazakh land, but a prophecy has it that a descendant of Genghis will unite his people. Oraz the Wise travels the land looking for the child who will fulfill the prophecy. He finds that infant and protects him from the warriors of Galdan, the Jungar king. Oraz recruits one lad from each Kazakh tribe and teaches them the art of war, loyalty, and camaraderie. Two are the best: Mansur and Erali. They are like brothers. Each must prove himself; both fall in love with the same young woman; both fall into enemy hands. At what cost does a prophecy come to pass?","genres":["Drama"," War"," History"],"stems":["Rebirth","of","a","nation",".","Not","sinc","Genghi","Khan","has","anyon","unit","the","Kazakh","tribe",".","Jungar","tribesmen","of","Mongolia","rule","Kazakh","land",",","but","a","propheci","has","it","that","a","descend","of","Genghi","will","unit","his","peopl",".","Oraz","the","Wise","travel","the","land","look","for","the","child","who","will","fulfil","the","propheci",".","He","find","that","infant","and","protect","him","from","the","warrior","of","Galdan",",","the","Jungar","king",".","Oraz","recruit","one","lad","from","each","Kazakh","tribe","and","teach","them","the","art","of","war",",","loyalti",",","and","camaraderi",".","Two","are","the","best",":","Mansur","and","Erali",".","They","are","like","brother",".","Each","must","prove","himself",";","both","fall","in","love","with","the","same","young","woman",";","both","fall","into","enemi","hand",".","At","what","cost","doe","a","propheci","come","to","pass","?"],"lemmas":["rebirth","of","a","nation",".","not","since","Genghis","Khan","have","anyone","unite","the","kazakh","tribe",".","jungar","tribesman","of","Mongolia","rule","Kazakh","land",",","but","a","prophecy","have","it","that","a","descendant","of","Genghis","will","unite","he","people",".","Oraz","the","Wise","travel","the","land","look","for","the","child","who","will","fulfill","the","prophecy",".","he","find","that","infant","and","protect","he","from","the","warrior","of","Galdan",",","the","Jungar","king",".","Oraz","recruit","one","lad","from","each","kazakh","tribe","and","teach","they","the","art","of","war",",","loyalty",",","and","camaraderie",".","two","be","the","best",":","Mansur","and","Erali",".","they","be","like","brother",".","each","must","prove","himself",";","both","fall","in","love","with","the","same","young","woman",";","both","fall","into","enemy","hand",".","at","what","cost","do","a","prophecy","come","to","pass","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Rebirth of a","of a nation","Not since Genghis","since Genghis Khan","Genghis Khan has","Khan has anyone","has anyone united","anyone united the","united the Kazakh","the Kazakh tribes","Jungar tribesmen of","tribesmen of Mongolia","of Mongolia rule","Mongolia rule Kazakh","rule Kazakh land","Kazakh land ,","land , but",", but a","but a prophecy","a prophecy has","prophecy has it","has it that","it that a","that a descendant","a descendant of","descendant of Genghis","of Genghis will","Genghis will unite","will unite his","unite his people","Oraz the Wise","the Wise travels","Wise travels the","travels the land","the land looking","land looking for","looking for the","for the child","the child who","child who will","who will fulfill","will fulfill the","fulfill the prophecy","He finds that","finds that infant","that infant and","infant and protects","and protects him","protects him from","him from the","from the warriors","the warriors of","warriors of Galdan","of Galdan ,","Galdan , the",", the Jungar","the Jungar king","Oraz recruits one","recruits one lad","one lad from","lad from each","from each Kazakh","each Kazakh tribe","Kazakh tribe and","tribe and teaches","and teaches them","teaches them the","them the art","the art of","art of war","of war ,","war , loyalty",", loyalty ,","loyalty , and",", and camaraderie","Two are the","are the best","the best :","best : Mansur",": Mansur and","Mansur and Erali","They are like","are like brothers","Each must prove","must prove himself","prove himself ;","himself ;

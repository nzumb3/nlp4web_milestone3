{"title":"Viajero","plot":"Coined an Ambient Film by Kim Merlino, this is an experimental silent film inspired by 19th century poet Joaquin Miller, the flamboyant and controversial writer who spent a brief part of his life living near beautiful Mt Shasta.Viajero feels like a tale of magic realism and a visual excursion through the Siskiyous Mountains of Northern California. Evoking images both lyrical and powerful in their concrete immediacy and enigmatic randomness. It follows a Viajero (traveler in Spanish) walking through these landscapes interacting with and pausing at, its wonders, both natural and supernatural.","genres":["Drama"," Mystery"],"stems":["Coin","an","Ambient","Film","by","Kim","Merlino",",","this","is","an","experiment","silent","film","inspir","by","19th","centuri","poet","Joaquin","Miller",",","the","flamboy","and","controversi","writer","who","spent","a","brief","part","of","his","life","live","near","beauti","Mt","Shasta.Viajero","feel","like","a","tale","of","magic","realism","and","a","visual","excurs","through","the","Siskiy","Mountain","of","Northern","California",".","Evoke","imag","both","lyric","and","power","in","their","concret","immediaci","and","enigmat","random",".","It","follow","a","Viajero","(","travel","in","Spanish",")","walk","through","these","landscap","interact","with","and","paus","at",",","it","wonder",",","both","natur","and","supernatur","."],"lemmas":["coin","a","Ambient","Film","by","Kim","Merlino",",","this","be","a","experimental","silent","film","inspire","by","19th","century","poet","Joaquin","Miller",",","the","flamboyant","and","controversial","writer","who","spend","a","brief","part","of","he","life","living","near","beautiful","mt","shasta.viajero","feel","like","a","tale","of","magic","realism","and","a","visual","excursion","through","the","siskiyous","mountain","of","Northern","California",".","evoke","image","both","lyrical","and","powerful","in","they","concrete","immediacy","and","enigmatic","randomness",".","it","follow","a","viajero","-lrb-","traveler","in","Spanish","-rrb-","walk","through","these","landscape","interact","with","and","pause","at",",","its","wonder",",","both","natural","and","supernatural","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Coined an Ambient","an Ambient Film","Ambient Film by","Film by Kim","by Kim Merlino","Kim Merlino ,","Merlino , this",", this is","this is an","is an experimental","an experimental silent","experimental silent film","silent film inspired","film inspired by","inspired by 19th","by 19th century","19th century poet","century poet Joaquin","poet Joaquin Miller","Joaquin Miller ,","Miller , the",", the flamboyant","the flamboyant and","flamboyant and controversial","and controversial writer","controversial writer who","writer who spent","who spent a","spent a brief","a brief part","brief part of","part of his","of his life","his life living","life living near","living near beautiful","near beautiful Mt","beautiful Mt Shasta.Viajero","Mt Shasta.Viajero feels","Shasta.Viajero feels like","feels like a","like a tale","a tale of","tale of magic","of magic realism","magic realism and","realism and a","and a visual","a visual excursion","visual excursion through","excursion through the","through the Siskiyous","the Siskiyous Mountains","Siskiyous Mountains of","Mountains of Northern","of Northern California","Evoking images both","images both lyrical","both lyrical and","lyrical and powerful","and powerful in","powerful in their","in their concrete","their concrete immediacy","concrete immediacy and","immediacy and enigmatic","and enigmatic randomness","It follows a","follows a Viajero","a Viajero (","Viajero ( traveler","( traveler in","traveler in Spanish","in Spanish )","Spanish ) walking",") walking through","walking through these","through these landscapes","these landscapes interacting","landscapes interacting with","interacting with and","with and pausing","and pausing at","pausing at ,","at , its",", its wonders","its wonders ,","wonders , both",", both natural","both natural and","natural and supernatural"],"2grams":["Coined an","an Ambient","Ambient Film","Film by","by Kim","Kim Merlino","Merlino ,",", this","this is","is an","an experimental","experimental silent","silent film","film inspired","inspired by","by 19th","19th century","century poet","poet Joaquin","Joaquin Miller","Miller ,",", the","the flamboyant","flamboyant and","and controversial","controversial writer","writer who","who spent","spent a","a brief","brief part","part of","of his","his life","life living","living near","near beautiful","beautiful Mt","Mt Shasta.Viajero","Shasta.Viajero feels","feels like","like a","a tale","tale of","of magic","magic realism","realism and","and a","a visual","visual excursion","excursion through","through the","the Siskiyous","Siskiyous Mountains","Mountains of","of Northern","Northern California","Evoking images","images both","both lyrical","lyrical and","and powerful","powerful in","in their","their concrete","concrete immediacy","immediacy and","and enigmatic","enigmatic randomness","It follows","follows a","a Viajero","Viajero (","( traveler","traveler in","in Spanish","Spanish )",") walking","walking through","through these","these landscapes","landscapes interacting","interacting with","with and","and pausing","pausing at","at ,",", its","its wonders","wonders ,",", both","both natural","natural and","and supernatural"]}

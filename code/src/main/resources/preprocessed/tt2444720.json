{"title":"The Ukes Down Under","plot":"The Ukulele Orchestra of Great Britain played their first gig in 1985, and the world has been catching up with them ever since. Riding the global ukulele boom they did so much to inspire, in February 2012 the band embarked on their first World Tour, starting in Australia. Litmus Films filmed The Ukes throughout their two-week trip, capturing backstage mishaps, road trip adventures, jam sessions with local fans, guerrilla gigs at unlikely venues and standing ovations across the country including Sydney Opera House. This intimate, uplifting and entertaining film shows the band as they've never been seen before.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","Ukulel","Orchestra","of","Great","Britain","play","their","first","gig","in","1985",",","and","the","world","has","been","catch","up","with","them","ever","sinc",".","Ride","the","global","ukulel","boom","they","did","so","much","to","inspir",",","in","Februari","2012","the","band","embark","on","their","first","World","Tour",",","start","in","Australia",".","Litmus","Film","film","The","Ukes","throughout","their","two-week","trip",",","captur","backstag","mishap",",","road","trip","adventur",",","jam","session","with","local","fan",",","guerrilla","gig","at","unlik","venu","and","stand","ovat","across","the","countri","includ","Sydney","Opera","Hous",".","This","intim",",","uplift","and","entertain","film","show","the","band","as","they","ve","never","been","seen","befor","."],"lemmas":["the","Ukulele","Orchestra","of","Great","Britain","play","they","first","gig","in","1985",",","and","the","world","have","be","catch","up","with","they","ever","since",".","ride","the","global","ukulele","boom","they","do","so","much","to","inspire",",","in","February","2012","the","band","embark","on","they","first","World","Tour",",","start","in","Australia",".","litmus","film","film","the","Ukes","throughout","they","two-week","trip",",","capture","backstage","mishap",",","road","trip","adventure",",","jam","session","with","local","fan",",","guerrilla","gig","at","unlikely","venue","and","standing","ovation","across","the","country","include","Sydney","Opera","House",".","this","intimate",",","uplifting","and","entertaining","film","show","the","band","as","they","have","never","be","see","before","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The

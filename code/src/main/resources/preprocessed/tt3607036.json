{"title":"Salsa Giants","plot":"On 31 August 2012, several big names from the world of salsa came together for a unique reunion on Curaçao led by producer Sergio George. The reason: a concert at the Curaçao North Sea Jazz Festival that has already attained legendary status. On stage that day, no one less than hit singer Marc Anthony, flamboyant bassist Oscar D'León, Cheo Feliciano, Willy Chirino, Charlie Zaa, Jose Alberto 'El Canario', singer Tito Nieves, Nora from Orquesta de la Luz, Luis Enrique and Andy Montañez. US/Venezuelan director Pablo Croce has recorded this exceptional event in a gripping, intimate and above-all swinging documentary. Atmospheric black-and-white backstage images, rehearsal footage showing musical sparks flying, archive footage and personal interviews with musicians are rhythmically edited to form a dynamic whole. And to top it all off, Salsa Giants naturally includes beautiful footage of that exceptional concert at Curaçao North Sea Jazz.","genres":["Documentary"," Music","

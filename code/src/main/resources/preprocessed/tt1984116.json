{"title":"Backwater","plot":"Cass and Mark are a couple on a camping trip to the distant countryside. When their seemingly secluded getaway is interrupted by an ominous scream, they start to think someone might be stalking them, and encounter two strangers who are also in the woods near them. Despite everything appearing to be harmless, they can't shake the feeling that something is wrong. The truth, however, is far more disturbing than meets the eye.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"," Mystery"],"stems":["Cass","and","Mark","are","a","coupl","on","a","camp","trip","to","the","distant","countrysid",".","When","their","seem","seclud","getaway","is","interrupt","by","an","omin","scream",",","they","start","to","think","someon","might","be","stalk","them",",","and","encount","two","stranger","who","are","also","in","the","wood","near","them",".","Despit","everyth","appear","to","be","harmless",",","they","ca","n't","shake","the","feel","that","someth","is","wrong",".","The","truth",",","howev",",","is","far","more","disturb","than","meet","the","eye","."],"lemmas":["Cass","and","Mark","be","a","couple","on","a","camping","trip","to","the","distant","countryside",".","when","they","seemingly","secluded","getaway","be","interrupt","by","a","ominous","scream",",","they","start","to","think","someone","might","be","stalk","they",",","and","encounter","two","stranger","who","be","also","in","the","wood","near","they",".","despite","everything","appear","to","be","harmless",",","they","can","not","shake","the","feeling","that","something","be","wrong",".","the","truth",",","however",",","be","far","more","disturbing","than","meet","the","eye","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cass and Mark","and Mark are","Mark are a","are a couple","a couple on","couple on a","on a camping","a camping trip","camping trip to","trip to the","to the distant","the distant countryside","When their seemingly","their seemingly secluded","seemingly secluded getaway","secluded getaway is","getaway is interrupted","is interrupted by","interrupted by an","by an ominous","an ominous scream","ominous scream ,","scream , they",", they start","they start to","start to think","to think someone","think someone might","someone might be","might be stalking","be stalking them","stalking them ,","them , and",", and encounter","and encounter two","encounter two strangers","two strangers who","strangers who are","who are also","are also in","also in the","in the woods","the woods near","woods near them","Despite everything appearing","everything appearing to","appearing to be","to be harmless","be harmless ,","harmless , they",", they ca","they ca n't","ca n't shake","n't shake the","shake the feeling","the feeling that","feeling that something","that something is","something is wrong","The truth ,","truth , however",", however ,","however , is",", is far","is far more","far more disturbing","more disturbing than","disturbing than meets","than meets the","meets the eye"],"2grams":["Cass and","and Mark","Mark are","are a","a couple","couple on","on a","a camping","camping trip","trip to","to the","the distant","distant countryside","When their","their seemingly","seemingly secluded","secluded getaway","getaway is","is interrupted","interrupted by","by an","an ominous","ominous scream","scream ,",", they","they start","start to","to think","think someone","someone might","might be","be stalking","stalking them","them ,",", and","and encounter","encounter two","two strangers","strangers who","who are","are also","also in","in the","the woods","woods near","near them","Despite everything","everything appearing","appearing to","to be","be harmless","harmless ,",", they","they ca","ca n't","n't shake","shake the","the feeling","feeling that","that something","something is","is wrong","The truth","truth ,",", however","however ,",", is","is far","far more","more disturbing","disturbing than","than meets","meets the","the eye"]}

{"title":"Minotaur","plot":"Long ago in the Iron Age, a shadow loomed over a lonely village. For generations, the village youths are stolen from their families and delivered as sacrifice to a mythical beast - the Minotaur that dwells beneath a great palace. Theo, haunted by the loss of his love in an earlier sacrifice is convinced that the beast isn't real, and that his girl still lives as a slave within the palace. His father, Cyrnan, the village leader, tries to reason with Theo not to go, but Theo is driven by blind rage. He devises a plan and is taken with the other youths who are dragged screaming from their families.","genres":["Adventure"," Horror"," Fantasy"],"stems":["Long","ago","in","the","Iron","Age",",","a","shadow","loom","over","a","lone","villag",".","For","generat",",","the","villag","youth","are","stolen","from","their","famili","and","deliv","as","sacrific","to","a","mythic","beast","-","the","Minotaur","that","dwell","beneath","a","great","palac",".","Theo",",","haunt","by","the","loss","of","his","love","in","an","earlier","sacrific","is","convinc","that","the","beast","is","n't","real",",","and","that","his","girl","still","live","as","a","slave","within","the","palac",".","His","father",",","Cyrnan",",","the","villag","leader",",","tri","to","reason","with","Theo","not","to","go",",","but","Theo","is","driven","by","blind","rage",".","He","devis","a","plan","and","is","taken","with","the","other","youth","who","are","drag","scream","from","their","famili","."],"lemmas":["long","ago","in","the","Iron","Age",",","a","shadow","loom","over","a","lonely","village",".","for","generation",",","the","village","youth","be","steal","from","they","family","and","deliver","as","sacrifice","to","a","mythical","beast","-","the","minotaur","that","dwell","beneath","a","great","palace",".","Theo",",","haunt","by","the","loss","of","he","love","in","a","earlier","sacrifice","be","convince","that","the","beast","be","not","real",",","and","that","he","girl","still","live","as","a","slave","within","the","palace",".","he","father",",","Cyrnan",",","the","village","leader",",","try","to","reason","with","Theo","not","to","go",",","but","Theo","be","drive","by","blind","rage",".","he","devise","a","plan","and","be","take","with","the","other","youth","who","be","drag","scream","from","they","family","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Long ago in","ago in the","in the Iron","the Iron Age","Iron Age ,","Age , a",", a shadow","a shadow loomed","shadow loomed over","loomed over a","over a lonely","a lonely village","For generations ,","generations , the",", the village","the village youths","village youths are","youths are stolen","are stolen from","stolen from their","from their families","their families and","families and delivered","and delivered as","delivered as sacrifice","as sacrifice to","sacrifice to a","to a mythical","a mythical beast","mythical beast -","beast -

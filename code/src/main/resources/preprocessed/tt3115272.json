{"title":"Wicked Funny 2","plot":"In 2009, filmmaker Lisa Romagnoli documented the burgeoning comedy scene of Manchester, NH, in her short film 'Wicked Funny'. Three years later, she has checked back in with the comics from the first film to see how their comedy careers have developed. 'Wicked Funny 2' explores the challenges of developing from an open mic performer into a true comedian. Stand-up comedy is an art form not easily mastered, and the long journey the comics take leads them through frustration, failure, and self-examination. The film showcases the raw talent that exists in these comics, as the comics themselves reevaluate their own aspirations as they encounter the many hurdles that arise on the journey to becoming a successful comedian.","genres":["Comedy"," Documentary"],"stems":["In","2009",",","filmmak","Lisa","Romagnoli","document","the","burgeon","comedi","scene","of","Manchest",",","NH",",","in","her","short","film","'","Wick","Funni","'",".","Three","year","later",",","she","has","check","back","in","with","the","comic","from","the","first","film","to","see","how","their","comedi","career","have","develop",".","'","Wick","Funni","2","'","explor","the","challeng","of","develop","from","an","open","mic","perform","into","a","true","comedian",".","Stand-up","comedi","is","an","art","form","not","easili","master",",","and","the","long","journey","the","comic","take","lead","them","through","frustrat",",","failur",",","and","self-examin",".","The","film","showcas","the","raw","talent","that","exist","in","these","comic",",","as","the","comic","themselv","reevalu","their","own","aspir","as","they","encount","the","mani","hurdl","that","aris","on","the","journey","to","becom","a","success","comedian","."],"lemmas":["in","2009",",","filmmaker","Lisa","Romagnoli","document","the","burgeon","comedy","scene","of","Manchester",",","NH",",","in","she","short","film","'","Wicked","Funny","'",".","three","year","later",",","she","have","check","back","in","with","the","comic","from","the","first","film","to","see","how","they","comedy","career","have","develop",".","'","wicked","Funny","2","'","explore","the","challenge","of","develop","from","a","open","mic","performer","into","a","true","comedian",".","stand-up","comedy","be","a","art","form","not","easily","master",",","and","the","long","journey","the","comic","take","lead","they","through","frustration",",","failure",",","and","self-examination",".","the","film","showcase","the","raw","talent","that","exist","in","these","comic",",","as","the","comic","themselves","reevaluate","they","own","aspiration","as","they","encounter","the","many","hurdle","that","arise","on","the","journey","to","become","a","successful","comedian","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["In 2009 ,","2009 , filmmaker",", filmmaker Lisa","filmmaker Lisa Romagnoli","Lisa Romagnoli documented","Romagnoli documented the","documented the burgeoning","the burgeoning comedy","burgeoning comedy scene","comedy scene of","scene of Manchester","of Manchester ,","Manchester , NH",", NH ,","NH , in",", in her","in her short","her short film","short film '","film ' Wicked","' Wicked Funny","Wicked Funny '","Three years later","years later ,","later , she",", she has","she has checked","has checked back","checked back in","back in with","in with the","with the comics","the comics from","comics from the","from the first","the first film","first film to","film to see","to see how","see how their","how their comedy","their comedy careers","comedy careers have","careers have developed","have developed .","developed .

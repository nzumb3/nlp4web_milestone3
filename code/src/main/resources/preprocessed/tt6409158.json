{"title":"From India with Love","plot":"Six Americans from varied backgrounds - a single mother whose son was murdered in a tragic school shooting (from Sandy Hook) and her friend (from Atlanta), an ex-gang leader (from Los Angeles), an educator (from Newark), and two advocates of the Movement for Black Lives (both from Oakland) - who have all experienced violence come together for a shared experience of healing and transformation during a 10-day pilgrimage to India, following the intention behind Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he had visited India to deepen his understanding of nonviolence, nearly sixty years ago. What will they discover in India that can help reinvigorate nonviolence in America today?","genres":["Crime"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Six","American","from","vari","background","-","a","singl","mother","whose","son","was","murder","in","a","tragic","school","shoot","(","from","Sandi","Hook",")","and","her","friend","(","from","Atlanta",")",",","an","ex-gang","leader","(","from","Los","Angele",")",",","an","educ","(","from","Newark",")",",","and","two","advoc","of","the","Movement","for","Black","Live","(","both","from","Oakland",")","-","who","have","all","experienc","violenc","come","togeth","for","a","share","experi","of","heal","and","transform","dure","a","10-day","pilgrimag","to","India",",","follow","the","intent","behind","Rev.","Martin","Luther","King","Jr.","when","he","had","visit","India","to","deepen","his","understand","of","nonviol",",","near","sixti","year","ago",".","What","will","they","discov","in","India","that","can","help","reinvigor","nonviol","in","America","today","?"],"lemmas":["six","Americans","from","varied","background","-","a","single","mother","whose","son","be","murder","in","a","tragic","school","shooting","-lrb-","from","Sandy","Hook","-rrb-","and","she","friend","-lrb-","from","Atlanta","-rrb-",",","a","ex-gang","leader","-lrb-","from","Los","Angeles","-rrb-",",","a","educator","-lrb-","from","Newark","-rrb-",",","and","two","advocate","of","the","Movement","for","black","life","-lrb-","both","from","Oakland","-rrb-","-","who","have","all","experienced","violence","come","together","for","a","shared","experience","of","healing","and","transformation","during","a","10-day","pilgrimage","to","India",",","follow","the","intention","behind","Rev.","Martin","Luther","King","Jr.","when","he","have","visit","India","to","deepen","he","understanding","of","nonviolence",",","nearly","sixty","year","ago",".","what","will","they","discover","in","India","that","can","help","reinvigorate","nonviolence","in","America","today","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Six Americans from","Americans from varied","from varied backgrounds","varied backgrounds -","backgrounds - a","- a single","a single mother","single mother whose","mother whose son","whose son was","son was murdered","was murdered in","murdered in a","in a tragic","a tragic school","tragic school shooting","school shooting (","shooting ( from","( from Sandy","from Sandy Hook","Sandy Hook )","Hook ) and",") and her","and her friend","her friend (","friend ( from","( from Atlanta","from Atlanta )","Atlanta ) ,",") , an",", an ex-gang","an ex-gang leader","ex-gang leader (","leader ( from","( from Los","from Los Angeles","Los Angeles )","Angeles ) ,",") , an",", an educator","an educator (","educator ( from","( from Newark","from Newark )","Newark ) ,",") , and",", and two","and two advocates","two advocates of","advocates of the","of the Movement","the Movement for","Movement for Black","for Black Lives","Black Lives (","Lives ( both","( both from","both from Oakland","from Oakland )","Oakland ) -",") - who","- who have","who have all","have all experienced","all experienced violence","experienced violence come","violence come together","come together for","together for a","for a shared","a shared experience","shared experience of","experience of healing","of healing and","healing and transformation","and transformation during","transformation during a","during a 10-day","a 10-day pilgrimage","10-day pilgrimage to","pilgrimage to India","to India ,","India , following",", following the","following the intention","the intention behind","intention behind Rev.","behind Rev.

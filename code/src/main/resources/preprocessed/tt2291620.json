{"title":"Wandering","plot":"'Wandering' depicts the curious tragedy of a historical injustice victim, a man living in Diaspora. Christianity, immortality of soul, human sins and trespasses, historical injustices, love and purification - these topics are the ideological basis of the film. 'Wandering' belongs to the farcical and tragicomic genre and is exceptional in its style. 'Wandering' has a structure typical of classical opera: an overture, duets, trios, arias and choral performances with clear development and ideology. 'Wandering' is the first such a film in the region.","genres":["Fantasy"," Musical"],"stems":["'","Wander","'","depict","the","curious","tragedi","of","a","histor","injustic","victim",",","a","man","live","in","Diaspora",".","Christian",",","immort","of","soul",",","human","sin","and","trespass",",","histor","injustic",",","love","and","purif","-","these","topic","are","the","ideolog","basi","of","the","film",".","'","Wander","'","belong","to","the","farcic","and","tragicom","genr","and","is","except","in","it","style",".","'","Wander","'","has","a","structur","typic","of","classic","opera",":","an","overtur",",","duet",",","trio",",","aria","and","choral","perform","with","clear","develop","and","ideolog",".","'","Wander","'","is","the","first","such","a","film","in","the","region","."],"lemmas":["'","wander","'","depict","the","curious","tragedy","of","a","historical","injustice","victim",",","a","man","live","in","Diaspora",".","Christianity",",","immortality","of","soul",",","human","sin","and","trespass",",","historical","injustice",",","love","and","purification","-","these","topic","be","the","ideological","basis","of","the","film",".","'","wander","'","belong","to","the","farcical","and","tragicomic","genre","and","be","exceptional","in","its","style",".","'","wander","'","have","a","structure","typical","of","classical","opera",":","a","overture",",","duet",",","trio",",","aria","and","choral","performance","with","clear","development","and","ideology",".","'","wander","'","be","the","first","such","a","film","in","the","region","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["' Wandering '","Wandering ' depicts","' depicts the","depicts the curious","the curious tragedy","curious tragedy of","tragedy of a","of a historical","a historical injustice","historical injustice victim","injustice victim ,","victim , a",", a man","a man living","man living in","living in Diaspora","Christianity , immortality",", immortality of","immortality of soul","of soul ,","soul , human",", human sins","human sins and","sins and trespasses","and trespasses ,","trespasses , historical",", historical injustices","historical injustices ,","injustices , love",", love and","love and purification","and purification -","purification - these","- these topics","these topics are","topics are the","are the ideological","the ideological basis","ideological basis of","basis of the","of the film","the film .","film .

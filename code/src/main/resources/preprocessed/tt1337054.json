{"title":"Lost in Winesburg","plot":"Sherwood Anderson's Winesburg, Ohio (1919) is a minor classic in American literature. Challenging the mores of small-town life, the book was banned in Anderson's own hometown of Clyde, Ohio. Lost in Winesburg looks at the enduring legacy of Anderson's book by examining present day small-town Ohio, where a film crew attempts to adapt Winesburg, Ohio for the screen. We follow both the production as it takes some unfortunate turns and the residents of Clyde, who grapple with their hometown hero and his portrait of their way of life. Lost in Winesburg confronts the possibility that some stories are best left untold.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Sherwood","Anderson","'s","Winesburg",",","Ohio","(","1919",")","is","a","minor","classic","in","American","literatur",".","Challeng","the","more","of","small-town","life",",","the","book","was","ban","in","Anderson","'s","own","hometown","of","Clyde",",","Ohio",".","Lost","in","Winesburg","look","at","the","endur","legaci","of","Anderson","'s","book","by","examin","present","day","small-town","Ohio",",","where","a","film","crew","attempt","to","adapt","Winesburg",",","Ohio","for","the","screen",".","We","follow","both","the","product","as","it","take","some","unfortun","turn","and","the","resid","of","Clyde",",","who","grappl","with","their","hometown","hero","and","his","portrait","of","their","way","of","life",".","Lost","in","Winesburg","confront","the","possibl","that","some","stori","are","best","left","untold","."],"lemmas":["Sherwood","Anderson","'s","Winesburg",",","Ohio","-lrb-","1919","-rrb-","be","a","minor","classic","in","american","literature",".","challenge","the","mores","of","small-town","life",",","the","book","be","ban","in","Anderson","'s","own","hometown","of","Clyde",",","Ohio",".","Lost","in","Winesburg","look","at","the","enduring","legacy","of","Anderson","'s","book","by","examine","present","day","small-town","Ohio",",","where","a","film","crew","attempt","to","adapt","Winesburg",",","Ohio","for","the","screen",".","we","follow","both","the","production","as","it","take","some","unfortunate","turn","and","the","resident","of","Clyde",",","who","grapple","with","they","hometown","hero","and","he","portrait","of","they","way","of","life",".","Lost","in","Winesburg","confront","the","possibility","that","some","story","be","best","leave","untold","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Sherwood

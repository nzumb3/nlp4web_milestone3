{"title":"The Only Son","plot":"Pema, 19, is supposed to marry a girl from home, a Nepali Himalayan village at an altitude of 13,000 feet. Pema grew up in a Kathmandu orphanage as poverty and illness forced his parents to give most of their 6 children away. Today, the unusual family is scattered around the globe. It would be the only son's duty to tend to the family home in the mountains. But Pema wants to study abroad, and live a modern life.","genres":["Documentary"," Drama"],"stems":["Pema",",","19",",","is","suppos","to","marri","a","girl","from","home",",","a","Nepali","Himalayan","villag","at","an","altitud","of","13,000","feet",".","Pema","grew","up","in","a","Kathmandu","orphanag","as","poverti","and","ill","forc","his","parent","to","give","most","of","their","6","children","away",".","Today",",","the","unusu","famili","is","scatter","around","the","globe",".","It","would","be","the","onli","son","'s","duti","to","tend","to","the","famili","home","in","the","mountain",".","But","Pema","want","to","studi","abroad",",","and","live","a","modern","life","."],"lemmas":["Pema",",","19",",","be","suppose","to","marry","a","girl","from","home",",","a","Nepali","Himalayan","village","at","a","altitude","of","13,000","foot",".","Pema","grow","up","in","a","Kathmandu","orphanage","as","poverty","and","illness","force","he","parent","to","give","most","of","they","6","child","away",".","today",",","the","unusual","family","be","scatter","around","the","globe",".","it","would","be","the","only","son","'s","duty","to","tend","to","the","family","home","in","the","mountain",".","but","Pema","want","to","study","abroad",",","and","live","a","modern","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Pema , 19",", 19 ,","19 , is",", is supposed","is supposed to","supposed to marry","to marry a","marry a girl","a girl from","girl from home","from home ,","home , a",", a Nepali","a Nepali Himalayan","Nepali Himalayan village","Himalayan village at","village at an","at an altitude","an altitude of","altitude of 13,000","of 13,000 feet","Pema grew up","grew up in","up in a","in a Kathmandu","a Kathmandu orphanage","Kathmandu orphanage as","orphanage as poverty","as poverty and","poverty and illness","and illness forced","illness forced his","forced his parents","his parents to","parents to give","to give most","give most of","most of their","of their 6","their 6 children","6 children away","Today , the",", the unusual","the unusual family","unusual family is","family is scattered","is scattered around","scattered around the","around the globe","It would be","would be the","be the only","the only son","only son 's","son 's duty","'s duty to","duty to tend","to tend to","tend to the","to the family","the family home","family home in","home in the","in the mountains","But Pema wants","Pema wants to","wants to study","to study abroad","study abroad ,","abroad , and",", and live","and live a","live a modern","a modern life"],"2grams":["Pema ,",", 19","19 ,",", is","is supposed","supposed to","to marry","marry a","a girl","girl from","from home","home ,",", a","a Nepali","Nepali Himalayan","Himalayan village","village at","at an","an altitude","altitude of","of 13,000","13,000 feet","Pema grew","grew up","up in","in a","a Kathmandu","Kathmandu orphanage","orphanage as","as poverty","poverty and","and illness","illness forced","forced his","his parents","parents to","to give","give most","most of","of their","their 6","6 children","children away","Today ,",", the","the unusual","unusual family","family is","is scattered","scattered around","around the","the globe","It would","would be","be the","the only","only son","son 's","'s duty","duty to","to tend","tend to","to the","the family","family home","home in","in the","the mountains","But Pema","Pema wants","wants to","to study","study abroad","abroad ,",", and","and live","live a","a modern","modern life"]}

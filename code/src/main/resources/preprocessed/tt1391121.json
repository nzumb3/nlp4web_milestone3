{"title":"Small Talk","plot":"Small Talk takes a look at post college annui and the choices that have to be made in order to move on with life. George, Dana, Shak, Erin, and Jess find themselves stuck in a kind of arrested development. They hate their jobs, their prospects, and their lives. The only real joy that anyone has is the friendships that they've sustained through the years; but even those must be looked at carefully if any of this group is to move on to the next stage of life.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Small","Talk","take","a","look","at","post","colleg","annui","and","the","choic","that","have","to","be","made","in","order","to","move","on","with","life",".","Georg",",","Dana",",","Shak",",","Erin",",","and","Jess","find","themselv","stuck","in","a","kind","of","arrest","develop",".","They","hate","their","job",",","their","prospect",",","and","their","live",".","The","onli","real","joy","that","anyon","has","is","the","friendship","that","they","ve","sustain","through","the","year",";","but","even","those","must","be","look","at","care","if","ani","of","this","group","is","to","move","on","to","the","next","stage","of","life","."],"lemmas":["small","talk","take","a","look","at","post","college","annui","and","the","choice","that","have","to","be","make","in","order","to","move","on","with","life",".","George",",","Dana",",","Shak",",","Erin",",","and","Jess","find","themselves","stick","in","a","kind","of","arrest","development",".","they","hate","they","job",",","they","prospects",",","and","they","life",".","the","only","real","joy","that","anyone","have","be","the","friendship","that","they","have","sustain","through","the","year",";","but","even","those","must","be","look","at","carefully","if","any","of","this","group","be","to","move","on","to","the","next","stage","of","life","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Small Talk takes","Talk takes a","takes a look","a look at","look at post","at post college","post college annui","college annui and","annui and the","and the choices","the choices that","choices that have","that have to","have to be","to be made","be made in","made in order","in order to","order to move","to move on","move on with","on with life","George , Dana",", Dana ,","Dana , Shak",", Shak ,","Shak , Erin",", Erin ,","Erin , and",", and Jess","and Jess find","Jess find themselves","find themselves stuck","themselves stuck in","stuck in a","in a kind","a kind of","kind of arrested","of arrested development","They hate their","hate their jobs","their jobs ,","jobs , their",", their prospects","their prospects ,","prospects , and",", and their","and their lives","The only real","only real joy","real joy that","joy that anyone","that anyone has","anyone has is","has is the","is the friendships","the friendships that","friendships that they","that they 've","they 've sustained","'ve sustained through","sustained through the","through the years","the years ;","years ; but","; but even","but even those","even those must","those must be","must be looked","be looked at","looked at carefully","at carefully if","carefully if any","if any of","any of this","of this group","this group is","group is to","is to move","to move on","move on to","on to the","to the next","the next stage","next stage of","stage of life"],"2grams":["Small Talk","Talk takes","takes a","a look","look at","at post","post college","college annui","annui and","and the","the choices","choices that","that have","have to","to be","be made","made in","in order","order to","to move","move on","on with","with life","George ,",", Dana","Dana ,",", Shak","Shak ,",", Erin","Erin ,",", and","and Jess","Jess find","find themselves","themselves stuck","stuck in","in a","a kind","kind of","of arrested","arrested development","They hate","hate their","their jobs","jobs ,",", their","their prospects","prospects ,",", and","and their","their lives","The only","only real","real joy","joy that","that anyone","anyone has","has is","is the","the friendships","friendships that","that they","they 've","'ve sustained","sustained through","through the","the years","years ;","; but","but even","even those","those must","must be","be looked","looked at","at carefully","carefully if","if any","any of","of this","this group","group is","is to","to move","move on","on to","to the","the next","next stage","stage of","of life"]}

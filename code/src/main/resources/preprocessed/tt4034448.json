{"title":"Neverside","plot":"Nevercyde is an original screenplay written by Josiah David Warren. As a music bard himself, he writes the tale of a young, rock band scraping along doing whatever gigs they can find in local clubs. Between pickup girls and bar scene temptations of drugs and alcohol, these aspiring rock musicians find themselves at odds with each other and facing down an ugly drug dealer. What results in tragedy brings about maturity, sobering reality and a message for every youth.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["Nevercyd","is","an","origin","screenplay","written","by","Josiah","David","Warren",".","As","a","music","bard","himself",",","he","write","the","tale","of","a","young",",","rock","band","scrape","along","do","whatev","gig","they","can","find","in","local","club",".","Between","pickup","girl","and","bar","scene","temptat","of","drug","and","alcohol",",","these","aspir","rock","musician","find","themselv","at","odd","with","each","other","and","face","down","an","ugli","drug","dealer",".","What","result","in","tragedi","bring","about","matur",",","sober","realiti","and","a","messag","for","everi","youth","."],"lemmas":["Nevercyde","be","a","original","screenplay","write","by","Josiah","David","Warren",".","as","a","music","bard","himself",",","he","write","the","tale","of","a","young",",","rock","band","scrape","along","do","whatever","gig","they","can","find","in","local","club",".","between","pickup","girl","and","bar","scene","temptation","of","drug","and","alcohol",",","these","aspire","rock","musician","find","themselves","at","odds","with","each","other","and","face","down","a","ugly","drug","dealer",".","what","result","in","tragedy","bring","about","maturity",",","sobering","reality","and","a","message","for","every","youth","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Nevercyde is an","is an original","an original screenplay","original screenplay written","screenplay written by","written by Josiah","by Josiah David","Josiah David Warren","As a music","a music bard","music bard himself","bard himself ,","himself , he",", he writes","he writes the","writes the tale","the tale of","tale of a","of a young","a young ,","young , rock",", rock band","rock band scraping","band scraping along","scraping along doing","along doing whatever","doing whatever gigs","whatever gigs they","gigs they can","they can find","can find in","find in local","in local clubs","Between pickup girls","pickup girls and","girls and bar","and bar scene","bar scene temptations","scene temptations of","temptations of drugs","of drugs and","drugs and alcohol","and alcohol ,","alcohol , these",", these aspiring","these aspiring rock","aspiring rock musicians","rock musicians find","musicians find themselves","find themselves at","themselves at odds","at odds with","odds with each","with each other","each other and","other and facing","and facing down","facing down an","down an ugly","an ugly drug","ugly drug dealer","What results in","results in tragedy","in tragedy brings","tragedy brings about","brings about maturity","about maturity ,","maturity , sobering",", sobering reality","sobering reality and","reality and a","and a message","a message for","message for every","for every youth"],"2grams":["Nevercyde is","is an","an original","original screenplay","screenplay written","written by","by Josiah","Josiah David","David Warren","As a","a music","music bard","bard himself","himself ,",", he","he writes","writes the","the tale","tale of","of a","a young","young ,",", rock","rock band","band scraping","scraping along","along doing","doing whatever","whatever gigs","gigs they","they can","can find","find in","in local","local clubs","Between pickup","pickup girls","girls and","and bar","bar scene","scene temptations","temptations of","of drugs","drugs and","and alcohol","alcohol ,",", these","these aspiring","aspiring rock","rock musicians","musicians find","find themselves","themselves at","at odds","odds with","with each","each other","other and","and facing","facing down","down an","an ugly","ugly drug","drug dealer","What results","results in","in tragedy","tragedy brings","brings about","about maturity","maturity ,",", sobering","sobering reality","reality and","and a","a message","message for","for every","every youth"]}

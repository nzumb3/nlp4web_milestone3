{"title":"Isn't It Delicious","plot":"When Joan Weldon discovers she is dying of lung cancer, she sets out to reconcile her dysfunctional relationships with her three children, her husband, and along the way, her former best friend. The family's destructive ways are offset by messy and somewhat humorous attempts by Joan to set her children on the right course before she dies. In this big dysfunctional mix, they will all learn to connect in their own ways, and realize on their own terms what life is about.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["When","Joan","Weldon","discov","she","is","die","of","lung","cancer",",","she","set","out","to","reconcil","her","dysfunct","relationship","with","her","three","children",",","her","husband",",","and","along","the","way",",","her","former","best","friend",".","The","famili","'s","destruct","way","are","offset","by","messi","and","somewhat","humor","attempt","by","Joan","to","set","her","children","on","the","right","cours","befor","she","die",".","In","this","big","dysfunct","mix",",","they","will","all","learn","to","connect","in","their","own","way",",","and","realiz","on","their","own","term","what","life","is","about","."],"lemmas":["when","Joan","Weldon","discover","she","be","die","of","lung","cancer",",","she","set","out","to","reconcile","she","dysfunctional","relationship","with","she","three","child",",","she","husband",",","and","along","the","way",",","she","former","best","friend",".","the","family","'s","destructive","way","be","offset","by","messy","and","somewhat","humorous","attempt","by","Joan","to","set","she","child","on","the","right","course","before","she","die",".","in","this","big","dysfunctional","mix",",","they","will","all","learn","to","connect","in","they","own","way",",","and","realize","on","they","own","term","what","life","be","about","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["When Joan Weldon","Joan Weldon discovers","Weldon discovers she","discovers she is","she is dying","is dying of","dying of lung","of lung cancer","lung cancer ,","cancer , she",", she sets","she sets out","sets out to","out to reconcile","to reconcile her","reconcile her dysfunctional","her dysfunctional relationships","dysfunctional relationships with","relationships with her","with her three","her three children","three children ,","children , her",", her husband","her husband ,","husband , and",", and along","and along the","along the way","the way ,","way , her",", her former","her former best","former best friend","The family 's","family 's destructive","'s destructive ways","destructive ways are","ways are offset","are offset by","offset by messy","by messy and","messy and somewhat","and somewhat humorous","somewhat humorous attempts","humorous attempts by","attempts by Joan","by Joan to","Joan to set","to set her","set her children","her children on","children on the","on the right","the right course","right course before","course before she","before she dies","In this big","this big dysfunctional","big dysfunctional mix","dysfunctional mix ,","mix , they",", they will","they will all","will all learn","all learn to","learn to connect","to connect in","connect in their","in their own","their own ways","own ways ,","ways , and",", and realize","and realize on","realize on their","on their own","their own terms","own terms what","terms what life","what life is","life is about"],"2grams":["When Joan","Joan Weldon","Weldon discovers","discovers she","she is","is dying","dying of","of lung","lung cancer","cancer ,",", she","she sets","sets out","out to","to reconcile","reconcile her","her dysfunctional","dysfunctional relationships","relationships with","with her","her three","three children","children ,",", her","her husband","husband ,",", and","and along","along the","the way","way ,",", her","her former","former best","best friend","The family","family 's","'s destructive","destructive ways","ways are","are offset","offset by","by messy","messy and","and somewhat","somewhat humorous","humorous attempts","attempts by","by Joan","Joan to","to set","set her","her children","children on","on the","the right","right course","course before","before she","she dies","In this","this big","big dysfunctional","dysfunctional mix","mix ,",", they","they will","will all","all learn","learn to","to connect","connect in","in their","their own","own ways","ways ,",", and","and realize","realize on","on their","their own","own terms","terms what","what life","life is","is about"]}

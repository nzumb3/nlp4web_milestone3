{"title":"Bez semeyna prilika","plot":"The film deals with a story about unusual meeting of two people from Europe. The protagonists are a man and a woman who came to encounter each other. She is a Bulgarian journalist, about 35 old, divorced, without children. He is a 10-year-old boy from Sweden, whose father was her love for a lifetime. This is a film about the present-day wars, affecting our lives even though we haven't a hand in it. It is also a story about the iron curtain - invisible but still existing. Emigrants, wars, hate, anguish, loneliness, fear, drugs, skinheads - is this the word we have created? The East and the West come into inevitable collision. According to the official, who often predetermine our lives, the woman and the boy have no future together as they lack any family resemblance.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["The","film","deal","with","a","stori","about","unusu","meet","of","two","peopl","from","Europ",".","The","protagonist","are","a","man","and","a","woman","who","came","to","encount","each","other",".","She","is","a","Bulgarian","journalist",",","about","35","old",",","divorc",",","without","children",".","He","is","a","10-year-old","boy","from","Sweden",",","whose","father","was","her","love","for","a","lifetim",".","This","is","a","film","about","the","present-day","war",",","affect","our","live","even","though","we","have","n't","a","hand","in","it",".","It","is","also","a","stori","about","the","iron","curtain","-","invis","but","still","exist",".","Emigrant",",","war",",","hate",",","anguish",",","loneli",",","fear",",","drug",",","skinhead","-","is","this","the","word","we","have","creat","?","The","East","and","the","West","come","into","inevit","collis",".","Accord","to","the","offici",",","who","often","predetermin","our","live",",","the","woman","and","the","boy","have","no","futur","togeth","as","they","lack","ani","famili","resembl","."],"lemmas":["the","film","deal","with","a","story","about","unusual","meeting","of","two","people","from","Europe",".","the","protagonist","be","a","man","and","a","woman","who","come","to","encounter","each","other",".","she","be","a","bulgarian","journalist",",","about","35","old",",","divorce",",","without","child",".","he","be","a","10-year-old","boy","from","Sweden",",","whose","father","be","she","love","for","a","lifetime",".","this","be","a","film","about","the","present-day","war",",","affect","we","life","even","though","we","have","not","a","hand","in","it",".","it","be","also","a","story","about","the","iron","curtain","-","invisible","but","still","exist",".","emigrant",",","war",",","hate",",","anguish",",","loneliness",",","fear",",","drug",",","skinhead","-","be","this","the","word","we","have","create","?","the","East","and","the","west","come","into","inevitable","collision",".","accord","to","the","official",",","who","often","predetermine","we","life",",","the","woman","and","the","boy","have","no","future","together","as","they","lack","any","family","resemblance","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The film deals","film deals with","deals with a","with a story","a story about","story about unusual","about unusual meeting","unusual meeting of","meeting of two","of two people","two people from","people from Europe","The protagonists are","protagonists are a","are a man","a man and","man and a","and a woman","a woman who","woman who came","who came to","came to encounter","to encounter each","encounter each other","She is a","is a Bulgarian","a Bulgarian journalist","Bulgarian journalist ,","journalist , about",", about 35","about 35 old","35 old ,","old , divorced",", divorced ,","divorced , without",", without children","He is a","is a 10-year-old","a 10-year-old boy","10-year-old boy from","boy from Sweden","from Sweden ,","Sweden , whose",", whose father","whose father was","father was her","was her love","her love for","love for a","for a lifetime","This is a","is a film","a film about","film about the","about the present-day","the present-day wars","present-day wars ,","wars , affecting",", affecting our","affecting our lives","our lives even","lives even though","even though we","though we have","we have n't","have n't a","n't a hand","a hand in","hand in it","It is also","is also a","also a story","a story about","story about the","about the iron","the iron curtain","iron curtain -","curtain -

MISCELLANEOUS Productions' professional artists collaborate with East Vancouver at-risk youth, working diligently to create and present a hip hop musical satirizing the Japanese Iron Chef television show. Just as all looks promising, the main funding for the play falls through and Dakota, a 15-year-old Indigenous youth performer, disappears. MISCELLANEOUS Productions struggles to replace the funding despite opposition from politicians that deny such work to be a priority. Meanwhile, the young performers strive to achieve some meaning and value in their lives.

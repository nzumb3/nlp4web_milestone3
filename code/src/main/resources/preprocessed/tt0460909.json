{"title":"Prisoner","plot":"Notorious Hollywood bad boy Darek Playto is captured by a mysterious Jailer while scouting a decrepit, abandoned prison for an upcoming film. Playto is a volatile visionary whose controversial reputation has earned him more than his fair share of enemies in the entertainment industry. In preparation for his upcoming feature film - a violent prison drama - Playto sets out to find the perfect surroundings in which to tell his brutal tale. Upon discovering a dilapidated prison that was once a notorious house of pain, it appears that Playto has found just such a location. But Playto isn't alone in this crumbling penitentiary, and upon being captured by the Jailer the director's only hope for escape is to answer a series of increasingly intimate questions concerning his art and his life.","genres":["Horror"," Thriller"],"stems":["Notori","Hollywood","bad","boy","Darek","Playto","is","captur","by","a","mysteri","Jailer","while","scout","a","decrepit",",","abandon","prison","for","an","upcom","film",".","Playto","is","a","volatil","visionari","whose","controversi","reput","has","earn","him","more","than","his","fair","share","of","enemi","in","the","entertain","industri",".","In","prepar","for","his","upcom","featur","film","-","a","violent","prison","drama","-","Playto","set","out","to","find","the","perfect","surround","in","which","to","tell","his","brutal","tale",".","Upon","discov","a","dilapid","prison","that","was","onc","a","notori","hous","of","pain",",","it","appear","that","Playto","has","found","just","such","a","locat",".","But","Playto","is","n't","alon","in","this","crumbl","penitentiari",",","and","upon","be","captur","by","the","Jailer","the","director","'s","onli","hope","for","escap","is","to","answer","a","seri","of","increas","intim","question","concern","his","art","and","his","life","."],"lemmas":["notorious","Hollywood","bad","boy","Darek","Playto","be","capture","by","a","mysterious","jailer","while","scout","a","decrepit",",","abandoned","prison","for","a","upcoming","film",".","Playto","be","a","volatile","visionary","whose","controversial","reputation","have","earn","he","more","than","he","fair","share","of","enemy","in","the","entertainment","industry",".","in","preparation","for","he","upcoming","feature","film","-","a","violent","prison","drama","-","Playto","set","out","to","find","the","perfect","surroundings","in","which","to","tell","he","brutal","tale",".","upon","discover","a","dilapidated","prison","that","be","once","a","notorious","house","of","pain",",","it","appear","that","Playto","have","find","just","such","a","location",".","but","Playto","be","not","alone","in","this","crumble","penitentiary",",","and","upon","be","capture","by","the","Jailer","the","director","'s","only","hope","for","escape","be","to","answer","a","series","of","increasingly","intimate","question","concern","he","art","and","he","life","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Notorious Hollywood bad","Hollywood bad boy","bad boy Darek","boy Darek Playto","Darek Playto is","Playto is captured","is captured by","captured by a","by a mysterious","a mysterious Jailer","mysterious Jailer while","Jailer while scouting","while scouting a","scouting a decrepit","a decrepit ,","decrepit , abandoned",", abandoned prison","abandoned prison for","prison for an","for an upcoming","an upcoming film","Playto is a","is a volatile","a volatile visionary","volatile visionary whose","visionary whose controversial","whose controversial reputation","controversial reputation has","reputation has earned","has earned him","earned him more","him more than","more than his","than his fair","his fair share","fair share of","share of enemies","of enemies in","enemies in the","in the entertainment","the entertainment industry","In preparation for","preparation for his","for his upcoming","his upcoming feature","upcoming feature film","feature film -","film -

{"title":"Where the Sea Used to Be","plot":"Two brothers meet up for the obligatory Christmas Eve pint and find themselves spending that day together. They don't discuss the big issues. The mysteries of the universe are not uncovered. No great wounds are healed nor sins forgiven. But gradually we learn everything important there is to know about these two men, their pasts and their futures. There are a few jokes and a song or two. Nobody gets too drunk. But the boys do meet Santy. Briefly. And their Auntie Betty cooks them a fry.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","brother","meet","up","for","the","obligatori","Christma","Eve","pint","and","find","themselv","spend","that","day","togeth",".","They","do","n't","discuss","the","big","issu",".","The","mysteri","of","the","univers","are","not","uncov",".","No","great","wound","are","heal","nor","sin","forgiven",".","But","gradual","we","learn","everyth","import","there","is","to","know","about","these","two","men",",","their","past","and","their","futur",".","There","are","a","few","joke","and","a","song","or","two",".","Nobodi","get","too","drunk",".","But","the","boy","do","meet","Santi",".","Briefli",".","And","their","Aunti","Betti","cook","them","a","fri","."],"lemmas":["two","brother","meet","up","for","the","obligatory","Christmas","Eve","pint","and","find","themselves","spend","that","day","together",".","they","do","not","discuss","the","big","issue",".","the","mystery","of","the","universe","be","not","uncover",".","no","great","wound","be","heal","nor","sin","forgive",".","but","gradually","we","learn","everything","important","there","be","to","know","about","these","two","man",",","they","past","and","they","future",".","there","be","a","few","joke","and","a","song","or","two",".","nobody","get","too","drunk",".","but","the","boy","do","meet","Santy",".","briefly",".","and","they","Auntie","Betty","cook","they","a","fry","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Two brothers meet","brothers meet up","meet up for","up for the","for the obligatory","the obligatory Christmas","obligatory Christmas Eve","Christmas Eve pint","Eve pint and","pint and find","and find themselves","find themselves spending","themselves spending that","spending that day","that day together","They do n't","do n't discuss","n't discuss the","discuss the big","the big issues","The mysteries of","mysteries of the","of the universe","the universe are","universe are not","are not uncovered","No great wounds","great wounds are","wounds are healed","are healed nor","healed nor sins","nor sins forgiven","But gradually we","gradually we learn","we learn everything","learn everything important","everything important there","important there is","there is to","is to know","to know about","know about these","about these two","these two men","two men ,","men , their",", their pasts","their pasts and","pasts and their","and their futures","There are a","are a few","a few jokes","few jokes and","jokes and a","and a song","a song or","song or two","Nobody gets too","gets too drunk","But the boys","the boys do","boys do meet","do meet Santy","And their Auntie","their Auntie Betty","Auntie Betty cooks","Betty cooks them","cooks them a","them a fry"],"2grams":["Two brothers","brothers meet","meet up","up for","for the","the obligatory","obligatory Christmas","Christmas Eve","Eve pint","pint and","and find","find themselves","themselves spending","spending that","that day","day together","They do","do n't","n't discuss","discuss the","the big","big issues","The mysteries","mysteries of","of the","the universe","universe are","are not","not uncovered","No great","great wounds","wounds are","are healed","healed nor","nor sins","sins forgiven","But gradually","gradually we","we learn","learn everything","everything important","important there","there is","is to","to know","know about","about these","these two","two men","men ,",", their","their pasts","pasts and","and their","their futures","There are","are a","a few","few jokes","jokes and","and a","a song","song or","or two","Nobody gets","gets too","too drunk","But the","the boys","boys do","do meet","meet Santy","And their","their Auntie","Auntie Betty","Betty cooks","cooks them","them a","a fry"]}

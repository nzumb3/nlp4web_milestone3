{"title":"It's a Perfect Night for Suicide","plot":"A comedy about a psychic who pretends to believe that magic exists, a gigolo who pretends to believe the psychic, an illusionist who pretends to be somebody else and a desperate woman who believes she will find true happiness in love... when she's dead. Lenka is a psychic who besides telling fortunes is great at depriving her clients of them, with the help of an extraordinary uncle-illusionist. The business flourishes until Lenka's most profitable client, a soulful Buddhist Yvonne, decides to commit suicide. She was jilted by the man of her dreams - Oscar. What's more, Yvonne wants to leave a suicidal note, pointing to Lenka as the cause of all her misfortunes. Lenka's entire world falls apart. She must dissuade Yvonne from killing herself and in her desperation is ready to use all her magical skills to make Oscar fall in love with Yvonne. However, Lenka doesn't even suspect she's entering the lion's den. A dangerous game begins. The full moon is on the rise - and, surprisingly, the magic starts to work for real. It turns out that the scenario written in the stars is not an easy thing to change...","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["A","comedi","about","a","psychic","who","pretend","to","believ","that","magic","exist",",","a","gigolo","who","pretend","to","believ","the","psychic",",","an","illusionist","who","pretend","to","be","somebodi","els","and","a","desper","woman","who","believ","she","will","find","true","happi","in","love","...","when","she","'s","dead",".","Lenka","is","a","psychic","who","besid","tell","fortun","is","great","at","depriv","her","client","of","them",",","with","the","help","of","an","extraordinari","uncle-illusionist",".","The","busi","flourish","until","Lenka","'s","most","profit","client",",","a","soul","Buddhist","Yvonn",",","decid","to","commit","suicid",".","She","was","jilt","by","the","man","of","her","dream","-","Oscar",".","What","'s","more",",","Yvonn","want","to","leav","a","suicid","note",",","point","to","Lenka","as","the","caus","of","all","her","misfortun",".","Lenka","'s","entir","world","fall","apart",".","She","must","dissuad","Yvonn","from","kill","herself","and","in","her","desper","is","readi","to","use","all","her","magic","skill","to","make","Oscar","fall","in","love","with","Yvonn",".","Howev",",","Lenka","doe","n't","even","suspect","she","'s","enter","the","lion","'s","den",".","A","danger","game","begin",".","The","full","moon","is","on","the","rise","-","and",",","surpris",",","the","magic","start","to","work","for","real",".","It","turn","out","that","the","scenario","written","in","the","star","is","not","an","easi","thing","to","chang","..."],"lemmas":["a","comedy","about","a","psychic","who","pretend","to","believe","that","magic","exist",",","a","gigolo","who","pretend","to","believe","the","psychic",",","a","illusionist","who","pretend","to","be","somebody","else","and","a","desperate","woman","who","believe","she","will","find","true","happiness","in","love","...","when","she","be","dead",".","Lenka","be","a","psychic","who","besides","tell","fortune","be","great","at","deprive","she","client","of","they",",","with","the","help","of","a","extraordinary","uncle-illusionist",".","the","business","flourish","until","Lenka","'s","most","profitable","client",",","a","soulful","Buddhist","Yvonne",",","decide","to","commit","suicide",".","she","be","jilt","by","the","man","of","she","dream","-","Oscar",".","what","be","more",",","Yvonne","want","to","leave","a","suicidal","note",",","point","to","Lenka","as","the","cause","of","all","she","misfortune",".","Lenka","'s","entire","world","fall","apart",".","she","must","dissuade","Yvonne","from","kill","herself","and","in","she","desperation","be","ready","to","use","all","she","magical","skill","to","make","Oscar","fall","in","love","with","Yvonne",".","however",",","Lenka","do","not","even","suspect","she","be","enter","the","lion","'s","den",".","a","dangerous","game","begin",".","the","full","moon","be","on","the","rise","-","and",",","surprisingly",",","the","magic","start","to","work","for","real",".","it","turn","out","that","the","scenario","write","in","the","star","be","not","a","easy","thing","to","change","..."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"I Love This Place","plot":"I LOVE THIS PLACE is about my backyard - a special patch of coastline - From Bondi Beach to the tiny and intimate Clovelly. The essence of Sydney's culture in four beaches next to the city. It's not a travelogue, or a surf movie, or a 'reality' beat-up, it's a layered, impressionistic portrait of this distinctive slice of seashore, and its people. in the next 72 minutes you won't find a single interview, but a great bespoke soundtrack by composer David Roberts. Beaches are like theatre - people from a multitude of cultures are the players on this stage a small expanse of coast. I LOVE THIS PLACE shows how the sheer nature of location defines people's personalities. How our interaction to place is personal and intimate.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["I","LOVE","THIS","PLACE","is","about","my","backyard","-","a","special","patch","of","coastlin","-","From","Bondi","Beach","to","the","tini","and","intim","Clovelli",".","The","essenc","of","Sydney","'s","cultur","in","four","beach","next","to","the","citi",".","It","'s","not","a","travelogu",",","or","a","surf","movi",",","or","a","'","realiti","'","beat-up",",","it","'s","a","layer",",","impressionist","portrait","of","this","distinct","slice","of","seashor",",","and","it","peopl",".","in","the","next","72","minut","you","wo","n't","find","a","singl","interview",",","but","a","great","bespok","soundtrack","by","compos","David","Robert",".","Beach","are","like","theatr","-","peopl","from","a","multitud","of","cultur","are","the","player","on","this","stage","a","small","expans","of","coast",".","I","LOVE","THIS","PLACE","show","how","the","sheer","natur","of","locat","defin","peopl","'s","person",".","How","our","interact","to","place","is","person","and","intim","."],"lemmas":["I","love","this","place","be","about","my","backyard","-","a","special","patch","of","coastline","-","from","Bondi","Beach","to","the","tiny","and","intimate","Clovelly",".","the","essence","of","Sydney","'s","culture","in","four","beach","next","to","the","city",".","it","be","not","a","travelogue",",","or","a","surf","movie",",","or","a","'","reality","'","beat-up",",","it","be","a","layered",",","impressionistic","portrait","of","this","distinctive","slice","of","seashore",",","and","its","people",".","in","the","next","72","minute","you","will","not","find","a","single","interview",",","but","a","great","bespoke","soundtrack","by","composer","David","Roberts",".","beach","be","like","theatre","-","people","from","a","multitude","of","culture","be","the","player","on","this","stage","a","small","expanse","of","coast",".","I","love","this","place","show","how","the","sheer","nature","of","location","define","people","'s","personality",".","how","we","interaction","to","place","be","personal","and","intimate","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["I LOVE THIS","LOVE THIS PLACE","THIS PLACE is","PLACE is about","is about my","about my backyard","my backyard -","backyard -

{"title":"De Haas in de Marathon","plot":"In October 2002 the first political party worldwide is founded which does not base its policy on human-centric thinking. The Party for the Animals represents a new political movement that values animal welfare and the environment. 'The foundation of The Party for the Animals was received with much skepticism within traditional politics. However, the Party for the Animals quickly appeared to function as a pacer in the marathon', recalls Marianne Thieme - co-founder and party leader. The Pacer in the Marathon is a documentary on the first ten years of the Party for the Animals. Next to in-depth interviews with the party founders, the film provides an insight into the public reception of this pioneering political movement, within science, politics and media.","genres":["Documentary"," History"],"stems":["In","October","2002","the","first","polit","parti","worldwid","is","found","which","doe","not","base","it","polici","on","human-centr","think",".","The","Parti","for","the","Animal","repres","a","new","polit","movement","that","valu","anim","welfar","and","the","environ",".","'","The","foundat","of","The","Parti","for","the","Animal","was","receiv","with","much","skeptic","within","tradit","polit",".","Howev",",","the","Parti","for","the","Animal","quick","appear","to","function","as","a","pacer","in","the","marathon","'",",","recal","Mariann","Thiem","-","co-found","and","parti","leader",".","The","Pacer","in","the","Marathon","is","a","documentari","on","the","first","ten","year","of","the","Parti","for","the","Animal",".","Next","to","in-depth","interview","with","the","parti","founder",",","the","film","provid","an","insight","into","the","public","recept","of","this","pioneer","polit","movement",",","within","scienc",",","polit","and","media","."],"lemmas":["in","October","2002","the","first","political","party","worldwide","be","found","which","do","not","base","its","policy","on","human-centric","thinking",".","the","Party","for","the","Animals","represent","a","new","political","movement","that","value","animal","welfare","and","the","environment",".","'","the","foundation","of","the","Party","for","the","animal","be","receive","with","much","skepticism","within","traditional","politics",".","however",",","the","Party","for","the","Animals","quickly","appear","to","function","as","a","pacer","in","the","marathon","'",",","recall","Marianne","Thieme","-","co-founder","and","party","leader",".","the","Pacer","in","the","Marathon","be","a","documentary","on","the","first","ten","year","of","the","Party","for","the","Animals",".","next","to","in-depth","interview","with","the","party","founder",",","the","film","provide","a","insight","into","the","public","reception","of","this","pioneering","political","movement",",","within","science",",","politics","and","media","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["In October 2002","October 2002 the","2002 the first","the first political","first political party","political party worldwide","party worldwide is","worldwide is founded","is founded which","founded which does","which does not","does not base","not base its","base its policy","its policy on","policy on human-centric","on human-centric thinking","The Party for","Party for the","for the Animals","the Animals represents","Animals represents a","represents a new","a new political","new political movement","political movement that","movement that values","that values animal","values animal welfare","animal welfare and","welfare and the","and the environment","the environment .","environment .

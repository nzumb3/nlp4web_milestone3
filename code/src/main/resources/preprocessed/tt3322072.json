{"title":"Coup de Grâce","plot":"A hostage situation gone bad. Jesús, an amateur thief, holds prisoner a group of clients. But nothing is what it seems. Behind the gates of the drugstore the story will unfold in two times. On one side, to the inevitable end: the police will shoot their way inn. And on the other side, to the past, unveiling how Jesús got caught in this situation, where the hostages are not the real victims, but something more sinister. Retracing step by step, reveling the truth, playing with the prejudices and beliefs of the audience on racial hate, social prejudices, and the intolerance. How far are we willing to go to survive?","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","hostag","situat","gone","bad",".","Jesú",",","an","amateur","thief",",","hold","prison","a","group","of","client",".","But","noth","is","what","it","seem",".","Behind","the","gate","of","the","drugstor","the","stori","will","unfold","in","two","time",".","On","one","side",",","to","the","inevit","end",":","the","polic","will","shoot","their","way","inn",".","And","on","the","other","side",",","to","the","past",",","unveil","how","Jesú","got","caught","in","this","situat",",","where","the","hostag","are","not","the","real","victim",",","but","someth","more","sinist",".","Retrac","step","by","step",",","revel","the","truth",",","play","with","the","prejudic","and","belief","of","the","audienc","on","racial","hate",",","social","prejudic",",","and","the","intoler",".","How","far","are","we","will","to","go","to","surviv","?"],"lemmas":["a","hostage","situation","go","bad",".","Jesús",",","a","amateur","thief",",","hold","prisoner","a","group","of","client",".","but","nothing","be","what","it","seem",".","behind","the","gate","of","the","drugstore","the","story","will","unfold","in","two","time",".","on","one","side",",","to","the","inevitable","end",":","the","police","will","shoot","they","way","inn",".","and","on","the","other","side",",","to","the","past",",","unveil","how","Jesús","get","catch","in","this","situation",",","where","the","hostage","be","not","the","real","victim",",","but","something","more","sinister",".","retrace","step","by","step",",","revel","the","truth",",","play","with","the","prejudice","and","belief","of","the","audience","on","racial","hate",",","social","prejudice",",","and","the","intolerance",".","how","far","be","we","willing","to","go","to","survive","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["A

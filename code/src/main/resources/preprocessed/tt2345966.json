{"title":"Dream Team: Hero Fan Namnom","plot":"Soccer coach Byrd (Kiat Kitcharoen) is persuaded by teacher Noo Lek (Sakolrat Wora-Urai) to help coach ten of the school's kindergarteners students for a tug-of-war tournament being staged as part of the 18th National Kindergarten Sports Competition. Problems arise upon learning the rules clearly state that only 9 players are allowed on each tug of war team. Thus the 10-kid \"Dream Team\" must bench one member during the competition. Coach Byrd is forced to deal with a bunch of interfering parents who want to make sure their kid is featured on the school team.","genres":["Comedy"," Sport"],"stems":["Soccer","coach","Byrd","(","Kiat","Kitcharoen",")","is","persuad","by","teacher","Noo","Lek","(","Sakolrat","Wora-Urai",")","to","help","coach","ten","of","the","school","'s","kindergarten","student","for","a","tug-of-war","tournament","be","stage","as","part","of","the","18th","Nation","Kindergarten","Sport","Competit",".","Problem","aris","upon","learn","the","rule","clear","state","that","onli","9","player","are","allow","on","each","tug","of","war","team",".","Thus","the","10-kid","\"","Dream","Team","\"","must","bench","one","member","dure","the","competit",".","Coach","Byrd","is","forc","to","deal","with","a","bunch","of","interf","parent","who","want","to","make","sure","their","kid","is","featur","on","the","school","team","."],"lemmas":["soccer","coach","Byrd","-lrb-","Kiat","Kitcharoen","-rrb-","be","persuade","by","teacher","Noo","Lek","-lrb-","Sakolrat","Wora-Urai","-rrb-","to","help","coach","ten","of","the","school","'s","kindergartener","student","for","a","tug-of-war","tournament","be","stage","as","part","of","the","18th","National","Kindergarten","Sports","Competition",".","problem","arise","upon","learn","the","rule","clearly","state","that","only","9","player","be","allow","on","each","tug","of","war","team",".","thus","the","10-kid","``","dream","Team","''","must","bench","one","member","during","the","competition",".","coach","Byrd","be","force","to","deal","with","a","bunch","of","interfere","parent","who","want","to","make","sure","they","kid","be","feature","on","the","school","team","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Soccer coach Byrd","coach Byrd (","Byrd ( Kiat","( Kiat Kitcharoen","Kiat Kitcharoen )","Kitcharoen ) is",") is persuaded","is persuaded by","persuaded by teacher","by teacher Noo","teacher Noo Lek","Noo Lek (","Lek ( Sakolrat","( Sakolrat Wora-Urai","Sakolrat Wora-Urai )","Wora-Urai ) to",") to help","to help coach","help coach ten","coach ten of","ten of the","of the school","the school 's","school 's kindergarteners","'s kindergarteners students","kindergarteners students for","students for a","for a tug-of-war","a tug-of-war tournament","tug-of-war tournament being","tournament being staged","being staged as","staged as part","as part of","part of the","of the 18th","the 18th National","18th National Kindergarten","National Kindergarten Sports","Kindergarten Sports Competition","Problems arise upon","arise upon learning","upon learning the","learning the rules","the rules clearly","rules clearly state","clearly state that","state that only","that only 9","only 9 players","9 players are","players are allowed","are allowed on","allowed on each","on each tug","each tug of","tug of war","of war team","Thus the 10-kid","the 10-kid \"","10-kid \" Dream","\" Dream Team","Dream Team \"","Team \" must","\" must bench","must bench one","bench one member","one member during","member during the","during the competition","Coach Byrd is","Byrd is forced","is forced to","forced to deal","to deal with","deal with a","with a bunch","a bunch of","bunch of interfering","of interfering parents","interfering parents who","parents who want","who want to","want to make","to make sure","make sure their","sure their kid","their kid is","kid is featured","is featured on","featured on the","on the school","the school team"],"2grams":["Soccer coach","coach Byrd","Byrd (","( Kiat","Kiat Kitcharoen","Kitcharoen )",") is","is persuaded","persuaded by","by teacher","teacher Noo","Noo Lek","Lek (","( Sakolrat","Sakolrat Wora-Urai","Wora-Urai )",") to","to help","help coach","coach ten","ten of","of the","the school","school 's","'s kindergarteners","kindergarteners students","students for","for a","a tug-of-war","tug-of-war tournament","tournament being","being staged","staged as","as part","part of","of the","the 18th","18th National","National Kindergarten","Kindergarten Sports","Sports Competition","Problems arise","arise upon","upon learning","learning the","the rules","rules clearly","clearly state","state that","that only","only 9","9 players","players are","are allowed","allowed on","on each","each tug","tug of","of war","war team","Thus the","the 10-kid","10-kid \"","\" Dream","Dream Team","Team \"","\" must","must bench","bench one","one member","member during","during the","the competition","Coach Byrd","Byrd is","is forced","forced to","to deal","deal with","with a","a bunch","bunch of","of interfering","interfering parents","parents who","who want","want to","to make","make sure","sure their","their kid","kid is","is featured","featured on","on the","the school","school team"]}

{"title":"Thick as Thieves","plot":"Two master thieves go at odds with one another as one sets the other up for a crime. The first, a suave pro who does his job and then hides in his own privacy, listening to old jazz records and caring for his ailing dog, Wally. The other is a local gangster with a taste for the finer life, who decides to eliminate the competition. This ignites a war between the two men and their aides. An angry mob boss and a female police officer try to sort the mess before things get too out of hand.","genres":["Crime"," Drama"],"stems":["Two","master","thiev","go","at","odd","with","one","anoth","as","one","set","the","other","up","for","a","crime",".","The","first",",","a","suav","pro","who","doe","his","job","and","then","hide","in","his","own","privaci",",","listen","to","old","jazz","record","and","care","for","his","ail","dog",",","Walli",".","The","other","is","a","local","gangster","with","a","tast","for","the","finer","life",",","who","decid","to","elimin","the","competit",".","This","ignit","a","war","between","the","two","men","and","their","aid",".","An","angri","mob","boss","and","a","femal","polic","offic","tri","to","sort","the","mess","befor","thing","get","too","out","of","hand","."],"lemmas":["two","master","thief","go","at","odds","with","one","another","as","one","set","the","other","up","for","a","crime",".","the","first",",","a","suave","pro","who","do","he","job","and","then","hide","in","he","own","privacy",",","listen","to","old","jazz","record","and","care","for","he","ailing","dog",",","Wally",".","the","other","be","a","local","gangster","with","a","taste","for","the","finer","life",",","who","decide","to","eliminate","the","competition",".","this","ignite","a","war","between","the","two","man","and","they","aide",".","a","angry","mob","boss","and","a","female","police","officer","try","to","sort","the","mess","before","thing","get","too","out","of","hand","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Two master thieves","master thieves go","thieves go at","go at odds","at odds with","odds with one","with one another","one another as","another as one","as one sets","one sets the","sets the other","the other up","other up for","up for a","for a crime","The first ,","first , a",", a suave","a suave pro","suave pro who","pro who does","who does his","does his job","his job and","job and then","and then hides","then hides in","hides in his","in his own","his own privacy","own privacy ,","privacy , listening",", listening to","listening to old","to old jazz","old jazz records","jazz records and","records and caring","and caring for","caring for his","for his ailing","his ailing dog","ailing dog ,","dog , Wally","The other is","other is a","is a local","a local gangster","local gangster with","gangster with a","with a taste","a taste for","taste for the","for the finer","the finer life","finer life ,","life , who",", who decides","who decides to","decides to eliminate","to eliminate the","eliminate the competition","This ignites a","ignites a war","a war between","war between the","between the two","the two men","two men and","men and their","and their aides","An angry mob","angry mob boss","mob boss and","boss and a","and a female","a female police","female police officer","police officer try","officer try to","try to sort","to sort the","sort the mess","the mess before","mess before things","before things get","things get too","get too out","too out of","out of hand"],"2grams":["Two master","master thieves","thieves go","go at","at odds","odds with","with one","one another","another as","as one","one sets","sets the","the other","other up","up for","for a","a crime","The first","first ,",", a","a suave","suave pro","pro who","who does","does his","his job","job and","and then","then hides","hides in","in his","his own","own privacy","privacy ,",", listening","listening to","to old","old jazz","jazz records","records and","and caring","caring for","for his","his ailing","ailing dog","dog ,",", Wally","The other","other is","is a","a local","local gangster","gangster with","with a","a taste","taste for","for the","the finer","finer life","life ,",", who","who decides","decides to","to eliminate","eliminate the","the competition","This ignites","ignites a","a war","war between","between the","the two","two men","men and","and their","their aides","An angry","angry mob","mob boss","boss and","and a","a female","female police","police officer","officer try","try to","to sort","sort the","the mess","mess before","before things","things get","get too","too out","out of","of hand"]}

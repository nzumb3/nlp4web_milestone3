{"title":"Divine Trash","plot":"The life and times of Baltimore film maker and midnight movie pioneer, John Waters. Intercut with a 1972 interview of Waters are clips from his first films and recent interviews with his parents, his brother, Divine's mom, actors and crew, other directors, film critics, a film curator, psychologists, and Maryland's last censor, who shudders at the memory of Waters's pictures. Also included is footage of Waters making his early movies, culminating in an up-close and in-depth look at Pink Flamingos: the script, the set, the filming conditions, its editing, its distribution, and its impact. In sweet ways, this documentary is also a celebration of Divine (1945-1988).","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","life","and","time","of","Baltimor","film","maker","and","midnight","movi","pioneer",",","John","Water",".","Intercut","with","a","1972","interview","of","Water","are","clip","from","his","first","film","and","recent","interview","with","his","parent",",","his","brother",",","Divin","'s","mom",",","actor","and","crew",",","other","director",",","film","critic",",","a","film","curat",",","psychologist",",","and","Maryland","'s","last","censor",",","who","shudder","at","the","memori","of","Water","'s","pictur",".","Also","includ","is","footag","of","Water","make","his","earli","movi",",","culmin","in","an","up-clos","and","in-depth","look","at","Pink","Flamingo",":","the","script",",","the","set",",","the","film","condit",",","it","edit",",","it","distribut",",","and","it","impact",".","In","sweet","way",",","this","documentari","is","also","a","celebr","of","Divin","(","1945-1988",")","."],"lemmas":["the","life","and","time","of","Baltimore","film","maker","and","midnight","movie","pioneer",",","John","Waters",".","intercut","with","a","1972","interview","of","Waters","be","clip","from","he","first","film","and","recent","interview","with","he","parent",",","he","brother",",","Divine","'s","mom",",","actor","and","crew",",","other","director",",","film","critic",",","a","film","curator",",","psychologist",",","and","Maryland","'s","last","censor",",","who","shudder","at","the","memory","of","Waters","'s","picture",".","also","include","be","footage","of","Waters","make","he","early","movie",",","culminate","in","a","up-close","and","in-depth","look","at","Pink","Flamingos",":","the","script",",","the","set",",","the","film","condition",",","its","editing",",","its","distribution",",","and","its","impact",".","in","sweet","way",",","this","documentary","be","also","a","celebration","of","Divine","-lrb-","1945-1988","-rrb-","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The

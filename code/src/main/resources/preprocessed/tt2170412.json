{"title":"It's a Living","plot":"While Inuit art is often positioned as quintessentially Northern, of the North and of the Arctic, it is also urban and, for the urban Inuit artist, it is a living. In this short film, the filmmakers provide a brief glimpse into the daily work of an urban Inuit carver in Ottawa, Canada. Images of carving and rock-hounding are contrasted with the towering presence of Inuit art in the nation's capital.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["While","Inuit","art","is","often","posit","as","quintessenti","Northern",",","of","the","North","and","of","the","Arctic",",","it","is","also","urban","and",",","for","the","urban","Inuit","artist",",","it","is","a","live",".","In","this","short","film",",","the","filmmak","provid","a","brief","glimps","into","the","daili","work","of","an","urban","Inuit","carver","in","Ottawa",",","Canada",".","Image","of","carv","and","rock-hound","are","contrast","with","the","tower","presenc","of","Inuit","art","in","the","nation","'s","capit","."],"lemmas":["while","Inuit","art","be","often","positioned","as","quintessentially","northern",",","of","the","North","and","of","the","Arctic",",","it","be","also","urban","and",",","for","the","urban","Inuit","artist",",","it","be","a","living",".","in","this","short","film",",","the","filmmaker","provide","a","brief","glimpse","into","the","daily","work","of","a","urban","Inuit","carver","in","Ottawa",",","Canada",".","image","of","carve","and","rock-hounding","be","contrast","with","the","towering","presence","of","Inuit","art","in","the","nation","'s","capital","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["While Inuit art","Inuit art is","art is often","is often positioned","often positioned as","positioned as quintessentially","as quintessentially Northern","quintessentially Northern ,","Northern , of",", of the","of the North","the North and","North and of","and of the","of the Arctic","the Arctic ,","Arctic , it",", it is","it is also","is also urban","also urban and","urban and ,","and , for",", for the","for the urban","the urban Inuit","urban Inuit artist","Inuit artist ,","artist , it",", it is","it is a","is a living","In this short","this short film","short film ,","film , the",", the filmmakers","the filmmakers provide","filmmakers provide a","provide a brief","a brief glimpse","brief glimpse into","glimpse into the","into the daily","the daily work","daily work of","work of an","of an urban","an urban Inuit","urban Inuit carver","Inuit carver in","carver in Ottawa","in Ottawa ,","Ottawa , Canada","Images of carving","of carving and","carving and rock-hounding","and rock-hounding are","rock-hounding are contrasted","are contrasted with","contrasted with the","with the towering","the towering presence","towering presence of","presence of Inuit","of Inuit art","Inuit art in","art in the","in the nation","the nation 's","nation 's capital"],"2grams":["While Inuit","Inuit art","art is","is often","often positioned","positioned as","as quintessentially","quintessentially Northern","Northern ,",", of","of the","the North","North and","and of","of the","the Arctic","Arctic ,",", it","it is","is also","also urban","urban and","and ,",", for","for the","the urban","urban Inuit","Inuit artist","artist ,",", it","it is","is a","a living","In this","this short","short film","film ,",", the","the filmmakers","filmmakers provide","provide a","a brief","brief glimpse","glimpse into","into the","the daily","daily work","work of","of an","an urban","urban Inuit","Inuit carver","carver in","in Ottawa","Ottawa ,",", Canada","Images of","of carving","carving and","and rock-hounding","rock-hounding are","are contrasted","contrasted with","with the","the towering","towering presence","presence of","of Inuit","Inuit art","art in","in the","the nation","nation 's","'s capital"]}

{"title":"Cereal Killers Movie","plot":"The film follows a lean, fit, seemingly healthy 41 year old man on a quest to hack his genes and drop dead healthy by avoiding the heart disease and diabetes that has afflicted his family. Kevin O'Neill, an Irish Gaelic football star from the 1960s, won the first of 2 All Ireland Championships with the Down Senior Football Team in 1960 before the biggest crowd (94,000) ever seen at an Irish sporting event. When Kevin suffered a heart attack later in life, family and friends were shocked. How does a lean, fit and seemingly healthy man - who has sailed through cardiac stress tests - suddenly fall victim to heart disease? Can a controversial diet consisting of 70% fat provide his son with the answers?","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","film","follow","a","lean",",","fit",",","seem","healthi","41","year","old","man","on","a","quest","to","hack","his","gene","and","drop","dead","healthi","by","avoid","the","heart","diseas","and","diabet","that","has","afflict","his","famili",".","Kevin","O'Neill",",","an","Irish","Gaelic","footbal","star","from","the","1960s",",","won","the","first","of","2","All","Ireland","Championship","with","the","Down","Senior","Footbal","Team","in","1960","befor","the","biggest","crowd","(","94,000",")","ever","seen","at","an","Irish","sport","event",".","When","Kevin","suffer","a","heart","attack","later","in","life",",","famili","and","friend","were","shock",".","How","doe","a","lean",",","fit","and","seem","healthi","man","-","who","has","sail","through","cardiac","stress","test","-","sudden","fall","victim","to","heart","diseas","?","Can","a","controversi","diet","consist","of","70","%","fat","provid","his","son","with","the","answer","?"],"lemmas":["the","film","follow","a","lean",",","fit",",","seemingly","healthy","41","year","old","man","on","a","quest","to","hack","he","gene","and","drop","dead","healthy","by","avoid","the","heart","disease","and","diabetes","that","have","afflict","he","family",".","Kevin","O'Neill",",","a","irish","gaelic","football","star","from","the","1960s",",","win","the","first","of","2","All","Ireland","Championships","with","the","Down","Senior","Football","Team","in","1960","before","the","biggest","crowd","-lrb-","94,000","-rrb-","ever","see","at","a","Irish","sport","event",".","when","Kevin","suffer","a","heart","attack","later","in","life",",","family","and","friend","be","shock",".","how","do","a","lean",",","fit","and","seemingly","healthy","man","-","who","have","sail","through","cardiac","stress","test","-","suddenly","fall","victim","to","heart","disease","?","can","a","controversial","diet","consist","of","70","%","fat","provide","he","son","with","the","answer","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The film follows","film follows a","follows a lean","a lean ,","lean , fit",", fit ,","fit , seemingly",", seemingly healthy","seemingly healthy 41","healthy 41 year","41 year old","year old man","old man on","man on a","on a quest","a quest to","quest to hack","to hack his","hack his genes","his genes and","genes and drop","and drop dead","drop dead healthy","dead healthy by","healthy by avoiding","by avoiding the","avoiding the heart","the heart disease","heart disease and","disease and diabetes","and diabetes that","diabetes that has","that has afflicted","has afflicted his","afflicted his family","Kevin O'Neill ,","O'Neill , an",", an Irish","an Irish Gaelic","Irish Gaelic football","Gaelic football star","football star from","star from the","from the 1960s","the 1960s ,","1960s , won",", won the","won the first","the first of","first of 2","of 2 All","2 All Ireland","All Ireland Championships","Ireland Championships with","Championships with the","with the Down","the Down Senior","Down Senior Football","Senior Football Team","Football Team in","Team in 1960","in 1960 before","1960 before the","before the biggest","the biggest crowd","biggest crowd (","crowd ( 94,000","( 94,000 )","94,000 ) ever",") ever seen","ever seen at","seen at an","at an Irish","an Irish sporting","Irish sporting event","When Kevin suffered","Kevin suffered a","suffered a heart","a heart attack","heart attack later","attack later in","later in life","in life ,","life , family",", family and","family and friends","and friends were","friends were shocked","How does a","does a lean","a lean ,","lean , fit",", fit and","fit and seemingly","and seemingly healthy","seemingly healthy man","healthy man -","man -

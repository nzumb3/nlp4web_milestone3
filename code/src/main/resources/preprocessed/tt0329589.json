{"title":"Shark Hunter","plot":"Years after his parents are killed by a megalodon (an enormous shark that has supposedly been extinct for millions of years), Dr. Spencer is obsessed with the idea of hunting down and killing the monster. He's assigned to investigate the destruction of an undersea research station with the crew of the Argus, a giant submarine Spencer designed himself. After a little searching the team realizes that it was indeed a megalodon that destroyed the base, and the hunt for the creature is on. Will the Argus and its crew have what it takes for Spencer to get his revenge?","genres":["Action"," Horror"," Adventure"],"stems":["Year","after","his","parent","are","kill","by","a","megalodon","(","an","enorm","shark","that","has","suppos","been","extinct","for","million","of","year",")",",","Dr.","Spencer","is","obsess","with","the","idea","of","hunt","down","and","kill","the","monster",".","He","'s","assign","to","investig","the","destruct","of","an","undersea","research","station","with","the","crew","of","the","Argus",",","a","giant","submarin","Spencer","design","himself",".","After","a","littl","search","the","team","realiz","that","it","was","inde","a","megalodon","that","destroy","the","base",",","and","the","hunt","for","the","creatur","is","on",".","Will","the","Argus","and","it","crew","have","what","it","take","for","Spencer","to","get","his","reveng","?"],"lemmas":["year","after","he","parent","be","kill","by","a","megalodon","-lrb-","a","enormous","shark","that","have","supposedly","be","extinct","for","million","of","year","-rrb-",",","Dr.","Spencer","be","obsess","with","the","idea","of","hunting","down","and","kill","the","monster",".","he","be","assign","to","investigate","the","destruction","of","a","undersea","research","station","with","the","crew","of","the","Argus",",","a","giant","submarine","Spencer","design","himself",".","after","a","little","search","the","team","realize","that","it","be","indeed","a","megalodon","that","destroy","the","base",",","and","the","hunt","for","the","creature","be","on",".","will","the","Argus","and","its","crew","have","what","it","take","for","Spencer","to","get","he","revenge","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["Years after his","after his parents","his parents are","parents are killed","are killed by","killed by a","by a megalodon","a megalodon (","megalodon ( an","( an enormous","an enormous shark","enormous shark that","shark that has","that has supposedly","has supposedly been","supposedly been extinct","been extinct for","extinct for millions","for millions of","millions of years","of years )","years ) ,",") , Dr.",", Dr. Spencer","Dr. Spencer is","Spencer is obsessed","is obsessed with","obsessed with the","with the idea","the idea of","idea of hunting","of hunting down","hunting down and","down and killing","and killing the","killing the monster","He 's assigned","'s assigned to","assigned to investigate","to investigate the","investigate the destruction","the destruction of","destruction of an","of an undersea","an undersea research","undersea research station","research station with","station with the","with the crew","the crew of","crew of the","of the Argus","the Argus ,","Argus , a",", a giant","a giant submarine","giant submarine Spencer","submarine Spencer designed","Spencer designed himself","After a little","a little searching","little searching the","searching the team","the team realizes","team realizes that","realizes that it","that it was","it was indeed","was indeed a","indeed a megalodon","a megalodon that","megalodon that destroyed","that destroyed the","destroyed the base","the base ,","base , and",", and the","and the hunt","the hunt for","hunt for the","for the creature","the creature is","creature is on","Will the Argus","the Argus and","Argus and its","and its crew","its crew have","crew have what","have what it","what it takes","it takes for","takes for Spencer","for Spencer to","Spencer to get","to get his","get his revenge"],"2grams":["Years after","after his","his parents","parents are","are killed","killed by","by a","a megalodon","megalodon (","( an","an enormous","enormous shark","shark that","that has","has supposedly","supposedly been","been extinct","extinct for","for millions","millions of","of years","years )",") ,",", Dr.","Dr. Spencer","Spencer is","is obsessed","obsessed with","with the","the idea","idea of","of hunting","hunting down","down and","and killing","killing the","the monster","He 's","'s assigned","assigned to","to investigate","investigate the","the destruction","destruction of","of an","an undersea","undersea research","research station","station with","with the","the crew","crew of","of the","the Argus","Argus ,",", a","a giant","giant submarine","submarine Spencer","Spencer designed","designed himself","After a","a little","little searching","searching the","the team","team realizes","realizes that","that it","it was","was indeed","indeed a","a megalodon","megalodon that","that destroyed","destroyed the","the base","base ,",", and","and the","the hunt","hunt for","for the","the creature","creature is","is on","Will the","the Argus","Argus and","and its","its crew","crew have","have what","what it","it takes","takes for","for Spencer","Spencer to","to get","get his","his revenge"]}

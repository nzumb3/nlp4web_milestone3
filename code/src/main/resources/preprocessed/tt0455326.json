{"title":"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters","plot":"The story begins in Egypt, where Master Shake, Frylock and Meatwad are being attacked by an oversize poodle, who kills Frylock before being destroyed by Shake. Shake and Meatwad drive off with Frylock's corpse, and meet Time Lincoln, who plans to revive Frylock; however, when the CIA break into his house, the Aqua Teens flee in his wooden rocket ship, and Time Lincoln is shot. This, however, is all revealed to be an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain the ATHF's origin to Meatwad. Shake then explains to Meatwad that women are only attracted to great bodies, then heads off to work out on his new exercise machine, the Insane-O-Flex. Together, they go in search of a missing piece of an exercise machine that happens to be more than an exercise machine, placing them on a collision course with the likes of Oglethorpe and Emory, a pair of jagged, ridiculous creatures from the future who travel with a robot companion claiming to be the Ghost of Christmas Past. They also encounter Dr. Weird, a mad and evil scientist given to disguises and who seeks revenge against the Hunger Force; McPee Pants, a rapping spider who wears a shower cap and diaper; and the hilarious Ignignokt and Err, two-dimensional villains from the ancient days of Pokey, Atari video games.","genres":["Action"," Animation"," Adventure"],"stems":["The","stori","begin","in","Egypt",",","where","Master","Shake",",","Frylock","and","Meatwad","are","be","attack","by","an","overs","poodl",",","who","kill","Frylock","befor","be","destroy","by","Shake",".","Shake","and","Meatwad","drive","off","with","Frylock","'s","corps",",","and","meet","Time","Lincoln",",","who","plan","to","reviv","Frylock",";","howev",",","when","the","CIA","break","into","his","hous",",","the","Aqua","Teen","flee","in","his","wooden","rocket","ship",",","and","Time","Lincoln","is","shot",".","This",",","howev",",","is","all","reveal","to","be","an","elabor","stori","concoct","by","Shake","to","explain","the","ATHF","'s","origin","to","Meatwad",".","Shake","then","explain","to","Meatwad","that","women","are","onli","attract","to","great","bodi",",","then","head","off","to","work","out","on","his","new","exercis","machin",",","the","Insane-O-Flex",".","Togeth",",","they","go","in","search","of","a","miss","piec","of","an","exercis","machin","that","happen","to","be","more","than","an","exercis","machin",",","place","them","on","a","collis","cours","with","the","like","of","Oglethorp","and","Emori",",","a","pair","of","jag",",","ridicul","creatur","from","the","futur","who","travel","with","a","robot","companion","claim","to","be","the","Ghost","of","Christma","Past",".","They","also","encount","Dr.","Weird",",","a","mad","and","evil","scientist","given","to","disguis","and","who","seek","reveng","against","the","Hunger","Forc",";","McPee","Pant",",","a","rap","spider","who","wear","a","shower","cap","and","diaper",";","and","the","hilari","Ignignokt","and","Err",",","two-dimension","villain","from","the","ancient","day","of","Pokey",",","Atari","video","game","."],"lemmas":["the","story","begin","in","Egypt",",","where","Master","Shake",",","Frylock","and","Meatwad","be","be","attack","by","a","oversize","poodle",",","who","kill","Frylock","before","be","destroy","by","Shake",".","Shake","and","Meatwad","drive","off","with","Frylock","'s","corpse",",","and","meet","Time","Lincoln",",","who","plan","to","revive","Frylock",";","however",",","when","the","CIA","break","into","he","house",",","the","Aqua","teens","flee","in","he","wooden","rocket","ship",",","and","Time","Lincoln","be","shoot",".","this",",","however",",","be","all","reveal","to","be","a","elaborate","story","concoct","by","Shake","to","explain","the","ATHF","'s","origin","to","Meatwad",".","Shake","then","explain","to","Meatwad","that","woman","be","only","attract","to","great","body",",","then","head","off","to","work","out","on","he","new","exercise","machine",",","the","Insane-O-Flex",".","together",",","they","go","in","search","of","a","miss","piece","of","a","exercise","machine","that","happen","to","be","more","than","a","exercise","machine",",","place","they","on","a","collision","course","with","the","likes","of","Oglethorpe","and","Emory",",","a","pair","of","jagged",",","ridiculous","creature","from","the","future","who","travel","with","a","robot","companion","claim","to","be","the","ghost","of","Christmas","Past",".","they","also","encounter","Dr.","Weird",",","a","mad","and","evil","scientist","give","to","disguise","and","who","seek","revenge","against","the","Hunger","Force",";","McPee","Pants",",","a","rap","spider","who","wear","a","shower","cap","and","diaper",";","and","the","hilarious","Ignignokt","and","Err",",","two-dimensional","villain","from","the","ancient","day","of","Pokey",",","Atari","video","game","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The story begins","story begins in","begins in Egypt","in Egypt ,","Egypt , where",", where Master","where Master Shake","Master Shake ,","Shake , Frylock",", Frylock and","Frylock and Meatwad","and Meatwad are","Meatwad are being","are being attacked","being attacked by","attacked by an","by an oversize","an oversize poodle","oversize poodle ,","poodle , who",", who kills","who kills Frylock","kills Frylock before","Frylock before being","before being destroyed","being destroyed by","destroyed by Shake","Shake and Meatwad","and Meatwad drive","Meatwad drive off","drive off with","off with Frylock","with Frylock 's","Frylock 's corpse","'s corpse ,","corpse , and",", and meet","and meet Time","meet Time Lincoln","Time Lincoln ,","Lincoln , who",", who plans","who plans to","plans to revive","to revive Frylock","revive Frylock ;","Frylock ;

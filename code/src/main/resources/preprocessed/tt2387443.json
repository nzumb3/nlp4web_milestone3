{"title":"Dinotasia","plot":"One of our favourite natural history subjects, the good old dinosaur, gets a makeover and then some in this fantastically ambitious and groundbreaking documentary. Based on cutting-edge palaeontology and the latest fossil records, DINOTASIA presents a series of vignettes about dinosaurs - both familiar faces and some we have only found out about in the past ten years. The film uses CGI to bring the stories to life, but draws on animation's birth in silent film and early Disney to create proper, traditional visual storytelling. Werner Herzog narrates, reuniting with the team behind GRIZZLY MAN and CAVE OF FORGOTTEN DREAMS.","genres":["Animation"," Documentary"],"stems":["One","of","our","favourit","natur","histori","subject",",","the","good","old","dinosaur",",","get","a","makeov","and","then","some","in","this","fantast","ambiti","and","groundbreak","documentari",".","Base","on","cutting-edg","palaeontolog","and","the","latest","fossil","record",",","DINOTASIA","present","a","seri","of","vignett","about","dinosaur","-","both","familiar","face","and","some","we","have","onli","found","out","about","in","the","past","ten","year",".","The","film","use","CGI","to","bring","the","stori","to","life",",","but","draw","on","anim","'s","birth","in","silent","film","and","earli","Disney","to","creat","proper",",","tradit","visual","storytel",".","Werner","Herzog","narrat",",","reunit","with","the","team","behind","GRIZZLi","MAN","and","CAVE","OF","FORGOTTEN","DREAMS","."],"lemmas":["one","of","we","favourite","natural","history","subject",",","the","good","old","dinosaur",",","get","a","makeover","and","then","some","in","this","fantastically","ambitious","and","groundbreaking","documentary",".","base","on","cutting-edge","palaeontology","and","the","latest","fossil","record",",","DINOTASIA","present","a","series","of","vignette","about","dinosaur","-","both","familiar","face","and","some","we","have","only","find","out","about","in","the","past","ten","year",".","the","film","use","CGI","to","bring","the","story","to","life",",","but","draw","on","animation","'s","birth","in","silent","film","and","early","Disney","to","create","proper",",","traditional","visual","storytelling",".","Werner","Herzog","narrate",",","reunite","with","the","team","behind","GRIZZLY","MAN","and","CAVE","of","FORGOTTEN","DREAMS","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["One of our","of our favourite","our favourite natural","favourite natural history","natural history subjects","history subjects ,","subjects , the",", the good","the good old","good old dinosaur","old dinosaur ,","dinosaur , gets",", gets a","gets a makeover","a makeover and","makeover and then","and then some","then some in","some in this","in this fantastically","this fantastically ambitious","fantastically ambitious and","ambitious and groundbreaking","and groundbreaking documentary","Based on cutting-edge","on cutting-edge palaeontology","cutting-edge palaeontology and","palaeontology and the","and the latest","the latest fossil","latest fossil records","fossil records ,","records , DINOTASIA",", DINOTASIA presents","DINOTASIA presents a","presents a series","a series of","series of vignettes","of vignettes about","vignettes about dinosaurs","about dinosaurs -","dinosaurs -

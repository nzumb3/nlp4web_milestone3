{"title":"Everything's Bigger: Adam Pacitti's Accidental Guide to Texas","plot":"'Everything's Bigger: Adam Pacitti's Accidental Guide to Texas' is a documentary about a documentary gone wrong. Originally a follow-up to 'Pinfall: A Professional Wrestling Documentary', this was meant to be broadcast on British television as an insight into my wrestling career. When I arrived in Texas I wasn't allowed to wrestle. Improvising, I decided to make a new documentary about the Lone Star State. From competitive eating and handguns to cowboys and conspiracy theorists, Everything's Bigger is pretty unique. More importantly, whilst in Texas I met someone pretty special.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["'","Everyth","'s","Bigger",":","Adam","Pacitti","'s","Accident","Guid","to","Texa","'","is","a","documentari","about","a","documentari","gone","wrong",".","Origin","a","follow-up","to","'","Pinfal",":","A","Profession","Wrestl","Documentari","'",",","this","was","meant","to","be","broadcast","on","British","televis","as","an","insight","into","my","wrestl","career",".","When","I","arriv","in","Texa","I","was","n't","allow","to","wrestl",".","Improvis",",","I","decid","to","make","a","new","documentari","about","the","Lone","Star","State",".","From","competit","eat","and","handgun","to","cowboy","and","conspiraci","theorist",",","Everyth","'s","Bigger","is","pretti","uniqu",".","More","import",",","whilst","in","Texa","I","met","someon","pretti","special","."],"lemmas":["'","Everything","'s","bigger",":","Adam","Pacitti","'s","Accidental","Guide","to","Texas","'","be","a","documentary","about","a","documentary","go","wrong",".","originally","a","follow-up","to","'","Pinfall",":","A","Professional","Wrestling","Documentary","'",",","this","be","mean","to","be","broadcast","on","british","television","as","a","insight","into","my","wrestling","career",".","when","I","arrive","in","Texas","I","be","not","allow","to","wrestle",".","improvise",",","I","decide","to","make","a","new","documentary","about","the","Lone","Star","State",".","from","competitive","eating","and","handgun","to","cowboy","and","conspiracy","theorist",",","Everything","'s","bigger","be","pretty","unique",".","more","importantly",",","whilst","in","Texas","I","meet","someone","pretty","special","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["' Everything 's","Everything 's Bigger","'s Bigger :","Bigger : Adam",": Adam Pacitti","Adam Pacitti 's","Pacitti 's Accidental","'s Accidental Guide","Accidental Guide to","Guide to Texas","to Texas '","Texas ' is","' is a","is a documentary","a documentary about","documentary about a","about a documentary","a documentary gone","documentary gone wrong","Originally a follow-up","a follow-up to","follow-up to '","to ' Pinfall","' Pinfall :","Pinfall : A",": A Professional","A Professional Wrestling","Professional Wrestling Documentary","Wrestling Documentary '","Documentary ' ,","' , this",", this was","this was meant","was meant to","meant to be","to be broadcast","be broadcast on","broadcast on British","on British television","British television as","television as an","as an insight","an insight into","insight into my","into my wrestling","my wrestling career","When I arrived","I arrived in","arrived in Texas","in Texas I","Texas I was","I was n't","was n't allowed","n't allowed to","allowed to wrestle","Improvising , I",", I decided","I decided to","decided to make","to make a","make a new","a new documentary","new documentary about","documentary about the","about the Lone","the Lone Star","Lone Star State","From competitive eating","competitive eating and","eating and handguns","and handguns to","handguns to cowboys","to cowboys and","cowboys and conspiracy","and conspiracy theorists","conspiracy theorists ,","theorists , Everything",", Everything 's","Everything 's Bigger","'s Bigger is","Bigger is pretty","is pretty unique","More importantly ,","importantly , whilst",", whilst in","whilst in Texas","in Texas I","Texas I met","I met someone","met someone pretty","someone pretty special"],"2grams":["' Everything","Everything 's","'s Bigger","Bigger :",": Adam","Adam Pacitti","Pacitti 's","'s Accidental","Accidental Guide","Guide to","to Texas","Texas '","' is","is a","a documentary","documentary about","about a","a documentary","documentary gone","gone wrong","Originally a","a follow-up","follow-up to","to '","' Pinfall","Pinfall :",": A","A Professional","Professional Wrestling","Wrestling Documentary","Documentary '","' ,",", this","this was","was meant","meant to","to be","be broadcast","broadcast on","on British","British television","television as","as an","an insight","insight into","into my","my wrestling","wrestling career","When I","I arrived","arrived in","in Texas","Texas I","I was","was n't","n't allowed","allowed to","to wrestle","Improvising ,",", I","I decided","decided to","to make","make a","a new","new documentary","documentary about","about the","the Lone","Lone Star","Star State","From competitive","competitive eating","eating and","and handguns","handguns to","to cowboys","cowboys and","and conspiracy","conspiracy theorists","theorists ,",", Everything","Everything 's","'s Bigger","Bigger is","is pretty","pretty unique","More importantly","importantly ,",", whilst","whilst in","in Texas","Texas I","I met","met someone","someone pretty","pretty special"]}

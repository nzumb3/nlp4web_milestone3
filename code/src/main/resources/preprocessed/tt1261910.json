{"title":"Mazie laupitaji","plot":"Cross your heart and hope to die! Can you honestly swear that at least once in your life you have not thought that robbing a bank is a good idea? Especially, if you're five years old and that bank has just thrown your parents out of a brand new apartment, because your father has lost his job. Robby (5) is no Zorro, but he'd like to be. His sister Louise (7) thinks he's too childish, but can't resist the game of robbing a bank. Together they can pull off just about anything. Getting away with it is the hard part.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"," Crime"],"stems":["Cross","your","heart","and","hope","to","die","!","Can","you","honest","swear","that","at","least","onc","in","your","life","you","have","not","thought","that","rob","a","bank","is","a","good","idea","?","Especial",",","if","you","re","five","year","old","and","that","bank","has","just","thrown","your","parent","out","of","a","brand","new","apart",",","becaus","your","father","has","lost","his","job",".","Robbi","(","5",")","is","no","Zorro",",","but","he","'d","like","to","be",".","His","sister","Louis","(","7",")","think","he","'s","too","childish",",","but","ca","n't","resist","the","game","of","rob","a","bank",".","Togeth","they","can","pull","off","just","about","anyth",".","Get","away","with","it","is","the","hard","part","."],"lemmas":["Cross","you","heart","and","hope","to","die","!","can","you","honestly","swear","that","at","least","once","in","you","life","you","have","not","think","that","rob","a","bank","be","a","good","idea","?","especially",",","if","you","be","five","year","old","and","that","bank","have","just","throw","you","parent","out","of","a","brand","new","apartment",",","because","you","father","have","lose","he","job",".","Robby","-lrb-","5","-rrb-","be","no","Zorro",",","but","he","would","like","to","be",".","he","sister","Louise","-lrb-","7","-rrb-","think","he","be","too","childish",",","but","can","not","resist","the","game","of","rob","a","bank",".","together","they","can","pull","off","just","about","anything",".","get","away","with","it","be","the","hard","part","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Cross your heart","your heart and","heart and hope","and hope to","hope to die","Can you honestly","you honestly swear","honestly swear that","swear that at","that at least","at least once","least once in","once in your","in your life","your life you","life you have","you have not","have not thought","not thought that","thought that robbing","that robbing a","robbing a bank","a bank is","bank is a","is a good","a good idea","Especially , if",", if you","if you 're","you 're five","'re five years","five years old","years old and","old and that","and that bank","that bank has","bank has just","has just thrown","just thrown your","thrown your parents","your parents out","parents out of","out of a","of a brand","a brand new","brand new apartment","new apartment ,","apartment , because",", because your","because your father","your father has","father has lost","has lost his","lost his job","Robby ( 5","( 5 )","5 ) is",") is no","is no Zorro","no Zorro ,","Zorro , but",", but he","but he 'd","he 'd like","'d like to","like to be","His sister Louise","sister Louise (","Louise ( 7","( 7 )","7 ) thinks",") thinks he","thinks he 's","he 's too","'s too childish","too childish ,","childish , but",", but ca","but ca n't","ca n't resist","n't resist the","resist the game","the game of","game of robbing","of robbing a","robbing a bank","Together they can","they can pull","can pull off","pull off just","off just about","just about anything","Getting away with","away with it","with it is","it is the","is the hard","the hard part"],"2grams":["Cross your","your heart","heart and","and hope","hope to","to die","Can you","you honestly","honestly swear","swear that","that at","at least","least once","once in","in your","your life","life you","you have","have not","not thought","thought that","that robbing","robbing a","a bank","bank is","is a","a good","good idea","Especially ,",", if","if you","you 're","'re five","five years","years old","old and","and that","that bank","bank has","has just","just thrown","thrown your","your parents","parents out","out of","of a","a brand","brand new","new apartment","apartment ,",", because","because your","your father","father has","has lost","lost his","his job","Robby (","( 5","5 )",") is","is no","no Zorro","Zorro ,",", but","but he","he 'd","'d like","like to","to be","His sister","sister Louise","Louise (","( 7","7 )",") thinks","thinks he","he 's","'s too","too childish","childish ,",", but","but ca","ca n't","n't resist","resist the","the game","game of","of robbing","robbing a","a bank","Together they","they can","can pull","pull off","off just","just about","about anything","Getting away","away with","with it","it is","is the","the hard","hard part"]}

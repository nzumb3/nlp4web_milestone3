{"title":"Political Bodies","plot":"Not since before Roe v. Wade has access to choice encountered so many hurdles across so many US states. 2011 and 2012 saw a record-breaking number of abortion restrictions passed throughout the country. One of the states that led the charge was Virginia. With Virginia legislators attempting to pass everything from a Personhood amendment to transvaginal ultrasounds, Virginia quickly became ground zero in the fight for a woman's right to choose. Political Bodies documents the 3 pieces of legislation surrounding the debate, the legislators involved and the swift response from the women of Virginia. The film explores what happens when citizens fight for their reproductive rights and the determination it takes to stand up to one's government. Featured interviews from pro-choice activists including Shelley Abrams, Molly Vick, Tarina Keene and Rosemary Codding; pro-choice political figures including Katherine Waddell, Janet Howell, Jim Edmondson, David Englin; and pro-life politicians and activists Victoria Cobb and Bob Marshall. This film shows audiences the fearlessness and determination it takes to stand up for one's autonomy.","genres":["Biography"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["Not","sinc","befor","Roe","v.","Wade","has","access","to","choic","encount","so","mani","hurdl","across","so","mani","US","state",".","2011","and","2012","saw","a","record-break","number","of","abort","restrict","pass","throughout","the","countri",".","One","of","the","state","that","led","the","charg","was","Virginia",".","With","Virginia","legisl","attempt","to","pass","everyth","from","a","Personhood","amend","to","transvagin","ultrasound",",","Virginia","quick","becam","ground","zero","in","the","fight","for","a","woman","'s","right","to","choos",".","Polit","Bodi","document","the","3","piec","of","legisl","surround","the","debat",",","the","legisl","involv","and","the","swift","respons","from","the","women","of","Virginia",".","The","film","explor","what","happen","when","citizen","fight","for","their","reproduct","right","and","the","determin","it","take","to","stand","up","to","one","'s","govern",".","Featur","interview","from","pro-choic","activist","includ","Shelley","Abram",",","Molli","Vick",",","Tarina","Keen","and","Rosemari","Cod",";","pro-choic","polit","figur","includ","Katherin","Waddel",",","Janet","Howel",",","Jim","Edmondson",",","David","Englin",";","and","pro-lif","politician","and","activist","Victoria","Cobb","and","Bob","Marshal",".","This","film","show","audienc","the","fearless","and","determin","it","take","to","stand","up","for","one","'s","autonomi","."],"lemmas":["not","since","before","Roe","v.","Wade","have","access","to","choice","encounter","so","many","hurdle","across","so","many","US","state",".","2011","and","2012","see","a","record-breaking","number","of","abortion","restriction","pass","throughout","the","country",".","one","of","the","state","that","lead","the","charge","be","Virginia",".","with","Virginia","legislator","attempt","to","pass","everything","from","a","Personhood","amendment","to","transvaginal","ultrasound",",","Virginia","quickly","become","ground","zero","in","the","fight","for","a","woman","'s","right","to","choose",".","political","body","document","the","3","piece","of","legislation","surround","the","debate",",","the","legislator","involve","and","the","swift","response","from","the","woman","of","Virginia",".","the","film","explore","what","happen","when","citizen","fight","for","they","reproductive","rights","and","the","determination","it","take","to","stand","up","to","one","'s","government",".","feature","interview","from","pro-choice","activist","include","Shelley","Abrams",",","Molly","Vick",",","Tarina","Keene","and","Rosemary","Codding",";","pro-choice","political","figure","include","Katherine","Waddell",",","Janet","Howell",",","Jim","Edmondson",",","David","Englin",";","and","pro-life","politician","and","activist","Victoria","Cobb","and","Bob","Marshall",".","this","film","show","audience","the","fearlessness","and","determination","it","take","to","stand","up","for","one","'s","autonomy","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Not since before","since before Roe","before Roe v.","Roe v.

{"title":"The Woodsman","plot":"After twelve years in prison, Walter arrives in an unnamed city, moves into a small apartment across the street from an elementary school, gets a job at a lumberyard, and mostly keeps to himself. A quiet, guarded man, Walter finds unexpected solace from Vickie, a tough-talking woman who promises not to judge him for his history. But Walter cannot escape his past. A convicted sex offender, Walter is warily eyed by his brother-in-law, shunned by his sister, lives in fear of being discovered at work, and is hounded by a suspicious local police officer, Detective Lucas. After befriending a young girl in a neighborhood park, Walter must also grapple with the terrible prospect of his own reawakened demons.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["After","twelv","year","in","prison",",","Walter","arriv","in","an","unnam","citi",",","move","into","a","small","apart","across","the","street","from","an","elementari","school",",","get","a","job","at","a","lumberyard",",","and","most","keep","to","himself",".","A","quiet",",","guard","man",",","Walter","find","unexpect","solac","from","Vicki",",","a","tough-talk","woman","who","promis","not","to","judg","him","for","his","histori",".","But","Walter","can","not","escap","his","past",".","A","convict","sex","offend",",","Walter","is","warili","eye","by","his","brother-in-law",",","shun","by","his","sister",",","live","in","fear","of","be","discov","at","work",",","and","is","hound","by","a","suspici","local","polic","offic",",","Detect","Luca",".","After","befriend","a","young","girl","in","a","neighborhood","park",",","Walter","must","also","grappl","with","the","terribl","prospect","of","his","own","reawaken","demon","."],"lemmas":["after","twelve","year","in","prison",",","Walter","arrive","in","a","unnamed","city",",","move","into","a","small","apartment","across","the","street","from","a","elementary","school",",","get","a","job","at","a","lumberyard",",","and","mostly","keep","to","himself",".","a","quiet",",","guard","man",",","Walter","find","unexpected","solace","from","Vickie",",","a","tough-talking","woman","who","promise","not","to","judge","he","for","he","history",".","but","Walter","can","not","escape","he","past",".","a","convict","sex","offender",",","Walter","be","warily","eye","by","he","brother-in-law",",","shun","by","he","sister",",","live","in","fear","of","be","discover","at","work",",","and","be","hound","by","a","suspicious","local","police","officer",",","Detective","Lucas",".","after","befriend","a","young","girl","in","a","neighborhood","park",",","Walter","must","also","grapple","with","the","terrible","prospect","of","he","own","reawakened","demon","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["After

{"title":"Deer Crossing","plot":"This film is about the Chancelor family. The mother (Maggie) and her son (Cole) head off after saying goodbye to Cole's father only to have an accident near a country farm. They are found by a farmer called Lukas Walton who takes them to his farm and they are never seen by the father again. It's now 8 years later and the father gets a call from someone who claims to be his son Cole. So the father hires an ex detective to go back to the County where his family went missing. But the Detective finds that there's something more than just a missing persons case here. He also thinks that the local Sheriff (Doug Bradley) is keeping something from him. Lukas is raising Cole as his own son, and things escalate from there. But what has happened to the mother Maggie?","genres":["Crime"," Horror","

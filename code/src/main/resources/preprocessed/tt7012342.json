{"title":"Namatjira Project","plot":"In the rugged heart of Australia, Aboriginal painter Albert Namatjira carved out his place in art history with his captivating landscapes. The first Aboriginal person to be granted citizenship, he pioneered both art and Aboriginal rights. Yet the fruits of his legacy have been denied to his people, with the copyright of his works posthumously sold off. The Namatjira Project aims to restore those rights to his impoverished family.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","the","rug","heart","of","Australia",",","Aborigin","painter","Albert","Namatjira","carv","out","his","place","in","art","histori","with","his","captiv","landscap",".","The","first","Aborigin","person","to","be","grant","citizenship",",","he","pioneer","both","art","and","Aborigin","right",".","Yet","the","fruit","of","his","legaci","have","been","deni","to","his","peopl",",","with","the","copyright","of","his","work","posthum","sold","off",".","The","Namatjira","Project","aim","to","restor","those","right","to","his","impoverish","famili","."],"lemmas":["in","the","rugged","heart","of","Australia",",","Aboriginal","painter","Albert","Namatjira","carve","out","he","place","in","art","history","with","he","captivating","landscape",".","the","first","aboriginal","person","to","be","grant","citizenship",",","he","pioneer","both","art","and","aboriginal","rights",".","yet","the","fruit","of","he","legacy","have","be","deny","to","he","people",",","with","the","copyright","of","he","work","posthumously","sell","off",".","the","Namatjira","Project","aim","to","restore","those","rights","to","he","impoverished","family","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON"],"3grams":["In the rugged","the rugged heart","rugged heart of","heart of Australia","of Australia ,","Australia , Aboriginal",", Aboriginal painter","Aboriginal painter Albert","painter Albert Namatjira","Albert Namatjira carved","Namatjira carved out","carved out his","out his place","his place in","place in art","in art history","art history with","history with his","with his captivating","his captivating landscapes","The first Aboriginal","first Aboriginal person","Aboriginal person to","person to be","to be granted","be granted citizenship","granted citizenship ,","citizenship , he",", he pioneered","he pioneered both","pioneered both art","both art and","art and Aboriginal","and Aboriginal rights","Yet the fruits","the fruits of","fruits of his","of his legacy","his legacy have","legacy have been","have been denied","been denied to","denied to his","to his people","his people ,","people , with",", with the","with the copyright","the copyright of","copyright of his","of his works","his works posthumously","works posthumously sold","posthumously sold off","The Namatjira Project","Namatjira Project aims","Project aims to","aims to restore","to restore those","restore those rights","those rights to","rights to his","to his impoverished","his impoverished family"],"2grams":["In the","the rugged","rugged heart","heart of","of Australia","Australia ,",", Aboriginal","Aboriginal painter","painter Albert","Albert Namatjira","Namatjira carved","carved out","out his","his place","place in","in art","art history","history with","with his","his captivating","captivating landscapes","The first","first Aboriginal","Aboriginal person","person to","to be","be granted","granted citizenship","citizenship ,",", he","he pioneered","pioneered both","both art","art and","and Aboriginal","Aboriginal rights","Yet the","the fruits","fruits of","of his","his legacy","legacy have","have been","been denied","denied to","to his","his people","people ,",", with","with the","the copyright","copyright of","of his","his works","works posthumously","posthumously sold","sold off","The Namatjira","Namatjira Project","Project aims","aims to","to restore","restore those","those rights","rights to","to his","his impoverished","impoverished family"]}

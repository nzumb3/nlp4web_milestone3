{"title":"Flawless","plot":"London, 1960. Laura Quinn is the lone female executive at London Diamond Corporation. She is frustrated as her talents are rarely acknowledged and her less-experienced male co-workers are promoted ahead of her. She is shocked, but intrigued, when the mild-mannered night janitor, Mr. Hobbs, approaches her with a daring but simple plan to steal a handful of diamonds from the vault. Laura agrees to help, but she is soon in over her head. And it is not long before insurance investigator Mr. Finch has his eyes on her.","genres":["Crime"," Thriller"," Drama"],"stems":["London",",","1960",".","Laura","Quinn","is","the","lone","femal","execut","at","London","Diamond","Corpor",".","She","is","frustrat","as","her","talent","are","rare","acknowledg","and","her","less-experienc","male","co-work","are","promot","ahead","of","her",".","She","is","shock",",","but","intrigu",",","when","the","mild-mann","night","janitor",",","Mr.","Hobb",",","approach","her","with","a","dare","but","simpl","plan","to","steal","a","hand","of","diamond","from","the","vault",".","Laura","agre","to","help",",","but","she","is","soon","in","over","her","head",".","And","it","is","not","long","befor","insur","investig","Mr.","Finch","has","his","eye","on","her","."],"lemmas":["London",",","1960",".","Laura","Quinn","be","the","lone","female","executive","at","London","Diamond","Corporation",".","she","be","frustrated","as","she","talent","be","rarely","acknowledge","and","she","less-experienced","male","co-worker","be","promote","ahead","of","she",".","she","be","shocked",",","but","intrigue",",","when","the","mild-mannered","night","janitor",",","Mr.","Hobbs",",","approach","she","with","a","daring","but","simple","plan","to","steal","a","handful","of","diamond","from","the","vault",".","Laura","agree","to","help",",","but","she","be","soon","in","over","she","head",".","and","it","be","not","long","before","insurance","investigator","Mr.","Finch","have","he","eye","on","she","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["London , 1960","Laura Quinn is","Quinn is the","is the lone","the lone female","lone female executive","female executive at","executive at London","at London Diamond","London Diamond Corporation","She is frustrated","is frustrated as","frustrated as her","as her talents","her talents are","talents are rarely","are rarely acknowledged","rarely acknowledged and","acknowledged and her","and her less-experienced","her less-experienced male","less-experienced male co-workers","male co-workers are","co-workers are promoted","are promoted ahead","promoted ahead of","ahead of her","She is shocked","is shocked ,","shocked , but",", but intrigued","but intrigued ,","intrigued , when",", when the","when the mild-mannered","the mild-mannered night","mild-mannered night janitor","night janitor ,","janitor , Mr.",", Mr. Hobbs","Mr. Hobbs ,","Hobbs , approaches",", approaches her","approaches her with","her with a","with a daring","a daring but","daring but simple","but simple plan","simple plan to","plan to steal","to steal a","steal a handful","a handful of","handful of diamonds","of diamonds from","diamonds from the","from the vault","Laura agrees to","agrees to help","to help ,","help , but",", but she","but she is","she is soon","is soon in","soon in over","in over her","over her head","And it is","it is not","is not long","not long before","long before insurance","before insurance investigator","insurance investigator Mr.","investigator Mr. Finch","Mr. Finch has","Finch has his","has his eyes","his eyes on","eyes on her"],"2grams":["London ,",", 1960","Laura Quinn","Quinn is","is the","the lone","lone female","female executive","executive at","at London","London Diamond","Diamond Corporation","She is","is frustrated","frustrated as","as her","her talents","talents are","are rarely","rarely acknowledged","acknowledged and","and her","her less-experienced","less-experienced male","male co-workers","co-workers are","are promoted","promoted ahead","ahead of","of her","She is","is shocked","shocked ,",", but","but intrigued","intrigued ,",", when","when the","the mild-mannered","mild-mannered night","night janitor","janitor ,",", Mr.","Mr. Hobbs","Hobbs ,",", approaches","approaches her","her with","with a","a daring","daring but","but simple","simple plan","plan to","to steal","steal a","a handful","handful of","of diamonds","diamonds from","from the","the vault","Laura agrees","agrees to","to help","help ,",", but","but she","she is","is soon","soon in","in over","over her","her head","And it","it is","is not","not long","long before","before insurance","insurance investigator","investigator Mr.","Mr. Finch","Finch has","has his","his eyes","eyes on","on her"]}

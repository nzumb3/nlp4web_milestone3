{"title":"Aimless","plot":"Aimless is the interwoven tale of three unconventional people looking for direction in life. Nathan is a jaded businessman, whose business just happens to be espionage and assassination. Percy is a balding sad-sack - a man so wretched he considers a mouse called Alan his best friend. And Zara is only a hair's breadth from returning to the insane asylum, which is unfortunate as she's about to get a nasty surprise. As our three protagonists find themselves swirling down the plughole of life, it's up to them to grab onto the greasy sink-hair of hope. They can either give up and admit defeat - or throw themselves headlong into new, confusing, and often frightening existences. With loved ones being kidnapped, mental states collapsing, genetic manipulation, vigilante violence, snipers, secrets, dead friends, clown fetishists, Glock-wielding mums, and two ever more confused narrators, it's hard to tell which option is more dangerous. Can Nathan, Zara and Percy escape their aimless lives - and do they even want to?","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Aimless","is","the","interwoven","tale","of","three","unconvent","peopl","look","for","direct","in","life",".","Nathan","is","a","jade","businessman",",","whose","busi","just","happen","to","be","espionag","and","assassin",".","Perci","is","a","bald","sad-sack","-","a","man","so","wretch","he","consid","a","mous","call","Alan","his","best","friend",".","And","Zara","is","onli","a","hair","'s","breadth","from","return","to","the","insan","asylum",",","which","is","unfortun","as","she","'s","about","to","get","a","nasti","surpris",".","As","our","three","protagonist","find","themselv","swirl","down","the","plughol","of","life",",","it","'s","up","to","them","to","grab","onto","the","greasi","sink-hair","of","hope",".","They","can","either","give","up","and","admit","defeat","-","or","throw","themselv","headlong","into","new",",","confus",",","and","often","frighten","exist",".","With","love","one","be","kidnap",",","mental","state","collaps",",","genet","manipul",",","vigilant","violenc",",","sniper",",","secret",",","dead","friend",",","clown","fetishist",",","Glock-wield","mum",",","and","two","ever","more","confus","narrat",",","it","'s","hard","to","tell","which","option","is","more","danger",".","Can","Nathan",",","Zara","and","Perci","escap","their","aimless","live","-","and","do","they","even","want","to","?"],"lemmas":["aimless","be","the","interwoven","tale","of","three","unconventional","people","look","for","direction","in","life",".","Nathan","be","a","jaded","businessman",",","whose","business","just","happen","to","be","espionage","and","assassination",".","Percy","be","a","balding","sad-sack","-","a","man","so","wretched","he","consider","a","mouse","call","Alan","he","best","friend",".","and","Zara","be","only","a","hair","'s","breadth","from","return","to","the","insane","asylum",",","which","be","unfortunate","as","she","be","about","to","get","a","nasty","surprise",".","as","we","three","protagonist","find","themselves","swirl","down","the","plughole","of","life",",","it","be","up","to","they","to","grab","onto","the","greasy","sink-hair","of","hope",".","they","can","either","give","up","and","admit","defeat","-","or","throw","themselves","headlong","into","new",",","confusing",",","and","often","frightening","existence",".","with","love","one","be","kidnap",",","mental","state","collapse",",","genetic","manipulation",",","vigilante","violence",",","sniper",",","secret",",","dead","friend",",","clown","fetishist",",","glock-wielding","mum",",","and","two","ever","more","confused","narrator",",","it","be","hard","to","tell","which","option","be","more","dangerous",".","can","Nathan",",","Zara","and","Percy","escape","they","aimless","life","-","and","do","they","even","want","to","?"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Aimless is the","is the interwoven","the interwoven tale","interwoven tale of","tale of three","of three unconventional","three unconventional people","unconventional people looking","people looking for","looking for direction","for direction in","direction in life","Nathan is a","is a jaded","a jaded businessman","jaded businessman ,","businessman , whose",", whose business","whose business just","business just happens","just happens to","happens to be","to be espionage","be espionage and","espionage and assassination","Percy is a","is a balding","a balding sad-sack","balding sad-sack -","sad-sack -

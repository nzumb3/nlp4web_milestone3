{"title":"Onde a Terra Acaba","plot":"On 17 May 1931, the young director Mário Peixoto released his masterpiece \"Limite\" in a premiere in Capitólio Theater in Rio de Janeiro to astonished audiences bewildered by the impressive and poetic images. Considered by many viewers the best Brazilian movie ever made, this feature has never been released commercially. However, in a great paradox, Mário Peixoto has never made any other movie. The director Sérgio Machado pays a great tribute to the life and work Mário Peixoto a.k.a. Maçarico by his close friends with this documentary, using his diary; footages of \"Limite\", the never concluded \"Onde a Terra Acaba\" (1933) and the short \"O Homem do Morcego\" (1980); and interesting testimonies of Olga Breno, Ruy Solberg, Nelson Pereira dos Santos and Walter Salles among others.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["On","17","May","1931",",","the","young","director","Mário","Peixoto","releas","his","masterpiec","\"","Limit","\"","in","a","premier","in","Capitólio","Theater","in","Rio","de","Janeiro","to","astonish","audienc","bewild","by","the","impress","and","poetic","imag",".","Consid","by","mani","viewer","the","best","Brazilian","movi","ever","made",",","this","featur","has","never","been","releas","commerci",".","Howev",",","in","a","great","paradox",",","Mário","Peixoto","has","never","made","ani","other","movi",".","The","director","Sérgio","Machado","pay","a","great","tribut","to","the","life","and","work","Mário","Peixoto","a.k.a.","Maçarico","by","his","close","friend","with","this","documentari",",","use","his","diari",";","footag","of","\"","Limit","\"",",","the","never","conclud","\"","Onde","a","Terra","Acaba","\"","(","1933",")","and","the","short","\"","O","Homem","do","Morcego","\"","(","1980",")",";","and","interest","testimoni","of","Olga","Breno",",","Ruy","Solberg",",","Nelson","Pereira","dos","Santo","and","Walter","Sall","among","other","."],"lemmas":["on","17","May","1931",",","the","young","director","Mário","Peixoto","release","he","masterpiece","``","Limite","''","in","a","premiere","in","Capitólio","Theater","in","Rio","de","Janeiro","to","astonished","audience","bewilder","by","the","impressive","and","poetic","image",".","consider","by","many","viewer","the","best","brazilian","movie","ever","make",",","this","feature","have","never","be","release","commercially",".","however",",","in","a","great","paradox",",","Mário","Peixoto","have","never","make","any","other","movie",".","the","director","Sérgio","Machado","pay","a","great","tribute","to","the","life","and","work","Mário","Peixoto","a.k.a.","Maçarico","by","he","close","friend","with","this","documentary",",","use","he","diary",";","footage","of","``","Limite","''",",","the","never","conclude","``","Onde","a","Terra","Acaba","''","-lrb-","1933","-rrb-","and","the","short","``","O","Homem","do","Morcego","''","-lrb-","1980","-rrb-",";","and","interesting","testimony","of","Olga","Breno",",","Ruy","Solberg",",","Nelson","Pereira","dos","Santos","and","Walter","Salles","among","other","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["On 17 May","17 May 1931","May 1931 ,","1931 , the",", the young","the young director","young director Mário","director Mário Peixoto","Mário Peixoto released","Peixoto released his","released his masterpiece","his masterpiece \"","masterpiece \" Limite","\" Limite \"","Limite \" in","\" in a","in a premiere","a premiere in","premiere in Capitólio","in Capitólio Theater","Capitólio Theater in","Theater in Rio","in Rio de","Rio de Janeiro","de Janeiro to","Janeiro to astonished","to astonished audiences","astonished audiences bewildered","audiences bewildered by","bewildered by the","by the impressive","the impressive and","impressive and poetic","and poetic images","Considered by many","by many viewers","many viewers the","viewers the best","the best Brazilian","best Brazilian movie","Brazilian movie ever","movie ever made","ever made ,","made , this",", this feature","this feature has","feature has never","has never been","never been released","been released commercially","However , in",", in a","in a great","a great paradox","great paradox ,","paradox , Mário",", Mário Peixoto","Mário Peixoto has","Peixoto has never","has never made","never made any","made any other","any other movie","The director Sérgio","director Sérgio Machado","Sérgio Machado pays","Machado pays a","pays a great","a great tribute","great tribute to","tribute to the","to the life","the life and","life and work","and work Mário","work Mário Peixoto","Mário Peixoto a.k.a.","Peixoto a.k.a.

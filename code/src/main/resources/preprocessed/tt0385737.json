{"title":"Happy Ero Christmas","plot":"Byung-ki (Cha Tae-hyun) is a clumsy village policeman who helps out with trivial tasks like distributing promotional papers, though he dreams of fighting evil. One day, he runs into Min-kyong (Kim Sun-a), an employee at the neighborhood bowling alley, and falls for her at first sight. However, his attempts to woo her go unnoticed. Meanwhile, Sang-doo, the boss of the local gang (with whom Byung-ki harbors a boyhood grudge) also swoons over Min-kyong and vows to take her virginity on Christmas Eve.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"],"stems":["Byung-ki","(","Cha","Tae-hyun",")","is","a","clumsi","villag","policeman","who","help","out","with","trivial","task","like","distribut","promot","paper",",","though","he","dream","of","fight","evil",".","One","day",",","he","run","into","Min-kyong","(","Kim","Sun-a",")",",","an","employe","at","the","neighborhood","bowl","alley",",","and","fall","for","her","at","first","sight",".","Howev",",","his","attempt","to","woo","her","go","unnot",".","Meanwhil",",","Sang-doo",",","the","boss","of","the","local","gang","(","with","whom","Byung-ki","harbor","a","boyhood","grudg",")","also","swoon","over","Min-kyong","and","vow","to","take","her","virgin","on","Christma","Eve","."],"lemmas":["byung-ki","-lrb-","cha","tae-hyun","-rrb-","be","a","clumsy","village","policeman","who","help","out","with","trivial","task","like","distribute","promotional","papers",",","though","he","dream","of","fight","evil",".","one","day",",","he","run","into","min-kyong","-lrb-","Kim","Sun-a","-rrb-",",","a","employee","at","the","neighborhood","bowling","alley",",","and","fall","for","she","at","first","sight",".","however",",","he","attempt","to","woo","she","go","unnoticed",".","meanwhile",",","sang-doo",",","the","boss","of","the","local","gang","-lrb-","with","whom","byung-ki","harbor","a","boyhood","grudge","-rrb-","also","swoon","over","min-kyong","and","vow","to","take","she","virginity","on","Christmas","Eve","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Byung-ki ( Cha","( Cha Tae-hyun","Cha Tae-hyun )","Tae-hyun ) is",") is a","is a clumsy","a clumsy village","clumsy village policeman","village policeman who","policeman who helps","who helps out","helps out with","out with trivial","with trivial tasks","trivial tasks like","tasks like distributing","like distributing promotional","distributing promotional papers","promotional papers ,","papers , though",", though he","though he dreams","he dreams of","dreams of fighting","of fighting evil","One day ,","day , he",", he runs","he runs into","runs into Min-kyong","into Min-kyong (","Min-kyong ( Kim","( Kim Sun-a","Kim Sun-a )","Sun-a ) ,",") , an",", an employee","an employee at","employee at the","at the neighborhood","the neighborhood bowling","neighborhood bowling alley","bowling alley ,","alley , and",", and falls","and falls for","falls for her","for her at","her at first","at first sight","However , his",", his attempts","his attempts to","attempts to woo","to woo her","woo her go","her go unnoticed","Meanwhile , Sang-doo",", Sang-doo ,","Sang-doo , the",", the boss","the boss of","boss of the","of the local","the local gang","local gang (","gang ( with","( with whom","with whom Byung-ki","whom Byung-ki harbors","Byung-ki harbors a","harbors a boyhood","a boyhood grudge","boyhood grudge )","grudge ) also",") also swoons","also swoons over","swoons over Min-kyong","over Min-kyong and","Min-kyong and vows","and vows to","vows to take","to take her","take her virginity","her virginity on","virginity on Christmas","on Christmas Eve"],"2grams":["Byung-ki (","( Cha","Cha Tae-hyun","Tae-hyun )",") is","is a","a clumsy","clumsy village","village policeman","policeman who","who helps","helps out","out with","with trivial","trivial tasks","tasks like","like distributing","distributing promotional","promotional papers","papers ,",", though","though he","he dreams","dreams of","of fighting","fighting evil","One day","day ,",", he","he runs","runs into","into Min-kyong","Min-kyong (","( Kim","Kim Sun-a","Sun-a )",") ,",", an","an employee","employee at","at the","the neighborhood","neighborhood bowling","bowling alley","alley ,",", and","and falls","falls for","for her","her at","at first","first sight","However ,",", his","his attempts","attempts to","to woo","woo her","her go","go unnoticed","Meanwhile ,",", Sang-doo","Sang-doo ,",", the","the boss","boss of","of the","the local","local gang","gang (","( with","with whom","whom Byung-ki","Byung-ki harbors","harbors a","a boyhood","boyhood grudge","grudge )",") also","also swoons","swoons over","over Min-kyong","Min-kyong and","and vows","vows to","to take","take her","her virginity","virginity on","on Christmas","Christmas Eve"]}

{"title":"Tinar","plot":"Doc follows the life of a boy named Tinar, a hired cowherd. Tinar works alone; his father lives elsewhere on the mountain with his new wife and family. Tinar's job is to keep careful watch over a fairly large herd of milking cows. He eats, sleeps, and even plays with them; they are his only companions. As the seasons change, a pastoral portrait of Tinar and his life gradually turns into a harrowing and lonely account of a boy longing for escape and love. What Tinar wants most is to go to school like his step-siblings, or to join his brother, who has escaped their father and now works in the city with their uncle.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Doc","follow","the","life","of","a","boy","name","Tinar",",","a","hire","cowherd",".","Tinar","work","alon",";","his","father","live","elsewher","on","the","mountain","with","his","new","wife","and","famili",".","Tinar","'s","job","is","to","keep","care","watch","over","a","fair","larg","herd","of","milk","cow",".","He","eat",",","sleep",",","and","even","play","with","them",";","they","are","his","onli","companion",".","As","the","season","chang",",","a","pastor","portrait","of","Tinar","and","his","life","gradual","turn","into","a","harrow","and","lone","account","of","a","boy","long","for","escap","and","love",".","What","Tinar","want","most","is","to","go","to","school","like","his","step-sibl",",","or","to","join","his","brother",",","who","has","escap","their","father","and","now","work","in","the","citi","with","their","uncl","."],"lemmas":["doc","follow","the","life","of","a","boy","name","Tinar",",","a","hire","cowherd",".","Tinar","work","alone",";","he","father","live","elsewhere","on","the","mountain","with","he","new","wife","and","family",".","Tinar","'s","job","be","to","keep","careful","watch","over","a","fairly","large","herd","of","milk","cow",".","he","eat",",","sleep",",","and","even","play","with","they",";","they","be","he","only","companion",".","as","the","season","change",",","a","pastoral","portrait","of","Tinar","and","he","life","gradually","turn","into","a","harrowing","and","lonely","account","of","a","boy","longing","for","escape","and","love",".","what","tinar","want","most","be","to","go","to","school","like","he","step-sibling",",","or","to","join","he","brother",",","who","have","escape","they","father","and","now","work","in","the","city","with","they","uncle","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Doc follows the","follows the life","the life of","life of a","of a boy","a boy named","boy named Tinar","named Tinar ,","Tinar , a",", a hired","a hired cowherd","Tinar works alone","works alone ;","alone ;

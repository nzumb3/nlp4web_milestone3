{"title":"Black Sorority Project: The Exodus","plot":"In 1913, a group of twenty-two female students at Howard University changed the course of American history forever. Defying barriers of race and gender, they courageously joined the women's suffrage movement and formed a new sorority, Delta Sigma Theta, which would grow to become -- as it is today -- one of the nation's most formidable women's organizations. Narrated by Tamara Tunie, \"Black Sorority Project: The Exodus\" transports the viewer back in time on a photographic journey into the world of these dynamic and ambitious Howard coeds and reveals one of the more remarkable chapters of women's history.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["In","1913",",","a","group","of","twenty-two","femal","student","at","Howard","Univers","chang","the","cours","of","American","histori","forev",".","Defi","barrier","of","race","and","gender",",","they","courag","join","the","women","'s","suffrag","movement","and","form","a","new","soror",",","Delta","Sigma","Theta",",","which","would","grow","to","becom","--","as","it","is","today","--","one","of","the","nation","'s","most","formid","women","'s","organ",".","Narrat","by","Tamara","Tuni",",","\"","Black","Soror","Project",":","The","Exodus","\"","transport","the","viewer","back","in","time","on","a","photograph","journey","into","the","world","of","these","dynam","and","ambiti","Howard","co","and","reveal","one","of","the","more","remark","chapter","of","women","'s","histori","."],"lemmas":["in","1913",",","a","group","of","twenty-two","female","student","at","Howard","University","change","the","course","of","american","history","forever",".","defy","barrier","of","race","and","gender",",","they","courageously","join","the","woman","'s","suffrage","movement","and","form","a","new","sorority",",","Delta","Sigma","Theta",",","which","would","grow","to","become","--","as","it","be","today","--","one","of","the","nation","'s","most","formidable","woman","'s","organization",".","narrate","by","Tamara","Tunie",",","``","Black","Sorority","Project",":","The","Exodus","''","transport","the","viewer","back","in","time","on","a","photographic","journey","into","the","world","of","these","dynamic","and","ambitious","Howard","coed","and","reveal","one","of","the","more","remarkable","chapter","of","woman","'s","history","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["In

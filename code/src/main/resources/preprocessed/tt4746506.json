{"title":"Sweet Dreams","plot":"Always inseparable with his beloved and joyful young mother, 9-year-old Massimo, now has to endure the tremendous blow from her death and the insufferable burden of accepting his loss. But no, this can't be true, his mother could not have died of a sudden heart attack, moreover, she simply cannot be his guardian angel from heaven, because Massimo, strongly believes that his vital mother is very much alive, temporarily residing in the United States. As the years pass by, profoundly traumatised little Massimo still refusing to accept the tragic event, he will silently continue carrying grief's heavy load on his shoulders, growing up to become a distant and detached journalist who chose to shut down his emotions, not out of revenge, but in order to survive. However, inevitably, after the death of his father, Massimo will need to confront his past in the very source of his persisting anguish, his house, react to the pain, refuse to be a victim, and ultimately, face courageously a well-hidden truth that was kept in the family for over thirty years.","genres":["Drama","

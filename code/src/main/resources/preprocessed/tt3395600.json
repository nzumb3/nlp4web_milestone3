The first is the story of the eye of a collector. Why does art collector William Louis-Dreyfus fall in love with the art -- and the artists -- he collects? The second is a story of generosity: How one man's passion for art and his passion for justice are joined in a single act of generosity. The third is the story of actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus discovering the depth of her father's passion for art, the people that this passion has brought into his life, and her search for the roots of his zeal for both art and justice.

Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children'z

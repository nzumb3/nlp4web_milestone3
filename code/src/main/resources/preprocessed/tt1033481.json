{"title":"A Journey of Dmitry Shostakovich","plot":"The Soviet Union's most famous composer took a sea voyage to America near the end of his life. This remarkable documentary is structured around his days on a Russian cruise ship in 1973. Soviet historical and propaganda footage form a visual counterpoint to a world-weary narration. Ample quotations from Shostakovich's writings give a window on his life story, which also spans twentieth century musical and world history. Unusual footage from his musical works, such as the operas The Nose and Lady Macbeth, are highlights in an elliptical and experimental tour-de-force.","genres":["Documentary"," Music"],"stems":["The","Soviet","Union","'s","most","famous","compos","took","a","sea","voyag","to","America","near","the","end","of","his","life",".","This","remark","documentari","is","structur","around","his","day","on","a","Russian","cruis","ship","in","1973",".","Soviet","histor","and","propaganda","footag","form","a","visual","counterpoint","to","a","world-weari","narrat",".","Ample","quotat","from","Shostakovich","'s","write","give","a","window","on","his","life","stori",",","which","also","span","twentieth","centuri","music","and","world","histori",".","Unusual","footag","from","his","music","work",",","such","as","the","opera","The","Nose","and","Ladi","Macbeth",",","are","highlight","in","an","ellipt","and","experiment","tour-de-forc","."],"lemmas":["the","Soviet","Union","'s","most","famous","composer","take","a","sea","voyage","to","America","near","the","end","of","he","life",".","this","remarkable","documentary","be","structure","around","he","day","on","a","russian","cruise","ship","in","1973",".","soviet","historical","and","propaganda","footage","form","a","visual","counterpoint","to","a","world-weary","narration",".","ample","quotation","from","Shostakovich","'s","writings","give","a","window","on","he","life","story",",","which","also","span","twentieth","century","musical","and","world","history",".","unusual","footage","from","he","musical","work",",","such","as","the","opera","the","Nose","and","Lady","Macbeth",",","be","highlight","in","a","elliptical","and","experimental","tour-de-force","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["The Soviet Union","Soviet Union 's","Union 's most","'s most famous","most famous composer","famous composer took","composer took a","took a sea","a sea voyage","sea voyage to","voyage to America","to America near","America near the","near the end","the end of","end of his","of his life","This remarkable documentary","remarkable documentary is","documentary is structured","is structured around","structured around his","around his days","his days on","days on a","on a Russian","a Russian cruise","Russian cruise ship","cruise ship in","ship in 1973","Soviet historical and","historical and propaganda","and propaganda footage","propaganda footage form","footage form a","form a visual","a visual counterpoint","visual counterpoint to","counterpoint to a","to a world-weary","a world-weary narration","Ample quotations from","quotations from Shostakovich","from Shostakovich 's","Shostakovich 's writings","'s writings give","writings give a","give a window","a window on","window on his","on his life","his life story","life story ,","story , which",", which also","which also spans","also spans twentieth","spans twentieth century","twentieth century musical","century musical and","musical and world","and world history","Unusual footage from","footage from his","from his musical","his musical works","musical works ,","works , such",", such as","such as the","as the operas","the operas The","operas The Nose","The Nose and","Nose and Lady","and Lady Macbeth","Lady Macbeth ,","Macbeth , are",", are highlights","are highlights in","highlights in an","in an elliptical","an elliptical and","elliptical and experimental","and experimental tour-de-force"],"2grams":["The Soviet","Soviet Union","Union 's","'s most","most famous","famous composer","composer took","took a","a sea","sea voyage","voyage to","to America","America near","near the","the end","end of","of his","his life","This remarkable","remarkable documentary","documentary is","is structured","structured around","around his","his days","days on","on a","a Russian","Russian cruise","cruise ship","ship in","in 1973","Soviet historical","historical and","and propaganda","propaganda footage","footage form","form a","a visual","visual counterpoint","counterpoint to","to a","a world-weary","world-weary narration","Ample quotations","quotations from","from Shostakovich","Shostakovich 's","'s writings","writings give","give a","a window","window on","on his","his life","life story","story ,",", which","which also","also spans","spans twentieth","twentieth century","century musical","musical and","and world","world history","Unusual footage","footage from","from his","his musical","musical works","works ,",", such","such as","as the","the operas","operas The","The Nose","Nose and","and Lady","Lady Macbeth","Macbeth ,",", are","are highlights","highlights in","in an","an elliptical","elliptical and","and experimental","experimental tour-de-force"]}

{"title":"Nazar","plot":"Bombay Police are baffled when several women of lose moral, bar girls, and prostitutes are found brutally murdered by a scalpel. The Police would like to assign this case to Inspector Shirke, however, Sub-Inspector Sujata Deshmukh insists that she can solve these murders with the help of her senior, Inspector Rohan Sethi. The matter is re-assigned to both of them and they soon become involved in this investigation. They are approached by a popular singer/dancer, Divya Varma, who claims to have visions of women getting killed. Divya is initially scoffed at, but when the murders really occur, her story gets a second look. After another murder at the Samurai Club, the Police find that they have a suspect named Jagdish, who also happens to be Divya's alcoholic paternal uncle. Despite of Divya's protests, Jagdish is arrested and held in a cell. Then Divya starts getting visions of her very own murder, leaving the question unanswered as to who the real killer is, and whether she/he will succeed in getting away with Divya's murder also.","genres":["Thriller"],"stems":["Bombay","Polic","are","baffl","when","sever","women","of","lose","moral",",","bar","girl",",","and","prostitut","are","found","brutal","murder","by","a","scalpel",".","The","Polic","would","like","to","assign","this","case","to","Inspector","Shirk",",","howev",",","Sub-Inspector","Sujata","Deshmukh","insist","that","she","can","solv","these","murder","with","the","help","of","her","senior",",","Inspector","Rohan","Sethi",".","The","matter","is","re-assign","to","both","of","them","and","they","soon","becom","involv","in","this","investig",".","They","are","approach","by","a","popular","singer/danc",",","Divya","Varma",",","who","claim","to","have","vision","of","women","get","kill",".","Divya","is","initi","scof","at",",","but","when","the","murder","realli","occur",",","her","stori","get","a","second","look",".","After","anoth","murder","at","the","Samurai","Club",",","the","Polic","find","that","they","have","a","suspect","name","Jagdish",",","who","also","happen","to","be","Divya","'s","alcohol","patern","uncl",".","Despit","of","Divya","'s","protest",",","Jagdish","is","arrest","and","held","in","a","cell",".","Then","Divya","start","get","vision","of","her","veri","own","murder",",","leav","the","question","unansw","as","to","who","the","real","killer","is",",","and","whether","she/h","will","succeed","in","get","away","with","Divya","'s","murder","also","."],"lemmas":["Bombay","Police","be","baffle","when","several","woman","of","lose","moral",",","bar","girl",",","and","prostitute","be","find","brutally","murder","by","a","scalpel",".","the","Police","would","like","to","assign","this","case","to","Inspector","Shirke",",","however",",","Sub-Inspector","Sujata","Deshmukh","insist","that","she","can","solve","these","murder","with","the","help","of","she","senior",",","Inspector","Rohan","Sethi",".","the","matter","be","re-assigned","to","both","of","they","and","they","soon","become","involve","in","this","investigation",".","they","be","approach","by","a","popular","singer/dancer",",","Divya","Varma",",","who","claim","to","have","vision","of","woman","get","kill",".","Divya","be","initially","scoff","at",",","but","when","the","murder","really","occur",",","she","story","get","a","second","look",".","after","another","murder","at","the","Samurai","Club",",","the","Police","find","that","they","have","a","suspect","name","Jagdish",",","who","also","happen","to","be","Divya","'s","alcoholic","paternal","uncle",".","despite","of","Divya","'s","protest",",","Jagdish","be","arrest","and","hold","in","a","cell",".","then","Divya","start","get","vision","of","she","very","own","murder",",","leave","the","question","unanswered","as","to","who","the","real","killer","be",",","and","whether","she/he","will","succeed","in","get","away","with","Divya","'s","murder","also","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Bombay

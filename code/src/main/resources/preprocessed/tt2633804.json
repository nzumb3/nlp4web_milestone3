{"title":"The Anarchist's Birthday","plot":"An angry farmer finds a witch camping on his land, so he gets the law involved. Enter the government-trained vicar for this very purpose. Unfortunately, this is his first operation, and his skills are lacking...! He's employed two men on community service: the titular anarchist and a cocky delinquent, but no volunteers turn up, with the exception of an all-too-useless townie girl. The motley bunch leave Bristol on foot in search of the witch's blood. In the fields they must prepare, but nothing goes to plan... Finally they charge.","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["An","angri","farmer","find","a","witch","camp","on","his","land",",","so","he","get","the","law","involv",".","Enter","the","government-train","vicar","for","this","veri","purpos",".","Unfortun",",","this","is","his","first","oper",",","and","his","skill","are","lack","...","!","He","'s","employ","two","men","on","communiti","servic",":","the","titular","anarchist","and","a","cocki","delinqu",",","but","no","volunt","turn","up",",","with","the","except","of","an","all-too-useless","towni","girl",".","The","motley","bunch","leav","Bristol","on","foot","in","search","of","the","witch","'s","blood",".","In","the","field","they","must","prepar",",","but","noth","goe","to","plan","...","Final","they","charg","."],"lemmas":["a","angry","farmer","find","a","witch","camping","on","he","land",",","so","he","get","the","law","involve",".","enter","the","government-trained","vicar","for","this","very","purpose",".","unfortunately",",","this","be","he","first","operation",",","and","he","skill","be","lack","...","!","he","be","employ","two","man","on","community","service",":","the","titular","anarchist","and","a","cocky","delinquent",",","but","no","volunteer","turn","up",",","with","the","exception","of","a","all-too-useless","townie","girl",".","the","motley","bunch","leave","Bristol","on","foot","in","search","of","the","witch","'s","blood",".","in","the","field","they","must","prepare",",","but","nothing","go","to","plan","...","finally","they","charge","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION"],"3grams":["An angry farmer","angry farmer finds","farmer finds a","finds a witch","a witch camping","witch camping on","camping on his","on his land","his land ,","land , so",", so he","so he gets","he gets the","gets the law","the law involved","Enter the government-trained","the government-trained vicar","government-trained vicar for","vicar for this","for this very","this very purpose","Unfortunately , this",", this is","this is his","is his first","his first operation","first operation ,","operation , and",", and his","and his skills","his skills are","skills are lacking","are lacking ...","He 's employed","'s employed two","employed two men","two men on","men on community","on community service","community service :","service : the",": the titular","the titular anarchist","titular anarchist and","anarchist and a","and a cocky","a cocky delinquent","cocky delinquent ,","delinquent , but",", but no","but no volunteers","no volunteers turn","volunteers turn up","turn up ,","up , with",", with the","with the exception","the exception of","exception of an","of an all-too-useless","an all-too-useless townie","all-too-useless townie girl","The motley bunch","motley bunch leave","bunch leave Bristol","leave Bristol on","Bristol on foot","on foot in","foot in search","in search of","search of the","of the witch","the witch 's","witch 's blood","In the fields","the fields they","fields they must","they must prepare","must prepare ,","prepare , but",", but nothing","but nothing goes","nothing goes to","goes to plan","to plan ...","plan ...

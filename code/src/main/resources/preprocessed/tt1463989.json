{"title":"A Different Conversation","plot":"\"A Different Conversation\" explores the experiences of college students on a trip to Jerusalem. Drawing from multiple religious and cultural backgrounds, these students generated individual and collective narratives as to how religion is both relevant and alive today. Within the context of Jerusalem's political tensions, the students explored interfaith dialogue and the interactions of the many religious traditions that inhabit this sacred space. Moreover, this space induced moments of self-reflection - forcing them to better understand themselves as individuals in a rich religious community. This documentary approaches Jerusalem from a different perspective - one focused not on politics or violence, but on religion and the people it affects.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["\"","A","Differ","Convers","\"","explor","the","experi","of","colleg","student","on","a","trip","to","Jerusalem",".","Draw","from","multipl","religi","and","cultur","background",",","these","student","generat","individu","and","collect","narrat","as","to","how","religion","is","both","relev","and","aliv","today",".","Within","the","context","of","Jerusalem","'s","polit","tension",",","the","student","explor","interfaith","dialogu","and","the","interact","of","the","mani","religi","tradit","that","inhabit","this","sacr","space",".","Moreov",",","this","space","induc","moment","of","self-reflect","-","forc","them","to","better","understand","themselv","as","individu","in","a","rich","religi","communiti",".","This","documentari","approach","Jerusalem","from","a","differ","perspect","-","one","focus","not","on","polit","or","violenc",",","but","on","religion","and","the","peopl","it","affect","."],"lemmas":["``","a","different","conversation","''","explore","the","experience","of","college","student","on","a","trip","to","Jerusalem",".","draw","from","multiple","religious","and","cultural","background",",","these","student","generate","individual","and","collective","narrative","as","to","how","religion","be","both","relevant","and","alive","today",".","within","the","context","of","Jerusalem","'s","political","tension",",","the","student","explore","interfaith","dialogue","and","the","interaction","of","the","many","religious","tradition","that","inhabit","this","sacred","space",".","moreover",",","this","space","induce","moment","of","self-reflection","-","force","they","to","better","understand","themselves","as","individual","in","a","rich","religious","community",".","this","documentary","approach","Jerusalem","from","a","different","perspective","-","one","focus","not","on","politics","or","violence",",","but","on","religion","and","the","people","it","affect","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["\" A Different","A Different Conversation","Different Conversation \"","Conversation \" explores","\" explores the","explores the experiences","the experiences of","experiences of college","of college students","college students on","students on a","on a trip","a trip to","trip to Jerusalem","Drawing from multiple","from multiple religious","multiple religious and","religious and cultural","and cultural backgrounds","cultural backgrounds ,","backgrounds , these",", these students","these students generated","students generated individual","generated individual and","individual and collective","and collective narratives","collective narratives as","narratives as to","as to how","to how religion","how religion is","religion is both","is both relevant","both relevant and","relevant and alive","and alive today","Within the context","the context of","context of Jerusalem","of Jerusalem 's","Jerusalem 's political","'s political tensions","political tensions ,","tensions , the",", the students","the students explored","students explored interfaith","explored interfaith dialogue","interfaith dialogue and","dialogue and the","and the interactions","the interactions of","interactions of the","of the many","the many religious","many religious traditions","religious traditions that","traditions that inhabit","that inhabit this","inhabit this sacred","this sacred space","Moreover , this",", this space","this space induced","space induced moments","induced moments of","moments of self-reflection","of self-reflection -","self-reflection -

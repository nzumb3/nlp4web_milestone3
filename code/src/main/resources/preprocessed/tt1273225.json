{"title":"Milking the Rhino","plot":"The clichés of nature documentaries ignore a key landscape feature: villagers just off-camera, who navigate the dangers and costs of living with wildlife. The Maasai of Kenya and Namibia's Himba - two of Earth's oldest cattle cultures - are in the midst of upheaval. After a century of \"white man conservation,\" which displaced them and fueled resentment towards wildlife, they are vying to share the wildlife-tourism pie. Community-based conservation, which tries to balance the needs of wildlife and people, has been touted as \"win-win.' The reality is more complex. Charting the collision of ancient ways with Western expectations, MILKING THE RHINO tells intimate, hopeful and heartbreaking stories of people facing deep cultural change.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["The","cliché","of","natur","documentari","ignor","a","key","landscap","featur",":","villag","just","off-camera",",","who","navig","the","danger","and","cost","of","live","with","wildlif",".","The","Maasai","of","Kenya","and","Namibia","'s","Himba","-","two","of","Earth","'s","oldest","cattl","cultur","-","are","in","the","midst","of","upheav",".","After","a","centuri","of","\"","white","man","conserv",",","\"","which","displac","them","and","fuel","resent","toward","wildlif",",","they","are","vy","to","share","the","wildlife-tour","pie",".","Community-bas","conserv",",","which","tri","to","balanc","the","need","of","wildlif","and","peopl",",","has","been","tout","as","\"","win-win",".","'","The","realiti","is","more","complex",".","Chart","the","collis","of","ancient","way","with","Western","expect",",","MILKING","THE","RHINO","tell","intim",",","hope","and","heartbreak","stori","of","peopl","face","deep","cultur","chang","."],"lemmas":["the","clichés","of","nature","documentary","ignore","a","key","landscape","feature",":","villager","just","off-camera",",","who","navigate","the","danger","and","cost","of","live","with","wildlife",".","the","Maasai","of","Kenya","and","Namibia","'s","Himba","-","two","of","Earth","'s","oldest","cattle","culture","-","be","in","the","midst","of","upheaval",".","after","a","century","of","``","white","man","conservation",",","''","which","displace","they","and","fuel","resentment","towards","wildlife",",","they","be","vie","to","share","the","wildlife-tourism","pie",".","community-based","conservation",",","which","try","to","balance","the","need","of","wildlife","and","people",",","have","be","tout","as","``","win-win",".","'","the","reality","be","more","complex",".","chart","the","collision","of","ancient","way","with","western","expectation",",","milk","the","rhino","tell","intimate",",","hopeful","and","heartbreaking","story","of","people","face","deep","cultural","change","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["The clichés of","clichés of nature","of nature documentaries","nature documentaries ignore","documentaries ignore a","ignore a key","a key landscape","key landscape feature","landscape feature :","feature : villagers",": villagers just","villagers just off-camera","just off-camera ,","off-camera , who",", who navigate","who navigate the","navigate the dangers","the dangers and","dangers and costs","and costs of","costs of living","of living with","living with wildlife","The Maasai of","Maasai of Kenya","of Kenya and","Kenya and Namibia","and Namibia 's","Namibia 's Himba","'s Himba -","Himba - two","- two of","two of Earth","of Earth 's","Earth 's oldest","'s oldest cattle","oldest cattle cultures","cattle cultures -","cultures - are","- are in","are in the","in the midst","the midst of","midst of upheaval","After a century","a century of","century of \"","of \" white","\" white man","white man conservation","man conservation ,","conservation , \"",", \" which","\" which displaced","which displaced them","displaced them and","them and fueled","and fueled resentment","fueled resentment towards","resentment towards wildlife","towards wildlife ,","wildlife , they",", they are","they are vying","are vying to","vying to share","to share the","share the wildlife-tourism","the wildlife-tourism pie","Community-based conservation ,","conservation , which",", which tries","which tries to","tries to balance","to balance the","balance the needs","the needs of","needs of wildlife","of wildlife and","wildlife and people","and people ,","people , has",", has been","has been touted","been touted as","touted as \"","as \" win-win","\" win-win .","win-win .

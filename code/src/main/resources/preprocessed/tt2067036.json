{"title":"Y-Love","plot":"Y-Love is the \"premier Orthodox Jewish entity in hip hop.\" Raised in inner-city Baltimore, Yitz Jordan became fascinated with Judaism as a child, attended Yeshiva in his teens and endured a short-lived arranged marriage to a Yiddish speaking woman who didn't think he was religious enough. Music is the medium through which Y-Love connects to his faith; he seems most at ease spouting rhymes on a Jerusalem stage, surrounded by adoring, religious fans. This documentary paints a poignant portrait of a perennial outsider: a Black, Jewish, gay orphan searching for a home.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["Y-Love","is","the","\"","premier","Orthodox","Jewish","entiti","in","hip","hop",".","\"","Rais","in","inner-c","Baltimor",",","Yitz","Jordan","becam","fascin","with","Judaism","as","a","child",",","attend","Yeshiva","in","his","teen","and","endur","a","short-liv","arrang","marriag","to","a","Yiddish","speak","woman","who","did","n't","think","he","was","religi","enough",".","Music","is","the","medium","through","which","Y-Love","connect","to","his","faith",";","he","seem","most","at","eas","spout","rhyme","on","a","Jerusalem","stage",",","surround","by","ador",",","religi","fan",".","This","documentari","paint","a","poignant","portrait","of","a","perenni","outsid",":","a","Black",",","Jewish",",","gay","orphan","search","for","a","home","."],"lemmas":["y-love","be","the","``","premier","Orthodox","Jewish","entity","in","hip","hop",".","''","raise","in","inner-city","Baltimore",",","Yitz","Jordan","become","fascinate","with","Judaism","as","a","child",",","attend","Yeshiva","in","he","teens","and","endure","a","short-lived","arrange","marriage","to","a","yiddish","speaking","woman","who","do","not","think","he","be","religious","enough",".","music","be","the","medium","through","which","y-love","connect","to","he","faith",";","he","seem","most","at","ease","spout","rhyme","on","a","Jerusalem","stage",",","surround","by","adoring",",","religious","fan",".","this","documentary","paint","a","poignant","portrait","of","a","perennial","outsider",":","a","Black",",","Jewish",",","gay","orphan","search","for","a","home","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","ORGANIZATION","ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Y-Love is the","is the \"","the \" premier","\" premier Orthodox","premier Orthodox Jewish","Orthodox Jewish entity","Jewish entity in","entity in hip","in hip hop","hip hop .","hop . \"","Raised in inner-city","in inner-city Baltimore","inner-city Baltimore ,","Baltimore , Yitz",", Yitz Jordan","Yitz Jordan became","Jordan became fascinated","became fascinated with","fascinated with Judaism","with Judaism as","Judaism as a","as a child","a child ,","child , attended",", attended Yeshiva","attended Yeshiva in","Yeshiva in his","in his teens","his teens and","teens and endured","and endured a","endured a short-lived","a short-lived arranged","short-lived arranged marriage","arranged marriage to","marriage to a","to a Yiddish","a Yiddish speaking","Yiddish speaking woman","speaking woman who","woman who did","who did n't","did n't think","n't think he","think he was","he was religious","was religious enough","Music is the","is the medium","the medium through","medium through which","through which Y-Love","which Y-Love connects","Y-Love connects to","connects to his","to his faith","his faith ;","faith ; he","; he seems","he seems most","seems most at","most at ease","at ease spouting","ease spouting rhymes","spouting rhymes on","rhymes on a","on a Jerusalem","a Jerusalem stage","Jerusalem stage ,","stage , surrounded",", surrounded by","surrounded by adoring","by adoring ,","adoring , religious",", religious fans","This documentary paints","documentary paints a","paints a poignant","a poignant portrait","poignant portrait of","portrait of a","of a perennial","a perennial outsider","perennial outsider :","outsider : a",": a Black","a Black ,","Black , Jewish",", Jewish ,","Jewish , gay",", gay orphan","gay orphan searching","orphan searching for","searching for a","for a home"],"2grams":["Y-Love is","is the","the \"","\" premier","premier Orthodox","Orthodox Jewish","Jewish entity","entity in","in hip","hip hop","hop .",". \"","Raised in","in inner-city","inner-city Baltimore","Baltimore ,",", Yitz","Yitz Jordan","Jordan became","became fascinated","fascinated with","with Judaism","Judaism as","as a","a child","child ,",", attended","attended Yeshiva","Yeshiva in","in his","his teens","teens and","and endured","endured a","a short-lived","short-lived arranged","arranged marriage","marriage to","to a","a Yiddish","Yiddish speaking","speaking woman","woman who","who did","did n't","n't think","think he","he was","was religious","religious enough","Music is","is the","the medium","medium through","through which","which Y-Love","Y-Love connects","connects to","to his","his faith","faith ;","; he","he seems","seems most","most at","at ease","ease spouting","spouting rhymes","rhymes on","on a","a Jerusalem","Jerusalem stage","stage ,",", surrounded","surrounded by","by adoring","adoring ,",", religious","religious fans","This documentary","documentary paints","paints a","a poignant","poignant portrait","portrait of","of a","a perennial","perennial outsider","outsider :",": a","a Black","Black ,",", Jewish","Jewish ,",", gay","gay orphan","orphan searching","searching for","for a","a home"]}

We are also, what we imagine, but imaginations form manifold and not seldom they seem to be unavoidably contradictory. This footage is part of a media-anthropological master's thesis that tries to collect, from local level, some pieces of the extensive discourses on global migratory processes, which are often framed by the encounters of numerous different life realities, in a sense, it seems, mutually exclusive to each other and yet somehow still co-existing.","genres":["Biography"," Documentary"],"stems":["Spring","2011",":","Seneg",",","streak","through","it","capitol","Dakar",",","more","or","less","incident","get","in","contact","with","some","urban","fishermen",",","their","stori","of","migrat",",","differ","notion","of","a","'","Europ","'","-","concret",",","abstract",",","symbol",",","project",",","realist","?","We","are","also",",","what","we","imagin",",","but","imagin","form","manifold","and","not","seldom","they","seem","to","be","unavoid","contradictori",".","This","footag","is","part","of","a","media-anthropolog","master","'s","thesi","that","tri","to","collect",",","from","local","level",",","some","piec","of","the","extens","discours","on","global","migratori","process",",","which","are","often","frame","by","the","encount","of","numer","differ","life","realiti",",","in","a","sens",",","it","seem",",","mutual","exclus","to","each","other","and","yet","somehow","still","co-exist","."],"lemmas":["spring","2011",":","Senegal",",","streak","through","its","capitol","Dakar",",","more","or","less","incidentally","get","in","contact","with","some","urban","fisherman",",","they","story","of","migration",",","different","notion","of","a","'","Europe","'","-","concrete",",","abstract",",","symbolic",",","projective",",","realistic","?","we","be","also",",","what","we","imagine",",","but","imagination","form","manifold","and","not","seldom","they","seem","to","be","unavoidably","contradictory",".","this","footage","be","part","of","a","media-anthropological","master","'s","thesis","that","try","to","collect",",","from","local","level",",","some","piece","of","the","extensive","discourse","on","global","migratory","process",",","which","be","often","frame","by","the","encounter","of","numerous","different","life","reality",",","in","a","sense",",","it","seem",",","mutually","exclusive","to","each","other","and","yet","somehow","still","co-exist","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Spring 2011 :","2011 : Senegal",": Senegal ,","Senegal , streaking",", streaking through","streaking through its","through its capitol","its capitol Dakar","capitol Dakar ,","Dakar , more",", more or","more or less","or less incidentally","less incidentally getting","incidentally getting in","getting in contact","in contact with","contact with some","with some urban","some urban fishermen","urban fishermen ,","fishermen , their",", their stories","their stories of","stories of migrations","of migrations ,","migrations , different",", different notions","different notions of","notions of a","of a '","a ' Europe","' Europe '","Europe ' -","' -

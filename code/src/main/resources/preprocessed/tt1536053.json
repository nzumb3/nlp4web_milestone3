{"title":"1st Night","plot":"Adam is a rich industrialist, who aspires to a more cultured world. Spurred on by playful jibes that he is little more than a city suit living the capitalist's dream, this frustrated amateur opera singer decides to throw an opera in his lavish country retreat. Once his friends see him belting out the notes, he feels sure it will spell the end to their shallow taunts. In fact, it might even help him win the hand of a female conductor he has been pursuing whom - it just so happens - is the first to be recruited for his showpiece.","genres":["Comedy"," Romance"," Musical"],"stems":["Adam","is","a","rich","industrialist",",","who","aspir","to","a","more","cultur","world",".","Spur","on","by","play","jibe","that","he","is","littl","more","than","a","citi","suit","live","the","capitalist","'s","dream",",","this","frustrat","amateur","opera","singer","decid","to","throw","an","opera","in","his","lavish","countri","retreat",".","Once","his","friend","see","him","belt","out","the","note",",","he","feel","sure","it","will","spell","the","end","to","their","shallow","taunt",".","In","fact",",","it","might","even","help","him","win","the","hand","of","a","femal","conductor","he","has","been","pursu","whom","-","it","just","so","happen","-","is","the","first","to","be","recruit","for","his","showpiec","."],"lemmas":["Adam","be","a","rich","industrialist",",","who","aspire","to","a","more","culture","world",".","spur","on","by","playful","jibe","that","he","be","little","more","than","a","city","suit","live","the","capitalist","'s","dream",",","this","frustrated","amateur","opera","singer","decide","to","throw","a","opera","in","he","lavish","country","retreat",".","once","he","friend","see","he","belt","out","the","note",",","he","feel","sure","it","will","spell","the","end","to","they","shallow","taunt",".","in","fact",",","it","might","even","help","he","win","the","hand","of","a","female","conductor","he","have","be","pursue","whom","-","it","just","so","happen","-","be","the","first","to","be","recruit","for","he","showpiece","."],"named_entities":["PERSON"],"3grams":["Adam is a","is a rich","a rich industrialist","rich industrialist ,","industrialist , who",", who aspires","who aspires to","aspires to a","to a more","a more cultured","more cultured world","Spurred on by","on by playful","by playful jibes","playful jibes that","jibes that he","that he is","he is little","is little more","little more than","more than a","than a city","a city suit","city suit living","suit living the","living the capitalist","the capitalist 's","capitalist 's dream","'s dream ,","dream , this",", this frustrated","this frustrated amateur","frustrated amateur opera","amateur opera singer","opera singer decides","singer decides to","decides to throw","to throw an","throw an opera","an opera in","opera in his","in his lavish","his lavish country","lavish country retreat","Once his friends","his friends see","friends see him","see him belting","him belting out","belting out the","out the notes","the notes ,","notes , he",", he feels","he feels sure","feels sure it","sure it will","it will spell","will spell the","spell the end","the end to","end to their","to their shallow","their shallow taunts","In fact ,","fact , it",", it might","it might even","might even help","even help him","help him win","him win the","win the hand","the hand of","hand of a","of a female","a female conductor","female conductor he","conductor he has","he has been","has been pursuing","been pursuing whom","pursuing whom -","whom - it","- it just","it just so","just so happens","so happens -","happens - is","- is the","is the first","the first to","first to be","to be recruited","be recruited for","recruited for his","for his showpiece"],"2grams":["Adam is","is a","a rich","rich industrialist","industrialist ,",", who","who aspires","aspires to","to a","a more","more cultured","cultured world","Spurred on","on by","by playful","playful jibes","jibes that","that he","he is","is little","little more","more than","than a","a city","city suit","suit living","living the","the capitalist","capitalist 's","'s dream","dream ,",", this","this frustrated","frustrated amateur","amateur opera","opera singer","singer decides","decides to","to throw","throw an","an opera","opera in","in his","his lavish","lavish country","country retreat","Once his","his friends","friends see","see him","him belting","belting out","out the","the notes","notes ,",", he","he feels","feels sure","sure it","it will","will spell","spell the","the end","end to","to their","their shallow","shallow taunts","In fact","fact ,",", it","it might","might even","even help","help him","him win","win the","the hand","hand of","of a","a female","female conductor","conductor he","he has","has been","been pursuing","pursuing whom","whom -","- it","it just","just so","so happens","happens -","- is","is the","the first","first to","to be","be recruited","recruited for","for his","his showpiece"]}

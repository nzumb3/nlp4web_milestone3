{"title":"Beyond Bidwill","plot":"A sixteen-year-old filmmaker documents the hiking adventure of four boys through the Tasmanian wilderness. Together they undertake a surprising spiritual challenge. The journey begins in Bidwill, a neighbourhood in one of Australia's largest public housing estates in Mt Druitt, Western Sydney. But embracing an opportunity to leave everything they know to hike for 10 days through challenging terrain, these boys find themselves unexpectedly facing their demons. Filmmaker Joshua Wyatt journeys alongside the boys as a fellow-trekker, capturing the unique physical and emotional challenges that each boy experiences. The wisdom and insight they gain is truly inspiring. Take this journey with these Bidwill boys and see how they grow with every step of their pilgrimage. Let them speak to you and challenge your sense of direction.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["A","sixteen-year-old","filmmak","document","the","hike","adventur","of","four","boy","through","the","Tasmanian","wilder",".","Togeth","they","undertak","a","surpris","spiritu","challeng",".","The","journey","begin","in","Bidwil",",","a","neighbourhood","in","one","of","Australia","'s","largest","public","hous","estat","in","Mt","Druitt",",","Western","Sydney",".","But","embrac","an","opportun","to","leav","everyth","they","know","to","hike","for","10","day","through","challeng","terrain",",","these","boy","find","themselv","unexpect","face","their","demon",".","Filmmak","Joshua","Wyatt","journey","alongsid","the","boy","as","a","fellow-trekk",",","captur","the","uniqu","physic","and","emot","challeng","that","each","boy","experi",".","The","wisdom","and","insight","they","gain","is","truli","inspir",".","Take","this","journey","with","these","Bidwil","boy","and","see","how","they","grow","with","everi","step","of","their","pilgrimag",".","Let","them","speak","to","you","and","challeng","your","sens","of","direct","."],"lemmas":["a","sixteen-year-old","filmmaker","document","the","hiking","adventure","of","four","boy","through","the","tasmanian","wilderness",".","together","they","undertake","a","surprising","spiritual","challenge",".","the","journey","begin","in","Bidwill",",","a","neighbourhood","in","one","of","Australia","'s","largest","public","housing","estate","in","Mt","Druitt",",","Western","Sydney",".","but","embrace","a","opportunity","to","leave","everything","they","know","to","hike","for","10","day","through","challenging","terrain",",","these","boy","find","themselves","unexpectedly","face","they","demon",".","Filmmaker","Joshua","Wyatt","journey","alongside","the","boy","as","a","fellow-trekker",",","capture","the","unique","physical","and","emotional","challenge","that","each","boy","experience",".","the","wisdom","and","insight","they","gain","be","truly","inspiring",".","take","this","journey","with","these","Bidwill","boy","and","see","how","they","grow","with","every","step","of","they","pilgrimage",".","let","they","speak","to","you","and","challenge","you","sense","of","direction","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A

{"title":"ABCD (Any Body Can Dance)","plot":"For Vishnu (Prabhudheva), widely regarded as India's best dancer, dance is more than a passion - it's the reason he lives! So when he finds himself thrown out from the swish dance academy he himself set up, by his manipulative business partner, it feels like the oxygen has been sucked out from the air he breathes. Heart-broken, Vishnu decides to give up dance and leave Mumbai forever. However the night before his departure he witnesses a most amazing sight - a group of dancers preparing for the upcoming Ganpati Dance Battle - an annual festival that pits Mumbai's best dance groups against each other. Watching the raw talent of these amazing dancers helps Vishnu arrive at a decision - he will take this disparate group under his wing, help them overcome their personal rivalries and past demons and turn them into India's best dance squad! From India's biggest film studio, UTV Motion Pictures, and renowned choreographer & director, Remo D'souza comes India's first dance film in 3D - a spectacular entertainer that proves yet again that if you dare to dream, impossible is nothing!","genres":["Drama"," Music"],"stems":["For","Vishnu","(","Prabhudheva",")",",","wide","regard","as","India","'s","best","dancer",",","danc","is","more","than","a","passion","-","it","'s","the","reason","he","live","!","So","when","he","find","himself","thrown","out","from","the","swish","danc","academi","he","himself","set","up",",","by","his","manipul","busi","partner",",","it","feel","like","the","oxygen","has","been","suck","out","from","the","air","he","breath",".","Heart-broken",",","Vishnu","decid","to","give","up","danc","and","leav","Mumbai","forev",".","Howev","the","night","befor","his","departur","he","wit","a","most","amaz","sight","-","a","group","of","dancer","prepar","for","the","upcom","Ganpati","Danc","Battl","-","an","annual","festiv","that","pit","Mumbai","'s","best","danc","group","against","each","other",".","Watch","the","raw","talent","of","these","amaz","dancer","help","Vishnu","arriv","at","a","decis","-","he","will","take","this","dispar","group","under","his","wing",",","help","them","overcom","their","person","rivalri","and","past","demon","and","turn","them","into","India","'s","best","danc","squad","!","From","India","'s","biggest","film","studio",",","UTV","Motion","Pictur",",","and","renown","choreograph","&","director",",","Remo","D'souza","come","India","'s","first","danc","film","in","3D","-","a","spectacular","entertain","that","prove","yet","again","that","if","you","dare","to","dream",",","imposs","is","noth","!"],"lemmas":["for","Vishnu","-lrb-","Prabhudheva","-rrb-",",","widely","regard","as","India","'s","best","dancer",",","dance","be","more","than","a","passion","-","it","be","the","reason","he","live","!","so","when","he","find","himself","throw","out","from","the","swish","dance","academy","he","himself","set","up",",","by","he","manipulative","business","partner",",","it","feel","like","the","oxygen","have","be","suck","out","from","the","air","he","breathe",".","heart-broken",",","Vishnu","decide","to","give","up","dance","and","leave","Mumbai","forever",".","however","the","night","before","he","departure","he","witness","a","most","amazing","sight","-","a","group","of","dancer","prepare","for","the","upcome","Ganpati","Dance","Battle","-","a","annual","festival","that","pit","Mumbai","'s","best","dance","group","against","each","other",".","watch","the","raw","talent","of","these","amazing","dancer","help","Vishnu","arrive","at","a","decision","-","he","will","take","this","disparate","group","under","he","wing",",","help","they","overcome","they","personal","rivalry","and","past","demon","and","turn","they","into","India","'s","best","dance","squad","!","from","India","'s","biggest","film","studio",",","UTV","Motion","Pictures",",","and","renowned","choreographer","&","director",",","Remo","D'souza","come","India","'s","first","dance","film","in","3d","-","a","spectacular","entertainer","that","prove","yet","again","that","if","you","dare","to","dream",",","impossible","be","nothing","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION","PERSON","LOCATION"],"3grams":["For Vishnu (","Vishnu ( Prabhudheva","( Prabhudheva )","Prabhudheva ) ,",") , widely",", widely regarded","widely regarded as","regarded as India","as India 's","India 's best","'s best dancer","best dancer ,","dancer , dance",", dance is","dance is more","is more than","more than a","than a passion","a passion -","passion -

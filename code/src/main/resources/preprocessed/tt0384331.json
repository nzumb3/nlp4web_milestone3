{"title":"Men Without Jobs","plot":"Men Without Jobs is a comedy about Ish and Oz - best friends and roommates whose main goal in life is to avoid work at all costs. Ish is a graffiti artist who dreams of starting his own hip-hop band. Oz is an obnoxious loudmouth, addicted to gambling and cooking shows. When Ish collects several thousand dollars in a lawsuit settlement stemming from a childhood accident, Oz tries to convince him to invest the money in a pyramid scam in order to help him pay off a debt to a sadistic loan shark. The stakes are raised when Ish's girlfriend Veronica gives him an ultimatum to either get a job or get lost. Ultimately, the two eccentric slackers are forced to wake up and realize that sooner or later, everybody has to get a job!","genres":["Comedy"],"stems":["Men","Without","Job","is","a","comedi","about","Ish","and","Oz","-","best","friend","and","roommat","whose","main","goal","in","life","is","to","avoid","work","at","all","cost",".","Ish","is","a","graffiti","artist","who","dream","of","start","his","own","hip-hop","band",".","Oz","is","an","obnoxi","loudmouth",",","addict","to","gambl","and","cook","show",".","When","Ish","collect","sever","thousand","dollar","in","a","lawsuit","settlement","stem","from","a","childhood","accid",",","Oz","tri","to","convinc","him","to","invest","the","money","in","a","pyramid","scam","in","order","to","help","him","pay","off","a","debt","to","a","sadist","loan","shark",".","The","stake","are","rais","when","Ish","'s","girlfriend","Veronica","give","him","an","ultimatum","to","either","get","a","job","or","get","lost",".","Ultimat",",","the","two","eccentr","slacker","are","forc","to","wake","up","and","realiz","that","sooner","or","later",",","everybodi","has","to","get","a","job","!"],"lemmas":["men","without","Jobs","be","a","comedy","about","Ish","and","Oz","-","best","friend","and","roommate","whose","main","goal","in","life","be","to","avoid","work","at","all","cost",".","ish","be","a","graffiti","artist","who","dream","of","start","he","own","hip-hop","band",".","Oz","be","a","obnoxious","loudmouth",",","addict","to","gambling","and","cooking","show",".","when","ish","collect","several","thousand","dollar","in","a","lawsuit","settlement","stem","from","a","childhood","accident",",","Oz","try","to","convince","he","to","invest","the","money","in","a","pyramid","scam","in","order","to","help","he","pay","off","a","debt","to","a","sadistic","loan","shark",".","the","stake","be","raise","when","Ish","'s","girlfriend","Veronica","give","he","a","ultimatum","to","either","get","a","job","or","get","lose",".","ultimately",",","the","two","eccentric","slacker","be","force","to","wake","up","and","realize","that","sooner","or","later",",","everybody","have","to","get","a","job","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Men Without Jobs","Without Jobs is","Jobs is a","is a comedy","a comedy about","comedy about Ish","about Ish and","Ish and Oz","and Oz -","Oz -

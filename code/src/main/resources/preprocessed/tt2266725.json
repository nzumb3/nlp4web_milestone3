{"title":"Freedom 50/50","plot":"With the Ten Year Anniversary of 9/11 coming up in the next year, Max McManus, a Cyclist from Reno Nevada, felt that those tragic events were beginning to be forgotten. That's when the Freedom 50/50 was born. The idea was this; Max was to set out on a Tribute Ride in which he would ride almost 7,500 miles on his bicycle, touching all fifty states in just fifty days, ending in New York for the Tenth Anniversary of 9/11. Along the way his patriotic mission was to raise awareness and funds for the 9/11 Help America Foundation, an organization that helps our Wounded Soldiers and their families.","genres":["Adventure"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["With","the","Ten","Year","Anniversari","of","9/11","come","up","in","the","next","year",",","Max","McManus",",","a","Cyclist","from","Reno","Nevada",",","felt","that","those","tragic","event","were","begin","to","be","forgotten",".","That","'s","when","the","Freedom","50/50","was","born",".","The","idea","was","this",";","Max","was","to","set","out","on","a","Tribut","Ride","in","which","he","would","ride","almost","7,500","mile","on","his","bicycl",",","touch","all","fifti","state","in","just","fifti","day",",","end","in","New","York","for","the","Tenth","Anniversari","of","9/11",".","Along","the","way","his","patriot","mission","was","to","rais","awar","and","fund","for","the","9/11","Help","America","Foundat",",","an","organ","that","help","our","Wound","Soldier","and","their","famili","."],"lemmas":["with","the","ten","year","anniversary","of","9/11","come","up","in","the","next","year",",","Max","McManus",",","a","Cyclist","from","Reno","Nevada",",","feel","that","those","tragic","event","be","begin","to","be","forget",".","that","be","when","the","Freedom","50/50","be","bear",".","the","idea","be","this",";","Max","be","to","set","out","on","a","tribute","ride","in","which","he","would","ride","almost","7,500","mile","on","he","bicycle",",","touch","all","fifty","state","in","just","fifty","day",",","end","in","New","York","for","the","tenth","anniversary","of","9/11",".","along","the","way","he","patriotic","mission","be","to","raise","awareness","and","fund","for","the","9/11","help","America","Foundation",",","a","organization","that","help","we","wounded","soldier","and","they","family","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","PERSON","LOCATION","ORGANIZATION"],"3grams":["With the Ten","the Ten Year","Ten Year Anniversary","Year Anniversary of","Anniversary of 9/11","of 9/11 coming","9/11 coming up","coming up in","up in the","in the next","the next year","next year ,","year , Max",", Max McManus","Max McManus ,","McManus , a",", a Cyclist","a Cyclist from","Cyclist from Reno","from Reno Nevada","Reno Nevada ,","Nevada , felt",", felt that","felt that those","that those tragic","those tragic events","tragic events were","events were beginning","were beginning to","beginning to be","to be forgotten","That 's when","'s when the","when the Freedom","the Freedom 50/50","Freedom 50/50 was","50/50 was born","The idea was","idea was this","was this ;","this ;

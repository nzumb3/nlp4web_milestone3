{"title":"Something Better","plot":"Boozing and drug abusing Sam decides to get his life together and become an art dealer, but his brother and criminal partner, Eddy, and his ball busting alcholic wife, Sally have enough dirt on him to send him to prison if he should so much as think of leaving them. Sam falls in love with a philosophy teacher who teaches him an important lesson - that things aren't always what they seem, and that perspective can reshape reality.","genres":["Comedy"," Drama"],"stems":["Booz","and","drug","abus","Sam","decid","to","get","his","life","togeth","and","becom","an","art","dealer",",","but","his","brother","and","crimin","partner",",","Eddi",",","and","his","ball","bust","alchol","wife",",","Salli","have","enough","dirt","on","him","to","send","him","to","prison","if","he","should","so","much","as","think","of","leav","them",".","Sam","fall","in","love","with","a","philosophi","teacher","who","teach","him","an","import","lesson","-","that","thing","are","n't","alway","what","they","seem",",","and","that","perspect","can","reshap","realiti","."],"lemmas":["boozing","and","drug","abuse","Sam","decide","to","get","he","life","together","and","become","a","art","dealer",",","but","he","brother","and","criminal","partner",",","Eddy",",","and","he","ball","bust","alcholic","wife",",","Sally","have","enough","dirt","on","he","to","send","he","to","prison","if","he","should","so","much","as","think","of","leave","they",".","Sam","fall","in","love","with","a","philosophy","teacher","who","teach","he","a","important","lesson","-","that","thing","be","not","always","what","they","seem",",","and","that","perspective","can","reshape","reality","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Boozing and drug","and drug abusing","drug abusing Sam","abusing Sam decides","Sam decides to","decides to get","to get his","get his life","his life together","life together and","together and become","and become an","become an art","an art dealer","art dealer ,","dealer , but",", but his","but his brother","his brother and","brother and criminal","and criminal partner","criminal partner ,","partner , Eddy",", Eddy ,","Eddy , and",", and his","and his ball","his ball busting","ball busting alcholic","busting alcholic wife","alcholic wife ,","wife , Sally",", Sally have","Sally have enough","have enough dirt","enough dirt on","dirt on him","on him to","him to send","to send him","send him to","him to prison","to prison if","prison if he","if he should","he should so","should so much","so much as","much as think","as think of","think of leaving","of leaving them","Sam falls in","falls in love","in love with","love with a","with a philosophy","a philosophy teacher","philosophy teacher who","teacher who teaches","who teaches him","teaches him an","him an important","an important lesson","important lesson -","lesson - that","- that things","that things are","things are n't","are n't always","n't always what","always what they","what they seem","they seem ,","seem , and",", and that","and that perspective","that perspective can","perspective can reshape","can reshape reality"],"2grams":["Boozing and","and drug","drug abusing","abusing Sam","Sam decides","decides to","to get","get his","his life","life together","together and","and become","become an","an art","art dealer","dealer ,",", but","but his","his brother","brother and","and criminal","criminal partner","partner ,",", Eddy","Eddy ,",", and","and his","his ball","ball busting","busting alcholic","alcholic wife","wife ,",", Sally","Sally have","have enough","enough dirt","dirt on","on him","him to","to send","send him","him to","to prison","prison if","if he","he should","should so","so much","much as","as think","think of","of leaving","leaving them","Sam falls","falls in","in love","love with","with a","a philosophy","philosophy teacher","teacher who","who teaches","teaches him","him an","an important","important lesson","lesson -","- that","that things","things are","are n't","n't always","always what","what they","they seem","seem ,",", and","and that","that perspective","perspective can","can reshape","reshape reality"]}

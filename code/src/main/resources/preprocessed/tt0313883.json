{"title":"Cherniyat pat na hristovite nevesti","plot":"This is a cinematographic tale of days, nights and the years in a Convent. It is a documentary of the other point of view, the other life, the one we haven't chosen but we can see sinful and divine existence in this world reflected. It is an attempt to go deeper into human psychology and community laws, looking for a metaphoric resemblance to the model of our ailing society. This is a film about guilt and redemption, about the choices we make and the meaning of existence. This is a cinematographic essay on the philosophy of devotion and the healing power of faith.","genres":["Documentary"],"stems":["This","is","a","cinematograph","tale","of","day",",","night","and","the","year","in","a","Convent",".","It","is","a","documentari","of","the","other","point","of","view",",","the","other","life",",","the","one","we","have","n't","chosen","but","we","can","see","sin","and","divin","exist","in","this","world","reflect",".","It","is","an","attempt","to","go","deeper","into","human","psycholog","and","communiti","law",",","look","for","a","metaphor","resembl","to","the","model","of","our","ail","societi",".","This","is","a","film","about","guilt","and","redempt",",","about","the","choic","we","make","and","the","mean","of","exist",".","This","is","a","cinematograph","essay","on","the","philosophi","of","devot","and","the","heal","power","of","faith","."],"lemmas":["this","be","a","cinematographic","tale","of","day",",","night","and","the","year","in","a","convent",".","it","be","a","documentary","of","the","other","point","of","view",",","the","other","life",",","the","one","we","have","not","choose","but","we","can","see","sinful","and","divine","existence","in","this","world","reflect",".","it","be","a","attempt","to","go","deeper","into","human","psychology","and","community","law",",","look","for","a","metaphoric","resemblance","to","the","model","of","we","ailing","society",".","this","be","a","film","about","guilt","and","redemption",",","about","the","choice","we","make","and","the","meaning","of","existence",".","this","be","a","cinematographic","essay","on","the","philosophy","of","devotion","and","the","healing","power","of","faith","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["This is a","is a cinematographic","a cinematographic tale","cinematographic tale of","tale of days","of days ,","days , nights",", nights and","nights and the","and the years","the years in","years in a","in a Convent","It is a","is a documentary","a documentary of","documentary of the","of the other","the other point","other point of","point of view","of view ,","view , the",", the other","the other life","other life ,","life , the",", the one","the one we","one we have","we have n't","have n't chosen","n't chosen but","chosen but we","but we can","we can see","can see sinful","see sinful and","sinful and divine","and divine existence","divine existence in","existence in this","in this world","this world reflected","It is an","is an attempt","an attempt to","attempt to go","to go deeper","go deeper into","deeper into human","into human psychology","human psychology and","psychology and community","and community laws","community laws ,","laws , looking",", looking for","looking for a","for a metaphoric","a metaphoric resemblance","metaphoric resemblance to","resemblance to the","to the model","the model of","model of our","of our ailing","our ailing society","This is a","is a film","a film about","film about guilt","about guilt and","guilt and redemption","and redemption ,","redemption , about",", about the","about the choices","the choices we","choices we make","we make and","make and the","and the meaning","the meaning of","meaning of existence","This is a","is a cinematographic","a cinematographic essay","cinematographic essay on","essay on the","on the philosophy","the philosophy of","philosophy of devotion","of devotion and","devotion and the","and the healing","the healing power","healing power of","power of faith"],"2grams":["This is","is a","a cinematographic","cinematographic tale","tale of","of days","days ,",", nights","nights and","and the","the years","years in","in a","a Convent","It is","is a","a documentary","documentary of","of the","the other","other point","point of","of view","view ,",", the","the other","other life","life ,",", the","the one","one we","we have","have n't","n't chosen","chosen but","but we","we can","can see","see sinful","sinful and","and divine","divine existence","existence in","in this","this world","world reflected","It is","is an","an attempt","attempt to","to go","go deeper","deeper into","into human","human psychology","psychology and","and community","community laws","laws ,",", looking","looking for","for a","a metaphoric","metaphoric resemblance","resemblance to","to the","the model","model of","of our","our ailing","ailing society","This is","is a","a film","film about","about guilt","guilt and","and redemption","redemption ,",", about","about the","the choices","choices we","we make","make and","and the","the meaning","meaning of","of existence","This is","is a","a cinematographic","cinematographic essay","essay on","on the","the philosophy","philosophy of","of devotion","devotion and","and the","the healing","healing power","power of","of faith"]}

{"title":"Movimientos Espectaculares","plot":"The young urban indigenous and mestizo actors of Teatro Trono stir up their collective memories of the social movements that sparked the revolution that currently transforms Bolivia, creating performances for their itinerant theater-truck and the street. The group struggles to overcome their doubts about living up to their heritage... especially since they decide to manifest those who died in the massacre at the heart of the revolution. Their paralyzing fear is overcome by the most unexpected force: the spirits of the dead themselves, seeking delayed justice and creative transformation.","genres":["Animation"," Drama"," Documentary"],"stems":["The","young","urban","indigen","and","mestizo","actor","of","Teatro","Trono","stir","up","their","collect","memori","of","the","social","movement","that","spark","the","revolut","that","current","transform","Bolivia",",","creat","perform","for","their","itiner","theater-truck","and","the","street",".","The","group","struggl","to","overcom","their","doubt","about","live","up","to","their","heritag","...","especi","sinc","they","decid","to","manifest","those","who","die","in","the","massacr","at","the","heart","of","the","revolut",".","Their","paralyz","fear","is","overcom","by","the","most","unexpect","forc",":","the","spirit","of","the","dead","themselv",",","seek","delay","justic","and","creativ","transform","."],"lemmas":["the","young","urban","indigenous","and","mestizo","actor","of","Teatro","Trono","stir","up","they","collective","memory","of","the","social","movement","that","spark","the","revolution","that","currently","transform","Bolivia",",","create","performance","for","they","itinerant","theater-truck","and","the","street",".","the","group","struggle","to","overcome","they","doubt","about","live","up","to","they","heritage","...","especially","since","they","decide","to","manifest","those","who","die","in","the","massacre","at","the","heart","of","the","revolution",".","they","paralyze","fear","be","overcome","by","the","most","unexpected","force",":","the","spirit","of","the","dead","themselves",",","seek","delay","justice","and","creative","transformation","."],"named_entities":["ORGANIZATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["The young urban","young urban indigenous","urban indigenous and","indigenous and mestizo","and mestizo actors","mestizo actors of","actors of Teatro","of Teatro Trono","Teatro Trono stir","Trono stir up","stir up their","up their collective","their collective memories","collective memories of","memories of the","of the social","the social movements","social movements that","movements that sparked","that sparked the","sparked the revolution","the revolution that","revolution that currently","that currently transforms","currently transforms Bolivia","transforms Bolivia ,","Bolivia , creating",", creating performances","creating performances for","performances for their","for their itinerant","their itinerant theater-truck","itinerant theater-truck and","theater-truck and the","and the street","The group struggles","group struggles to","struggles to overcome","to overcome their","overcome their doubts","their doubts about","doubts about living","about living up","living up to","up to their","to their heritage","their heritage ...","heritage ... especially","... especially since","especially since they","since they decide","they decide to","decide to manifest","to manifest those","manifest those who","those who died","who died in","died in the","in the massacre","the massacre at","massacre at the","at the heart","the heart of","heart of the","of the revolution","Their paralyzing fear","paralyzing fear is","fear is overcome","is overcome by","overcome by the","by the most","the most unexpected","most unexpected force","unexpected force :","force : the",": the spirits","the spirits of","spirits of the","of the dead","the dead themselves","dead themselves ,","themselves , seeking",", seeking delayed","seeking delayed justice","delayed justice and","justice and creative","and creative transformation"],"2grams":["The young","young urban","urban indigenous","indigenous and","and mestizo","mestizo actors","actors of","of Teatro","Teatro Trono","Trono stir","stir up","up their","their collective","collective memories","memories of","of the","the social","social movements","movements that","that sparked","sparked the","the revolution","revolution that","that currently","currently transforms","transforms Bolivia","Bolivia ,",", creating","creating performances","performances for","for their","their itinerant","itinerant theater-truck","theater-truck and","and the","the street","The group","group struggles","struggles to","to overcome","overcome their","their doubts","doubts about","about living","living up","up to","to their","their heritage","heritage ...","... especially","especially since","since they","they decide","decide to","to manifest","manifest those","those who","who died","died in","in the","the massacre","massacre at","at the","the heart","heart of","of the","the revolution","Their paralyzing","paralyzing fear","fear is","is overcome","overcome by","by the","the most","most unexpected","unexpected force","force :",": the","the spirits","spirits of","of the","the dead","dead themselves","themselves ,",", seeking","seeking delayed","delayed justice","justice and","and creative","creative transformation"]}

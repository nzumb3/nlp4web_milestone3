{"title":"Memories of San Pablo","plot":"Memories of San Pablo follows Oriana Korol, the granddaughter of American missionaries and her friend, Priya Ghosh, into the Amazon region of Ecuador. Using an experimental format of eight chapters, the film documents the intersection of cultures, between generations and locations. The film actively explores the fluid boundaries between right and wrong, repetition and progression, and connection and repulsion. By examining one small town in Ecuador it raises question about what it means to be a global citizen and a loving family member.","genres":["Documentary"," History"," Family"],"stems":["Memori","of","San","Pablo","follow","Oriana","Korol",",","the","granddaught","of","American","missionari","and","her","friend",",","Priya","Ghosh",",","into","the","Amazon","region","of","Ecuador",".","Using","an","experiment","format","of","eight","chapter",",","the","film","document","the","intersect","of","cultur",",","between","generat","and","locat",".","The","film","activ","explor","the","fluid","boundari","between","right","and","wrong",",","repetit","and","progress",",","and","connect","and","repuls",".","By","examin","one","small","town","in","Ecuador","it","rais","question","about","what","it","mean","to","be","a","global","citizen","and","a","love","famili","member","."],"lemmas":["Memories","of","San","Pablo","follow","Oriana","Korol",",","the","granddaughter","of","american","missionary","and","she","friend",",","Priya","Ghosh",",","into","the","Amazon","region","of","Ecuador",".","use","a","experimental","format","of","eight","chapter",",","the","film","document","the","intersection","of","culture",",","between","generation","and","location",".","the","film","actively","explore","the","fluid","boundary","between","right","and","wrong",",","repetition","and","progression",",","and","connection","and","repulsion",".","by","examine","one","small","town","in","Ecuador","it","raise","question","about","what","it","mean","to","be","a","global","citizen","and","a","loving","family","member","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Memories of San","of San Pablo","San Pablo follows","Pablo follows Oriana","follows Oriana Korol","Oriana Korol ,","Korol , the",", the granddaughter","the granddaughter of","granddaughter of American","of American missionaries","American missionaries and","missionaries and her","and her friend","her friend ,","friend , Priya",", Priya Ghosh","Priya Ghosh ,","Ghosh , into",", into the","into the Amazon","the Amazon region","Amazon region of","region of Ecuador","Using an experimental","an experimental format","experimental format of","format of eight","of eight chapters","eight chapters ,","chapters , the",", the film","the film documents","film documents the","documents the intersection","the intersection of","intersection of cultures","of cultures ,","cultures , between",", between generations","between generations and","generations and locations","The film actively","film actively explores","actively explores the","explores the fluid","the fluid boundaries","fluid boundaries between","boundaries between right","between right and","right and wrong","and wrong ,","wrong , repetition",", repetition and","repetition and progression","and progression ,","progression , and",", and connection","and connection and","connection and repulsion","By examining one","examining one small","one small town","small town in","town in Ecuador","in Ecuador it","Ecuador it raises","it raises question","raises question about","question about what","about what it","what it means","it means to","means to be","to be a","be a global","a global citizen","global citizen and","citizen and a","and a loving","a loving family","loving family member"],"2grams":["Memories of","of San","San Pablo","Pablo follows","follows Oriana","Oriana Korol","Korol ,",", the","the granddaughter","granddaughter of","of American","American missionaries","missionaries and","and her","her friend","friend ,",", Priya","Priya Ghosh","Ghosh ,",", into","into the","the Amazon","Amazon region","region of","of Ecuador","Using an","an experimental","experimental format","format of","of eight","eight chapters","chapters ,",", the","the film","film documents","documents the","the intersection","intersection of","of cultures","cultures ,",", between","between generations","generations and","and locations","The film","film actively","actively explores","explores the","the fluid","fluid boundaries","boundaries between","between right","right and","and wrong","wrong ,",", repetition","repetition and","and progression","progression ,",", and","and connection","connection and","and repulsion","By examining","examining one","one small","small town","town in","in Ecuador","Ecuador it","it raises","raises question","question about","about what","what it","it means","means to","to be","be a","a global","global citizen","citizen and","and a","a loving","loving family","family member"]}

{"title":"Bringing Out the Dead","plot":"An Easter story. Frank is a Manhattan medic, working graveyard in a two-man ambulance team. He's burned out, exhausted, seeing ghosts, especially a young woman he failed to save six months' before, and no longer able to save people: he brings in the dead. We follow him for three nights, each with a different partner: Larry, who thinks about dinner, Marcus, who looks to Jesus, and Tom, who wallops people when work is slow. Frank befriends the daughter of a heart victim he brings in; she's Mary, an ex-junkie, angry at her father but now hoping he'll live. Frank tries to get fired, tries to quit, and keeps coming back, to work and to Mary, in need of his own rebirth.","genres":["Drama"," Thriller"],"stems":["An","Easter","stori",".","Frank","is","a","Manhattan","medic",",","work","graveyard","in","a","two-man","ambul","team",".","He","'s","burn","out",",","exhaust",",","see","ghost",",","especi","a","young","woman","he","fail","to","save","six","month","'","befor",",","and","no","longer","abl","to","save","peopl",":","he","bring","in","the","dead",".","We","follow","him","for","three","night",",","each","with","a","differ","partner",":","Larri",",","who","think","about","dinner",",","Marcus",",","who","look","to","Jesus",",","and","Tom",",","who","wallop","peopl","when","work","is","slow",".","Frank","befriend","the","daughter","of","a","heart","victim","he","bring","in",";","she","'s","Mari",",","an","ex-junki",",","angri","at","her","father","but","now","hope","he","ll","live",".","Frank","tri","to","get","fire",",","tri","to","quit",",","and","keep","come","back",",","to","work","and","to","Mari",",","in","need","of","his","own","rebirth","."],"lemmas":["a","Easter","story",".","Frank","be","a","Manhattan","medic",",","work","graveyard","in","a","two-man","ambulance","team",".","he","be","burn","out",",","exhaust",",","see","ghost",",","especially","a","young","woman","he","fail","to","save","six","month","'","before",",","and","no","longer","able","to","save","people",":","he","bring","in","the","dead",".","we","follow","he","for","three","night",",","each","with","a","different","partner",":","Larry",",","who","think","about","dinner",",","Marcus",",","who","look","to","Jesus",",","and","Tom",",","who","wallop","people","when","work","be","slow",".","Frank","befriend","the","daughter","of","a","heart","victim","he","bring","in",";","she","be","Mary",",","a","ex-junkie",",","angry","at","she","father","but","now","hope","he","will","live",".","Frank","try","to","get","fire",",","try","to","quit",",","and","keep","come","back",",","to","work","and","to","Mary",",","in","need","of","he","own","rebirth","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["An Easter story","Frank is a","is a Manhattan","a Manhattan medic","Manhattan medic ,","medic , working",", working graveyard","working graveyard in","graveyard in a","in a two-man","a two-man ambulance","two-man ambulance team","He 's burned","'s burned out","burned out ,","out , exhausted",", exhausted ,","exhausted , seeing",", seeing ghosts","seeing ghosts ,","ghosts , especially",", especially a","especially a young","a young woman","young woman he","woman he failed","he failed to","failed to save","to save six","save six months","six months '","months ' before","' before ,","before , and",", and no","and no longer","no longer able","longer able to","able to save","to save people","save people :","people : he",": he brings","he brings in","brings in the","in the dead","We follow him","follow him for","him for three","for three nights","three nights ,","nights , each",", each with","each with a","with a different","a different partner","different partner :","partner : Larry",": Larry ,","Larry , who",", who thinks","who thinks about","thinks about dinner","about dinner ,","dinner , Marcus",", Marcus ,","Marcus , who",", who looks","who looks to","looks to Jesus","to Jesus ,","Jesus , and",", and Tom","and Tom ,","Tom , who",", who wallops","who wallops people","wallops people when","people when work","when work is","work is slow","Frank befriends the","befriends the daughter","the daughter of","daughter of a","of a heart","a heart victim","heart victim he","victim he brings","he brings in","brings in ;","in ;

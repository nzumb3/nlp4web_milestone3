{"title":"Strong!","plot":"Cheryl Haworth is America's top Olympic weightlifter, ranked well above all men and women on Team USA. But at 5 feet 8 inches, weighing over 300 pounds, she doesn't fit easily into standard chairs, clothing sizes, or preconceptions. STRONG! chronicles an athlete's struggle to defend her champion status as her weightlifting career inches towards its inevitable end, exploring the contradiction of a body that is at once celebrated within the confines of her sport and shunned by mainstream culture.","genres":["Biography"," Sport"," Documentary"],"stems":["Cheryl","Haworth","is","America","'s","top","Olympic","weightlift",",","rank","well","abov","all","men","and","women","on","Team","USA",".","But","at","5","feet","8","inch",",","weigh","over","300","pound",",","she","doe","n't","fit","easili","into","standard","chair",",","cloth","size",",","or","preconcept",".","STRONG","!","chronicl","an","athlet","'s","struggl","to","defend","her","champion","status","as","her","weightlift","career","inch","toward","it","inevit","end",",","explor","the","contradict","of","a","bodi","that","is","at","onc","celebr","within","the","confin","of","her","sport","and","shun","by","mainstream","cultur","."],"lemmas":["Cheryl","Haworth","be","America","'s","top","Olympic","weightlifter",",","rank","well","above","all","man","and","woman","on","Team","USA",".","but","at","5","foot","8","inch",",","weigh","over","300","pound",",","she","do","not","fit","easily","into","standard","chair",",","clothing","size",",","or","preconception",".","strong","!","chronicle","a","athlete","'s","struggle","to","defend","she","champion","status","as","she","weightlifting","career","inch","towards","its","inevitable","end",",","explore","the","contradiction","of","a","body","that","be","at","once","celebrate","within","the","confines","of","she","sport","and","shun","by","mainstream","culture","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","LOCATION","LOCATION"],"3grams":["Cheryl Haworth is","Haworth is America","is America 's","America 's top","'s top Olympic","top Olympic weightlifter","Olympic weightlifter ,","weightlifter , ranked",", ranked well","ranked well above","well above all","above all men","all men and","men and women","and women on","women on Team","on Team USA","But at 5","at 5 feet","5 feet 8","feet 8 inches","8 inches ,","inches , weighing",", weighing over","weighing over 300","over 300 pounds","300 pounds ,","pounds , she",", she does","she does n't","does n't fit","n't fit easily","fit easily into","easily into standard","into standard chairs","standard chairs ,","chairs , clothing",", clothing sizes","clothing sizes ,","sizes , or",", or preconceptions","chronicles an athlete","an athlete 's","athlete 's struggle","'s struggle to","struggle to defend","to defend her","defend her champion","her champion status","champion status as","status as her","as her weightlifting","her weightlifting career","weightlifting career inches","career inches towards","inches towards its","towards its inevitable","its inevitable end","inevitable end ,","end , exploring",", exploring the","exploring the contradiction","the contradiction of","contradiction of a","of a body","a body that","body that is","that is at","is at once","at once celebrated","once celebrated within","celebrated within the","within the confines","the confines of","confines of her","of her sport","her sport and","sport and shunned","and shunned by","shunned by mainstream","by mainstream culture"],"2grams":["Cheryl Haworth","Haworth is","is America","America 's","'s top","top Olympic","Olympic weightlifter","weightlifter ,",", ranked","ranked well","well above","above all","all men","men and","and women","women on","on Team","Team USA","But at","at 5","5 feet","feet 8","8 inches","inches ,",", weighing","weighing over","over 300","300 pounds","pounds ,",", she","she does","does n't","n't fit","fit easily","easily into","into standard","standard chairs","chairs ,",", clothing","clothing sizes","sizes ,",", or","or preconceptions","chronicles an","an athlete","athlete 's","'s struggle","struggle to","to defend","defend her","her champion","champion status","status as","as her","her weightlifting","weightlifting career","career inches","inches towards","towards its","its inevitable","inevitable end","end ,",", exploring","exploring the","the contradiction","contradiction of","of a","a body","body that","that is","is at","at once","once celebrated","celebrated within","within the","the confines","confines of","of her","her sport","sport and","and shunned","shunned by","by mainstream","mainstream culture"]}

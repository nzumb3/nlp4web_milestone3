{"title":"Element 1","plot":"To make two unrelated story lines melt together and work as one. To reconcile documentary with fiction, without resorting to docudrama, nor to mockumentary. To tell a story as old as the existence of mankind and painfully actual. The documentary line- a man's strive to save industrial artifacts threatened with destruction. The fictional line- what remains of a human being when the most vital element is taken away. The vital element- the link between the two. This is Element 1. A film that wants to undermine the assumed perceptions and the generally accepted wisdom. And to stimulate the viewer's readiness to accept the film's discovered truth through non-conventional points of view.","genres":["Drama"," Sci-Fi"," Romance"],"stems":["To","make","two","unrel","stori","line","melt","togeth","and","work","as","one",".","To","reconcil","documentari","with","fiction",",","without","resort","to","docudrama",",","nor","to","mockumentari",".","To","tell","a","stori","as","old","as","the","exist","of","mankind","and","pain","actual",".","The","documentari","line","-","a","man","'s","strive","to","save","industri","artifact","threaten","with","destruct",".","The","fiction","line","-","what","remain","of","a","human","be","when","the","most","vital","element","is","taken","away",".","The","vital","element","-","the","link","between","the","two",".","This","is","Element","1",".","A","film","that","want","to","undermin","the","assum","percept","and","the","general","accept","wisdom",".","And","to","stimul","the","viewer","'s","readi","to","accept","the","film","'s","discov","truth","through","non-convent","point","of","view","."],"lemmas":["to","make","two","unrelated","story","line","melt","together","and","work","as","one",".","to","reconcile","documentary","with","fiction",",","without","resort","to","docudrama",",","nor","to","mockumentary",".","to","tell","a","story","as","old","as","the","existence","of","mankind","and","painfully","actual",".","the","documentary","line","-","a","man","'s","strive","to","save","industrial","artifact","threaten","with","destruction",".","the","fictional","line","-","what","remain","of","a","human","be","when","the","most","vital","element","be","take","away",".","the","vital","element","-","the","link","between","the","two",".","this","be","element","1",".","a","film","that","want","to","undermine","the","assumed","perception","and","the","generally","accept","wisdom",".","and","to","stimulate","the","viewer","'s","readiness","to","accept","the","film","'s","discover","truth","through","non-conventional","point","of","view","."],"named_entities":[],"3grams":["To make two","make two unrelated","two unrelated story","unrelated story lines","story lines melt","lines melt together","melt together and","together and work","and work as","work as one","To reconcile documentary","reconcile documentary with","documentary with fiction","with fiction ,","fiction , without",", without resorting","without resorting to","resorting to docudrama","to docudrama ,","docudrama , nor",", nor to","nor to mockumentary","To tell a","tell a story","a story as","story as old","as old as","old as the","as the existence","the existence of","existence of mankind","of mankind and","mankind and painfully","and painfully actual","The documentary line","documentary line -","line -

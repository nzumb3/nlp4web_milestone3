{"title":"Overtime","plot":"Raph and Max only kill bad guys, and only after their boss Sam, a high-powered attorney, has cashed a nice paycheck for getting her sleazy clients off the hook. When Sam sends our heroes on a routine hit, they find themselves caught up in a conspiracy they never imagined. But whatever trouble they've gotten themselves into is nothing compared to the wrath of Raph's wife if he doesn't make it home in time for his son's birthday party. Being a good hit man is tough; being a good dad is killer!","genres":["Comedy"," Sci-Fi"," Horror"],"stems":["Raph","and","Max","onli","kill","bad","guy",",","and","onli","after","their","boss","Sam",",","a","high-pow","attorney",",","has","cash","a","nice","paycheck","for","get","her","sleazi","client","off","the","hook",".","When","Sam","send","our","hero","on","a","routin","hit",",","they","find","themselv","caught","up","in","a","conspiraci","they","never","imagin",".","But","whatev","troubl","they","ve","gotten","themselv","into","is","noth","compar","to","the","wrath","of","Raph","'s","wife","if","he","doe","n't","make","it","home","in","time","for","his","son","'s","birthday","parti",".","Be","a","good","hit","man","is","tough",";","be","a","good","dad","is","killer","!"],"lemmas":["Raph","and","Max","only","kill","bad","guy",",","and","only","after","they","boss","Sam",",","a","high-powered","attorney",",","have","cash","a","nice","paycheck","for","get","she","sleazy","client","off","the","hook",".","when","Sam","send","we","hero","on","a","routine","hit",",","they","find","themselves","catch","up","in","a","conspiracy","they","never","imagine",".","but","whatever","trouble","they","have","get","themselves","into","be","nothing","compare","to","the","wrath","of","Raph","'s","wife","if","he","do","not","make","it","home","in","time","for","he","son","'s","birthday","party",".","be","a","good","hit","man","be","tough",";","be","a","good","dad","be","killer","!"],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Raph and Max","and Max only","Max only kill","only kill bad","kill bad guys","bad guys ,","guys , and",", and only","and only after","only after their","after their boss","their boss Sam","boss Sam ,","Sam , a",", a high-powered","a high-powered attorney","high-powered attorney ,","attorney , has",", has cashed","has cashed a","cashed a nice","a nice paycheck","nice paycheck for","paycheck for getting","for getting her","getting her sleazy","her sleazy clients","sleazy clients off","clients off the","off the hook","When Sam sends","Sam sends our","sends our heroes","our heroes on","heroes on a","on a routine","a routine hit","routine hit ,","hit , they",", they find","they find themselves","find themselves caught","themselves caught up","caught up in","up in a","in a conspiracy","a conspiracy they","conspiracy they never","they never imagined","But whatever trouble","whatever trouble they","trouble they 've","they 've gotten","'ve gotten themselves","gotten themselves into","themselves into is","into is nothing","is nothing compared","nothing compared to","compared to the","to the wrath","the wrath of","wrath of Raph","of Raph 's","Raph 's wife","'s wife if","wife if he","if he does","he does n't","does n't make","n't make it","make it home","it home in","home in time","in time for","time for his","for his son","his son 's","son 's birthday","'s birthday party","Being a good","a good hit","good hit man","hit man is","man is tough","is tough ;","tough ; being","; being a","being a good","a good dad","good dad is","dad is killer"],"2grams":["Raph and","and Max","Max only","only kill","kill bad","bad guys","guys ,",", and","and only","only after","after their","their boss","boss Sam","Sam ,",", a","a high-powered","high-powered attorney","attorney ,",", has","has cashed","cashed a","a nice","nice paycheck","paycheck for","for getting","getting her","her sleazy","sleazy clients","clients off","off the","the hook","When Sam","Sam sends","sends our","our heroes","heroes on","on a","a routine","routine hit","hit ,",", they","they find","find themselves","themselves caught","caught up","up in","in a","a conspiracy","conspiracy they","they never","never imagined","But whatever","whatever trouble","trouble they","they 've","'ve gotten","gotten themselves","themselves into","into is","is nothing","nothing compared","compared to","to the","the wrath","wrath of","of Raph","Raph 's","'s wife","wife if","if he","he does","does n't","n't make","make it","it home","home in","in time","time for","for his","his son","son 's","'s birthday","birthday party","Being a","a good","good hit","hit man","man is","is tough","tough ;","; being","being a","a good","good dad","dad is","is killer"]}

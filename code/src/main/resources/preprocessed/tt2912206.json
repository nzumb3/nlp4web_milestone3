{"title":"Laci BÃ¡csi","plot":"Laszlo Somogyi Singer is a Hungarian Jew born in 1929 who has survived the Holocaust and Stalinism. During a full school year, the elderly man is visited by a group of students who question him about his past. The task, though, is tougher than imagined. There is the problem of finding a common language and ground where memories can be shared and passed on. Co-directors Elena Hazanov and Claudio Recupero film this encounter of distant generations trying to understand the process whereby the gap to the present is bridged.","genres":["Biography"," History"," Documentary"],"stems":["Laszlo","Somogyi","Singer","is","a","Hungarian","Jew","born","in","1929","who","has","surviv","the","Holocaust","and","Stalin",".","Dure","a","full","school","year",",","the","elder","man","is","visit","by","a","group","of","student","who","question","him","about","his","past",".","The","task",",","though",",","is","tougher","than","imagin",".","There","is","the","problem","of","find","a","common","languag","and","ground","where","memori","can","be","share","and","pass","on",".","Co-director","Elena","Hazanov","and","Claudio","Recupero","film","this","encount","of","distant","generat","tri","to","understand","the","process","wherebi","the","gap","to","the","present","is","bridg","."],"lemmas":["Laszlo","Somogyi","Singer","be","a","hungarian","jew","bear","in","1929","who","have","survive","the","Holocaust","and","Stalinism",".","during","a","full","school","year",",","the","elderly","man","be","visit","by","a","group","of","student","who","question","he","about","he","past",".","the","task",",","though",",","be","tougher","than","imagine",".","there","be","the","problem","of","find","a","common","language","and","ground","where","memory","can","be","share","and","pass","on",".","co-director","Elena","Hazanov","and","Claudio","Recupero","film","this","encounter","of","distant","generation","try","to","understand","the","process","whereby","the","gap","to","the","present","be","bridge","."],"named_entities":["PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["Laszlo Somogyi Singer","Somogyi Singer is","Singer is a","is a Hungarian","a Hungarian Jew","Hungarian Jew born","Jew born in","born in 1929","in 1929 who","1929 who has","who has survived","has survived the","survived the Holocaust","the Holocaust and","Holocaust and Stalinism","During a full","a full school","full school year","school year ,","year , the",", the elderly","the elderly man","elderly man is","man is visited","is visited by","visited by a","by a group","a group of","group of students","of students who","students who question","who question him","question him about","him about his","about his past","The task ,","task , though",", though ,","though , is",", is tougher","is tougher than","tougher than imagined","There is the","is the problem","the problem of","problem of finding","of finding a","finding a common","a common language","common language and","language and ground","and ground where","ground where memories","where memories can","memories can be","can be shared","be shared and","shared and passed","and passed on","Co-directors Elena Hazanov","Elena Hazanov and","Hazanov and Claudio","and Claudio Recupero","Claudio Recupero film","Recupero film this","film this encounter","this encounter of","encounter of distant","of distant generations","distant generations trying","generations trying to","trying to understand","to understand the","understand the process","the process whereby","process whereby the","whereby the gap","the gap to","gap to the","to the present","the present is","present is bridged"],"2grams":["Laszlo Somogyi","Somogyi Singer","Singer is","is a","a Hungarian","Hungarian Jew","Jew born","born in","in 1929","1929 who","who has","has survived","survived the","the Holocaust","Holocaust and","and Stalinism","During a","a full","full school","school year","year ,",", the","the elderly","elderly man","man is","is visited","visited by","by a","a group","group of","of students","students who","who question","question him","him about","about his","his past","The task","task ,",", though","though ,",", is","is tougher","tougher than","than imagined","There is","is the","the problem","problem of","of finding","finding a","a common","common language","language and","and ground","ground where","where memories","memories can","can be","be shared","shared and","and passed","passed on","Co-directors Elena","Elena Hazanov","Hazanov and","and Claudio","Claudio Recupero","Recupero film","film this","this encounter","encounter of","of distant","distant generations","generations trying","trying to","to understand","understand the","the process","process whereby","whereby the","the gap","gap to","to the","the present","present is","is bridged"]}

{"title":"L'étoile du jour","plot":"A small circus arrives in a coastal area of the North Sea: the place looks rather eerie and the audience is quite scarce. But despite all of this, the life of the performers is animated by feelings born under the circus tent, and which are often lived out in the secret of their trailers. The ballerina Angèle has an affair with Elliot, the company's clown who is tormented by his conscience; but she is also courted by Heroy, the circus director; he is a cruel and potentially dangerous man who is willing to win her over by resorting to the powers of the magician Zephyr.","genres":["Drama"],"stems":["A","small","circus","arriv","in","a","coastal","area","of","the","North","Sea",":","the","place","look","rather","eeri","and","the","audienc","is","quit","scarc",".","But","despit","all","of","this",",","the","life","of","the","perform","is","anim","by","feel","born","under","the","circus","tent",",","and","which","are","often","live","out","in","the","secret","of","their","trailer",".","The","ballerina","Angèle","has","an","affair","with","Elliot",",","the","compani","'s","clown","who","is","torment","by","his","conscienc",";","but","she","is","also","court","by","Heroy",",","the","circus","director",";","he","is","a","cruel","and","potenti","danger","man","who","is","will","to","win","her","over","by","resort","to","the","power","of","the","magician","Zephyr","."],"lemmas":["a","small","circus","arrive","in","a","coastal","area","of","the","North","Sea",":","the","place","look","rather","eerie","and","the","audience","be","quite","scarce",".","but","despite","all","of","this",",","the","life","of","the","performer","be","animated","by","feeling","bear","under","the","circus","tent",",","and","which","be","often","live","out","in","the","secret","of","they","trailer",".","the","ballerina","Angèle","have","a","affair","with","Elliot",",","the","company","'s","clown","who","be","torment","by","he","conscience",";","but","she","be","also","court","by","Heroy",",","the","circus","director",";","he","be","a","cruel","and","potentially","dangerous","man","who","be","willing","to","win","she","over","by","resort","to","the","power","of","the","magician","Zephyr","."],"named_entities":["LOCATION","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON","PERSON"],"3grams":["A small circus","small circus arrives","circus arrives in","arrives in a","in a coastal","a coastal area","coastal area of","area of the","of the North","the North Sea","North Sea :","Sea : the",": the place","the place looks","place looks rather","looks rather eerie","rather eerie and","eerie and the","and the audience","the audience is","audience is quite","is quite scarce","But despite all","despite all of","all of this","of this ,","this , the",", the life","the life of","life of the","of the performers","the performers is","performers is animated","is animated by","animated by feelings","by feelings born","feelings born under","born under the","under the circus","the circus tent","circus tent ,","tent , and",", and which","and which are","which are often","are often lived","often lived out","lived out in","out in the","in the secret","the secret of","secret of their","of their trailers","The ballerina Angèle","ballerina Angèle has","Angèle has an","has an affair","an affair with","affair with Elliot","with Elliot ,","Elliot , the",", the company","the company 's","company 's clown","'s clown who","clown who is","who is tormented","is tormented by","tormented by his","by his conscience","his conscience ;","conscience ;

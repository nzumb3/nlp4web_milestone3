Khane Black
###BREAK###
Khane Black is a psychological horror film about the double-edged nature of love and affection, and the oftentimes blurred line between dedication and madness. After a particularly horrible break-up, Khane and his loyal band of followers kidnap his former fianc√©e, Amber Caesar, and drag her off to an abandoned house to be beaten and tortured. They plan to murder Amber for alleged "crimes against Khane", and post a series of videos leading up to her death on YouTube for the world to see. But as the uploads hit the web and Khane's diabolical plans unfold, his desire for revenge brings about more trouble upon his soul than he ever could have imagined. Inspired by a real-life relationship, and littered with sadistic homages to Orson Welles' classic film "Citizen Kane", Khane Black is an independent film sensation that launched the film career of Christopher M. Cline.

Na carne e na alma
###BREAK###
Rodrigo makes casual sex, with any woman who crosses his way in the night bars. In college, he meets Mariana and falls in love for the first time in his life. Mariana behaves in a dubious manner and demonstrates both tenderness and brutality driving Rodrigo to despair. It is the story of a difficult rite of passage from the fresh youth to mature life.

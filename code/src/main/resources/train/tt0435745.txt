SPEILBURGH: The true story behind the man. The adventure didn't begin on the big screen it started in the lobby! Featuring the depraved comedy of award winning LA stand-up John "J.J" Williams and the menacing undertones of the legendary Sam Nicotero, first time director Andrew Zehner weaves a seamless comedy-drama that takes you to the edge of your seat and leaves you rolling in the aisles. Steven Speilburgh is a 30 year old movie usher and wannabe film maker whose big break may just break him. With a pallet of ecstasy, an ex-girlfriend, a Porn Star, a dead boss, and the F.B.I. he has more problems than a name change, but before he can make it big he has to make it out alive.

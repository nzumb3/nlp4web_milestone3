Ben, a 25 year-old with anxiety and OCD, still living with his Mom, is forced to embark on a road trip with his only friend Richardson, an unambitious model. They are asked to drive to Salt Lake City to help Ben's angry great uncle move out of a retirement community and into his own home. In this take on modern young adulthood, we follow Ben and Richardson over the course of their enlightening three day road-trip that results in a series of fascinating encounters and the sort of banter that only occurs between two mismatched friends.

In a strange house "That thing" appears. During the night the poltergeist walks on the roof while six people stay in the kitchen and listen to its quite steps. Hardly believing that ghosts can exist they decide to catch "That thing". All ambushes and traps give no result, but all of a sudden their own lives start to get a new meaning.

Each spring, villagers in Guatemala must say goodbye to their husbands and fathers for many long months. Their destination: rural Canada, where these men can earn twenty times the salary of their compatriots at home. For Mario, Jos√© Manuel and Edwin, the grueling days and lonely nights ahead represent their only hope for a better life for their families. Upon arriving at the Forino Farm, in French-speaking Quebec, they suddenly find themselves in the middle of an unforgiving agricultural industry, where their lives are dictated by the whims of demanding consumers. This season, however, the Forinos have hired some extra help - a gigantic mechanical harvester nicknamed "The Titanic." As it pushes tirelessly forwards in the vast fields of lettuce and celery, its human counterparts must muster all that they have, physically and emotionally, in order to stay ahead of the machine, or risk being left behind. The documentary gives us an insightful and revealing look at Canada's controversial temporary migrant worker program today. Are the richer nations taking advantage of the large economical divide with their neighbors to the South or are they indeed trying to help a few to build a better future for their communities?

Whisky Time, un portrait de Charlemagne Palestine
###BREAK###
At exactly 17:30, anywhere he is, the musician and visual artist Charlemagne Palestine, declares : Whisky Time. It's time that we choose to land at home with a bottle each time different. We drink together and what happens is unpredictable. The film is essentially a reflection of becoming drunk, on the art of drinking, on Art, on what escapes us. Including deep discussions, laughter and intense concerts.

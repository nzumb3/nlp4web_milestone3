Am I Black Enough for You
###BREAK###
Am I Black Enough for You tells the story about the artist Billy Paul, the city of Philadelphia and the lifelong companionship between Billy and his wife Blanche. It's a film about love, marriage, about life's complications. The film follows the story of Billy Paul's song 'Am I Black Enough for You'. The song was the second single, a follow up to the classic 'Mrs. Jones' a number one and smash hit on both sides of the Atlantic. On release 'Am I Black Enough for You' flopped, a failure that nearly cost Billy his career.

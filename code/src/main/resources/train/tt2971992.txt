Not since before Roe v. Wade has access to choice encountered so many hurdles across so many US states. 2011 and 2012 saw a record-breaking number of abortion restrictions passed throughout the country. One of the states that led the charge was Virginia. With Virginia legislators attempting to pass everything from a Personhood amendment to transvaginal ultrasounds, Virginia quickly became ground zero in the fight for a woman's right to choose. Political Bodies documents the 3 pieces of legislation surrounding the debate, the legislators involved and the swift response from the women of Virginia.

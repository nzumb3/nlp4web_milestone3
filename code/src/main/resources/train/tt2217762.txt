From the outside, 18-year-old Rachel Woods looks like she has it all; beauty, money, and a future full of hope. But on the inside, Rachel struggles with the fact that she's never really lived life on her own terms. All too often she concedes to overbearing parents with lofty expectations as to what Rachel should 'be' in the future. Rachel's entire world transforms after she meets Swan, a mysterious teen from a foreign land. As their relationship blossoms, Swan teaches Rachel that the only person she has to make happy in her life is herself.

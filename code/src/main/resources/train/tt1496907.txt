Whatever It Was
###BREAK###
There's always that one moment. That moment of temptation. That moment of betrayal. That moment when everything changes. Lives intersect, intertwine, and explode when six strangers come into contact with a man willing to say anything, and be anyone to get what - and who - he wants. This is a story of suspense, romance, and the type of passion that destroys everything it touches. This is a story of relationships that begin with a look, falter with a secret, and die by the truth. This is a story of three couples who find themselves falling out of love and into a tangled future with unknown possibilities and dangers.

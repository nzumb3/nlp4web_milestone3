Citizen Mayor
###BREAK###
Seven individuals from all walks of life have one thing in common, to be the next mayor of Seattle. Political experience is negligible or non-existent; financial resources are slim. Can passion and determination be enough to overcome the raw power of money and establishment? Out of a pack of underdog candidates, will one emerge against all odds as the next mayor of Seattle in 2009? Up close interviews reveal their naivet√©, hopes and dreams, and fears and concerns as the race progresses. As the election draws near and the stakes rise, viewers will be captivated by the bike-riding idealist and environmentalist Mike McGinn, who is consistently out-funded and out-spent by heavy-weight contenders. Commentaries from political pundits weigh the struggles and consequences throughout.

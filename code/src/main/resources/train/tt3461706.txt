Pillow Secrets
###BREAK###
When she recognises the body of the woman who was her mother, a young woman is drawn violently back to her past. She lived in the 'Big House' with her mother, Zahia. It was a boarding house converted into a brothel, which Zahia ruled with an iron fist - just as she ruled the whole neighbourhood. The little girl was known locally as the daughter of Zahia the prostitute. She finally discovers who she really is - on the very day her mother chooses to tell her everything.

Finding Anthony
###BREAK###
Innocent and introverted Ann is misunderstood by her mother, schoolmates and society. The one person she could count on was her father, who greatly cherished Ann and accepted her for who she is. But after the death of her father, Ann drowns herself in comics and romantic dramas. On the other hand, Ann's mother feels disgusted and trapped after being left with the store her husband used to run and seeks a new beginning, all while neglecting Ann's state of mind. This contributes to Ann's loneliness and strong desire for love. These feelings inadvertently lead Ann to a dating site to find her Prince Charming, 'Anthony', who understands her heart's deepest desires. Will he be the one to slay the dragons in Ann's life and save her?

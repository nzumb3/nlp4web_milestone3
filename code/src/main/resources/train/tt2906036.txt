Super Athlete
###BREAK###
Alex Walker, a 17-year-old ultra sports fan, has his life turned upside down when an 1890's football referee shows up in his TV to inform him that the Sports Gods have accidentally created a "super athlete." The teen is told that this super athlete, a 6'8" farm boy, is coming to his high school and he must keep him away from the athletic department. If anyone discovers his hidden talents it could mean the end of sports! But when Coach Lou, the cantankerous football coach, spots the towering farm boy in a school hallway, everything goes awry.

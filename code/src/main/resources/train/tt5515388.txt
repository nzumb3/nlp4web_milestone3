Neda is a fifty-year-old Roman woman who grew up in the old part of the city, right near the Colosseum. But today she no longer lives in her old neighborhood. She lives in Ponte di Nona, in the heart of the "new center" on the outskirts of Rome. Sara, too, lives and grew up in Ponte di Nona; she is eighteen years old and is one of the few girls there who has had the chance to go to high school.

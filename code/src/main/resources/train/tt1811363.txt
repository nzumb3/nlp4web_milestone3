The people of Djenne (Mali, Africa) end the dry season with a special tradition. They plaster their mosque. This fairy-like building is the largest adobe construction in the world. Due to high temperatures and the (scarce) rainfall it erodes quickly. To prevent the Grande Mosquee from 'melting down' to just a pile of clay, the Djenneke join forces at the fete de crepissage. This documentary follows the preamble to the festival and shows us a different Africa than we think we know. Throughout this storyline runs the tale of a many century old legend about the genesis of Djenne.

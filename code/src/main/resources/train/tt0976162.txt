Postpartum
###BREAK###
In 1970, a teenage girl gets pregnant and is forced to give up the baby to adoption by her parents. The child is passed from one foster home to another as he hones the same homicidal tendencies passed down from his father and grandfather. He decides to get his own justice for being given up at birth and seeks out his birth mother. The mother, in the same window of time, decides to find her son and hires a private detective. As the P.I. digs deeper, he finds more and more clues about the history of the young man and his side of the family. He enlists the help of a former FBI profiler to help him search and analyze the information. With a juxtaposing storyline, the young man knows nothing of his mother's search for him and the mother knows nothing of her son's quest to settle the score. When all paths meet, the climax delivers the final justice and shows the possible result when a child finds his way back home.

Hell's Pavement
###BREAK###
The film follows five years in the life of a young girl as she struggles against an onslaught of good intentions. From her first encounter with the social care system, through a range of foster placements, to a haunting climax, we are challenged to question how it is that so many well-intentioned people can do so much unintended damage. And how it is that the Â£4bn a year that people in the UK spend on children in care has failed to break the cycle of abuse, addiction and abandonment.

Letter One
###BREAK###
LETTER ONE articulates an actor's (writer's) struggle with cultural stereotypes in film, television and theater. Provoked by culturally offensive content in a television script for the series, Rent A Goalie, in which actor Tony Nardi had been asked to consider participation, actor/writer Nardi refused the 'offer', wrote a letter instead (to the producers via casting director) and went public with the Letter. LETTER ONE is the first of three 'theatrical' monologues, TWO LETTERS...AND COUNTING!, that decry the moribund state of Canadian film, television and theater. The live presentations of the Letters have aroused considerable controversy in Canada. LETTER ONE was filmed in front of a live audience.

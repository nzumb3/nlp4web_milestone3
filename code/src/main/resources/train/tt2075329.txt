The Ballad of Hugh
###BREAK###
Move over Justin Bieber, we have the next new music sensation. His name is Hugh Oliver and he is 83, but he dreams like an 18 yr old. This is the story of a complete unknown trying to make it in the 'youth' obsessed entertainment biz. Hugh teaches us that any age is a good age to dream, to play, to write, to learn. The Ballad of Hugh centres around Hugh's golden day at Canterbury Studios in Toronto, where some of Toronto's top musicians, help bring his songs to life. All the footage is interwoven with audio of Hugh's poems put to brilliant animated segments by Geoff Marshall. The Ballad of Hugh is waiting to be sung.

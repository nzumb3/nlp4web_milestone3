Objects from Oblivion
###BREAK###
Objects from Oblivion is an independent documentary of Newport RI Artist, Ben Butler. This master sculptor provides a studio Q & A of inestimable magnitude. His works are essentially an amalgamation of antique tools yet are timeless in their disguise as primitive totemic offerings. Butler articulately presents his process, artistic lineage, social significance, personal motivations, mythologies, local industrial era history and much more with a charismatic stage presence and a commanding yet gentle voice. Though recorded with low technology, his luminescent studio, the objects and the field work come across the barrier of the digital domain with a high level of beauty and clarity. His captured dialog and insight spans well beyond the act of sculpture, but into the realms of all the arts.

Let Me Die Quietly
###BREAK###
A haunted, broken-down psychic is being tortured with violent visions of murder. His unsettling "gift" is to see the last moments of a victim's time on earth. Now, as his visions become more intense, he knows that he is either going to die or get involved with a situation that might give him a little more time. His last obsession becomes to stop the death of at least one victim in his premonitions.

Falsos positivos
###BREAK###
The "Falsos Positivos" scandal that exploded on October 2008 revealed how and why ranks of the Colombian Army started to kill innocent people. Lured by money prizes given by the President Uribe's policy called "Seguridad Democratica", the Colombian Army dressed the bodies in military fatigues to claim the rewards for the fight against the FARC guerrilla. "Falsos Positivos" follows the trip of two families to retrieve the rests of their beloved, along with shocking interviews to activists, a former General, political analysts and witnesses of this huge scandal.

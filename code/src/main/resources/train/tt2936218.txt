Dimension Folders
###BREAK###
An astrophysicist professor - who firmly believes that higher dimensions exist - discovers an alien civilization in the Galaxy. He sends messages to the aliens and surprisingly they answer him instantly. He has only one explanation: they are in the 5th dimension - they exist OUTSIDE OF TIME, exactly as he described in his theory. The news spreads in seconds and more intelligent services are after him to erase - or possess - his dangerous discovery. With two of his helpers the professor flees across the Vancouver Island rain forests to reach Vancouver where publicity can protect his discovery.

The Regulators 250th Anniversary Edition
###BREAK###
'The Regulators' documents a pre-Revolutionary resistance movement that flourished in the colony of North Carolina. Living in a time fraught with rampant abuses of taxation and widespread corruption, Regulation supporters petitioned that the government merely follow the law. After years of abuse their opposition led to a showdown with Governor Tryon at the Battle of Alamance on May 16, 1771.

Werewolf
###BREAK###
Werewolf Carl-Johan Landquist's unlikely quest for immortality through procreation. By the insolent paralleling of multiple modern women the sensations of heart become delusions of a fool and cause an escalating werewolf-metamorphosis for the metropolitan polygamist. The contract is the only way to love but still maintain sanity. On top of the parliament stands the wounded wolf swaying his shirt soaked in blood as a banner for unconditional love.

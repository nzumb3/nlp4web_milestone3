Standard: le film
###BREAK###
Are you ready to change your mind about soccer fans? Going to the stadium to root for your favorite soccer team is a very exciting moment to share and exchange with others. STANDARD is the story of the Standard Football Club fans of Liege in Belgium and the passion they experience everyday. It's about the fervor that helps them to preserve whatever the cost, the spirit of their club, a battle flag flying high and strong in the face of global foot-business. Recounting the stories of a few fans, STANDARD brings the idea of transmission alive, the need and proud feeling of belonging to something indestructible, something that will be perpetuated for generations, so that the spirit of the Standard Club continues to soar above the stadium.

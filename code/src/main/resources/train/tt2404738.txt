Witching and Bitching
###BREAK###
After robbing a gold exchange pawn shop, a gang of armed robbers disguised as street performers is on the run, in a frantic attempt to escape from the Police in the crowded streets of Madrid. Without delay and with the unwilling help of a taxi driver, they head towards the safety of the borders, until night arrives and a safe haven is found deep in the woods of the secluded and notorious village of Zugarramurdi, known for some witch activity in the past. Sooner or later, in a place crammed with witches of all sorts and after numerous encounters with the bizarre, the unexpected and the occult, the clumsy thieves must learn fast the ways of the coven in order to save themselves and the world from the next witch apocalypse.

###BREAK###
Sometimes in the future, in order to "survive through Death", a hyper-fascistic entity decides to exterminate and inflict trauma on an unimaginable scale while it looses a global conflict. It bets on the winners to resurrect their ideology as the only viable alternative to the chaos and aftershocks that soon follow in a world gone desperate and mad. A young woman, taken from a psychiatric hospital during the war, becomes the catalyst for all the symbolism and inner struggles of that period. Her psychological madness is paralleled by that of a pilot who feels a strange resemblance between his and her way of killing, so abstract and brutal in this post industrial conflict.

One day, the woman decides to tell the truth to him about her feelings about their relationship to her silent husband.

She says things she could never have done before, even though they have been married for the past 10 years.

In this wait for her husband to come back to life, the woman struggles to survive and live. She finds refuge in her aunt's place, who is a prostitute, and the only relative who understands her. The woman seeks to free herself from suffering through the words she delivers audaciously to her husband.

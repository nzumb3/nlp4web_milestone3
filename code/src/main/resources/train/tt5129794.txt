Steam on the River
###BREAK###
Like the steam that silently appears and then disappears over a flowing river, the life of every human is just as fleeting, and this particularly applies in the case of artists. The transience of their fame is the main topic of this documentary, which provides a glimpse into the lives of three aging jazzmen: trumpeter Laco Deczi, saxophonist Lubomír Tamaskovic, and contrabass player Ján Jankeje, who fled from the Soviet-occupied Czechoslovakia to the West, where their stars shone alongside those of the world's famous musicians.

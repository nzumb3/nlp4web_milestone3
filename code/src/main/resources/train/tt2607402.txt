###BREAK###
SUGAR BABIES is a groundbreaking documentary that examines the public health epidemic of diabetic children in America. Through archival footage and revealing interviews with children and their families, we bring fresh insights to the ancient disease of type 1 diabetes and to its lifestyle-driven counterpart, type 2 diabetes. The central narrative weaves together five character-driven stories while providing the broader context--social, political, corporate-- of how this crisis came to be. SUGAR BABIES is a call to action, proposing solutions and demanding accountability. Intimate, searing, and inspirational, the documentary will change our country's understanding of this costly and often debilitating condition.

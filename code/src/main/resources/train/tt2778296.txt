The Rainbow Serpent feature documentary encompasses one man's five year pilgrimage. Join Tor Webster in his travels around the earth's chakra points, communicating and exploring global unity consciousness and discussing spirituality with tribal elders and sacred rites with the local spiritual communities. Gaia's energy system is remarkably similar to our own with our connection to the earth far greater than we realize, WE are the awareness of the planet and its only hope of salvation. Linking the myths and legends from all over the planet, we find a deep culture that has been lost to the sands of time. This film aims to inspire people to travel consciously around the world and into their own hearts.

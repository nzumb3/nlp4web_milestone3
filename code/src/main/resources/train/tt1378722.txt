Los con voz
###BREAK###
Los con Voz/Those With Voice documents current efforts in the Southern Mexican states of Oaxaca and Chiapas to produce what social scientists have dubbed "indigenous media". A pacifist group of radio engineers travel days to man the transmitter cabin in the hills of Chiapas, providing the surrounding communities with information about current events, family health, and national politics. An archaeologist in Massachusetts explains how his field has changed throughout the twentieth century. And an international film festival brings together visionaries from twenty-three countries including a girl from Finland searching for love and a Cree man working to keep his peoples' oral history alive. These stories illustrate the complexities of the indigenous experience today while at the same time they promote the universality of the human spirit. Through it all we find the undeniable desire to speak and be heard.

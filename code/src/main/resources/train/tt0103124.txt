An American wife (Maryam d'Abo) of a maharajah inherits five-million dollars after he is stepped on by an elephant during a leopard hunt, but the American insurance company suspects fraud and hires an insurance investigator (Rick Rossovich) to go to India to investigate the questionable death of her husband. In India the wife and investigator start an affair that leads to several soft-core sex scenes scattered throughout the film. Meanwhile an Indian woman (Asha Siewkumar) believes that her own father's disappearance may be involved in the murder, a story that local police dismiss. She then stalks the wife to get proof of a conspiracy.

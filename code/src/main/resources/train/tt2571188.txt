Redbelly
###BREAK###
A grim, mind-bending fairy tale which follows a brother and sister who are banished as children by their father, a greedy and lecherous King. The Princess is locked in a lone tower where she lives for years in complete isolation, surrounding herself with a vast menagerie of tiny objects which become the locus of her disturbed imagination. The Prince, abandoned in a swamp with the magical glass vessel that serves as his stomach, is found and raised by a Moonshiner, who uses the boy for slave labor and the vessel as a receptacle for his poisonous shine.

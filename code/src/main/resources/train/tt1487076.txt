Al√©m da Luz
###BREAK###
When it comes to visual impairment, we are often led to think of something sad and limiting. In Beyond the Light, however, seven blind Brazilians show us with great optimism, humor and boldness how they live a normal life, and even a more productive life than many ordinary people. More than an example of overcoming and courage, Beyond the Light is one of the rare films about disability that leaves you inspired, motivated and more enthusiastic about life.

Married for 7 Years
###BREAK###
A sexually frustrated husband learns to be careful what he asks for. His sex life virtually non-existent after only seven years of marriage, Alain and Audrey rarely find time for bedroom intimacy as a result of Audrey's demanding job and her tireless devotion to their daughter Camille. Concerned that their marriage may be in trouble as he increasingly relies on pornography to fulfill his sexual needs, Alain consults a sex therapist for suggestions on how to re-awaken his wife's sexual appetite. Although some subsequent trips to nearby sex stores and steamy nightclubs at first make Audrey uneasy, hapless Alain soon finds himself getting more than he bargained for when his plan starts to work a little too well.

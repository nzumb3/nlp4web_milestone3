528 Key Movie
###BREAK###
In 1938-39, the British Standards Institute and the Rockefeller Foundation imposed a musical standard on the world that condemned civilization to physiological distress and spiritual suppression. This imposition was called "Standard Concert Tuning." Increasingly, since then, the agents and agencies who did this have assaulted the environment, compromised public health and safety, and threatened the extinction of humanity, not only petro-chemically, but musically. Most intelligent people realize, at this point in history, the world needs a miracle to get us out of this mess we are in, imposed by global industrialists, affecting everything and everyone on earth. This film heralds the "MIracle 6" note of the original musical scale, otherwise called the "Key of the house of David" (Isaiah 22:22; Rev. 3: 6-8) or "Zion's Key" for global peace and prosperity. It celebrates the "LOVE528 frequency" at the heart of rainbows, sunshine and snowflakes. This extraordinary contribution by award-winning author, filmmaker, and "World Leading Intellectual" activist, Dr. Leonard Horowitz, is history in the making. It fulfills ancient prophesy, exalts creativity in the arts, and corrects and refocuses the sciences. THE 528 LOVE REVOLUTION IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY will impact everything, slowly but surely, eventually; and this feature-length multi-media presentation prepares leaders to take advantage of this monumental opportunity to be "ahead of the curve" in a world of creatively-frozen followers.

Gipsy Jew
###BREAK###
Nitzan is a twenty-year old lesbian from Tel Aviv. A time bomb of strong and conflicting emotions ticks under the surface. She escapes Israel by leaving for Tokyo to work as a hostess in a nightclub. She hates the job but needs the money for traveling to stay out of Israel. After Tokyo she travels to NY and Adam. Sex and drugs numb her. There's always pain for her country. It's too much effort to make something good out of it. Hope turns into apathy and apathy into hope.

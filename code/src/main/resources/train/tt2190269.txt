Football Gladiators
###BREAK###
The most popular sports of the world (football, rugby and American football) come from Historical Florentine Football, a game played in Florence since 1530. Four teams made by 27 players each face each other every year in Piazza S. Croce, a jewel of Italian Renaissance that becomes an Infernal arena. It's like a Spanish bullfight, but between human beings. Bare-chested players fight in a no holds barred contest. The beauty of their bodies is ancient: it's like seeing Michelangelo's sculptures in the flesh. We experience the game from the inside, with 12 cameras plus a ultra light micro-camera fixed on the referee's temple. Knock outs, broken noses, cracked ribs, but also courage, passion and loyalty: all this is Football Gladiators.

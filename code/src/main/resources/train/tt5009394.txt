###BREAK###
One hundred years ago, when Taiwan was under Japanese rule, the son of a poor farmer was born named Wu Fu-Zhi. His desire to become well educated and eventual achievements led him to a path of teaching. In 1940, he journeyed to Tokyo to take the teacher certification of calligraphy examination. He was the first person of Taiwanese descent to successfully pass this difficult exam. This achievement had a great influence on the people of Taiwan. Not only was he a great calligrapher but an outstanding educator. In 1945, Japan was defeated in the Second World War and the Kuomintang of China took back control of Taiwan. Beginning in 1948, Wu Fu-Zhi began to write the calligraphy textbooks for students in Taiwan. However, as a result of his relentless work ethic, he fell ill and died at the age of forty-one years. He had done many things for his country and for the next generation, but due to political reasons, his history was ignored by the people. This is the story of the deeds of Wu Fu-Zhi, the story in the wind.

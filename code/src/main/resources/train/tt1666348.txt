Vixen Highway 2006: It Came from Uranus!
###BREAK###
Vixen Highway 2006: It Came from Uranus!(2010) is an updated homage to 60's and 70's exploitation pictures & a re-imaging, re-regurgitation and semi-sequel to John Ervin's original 'Vixen Highway'; by Canadian schlock-meister: Tony 'Tex' Watt (Frankenpimp). This motion picture is a Faustian-tale, which takes place in Minnesota where the ailing, egotistical and sexually perverted rock-star Bobby Barzell (who sold his soul for wealth and rock and roll stardom) awaits a liver transplant from a psychotic fugitive of the law; as a vengeful, demonic alien tries to collect a past debt. This multi-genre feature is chock-full of Blood, Breasts, Bullets and Beasts ... an interstate, interplanetary menagerie of bad-assery!

###BREAK###
The story of a fun-loving boy Bablu (Vinay Rai) and his humorous love tale with a don Shankardada's (Prabhu) sister Deepika (Sharmila Mandre). Having fallen in love with Deepika, Bablu wins the heart of her with ease and marries her. His father, played by Pandiraj, works for the don and fears that his son's act might cost the lives of his family members. The rest of the story deals with how the hero manages to give a tough time (though it fun to watch) to the gangster.

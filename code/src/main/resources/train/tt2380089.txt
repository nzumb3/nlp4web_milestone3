Narcissus
###BREAK###
Narcissus (from Greek Narkissos) shares the root nark- with narcosis and narcotic. All these words have the same origin in the verb narkao - to intoxicate through a strong smell. In the modern interpretation of the ancient myth Teodore is a handsome and multiply gifted string quartet cello player who knows his own value. He draws people in, but ends up hurting them, yet he is impossible to resist. Teodore abandons his family, career, and friends in his quest for a true challenge. He has yet to find out that his greatest confrontation will be with himself.

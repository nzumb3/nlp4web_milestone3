Scarred Lands and Wounded Lives (60)
###BREAK###
In all its stages, from the production of weapons through combat to cleanup and restoration, war entails actions that pollute land, air, and water, destroy biodiversity, and drain natural resources. Yet the environmental damage occasioned by war and preparation for war is routinely underestimated, under reported, even ignored. The environment remains war's 'silent casualty.' This shorter, one hour version, of the feature length film by the same name is a powerful reminder of the true impact of war throughout our history.

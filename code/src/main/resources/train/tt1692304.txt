COMPLEXO: Parallel universe
###BREAK###
In the peak of tension in Rio de Janeiro, two Portuguese brothers ventured into the most feared favela (slum), and closely lived the largest police operation ever launched in that state; they felt in their skin what it is to wake up with the sound of gun fire and often to sleep accompanied by shots. The heads of the largest criminal faction of Rio speak intimately of the life in the world of Trafficking. A struggling mother's faith in Jesus makes her believe all is possible. "God is great, but business is nasty" says the president of the dwellers' association, who survived the frightening expansion of the complex, the arrival of crime, drugs and guns, who lived through many policies and wars. Mc Playboy is a funk artist who saw many of his friends murdered, and fights to destroy prejudice and to bring together the so-called both sides of society. Through action and word, each character adds a piece to a gigantic puzzle that reveals to us the daily life of the favela as a whole. How is it to survive within this reality?

Brother Liar John
###BREAK###
John is awkward. He's a little shy, he just graduated from High School and he's turning eighteen. His two best friends; one who he's hopelessly in love with, the other is her boyfriend, take him into San Francisco for a day-long celebration and 'initiation into Manhood.' Throughout the day John decides to actually try new things, some successfully, some miserably. But that's life isn't it? Sometimes you have to roll with the punches, other times you have to stop waiting and make your move.

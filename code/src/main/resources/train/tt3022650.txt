Els anys salvatges
###BREAK###
Three kids. In the streets of a city in Africa. A mafia-like gang. Fights. The smallest kid kills his stepmother. The kids flee: the journey begins. Love is born and they find their families. Responsibility and the song to freedom are not compatible. One has to make a choice. The kids are men. Maybe the wild years will not come back.

This Is Not a Dream
###BREAK###
THIS IS NOT A DREAM is a documentary feature, incorporating bespoke live performance, about how you can change the world with your video camera... or create your own. With the video revolution of the 1970s, new worlds began to unfold: artists and performers could talk back to the mainstream by hijacking its images; reach out, through the camera, to fellow freaks; and create dreamscapes to play out different ways of being. THIS IS NOT A DREAM unpacks four decades of avant-garde experiment and radical escapism, from Warhol's world to the web's perverted frontiers, taking in streetwalker fashions and glittery magic penises along the way. Exclusive interview and incredible archive material is complemented by live video-interactive performances in front of the screen by acclaimed drag fabulist Dickie Beau.

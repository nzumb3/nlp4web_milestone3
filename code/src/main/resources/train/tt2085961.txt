The Potato Eaters
###BREAK###
The Potato Eaters is a film about Nico's Snackbar, where the Gillisse family has been baking French fries for more then 55 years. People from miles around come to the Bezuidenhout, a district in The Hague, for the special taste of their French fries. The film tries to analyze what is so special about this taste. Is it craftsmanship, is it the taste of memories or is it the taste of social contact? The old Nico Gillisse founded Nico's Snackbar in 1955 in the Bezuidenhout, a district almost completely ruined by a mistaken Allied bombing during the Second World War. Nico brought a new kind of food and a new era. Since he died his sons Nico, Martin and Paul took over. They worked in the snackbar with their entire families until this very day. The Potato Eaters tells a post war Dutch family history as a tribute to Van Gogh.

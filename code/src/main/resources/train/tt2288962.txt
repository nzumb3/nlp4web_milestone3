Saving Rhino Phila
###BREAK###
A new breed of poachers has declared war on South Africa's rhino population. Armed with helicopters, night-vision goggles, and firepower that would put any army to shame, these men will stop at nothing to get their highly coveted and very valuable rhino horns. Only one rhino has survived their bullets, and Phila's story is one of courage, strength, and the will to survive. She and her rescuers have become symbols of hope in South Africa's new war on poaching against these strong and magnificent creatures.

Adivasi Queen
###BREAK###
An 8-year-old girl is raped, and abandoned in the jungle. She survives with the help of her only friends - the jungle animals - and becomes a "dakoity", a lawless jungle woman, mounting her faithful horse Sheru, and bent on revenge on the man she did not forget. She is the Adivasi Queen (jungle tribal queen). With the help of a good fighter, she will escape the police, and achieve her aim.

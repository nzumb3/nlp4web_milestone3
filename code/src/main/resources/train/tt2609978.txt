Frack You!
###BREAK###
Molly, a fire-breathing environmentalist, opposes fracking, while Nozmo wants his land fracked for big bucks. Frick and Frack, welders for Henley Drilling, are just happy to have jobs and each other. Joe, Molly's significant other, may be getting fracked on the side. Charlie has recently moved here from New York City and is clueless about fracking - but he learns pretty fast. Bring them all together at Nozmo's Bar and you have a volatile mix of personalities and viewpoints just waiting to burst into flames!

Window of Opportunity
###BREAK###
A suspenseful dark comedy/thriller about greed and the corporate world. CEO - Roger Sizemore and his toady CFO, Carl Everett, invite a young hotshot executive, Peter Miller, up to a remote cabin for a weekend of drinking and debauchery, but it is clear that Roger and Carl are setting Peter up to take the fall for their own financial shenanigans. When a couple of call girls come up to add spice to the weekend, things get hairy and way out of hand. Roger may have killed one of them and now enlists Carl and Peter to help cover up the matter. When the girls' pimp, Byron, arrives, the price of life gets quite clear...and outrageous.

A wig can sit on a someone's head for a lifetime or just a few hours. What does it hide? What story? What search for identity? Manuèla, Stéphanie, Nicole and Madeleine are 4 women who, for different reasons, have lost their hair and had recourse to the services of Christel, a social beautician. This movie tells of their daily lives and their fight to (re)build their image and femininity.

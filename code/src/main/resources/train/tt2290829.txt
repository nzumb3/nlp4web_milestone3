WHITE CAMELLIAS is a melodrama that revolves around an artist in her early 60s (Cybill Shepherd) who throws a Spanish-themed dinner party in the hopes of rekindling the great love affair of her youth. A passionate woman who fills her home with poetry and paintings, Annie is a genuine romantic which also leaves her vulnerable to disappointment and occasional delusion. As the evening progresses, her expectations of love transform as she faces painful truths about her past and present. Fueled by the strong words of her favorite poet -- Federico Garcia Lorca -- Annie will redefine her vision for the future and her definition of happiness over the course of this dark night of reckoning.

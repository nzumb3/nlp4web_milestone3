Faith, Fraud, & Minimum Wage
###BREAK###
Teenaged Casey never knew what a miracle could do... until she created one. Frustrated with her life, Casey throws a coffee at the wall of the Krowne Donuts where she works ... and the splash (with a little help from Casey) seems to resemble an image of Jesus Christ. Overnight, Casey finds herself becoming the ring-master of a growing faith circus: the parking-lot teems in new customers, 24-7 news media arrive. Casey's hoax changes everything: for her strict, fundamental boss, her sweet, believing boyfriend, her "Doubting Thomas" local priest, and, most importantly, for her Dad ... Haunted by the aftermath of a family tragedy, Casey's Dad is letting everything around him go: his mortgage payments, his business, everything. Casey's hoax might be just the "divine intervention" which her Dad needs ... but the results are not at all what she expected.

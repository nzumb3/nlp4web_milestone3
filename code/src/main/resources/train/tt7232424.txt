Geschichten aus der Heimat
###BREAK###
A journey back in time. People are telling their very individual lifetime stories from the late 1950s to the late 1980s. How did they celebrate anniversaries? Which special locations in town were their favorites? How did they work? And how were their family lives? The documentary is mixing digitized old substandard film material with new 4K-pictures of today's life of the attended people in Karlsruhe / Germany.

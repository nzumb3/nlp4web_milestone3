Who is the real Katie55? Is she a bored college student stuck in a hum-drum town, or a fifteen-year-old girl whose video journal has thousands of followers hits online? Even Katie isn't sure anymore. She thought it was innocent at first: If you only have one life, why not live two? Except it's no longer that simple. Katie must question her reality when elements from her fictional life start bleeding into her real one. Katie55 is a feature-length psychological thriller for the Facebook generation that asks: are we really who we think we are?

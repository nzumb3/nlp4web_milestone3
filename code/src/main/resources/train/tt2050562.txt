Love and Other Anxieties
###BREAK###
Faced with the reality that her only child will 'flee the nest' for college, documentary funder-turned-filmmaker Lyda Kuth gets anxious not only about her aspirations for her daughter but also about her relationship with her husband of 20 years. What is the real meaning of love, marriage, long-term commitment? She queries non-experts and experts alike, such as indie filmmaker Josh Safdie, playwright and budding rock star Kyle Jarrow, author and scholar Stephanie Coontz, about their successes and failures of the heart. 'Love and Other Anxieties' is both personal and poetic. With the help of editor/co-writer Lucia Small (filmmaker of 'My Father, the Genius' and 'The Axe in the Attic'), Kuth has crafted a meditative documentary that is poignantly intimate yet surprisingly universal.

Prometheus Triumphant
###BREAK###
Prometheus Triumphant is a throwback to 1920's German Expressionist silent film, telling the story with images, music and title cards. Prometheus is made to look as though it was produced decased ago, but the content leans toward a much more graphic contemporary edginess.

Where It Flows Out Into the Plains
###BREAK###
A film about light, culture, movements and the spiritual convictions that form India. It is not a documentary, fiction nor travelogue, but meditation through image and sound. The film travels from London, Bahrain, Delhi, Haridwar and Rishikesh. The sacred river Ganga flows through Rishikesh, a place where the river leaves the Himalayas and flows into the Plains. In this place, animals like cows, dogs, monkeys and people linger to meditate in the sacred wind.

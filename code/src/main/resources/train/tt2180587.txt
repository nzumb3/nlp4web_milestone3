Home for the Weekend
###BREAK###
Marko is in his mid-thirties, has just published his first book, and has been living in Berlin since his university days - far enough away from his parents Gitte and GÃ¼nter whose bourgeois lifestyle he could never quite get used to. He visits them once or twice a year, mainly to give them a chance to spend a few days with their grandson. His hopes of spending a quiet weekend with the family fall short when Gitte, who has been mentally unstable since Marko was a child, feels so healthy after a homeopathic treatment that she stops taking her medication. Her announcement triggers reserved reactions in the family, and a series of revelations tip his family's structure out of balance.

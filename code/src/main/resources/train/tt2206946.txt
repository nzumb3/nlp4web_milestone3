In Our Heads About Our Hair
###BREAK###
In Our Heads About Our Hair examines issues Black women confront regarding hair and self-esteem. Despite a current natural-hair trend in some urban areas, many Black women say conforming to mainstream beauty standards makes it easier to find mates and corporate employment. In Our Heads encourages viewers to celebrate their natural beauty, but offers differing opinions (and wisdom) from women who have chosen otherwise, while delving into underlying historical and social factors. Women of all ages, opinions, and, of course, hairstyles get In Our Heads About Our Hair. Included are interviews with: Melba Tolliver, the nation's first Black network TV news anchor; Farah Jasmine Griffin, historian and Columbia University professor, environmental activist Majora Carter, Dr. Marc Lamont Hill (host of Our World with Black Enterprise), author and activist Asha Bandele, celebrity makeup artist Roxanna Floyd, TV personality Abiola Abrams and many others. The film also features informal discussions in salons, commentary from men in the street, natural-hair fashion shows and a poetry performance. Audiences will meet a cancer survivor, women bald by choice, women from other countries and women whose faith dictates that hair never be seen. They all address history, identity, and the notion of "good" and "bad" hair.

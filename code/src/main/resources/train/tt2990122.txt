When Ash meets Charlie on the top of a parking structure, he knows something is different. He was there to jump, she was there to smoke, neither were there by chance. To The Horizon follows the story of Ash, a depressed high school teen who can't seem to find his purpose in life, and Charlie, a high school girl who doesn't need one, who only wants to escape. Their two best friends Gordon and Mia watch as their relationship grows into something bigger than themselves. To The Horizon is the story of how two people can effect not only each other, but the lives of those around them in miraculous ways.

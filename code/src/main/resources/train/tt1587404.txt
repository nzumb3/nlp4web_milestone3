Boats Beat Back
###BREAK###
Derek has got it made. Upwardly mobile with a beautiful girlfriend and a promotion on the way, it looks like he finally has everything sorted out. But oddly enough, when his ex-flame returns to the city, he finds himself increasingly absorbed with thoughts of his old life, one of coke-dusted halcyon nights. Alyssa's made the jump from user to wholesaler. Then again, her past isn't squeaky clean either, what with a dealer after his stolen stash and a possessive family bent on bringing her back into the fold. How these lifestyles collide is the subject of this no-budget debut feature from Todd Jurgess.

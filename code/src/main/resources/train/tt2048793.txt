Last Will and Embezzlement
###BREAK###
"Last Will and Embezzlement" is a feature-length documentary which examines the financial exploitation of the elderly. Its creation was inspired by the recent, true-life events in the family of Executive Producer and Starjack Entertainment partner, Pamela S. K. Glasner, and although the film does touch upon the events in Ms. Glasner's family, its focus is much more universal than that, because the problem is, without question, universal. Of all the illegal and illicit enterprises in the world, elder exploitation is among the safest and most lucrative. It is a criminal's dream. It carries the least amount of risk, requires minimal outlay, can be done right from your living room, is virtually unreported by its victims - and then, even when it IS reported, it's perpetrators are practically never prosecuted. The financial cost is staggering; the human cost is incalculable. Each and every day now, for the next 19 years, more than 11,000 Baby Boomers nationally and more than 61,000 Baby Boomers globally** will be turning 65 - and since Baby Boomers control 80% of the personal finances (as opposed to business finance), the world is about to experience the largest transfer of wealth, from one generation to the next, in human history. This quite literally exposes more than 500 million Baby Boomers, plus their already-aged parents, plus their adult children (their beneficiaries) to what will literally become a global epidemic of fraud and financial abuse if this crime-spree is left unchecked.

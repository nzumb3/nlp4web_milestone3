Chandra
###BREAK###
Royal decorum, even in modern India, is stringent. The old tenet of duties and honor, before emotions and love, still subsist. In order to conserve their prominence, the royals seek the wealthy for alliance, if they have exhausted their own kind. CHANDRA is a tale of a princess caught between the so called royal traditions and her simple uncomplicated heart. Through mature and gripping performances, the essence of love and values linger alongside melodious music, picturesque cinematography, witty comedy, and smooth rendition. The film sends the much needed message - love is above all, and it is only your heart that makes you a royal and not your wealth.

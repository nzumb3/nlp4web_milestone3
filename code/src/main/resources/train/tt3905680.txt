Our Land
###BREAK###
Our Land is about four people from different faith backgrounds who find common ground in pursuing forgiveness in the midst of conflict. As peace talks in Israel and Palestine continue to fail, and the situation only worsens, many people resort to apathy, fear, or harmful resistance. The region seems hopeless, but a closer look reveals otherwise. Our Land tells the story of four individuals living in Israel and Palestine, and how the deeply rooted pain of the conflict has affected their lives. The film reveals the hope these four individuals refuse to give up. Each goes against society by choosing another way - to love and forgive their neighbor. It's not easy, but they're determined to make small steps toward restoration.

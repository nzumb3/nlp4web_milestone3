Lila has been away from her home in Brussels for three months. Upon her return, she will meet three men who share a common thread and will each leave their own mark during extraordinary times in Lila's life. Whilst traveling by bus to the city, Lila encounters an old Iranian acquaintance who studied in her hometown decades earlier; a man she was once romantically involved with; and a confrontation with a young Eurocrat who knocks her from her bicycle.

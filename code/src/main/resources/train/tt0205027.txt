Swedish Beauty
###BREAK###
The year is 1964 and it's summer in a little rural village in Dalarna, Sweden. The two friends Anders and Börje rides around with their mopeds, waiting for something to happen. Then suddenly from out of nowhere a girl gets off the bus in a short yellow skirt. It's Sofia - a plain copy of Brigitte Bardot. It's like if Anders and Börje have been blinded by the sun. They're both obssessed by sex and slowly starts to figure out how to see Sofia naked. Soon they get a brilliant idea... Why not make a movie and let Sofia have the leading role. Everything doesn't fall right into place, but this is the beginning of a summer with incidents and secrets that the boys even in their wildest dreams never could have believed.

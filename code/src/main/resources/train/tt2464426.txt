Rebels: James Meredith and the Integration of Ole Miss
###BREAK###
On October 1, 1962 James Meredith became the first black student enrolled at the University of Mississippi. His journey to Ole Miss began with the state of Mississippi's denial and open defiance of the federal court's mandate of his admission. It ended on the night of September 30th as thousands of armed protesters rioted against the U.S. Marshals, Mississippi National Guard, and U.S. troops sent by President Kennedy. This is the incredible true story of one man's mission for equality and a state that would do everything in its power to stop him.

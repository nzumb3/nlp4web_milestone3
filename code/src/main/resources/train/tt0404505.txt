Tom's Wife
###BREAK###
Using a then proto-type lens that would later revolutionize digital video's ability to have a true filmic quality, Tom's Wife was a monumental achievement in micro-budget cinema. An authentically period drama shot on practical sets in Elgin, Texas, using meticulously selected antique props and costumes, carefully researched colloquial dialogue, and a cast of talented unknowns, Tom's Wife was called "a sincere and austere feature that vividly convey period flavor," by Variety Magazine. The filmmakers diligently crafted a quiet and honest Depression era story of a young woman trapped in an abusive marriage who finds grace in the friendship of her neighbor, and hope in the love of a traveling salesman. Garnering awards at festivals all over the world, Tom's Wife offers a glimpse into the scope of truly independent cinema and will be a joy to watch for anyone looking for a story with heart and dignity.

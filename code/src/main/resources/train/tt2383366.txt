Hardwater
###BREAK###
Hardwater is a feature-length documentary exploring the quirky, oft-understood Maine ice fishing culture. 77-year-old Mainer Bob Foster travels nearly three hundred miles north to the border of Canada, to chase trophy landlocked salmon, the fish he used to catch just miles from his central Maine home. His stories act as reflections on ice fishing's rich history and serve as connections to contemporary fishermen, environmental issues, and an exploration of Maine's rich, diverse winter tradition. Filmed on location in 11 counties over the course of three winters, Hardwater is a funny, moving, and first of it's kind documentary.

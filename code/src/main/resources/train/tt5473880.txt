Terra Mia Terra Nostra
###BREAK###
"Terra Mia Terra Nostra" is more than a family movie. Through the life of characters we first met 14 years ago, the film tackles the universal question of belonging to a particular country. It looks at the clash of languages, traditions and cultures, as well as the passage of generations that means memories are lost to an imaginary Italy. Today's life is elsewhere. The sense of double belonging and of dual nationality is transposed into a constant search for meaning. Where can one find balance? How can one define oneself?

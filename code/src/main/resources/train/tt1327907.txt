34th & Park
###BREAK###
In this creative documentary, 34th & PARK, the filmmaker, a young professor of film at the School of Visual Arts, explores what our reactions to the homeless are by impersonating a beggar, while using hidden cameras, on the streets of modern New York. He has encounters with real people as he tries to bum some change in various stages of disarray and destitution. The filming starts to affect him, however, and in the days that follow, he starts to believe he is actually homeless. As he delves deeper into the psyche of the city's street people and broods on the world's current interrelated problems contributing to their and his own destruction, his mind starts to deteriorate. The audience starts to wonder if he really has become homeless or if he's gone too insane to know for himself. On the way he learns there is always someone hungrier.

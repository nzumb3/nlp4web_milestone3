Songs of the Blue Hills

Contrary to the general misconception even within India, the Nagas are not a single tribe. Rather, they comprise a range of ethnic communities spread across several states of Northeastern India and also Northwestern Myanmar. Like ethnic communities the world over, folk music and dances form the core of Naga culture, but what makes it even more important ethnographically is the fact that the Naga folk traditions also comprise the tradition of oral history-keeping. Naga folk songs, thus, could be like any other folk song, and also could be an historical account of an important incident from the past. This feature-length documentary is the first-ever film to present such a wide range of Naga music - and musicians - together.

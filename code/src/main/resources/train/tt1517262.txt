Tokyo Taxi
###BREAK###
Korea and Japan, so close in proximity yet so distant culturally-so much so that they must converse with each other in English that doesn't go beyond the polite "Hellos" and "How are yous." Taking advantage of the favorable exchange rate of the yen, many Japanese tourists visit Korea. "Tokyo Taxi" is a story about two souls who visit Korea to realize that people aren't that much different. A four-member Japanese rock band has a concert date in Seoul. But RYO, the lead singer, is deathly afraid of planes. To appease his bandmates, Ryo agrees to take a water taxi from Tokyo to Seoul, leaving behind his ramen noodle shop where one particular female customer comes to eat every week. Yamada, a water taxi driver, was on the verge of running away from his home when he encounters an unlikely passenger in Ryo. Yamada who lives by the motto of "The customer is king" decides to ferry Ryo to Korea. When Yamada and Ryo cross the sea and dock in Busan, they are met with great fanfare. As Ryo, a perpetual loner, and Yamada, who regrets abandoning his wife back in Japan, journey across Korea, they must rely on each other, and, in the process, discover.

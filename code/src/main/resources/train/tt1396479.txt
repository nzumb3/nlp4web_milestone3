I Love Dries
###BREAK###
The famous Dutch singer Dries Roelvink is abducted after a gig in a local discotheque. He ends up in a mobile home right in the middle of nowhere amongst two of his biggest "fans": Freek and Teuntje. They are a friendly but unattractive couple who are missing one major thing in their lonely lives: a child of their own. But regrettably, they both can't have any children. Meanwhile Freek and Teuntje are trying to let their Idol feel comfortable in their mobile home and gradually it becomes clear to him why he has been taken there.

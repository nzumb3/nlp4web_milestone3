Sing*ularity
###BREAK###
SING*ularity is a fast-paced, intense and surprisingly funny look at the new wave of opera training in America as practiced by Ann Baltz's world-famous OperaWorks summer program, where thirty carefully selected singers gather for four weeks of irreverent, cutting-edge instruction. In subjects ranging from Yoga and Grotowski-based movement and acting techniques to visualization and operatic improvisation, the dedicated OperaWorks faculty lead their students on an incredible journey of self-discovery and technical refinement free from the harsh and damaging assaults of traditional vocal training. Filmed over the course of a year from the summer of 2006 through 2007, SING*ularity reveals OperaWorks the program as a microcosm of cooperative human endeavor in which highly ambitious singers work together for the greater glory of their art. With dozens of stunning musical performances and a winning cast of hip, gifted and immensely talented performers, SING*ularity is at turns seductive, inspirational, and funny.

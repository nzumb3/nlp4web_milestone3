The Inkerman Rockets
###BREAK###
The Inkerman Rockets Documentary is the story of a 1940's & 50's rag tag group of farm boys who went from playing shinny on the river in the center of their small eastern Ontario town to facing off against Jean Beliveau and the Quebec Citadels in the semi-finals of the Memorial Cup playoffs in 1951. The team was formed by their mild-mannered school teacher and coach Lloyd LaPorte, who treated his players with kindness and respect and in response they beat teams they never should have beaten. The Rockets are recognized in the Hockey Hall of Fame in Toronto. Notable Rockets include Leo Boivin (NHL), Floyd Smith (NHL) and narrator Brian McFarlane (Hockey Night in Canada commentator). Also appearing: Dickie Moore (NHL) and Don Cherry.

Mädchenflügel
###BREAK###
During an international youth exchange for young dancers in Israel, the lives of two young women convene: Chiba 17, from Sheik Dan noon, a Muslim village located in Israel, meets Laura 18, from Berlin. Girls Wings searches for moments of freedom and finds them: when the young girls float across the dance floor, when they stand together under a waterfall, or when the complexities of the world bring forth tears. That the two girls are united by a strong spiritual rapport quickly becomes apparent. Day to day Laura feels herself both more at home and familiar as she gets to know Chiba's family, while Chiba opens herself to Laura more and more and even shares some unpleasant secrets.

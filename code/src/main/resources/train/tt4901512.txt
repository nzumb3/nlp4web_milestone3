The Road of the Souls
###BREAK###
With the soul travels a common language. Music is its guardian and its messenger. The Road of the Souls is a music documentary that explores an ancestral musical pathway from Persia to Patagonia, tracing the cultural and spiritual journey of Ibero-American music. Beyond political or religious beliefs; beyond words and cultural norms, music is a shared, universal language that carries a message celebrating human creativity and diversity. This music documentary captures the creative process of its director and composer, Pavel Urkiza, and over 85 artists. They share, through their words and music, the experience of traveling along the Road of the Souls. Urkiza's original soundtrack is a moving masterpiece that serves as a soundscape through which he himself travels as a musician on a journey to connect and express his deepest self. Along his way he records and interviews a wide array of musicians who share a common historical context: the Ibero-American region. Urkiza masterfully weaves the threads of their distinct musical traditions into thirteen original pieces. Together they create a harmonious textile that reveals the soulful connection of the whole. And through interviews with the same artists, the film reveals ancestral ties that extend through music, across generations, and carry us towards a future where differences create harmony, rather than strife.

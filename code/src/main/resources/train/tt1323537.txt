Rehearsal
###BREAK###
Eight actors have been cast in 'Bloody Summer,' a typical schlock horror movie, with low-budget to match. But there's a twist: A week 'on set' at an isolated cabin in the mountains will start the production. One van will take the actors, the producer and the director from the safety of San Francisco to a run down den in La Honda, California. But when people begin to disappear, starting with the van's driver, those left begin to realize they may have auditioned for more than they bargained for.

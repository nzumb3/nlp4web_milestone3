Help! and Redemption
###BREAK###
In 2007 filmmaker Digby Rumsey was diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, the prognosis looked grim and a cure improbable. After a course of radical treatment, he takes the doctors' advice: 'If there's anything you want to do, we suggest you do it now' and he heads off to Central and South America. HELP! and REDEMPTION follows the painful journey through diagnosis, treatment and heartbreak... Three 'Wonders of the World' later, he and the viewer have witnessed some truly breath-taking vistas...but the big question remains...has he got Redemption?

Leap of Faith
###BREAK###
Four American families struggle with a life-altering decision to abandon their childhood Christian faith for conversion to Orthodox Judaism. A young woman from Trinidad, a family who leaves their dream home in the remote mountains of Colorado, a career Army woman and single mother, and an elderly couple. Each finally finds the faith for which they've long searched. Filmed over a three-year period, Leap of Faith is the rare documentary to chronicle not only the deeply emotional process of religious conversion, but also its effects on children and extended families.

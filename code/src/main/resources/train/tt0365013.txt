Boricua
###BREAK###
Slice of life in a Chicago neighborhood of Puerto Ricans, or boricuas. Tata wants to win a beauty pageant, Germ√°n wants to succeed in real estate: both have few scruples. Lola is a college student who may get involved with Willy, a macho drug dealer. Violence simmers close to the surface. Family honor, saving face, unscrupulous choices, the longing for love, and a baseball autographed by Roberto Clemente figure in how events play out.

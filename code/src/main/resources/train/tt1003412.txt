BRITTOWN - a motorcycle documentary featuring Meatball from the Hell On Wheels bike shop in Anaheim, California. As a master mechanic, vintage Brit bike connoisseur and dirt-track racer, Meatball splits his time between family, his shop and his rock band Smiling Face Down. Brittown joins Meatball for several months as he heads to races, plays gigs and uses all his skill to turn an old 650 Triumph Bonneville motor into a 130 mph road-ready screamer.

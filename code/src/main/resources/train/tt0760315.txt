Living with Uncle Ray
###BREAK###
Ray Hewitt, a shell-shocked Vietnam Veteran, returns home to find piece of mind when he instead finds himself on another battlefield, the family living room. Although Ray's only solace comes from the 24 hour News Channel, Ray's niece and nephews decide to stand their ground when it comes to their after school programming. Adding to Ray's frustrations are the loud and obnoxious neighbors (the Humphries family) led by their patriarch, Manny, his dim witted son, Jimmy, and their pet rooster. When Ray's two long lost sons from Vietnam show up, Ray has had just about all he can handle. While the forces of small town USA ignite Ray's old trauma and threaten to push him over the edge, the strain of Ray's visit may be just what both families need to realize the importance of one another.

###BREAK###
Alison sets off to Fiji in search of a lost island said to have some of the last firewalkers on earth. She soon finds herself on a wild adventure with the island's Chief, deep into the intense Fijian past: to a time of tribal wars, cannibals, and spiritual consequences for breaking traditions. As her virtue is gauged by as series of tests placed upon her by the villagers, along the way Alison learns the importance of family, living off the land, and stumbles upon the secret to happiness.

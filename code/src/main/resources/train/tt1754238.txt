The Music of Our Future
###BREAK###
Claude-Samuel Levine (aka Samy) is a Theremin-player who has chosen to live as an artist. But this very talented musician is unable to reach an audience. Neither his eccentric style nor his unique instruments seem to attract the public's attention. After several self-produced albums and once playing live with Radiohead, Samy still only sells 10 CDs a year over the Internet. At age 43, Samy lives with his mom. He splits his time between performing in a local Mexican restaurant, taking walks in the French countryside, and composing music for the planets in his bedroom. In spite of his continual setbacks and his moments of doubt, Samy has never given up.

Saxon
###BREAK###
Soon after leaving prison, EDDIE has his eye cut out by a loan shark chasing an old debt. Eddie's other eye will only be spared upon repayment. Desperate for cash, Eddie phones LINDA, a childhood sweetheart. She lives in Saxon - a nightmare sprawl of boarded-up and crumbling flats run by a corrupt council. But Linda is very wealthy. Her husband won a million pounds on a TV quiz show. She draws Eddie back to Saxon: the place where he grew up; the place where his mother works as a prostitute; the place where he murdered a bailiff. When Eddie arrives, Linda offers him a reward to find her missing husband whom she fears dead. Eddie turns amateur investigator and so embarks on a comically gruesome journey through a surreal underworld.

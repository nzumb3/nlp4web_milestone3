Where the Sky Meets the Trees
###BREAK###
What happens when seventeen former prisoners and homeless vets move from a world of drugs, guns, and homelessness into a world of art, theater, and Buddhism? This short documentary film shows what happens to three members of this group of men and women when the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts tried a five-month experiment that included a support team of social workers, arts professionals, and a theater director. In the process they explore modern and Buddha art, perform in front of an audience, and gain insight into their own lives in a way they never could have predicted.

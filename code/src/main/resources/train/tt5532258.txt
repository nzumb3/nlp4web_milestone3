24 Heures sur place
###BREAK###
Forty years after Louis Malle's documentary Place de la RÃ©publique, and a year after the recent renovation work, this is what happens in this famous corner of Paris during the span of an entire day. Twenty-four hours of people passing by in this intersection of bodies, sounds, vehicles, and car horns. The statue of "Marianne" offers an exceptional view of the square and how light changes it as the hours go by, casting new shadows and crafting new atmospheres.

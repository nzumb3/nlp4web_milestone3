Four Fifteen
###BREAK###
They were neighbors at birth, friends at 8, and from then on inseparable. All grown up now, Matt, Brian, and Cara haven't missed a beat with their friendship. Corporate life, with a desire for the finer things, keeps Brian in grand pursuit and simultaneously exposes an ever-growing Archilles Heel. While Cara enjoys a comfortable grasp on her life, she's confronted with a realization that's remained hidden for twenty years. Weighed by the strengths of his best friend Brian, and entertained by the childhood antics of his best friend Cara, Matt continues to take life in stride and seek that which consistently remains a mile from his finger tips...or does it? Childhood friendships blossom into adult romance, rivalries, striving and struggle. For Mathew, Brian and Cara, life will steer its own path into a frantic race for redemption, love and money, with good versus apathy playing out in terrifying brilliance.

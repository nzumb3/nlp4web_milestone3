The Paladins
###BREAK###
The Paladins chronicles the success of six companies in the United States and the United Kingdom. While the individual businesses may be very different, they share one notable trait, the organizations each had a champion, a Paladin, who inspired the change which elevated the business to another level, allowing them to flourish in these trying economic times. "With The Paladins, we wanted to put a face on corporate success," said Dena Hysell, writer and director of the film. "As we explored the story behind each of these businesses, it was clear that there was always an individual who was the catalyst for change. We wanted to tell that story and show how strong organizations embrace change by encouraging innovation.'

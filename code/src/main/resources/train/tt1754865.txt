Weddings and Diapers
###BREAK###
In this touching and humorous documentary, four Kosovar couples share how they deal with chores, child raising, freedoms and infidelity. How have roles changed and what are the limits to modernity in the sacred union of marriage? From milking the cow to a lesson in diaper changing, watching home wedding videos to the birth of a new baby, and a unique look at the disappearing tradition of polygamy. It's all a part of the intimate ride we call love (and everything that comes with it) in Weddings and Diapers.

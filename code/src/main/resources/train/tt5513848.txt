Young college graduate Lisa Bentini gets her first job as a substitute teacher at a middle school in Bologna. In Naples, professor Silvana De Fazio prepares her last class for their final examinations before she retires. Professor Dario Tulipano, a pro-tempore teacher from Palermo, moves to Bolzano for a one-year substitute teaching job. Three different experiences that illustrate the world of schools from the professors' point of view: expectations and satisfactions, vocations and frustrations, passion and confusion.

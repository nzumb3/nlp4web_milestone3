The Red Envelope
###BREAK###
It is an August Friday at 4am in the Bleeker Street loft of Josh Reese. Josh, a twenty five year old lawyer in Manhattan New York, who is attempting to deal with his secret, and overwhelming, infatuation with one of his friends, sits on his couch, slightly intoxicated, and watches out of the corner of his eye as one of his oldest friends dances erotically with the unaware love of his life. The Red Envelope is a twisty, passionate, and erotic coming of age story of a young mans attempt to come to grips with his first real experience with his feelings of real love.

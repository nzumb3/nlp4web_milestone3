The Deadly Ponies Gang
###BREAK###
A docu-comedy about friendship and the lengths people go to for their mates. Meet Clint and Dwayne- The extremely quotable members of the two-member Deadly ponies Gang who trawl the edges of rural New Zealand on their pimped-out rides (i.e.. ponies decorated with glitter, beads and sunglasses). Not short of a suave move with the ladies, Clint worries that Dwayne's not pulling the way he once did- most likely because he has no teeth! So Dwayne organises a gig to fundraise for a new set, the 'Help my mate Dwayne get some teeth Fundraising gig'. Along with some drug deals to supplement their income, the pair go in search of a life of hustling, riding and partying.

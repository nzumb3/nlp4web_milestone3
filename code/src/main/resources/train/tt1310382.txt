Lunicidal
###BREAK###
John Good is a kinder, gentler serial killer with a heart of gold. "Lunicidal" follows his exploits as he learns he has to contend with a new kid on the block - a slashing demon from Hell. This new nuisance from the pits of Hades has no concern for the community and is a bit of a litterbug as he drops evidence such as slaughtered teen body parts all over town; something John Good would never do. John Good seeks to right these wrongs and go to war against this untidy culprit. There are standards that need to be protected in the community and John means to uphold them, going to battle, monster to monster.

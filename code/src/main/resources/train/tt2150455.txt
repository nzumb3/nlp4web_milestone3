Shattered Hopes: The True Story of the Amityville Murders - Part II: Mob, Mayhem, Murder
###BREAK###
On a crisp autumn night in 1974, Ronald "Butch" DeFeo Jr. murdered his entire family with a high powered rifle as they slept. Or did he? This second installment of the Shattered Hopes documentary trilogy picks up where Part I left off. From the opening minute, the DeFeo family has been slaughtered and everyone scrambles to respond to the scene....the details are sketchy at best, and the only thing that is known is that the surviving eldest son, Butch, is the sole survivor of the massacre. Butch is taken into "protective custody" and from here the story takes on a life of its own. Butch is ultimately arrested and charged with the crime, and Shattered's Part II, "Mob, Mayhem...Murder" takes a very close look at went down on the night of the murders while exploring, in intricate detail, the police investigation and subsequent prosecution through the Suffolk County, New York court system.

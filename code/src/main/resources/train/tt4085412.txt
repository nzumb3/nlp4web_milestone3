Life Is Not a Musical: The Musical
###BREAK###
Tom a young adult who is going through a rough time. He's just gotten divorced from his wife Brooke (Jillian Lawson) and has lost his job. The two are so distant from each other at this point its hard to believe they ever liked each other let alone loved one another. Tom's friends (Craig Knepley and Jeffrey Thompson) are about as useful as a plastic spork at a steak dinner. It seems the only one in the world who actually somewhat cares about him is his lawyer Carson (Clayton Snyder) and it could be argued he just wants to win the case and doesn't care much about Tom as a person. Tom is forced to become a handyman for a local theater group where he works with the beyond bizarre Grover (Seth Allison). Eventually, as these musicals go Tom falls for a beautiful woman named Claire (Allegra Edwards). But there is competition from the snakey Adrian (Zach Garrett) , and before you know it BOOM you've got a musical.

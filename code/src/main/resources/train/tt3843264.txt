Broken Record
###BREAK###
Broken Record is a poetic journey through Iraq in search of an Iraqi/Turkman song, which the filmmaker Parine Jaddo's mother used to sing, and recorded with her brothers in 1960. Though she knows the melody, she no longer remembers the lyrics and her curiosity takes her around the country in search of it, giving rare insight to Iraq's rich musical culture and heritage, much of which has been burnt and lost.

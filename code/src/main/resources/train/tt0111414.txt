A Thin Life
###BREAK###
A lonely man on the run is trapped inside a house. He reflects on the mistakes in his life as he awaits his certain end. Paranoia has driven him to distrust everything, including himself. As he toys with his history and rewrites aspects that he didn't want to own up to, those that mean to do him harm slowly close-in. Or do they? Is it really himself that he is afraid of and everybody else has long forgotten him and moved on?

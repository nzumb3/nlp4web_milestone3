The Blue Generation
###BREAK###
Slank is a legendary rock band on the Indonesian scene, known for their politicized lyrics and activism, and for its fanatical fan base - known as "Slankers" - who see the band as something to coalesce around to promote peace and unity in their country. 'The Blue Generation' uniquely combines dance sequences, footage of live performances, interviews, and animations about Indonesia's political history in a gloriously energetic and inspiring manner.

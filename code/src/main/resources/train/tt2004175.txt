Blood Rites
###BREAK###
Heavily influenced by Giallo, Blood Rites is a macabre mystery of murder, drug use and the occult. When the drug deal goes bad and Jason disappears, Nikki is trapped on an upper floor of the warehouse with a vicious ex-military enforcer, a gunshot victim, a violent addict and his three hostages. All the exits have been blocked and somewhere in the darkness is something with a taste for blood and a love of pain. A great demon demands to be born and its faithful servant has planned a bizarre blood rite that will leave no vein untapped. Blood will flow. Hell is coming.

Experts say to make certain young people truly grasp concepts from lessons they have been taught about conservation and their environment, one must get them out into it for at least five days... no cell phones, no electronic gadgets, nothing but the splendor Mother Nature provides and the guidance only caring instructors can give. So that's what the Colorado Council of Trout Unlimited has done for more than half a decade. Every summer, dozens of teenagers who have submitted attention-getting essays stating why they want to learn how to sustain their environment, and to learn how to fly-fish, are treated to nearly a week of being out in the picturesque Rocky Mountains... doing just that. Some say their lives have changed because of the experience.

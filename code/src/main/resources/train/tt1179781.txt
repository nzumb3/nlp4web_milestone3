Mission Istaanbul: Darr Ke Aagey Jeet Hai!
###BREAK###
A promising journalist Vikas Sagar (Zayed Khan) is offered a position to head a controversial news station in Istanbul by its owner Owais Husain (Sunil Shetty). With this offer comes the promise of money and many other perks that make this offer hard to refuse, especially since Vikas is currently going through a very painful divorce with his wife Anjali (Shriya Saran). After working for the channel that in turn changes his life, he decides to quit, however it is brought to his attention by a Turkish commando Rizwan Khan (Vivek Oberoi), that others who have quit had been killed for knowing too much. It becomes a battle - which will win, the sword or the pen?

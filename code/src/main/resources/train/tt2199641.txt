The Couchsurfing Film Project
###BREAK###
An modern day adventure across the USA told in a very different way. One thing is to have a plan. Another thing is to succeed with it! The film was to be about the "Couchsurfing" phenomenon. It became a film about the film. A trip from New York to L.A. where almost everything that could go wrong -went wrong!

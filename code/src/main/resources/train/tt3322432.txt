Try Freedom tells the story of La Drola (from Piedmont dialect, the weird) first rugby team, entirely made up by inmates, to be admitted to play an official championship (third category of Italian rugby league). Thirty five inmates, one coach, training five days a week and the game on Saturdays. First steps aren't easy. The team is not there, everyone plays for himself and they hardly understand rules. But as time goes by locked up between an heavy past and uncertain future, teammates tell their story, they slowly bond together in and outside the field. Their performance improves as well. In spring time first wins. Life in jail starts flowing smoothly, and with it hope. Legs running toward a Try and the biggest is freedom.

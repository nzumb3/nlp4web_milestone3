The Horror of Barnes Folly
###BREAK###
When a misunderstood MONSTER stumbles into the small backwoods hillbilly town of BARNES FOLLY, it is up to DEPUTY JOHNSON (Gorbos), an inept, newly transplanted cop from the big city, to ease the terrified town and bring the Monster to justice. He forms a mismatch posse, including his slightly psychic girlfriend (Bell), the town's only doctor (Muhammed), an odd woodsman (Gubbins), and Jeff, the hillbilliest of all hillbillies (Rodrick), to catch the horrible, horrific, horrifying Monster.

Thundersky
###BREAK###
A film celebrating the life and art of Raymond Thunder-Sky. "Thundersky" documents Raymond's life and influence through interviews with artists, co-workers, construction workers, and fans who knew him. The cumulative effect is a portrait not just of Raymond as a man or artist, but as a cultural and spiritual figure who through the persistence of his art-making and brave exploration of his own aesthetic universe, and through the persistence of those his life touched, became a touchstone for what it means to be creative and alive.

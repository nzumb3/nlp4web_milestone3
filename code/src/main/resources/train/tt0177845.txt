Hotel Splendide
###BREAK###
The Hotel Splendide is on a remote and cold island, accessible only by a once-a-month ferry. It's a dark and dreary spa created by the late Dame Blanche, whose grown children now run the hotel according to her specificiations, serving up ghastly seaweed and fish-based food and enema treatments. Kath, once the sous chef, arrives when she receives an anonymous letter telling her of the matriarch's death. Will she bring light into the place with her wonderful cooking?

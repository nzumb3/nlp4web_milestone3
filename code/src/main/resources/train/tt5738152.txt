Stronger
###BREAK###
Master Sergeant Victor Raphael is nearing the end of his military career when an explosion in Afghanistan leaves him injured. Back home, he is thrust into battle once again, but he hasn't been trained for this type of warfare. Physical rehabilitation is painful, and he has more to overcome than his physical injuries. His wife, Michelle, is distant, and their marriage seems to be held together only by her sense of duty. Vic's first response is isolation, but that becomes a dead end. Feeling hopeless and alone, he is introduced to something new and uncomfortable- meeting in community with others who have faced trauma. People who endured and survived some terrible things, with the scars to prove it, are brought into his life. It is easy to see that these unlikely heroes now live with a hope and purpose far beyond this life. Somehow, their trials have made them STRONGER.

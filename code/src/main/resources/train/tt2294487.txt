Asian Delight
###BREAK###
Ferry Bertholet has a fascination for the Far East. Over the past 30 years he was specialized in collecting Chinese erotic art, which is no longer to be found in China itself, where it has been banned and destroyed. As a result, Bertholet now owns a big part of this cultural heritage. His collection is one of the largest in the world. It has also dominated his life: day and night, all he thinks about is his collection. At odds with this is the realization that his collection is basically just things. This is why he is now contemplating the idea of selling everything. If all goes well, this cultural heritage will return to its country of origin. Will it be a regret or a relief?

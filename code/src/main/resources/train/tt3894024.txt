Donkeys and Disillusionment
###BREAK###
Donkeys and Disillusionment visualizes the life stories of five pilgrims and a donkey over a six year period. A man leaves the city to walk the Camino de Santiago with a donkey. As he travels the ancient pilgrimage route, he crosses paths with a number of like-minded travelers from different countries and struggles with a stubborn donkey. Each pilgrim is in search of something more, and their similar and contrasting stories are revealed. The film charts the physiological and social changes in these characters as they undertake the physically and mentally grueling journey across Europe. Six years later, the same characters are interviewed in their hometowns and we discover whether or not the pilgrimage was a catalyst for change in their lives.

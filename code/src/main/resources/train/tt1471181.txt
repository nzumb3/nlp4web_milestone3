Man Zou: Beijing to Shanghai
###BREAK###
Four Americans friends and their Chinese guide set out in the fall of 2008 traveling by bicycle between China's two largest cities to learn more about the people, culture and the rapidly changing environment in which they live. Filmed at a historic time for China, with Beijing basking in the afterglow of the Olympics and the country emerging as an economic superpower, they capture an intimate and unfiltered look at parts of China that are typically flown over. MAN ZOU makes us all look at how we relate to the people, culture, and the country of China.

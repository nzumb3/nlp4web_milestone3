Donkey Love
###BREAK###
A documentary that introduces the unknown tradition of some people in rural areas of the Colombian Caribbean coast having sex and falling in love with donkeys. It starts off as a rite of passage ritual that fathers initiate with their sons and is carried on into their adulthood where men often end-up cheating on their wives with donkeys. There is belief among some people that boys should practice having sex with donkeys to prepare themselves for women, that it makes their penises bigger and also that it prevents them from becoming homosexuals.

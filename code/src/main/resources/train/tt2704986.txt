A Question of Perspective
###BREAK###
The Comando Vermelho (CV), an organized drug gang in Rio de Janeiro, has pervaded the lives of many since its emergence in the 70s. Francisco Freire and Michel Misse dispel the myth surrounding the beginnings of the CV. But how do the violent and territorialized drug wars affect the residents of Rio's favelas today, and what is their perspective of the CV in their life? We follow the brothers Leandro and Francisco to gain a glimpse of the reality of living under the constant threat of drug violence. Felipe, a member of the CV, tells us a whole new side of the story. And the Pacifying Police Unit officer Marcos gives an optimistic insight into Rio's present and future.

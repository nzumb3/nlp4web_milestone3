The Bishop
###BREAK###
"This is a story about urban life, struggles of faith, incarceration and salvation. A teenage Billy Jr. abandons his Christian roots; leaves his church affiliation and forfeits High School. A 1970's crime family is lead by its principal teacher, Fast, diligently looking for a young protégé to learn the ropes. Bayview San Francisco city life is full of pimps, hustlers and rival dope dealers headed towards an explosion of crack cocaine in the 1980's. Based on a true story, The Bishop emerges as a testimony of triumph over sin."

D'Curse
###BREAK###
NYPD cop Ruda, a cop during the day and a religious Santerio (High Ranking Priest) of "Black Magic" by night. One day a cop named James shoots and kills a son of a high priest in Santeria and Officer James plans to say the man did have a gun when he actually didn't. Being that it was a lie and the man that was killed had a mother and a brother that were High Preists in Santeria, they placed a Curse on the cop and everyone that's involved in the case that were testifying on the behalf of the cop that shot the man. Now a curse was placed and bad things started to happen to the cops. Now the NYPD needs Ruda's help to break the curse.

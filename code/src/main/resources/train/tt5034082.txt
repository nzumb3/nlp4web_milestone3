The Girl in the Cornfield
###BREAK###
Best friends Heather and Corrine are on their way home around midnight with Heather's little sister Tiffany in the backseat. When Heather begins to fall asleep at the wheel she doesn't see a woman in a white dress stumbling onto the road until it's too late. After a vicious impact, they exit the car to help but the woman has vanished, leaving behind a trail of blood that disappears deep in the cornfield. Unable to find her, Heather and Corrine decide to report it to the police and return home. That night both of them are terrorized in their homes by an unseen and seemingly supernatural intruder. They realize that someone or something has followed them and its intentions are far more horrific than they could've ever imagined.

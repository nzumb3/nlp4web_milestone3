The Creep Behind the Camera
###BREAK###
At first watch most viewers find many of the sequences in The Creeping Terror so unbelievably awful and ineptly executed that the movie transcends the sci-fi and horror genres and delves into the realm of comedy. But the story behind the film contains all of the elements of classic movie-making that director Art Nelson would have killed to have in The Creeping Terror. It's the sci-fi Ed Wood told by the actual people who helped bring The Creeping Terror to life, recounting the desperate tales of Art Nelson by those who knew him best. There are rather elegantly produced scenes to set up the actual, and hilarious, footage from The Creeping Terror, also included in CREEP! The real monster was behind the camera.

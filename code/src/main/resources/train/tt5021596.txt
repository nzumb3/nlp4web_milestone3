Christian Dance Music Videos: Part 3
###BREAK###
This is the last and final part of Christian Dance Music Videos volumes/series. This feature contains different editions of music videos made in the remainder of 2014 and then non-stop productions in 2015 till August of 2015. The series features the main song 'Kobra' , the black hooded man sending messages to the Anti-Christ that the event is near the prophecy to be fulfilled of the parade of the anti-christ soon to come and the 2nd coming of Jesus will defeat the anti-christ. The trance club house remix is a dedication to the year 2014 as it was produced then with real life rituals of calling the dead and then continuing into 2015. The last 2 music videos then divert a bit from the main video theme, they are taken from Barham Boulevard The Musical, the miracles of Jesus Christ in resurrecting the dead still come into play and effect, real communication with the deceased is established with the blessings of Christ, Elisha, Elijah and Peter. Some unaffected raw clips are ritualistic dances done to invoke forces of Christianity at 3am to battle with forces of Satan . Hitler symbolizes the Anti-Christ.

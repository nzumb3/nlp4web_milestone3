Peter, a young filmmaker, uses his camera to transform the banality of his Wisconsin hometown into art. Distant from his family and environment, Peter isolates himself in an aesthetic realm, one in which filmmaking grants him control, a control that reduces, simplifies, and purifies. Joining him on a documentary project, Vera - the daughter of a prominent local businessman - attempts to become the star of his cinematic and romantic universes. However, when Vera vanishes unexpectedly, Peter's creative detachment quickly gives way to deepening obsession, intensified by his fascination with a bit of scandalously suggestive footage. As Peter struggles to separate filmic fiction from reality, he uncovers a troubling explanation for Vera's disappearance . . . one that puts him on dangerous ground. Driven by loneliness and desire, Peter ignores warnings and threats - both well-meaning and sinister - on a mission to solve his own narrative. Whether daring or delusional, Peter's investigate impulse traps him in a mystery he unfortunately can't edit his way out of.

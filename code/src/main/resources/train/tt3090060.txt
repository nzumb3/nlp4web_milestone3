Breath
###BREAK###
Breath is a creative documentary about human existence and the mysteries of life and death, seen in the everyday life of a small village in the middle of nowhere, in the countryside of Brazil, where families have lived for years, almost completely isolated from contact with the outside world. Wind, dust, mountains, silence and time... Man and nature live together there in both harmony and conflict, amidst what is and what could be, in the vastness of a landscape grander than vision can grasp.

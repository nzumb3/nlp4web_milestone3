Jo joko
###BREAK###
The lives of hunter-gatherers, or you could say their ways of eating. They hunt what they can from surrounding nature, and then share for eating. In the tropical rain forest in Cameroon, the ethnic group called the Baka continues their traditional culture. In their language, they call food as 'jo', and good as 'joko' whatever the degree. This is an anthropological action film whose sole purpose is to simply record the mealtimes of people living in the forest.

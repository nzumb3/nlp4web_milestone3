What Is Love?
###BREAK###
We have dared to take the bull by the horns by asking the popular yet unanswered question, "What is Love?". What are past conceptions of love and how did they bring about our current understandings? How are we to love our friends? How are we to love our partner? How are we to love all of human existence? How can we apply ourselves best to meet all of our responsibilities to others while also loving ourselves? You have stumbled upon a course provided by an individual who has spent his entire life studying and attempting to practically apply love into all of his actions. Through our amazing journey we will learn, feel, and experience what it truly means to love. And after we get through all of the pain and suffering, we discover how to free education and are left with the required framework to build a utopian society.

It's the biggest starry night in the Oklahoma City art world as four troubled lives converge at one event, the annual downtown Momentum art show. It's a grand carnival here that runs a vast spectrum, an interwoven tapestry of performing dancers, electric indie bands and stunning visual art. It's all been built on the fragile shoulders of Maddy Rose, the curator of the event. Through a near death experience at the tender age of eight, Maddy has received a both a curse and a mystical blessing. Her eyes snap with knowing apprehension at the struggling lives the patrons have brought with them this cold February night. Her friend Sol is here too, an amazing Momentum artist who must deal with an ex-girlfriend who has decided to attend with her new husband. Still trapped in the wounds of the past, he must climb the mountain of a first love lost, and find his true redemption. Sol's friend Pat is here as well. He's a poet waiting on uninterested friends tonight, and he feels alone and suicidal... but will surprises from his past save him in the end? And then we have tormented Rose. Adorned with a visually stunning corset created by local artist Nicole Moan, she must shatter the memories of her youth and in the end find acceptance and love. This film has a unique vision, a dramatic carousel of lives, both fictional and actual, taking place in a very real, non-fictional context.

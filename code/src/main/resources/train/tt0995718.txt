###BREAK###
Employed in Kurla in a Multinational Call Center where he is instructed to speak with an accent, Nilesh Rastogi misses the last 1:40 AM Kalyan-bound local-train to return home to Vikhroli. Asked to leave the platform by a Hawaldar, he goes looking for an alternate place to hang out until the next train at 4:10 AM. He meets with a stranded woman, Madhu, and both find out that auto-rickshaws are on a flash strike due to a bomb blast at Ghatkopar. Their attempts to find alternate transportation are in vain, the duo then attend a bar and this is where both their lives will be turned upside down.

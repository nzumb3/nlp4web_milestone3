To Be Forever Wild
###BREAK###
In To Be Forever Wild, a crew of filmmakers, musicians and artists explore New York's Catskills Mountains, landscapes that have for centuries captured America's imagination and inspired a love of wilderness. Along the way they profile historian, hikers, scientists, cliff divers, organic farmers and others. In the film we see the power of nature to restore, reclaim and provoke our deepest emotions and connections to the world. It's a film that inspires people to reconnect with nature in their own way, wherever they happen to be.

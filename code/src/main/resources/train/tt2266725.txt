Freedom 50/50
###BREAK###
With the Ten Year Anniversary of 9/11 coming up in the next year, Max McManus, a Cyclist from Reno Nevada, felt that those tragic events were beginning to be forgotten. That's when the Freedom 50/50 was born. The idea was this; Max was to set out on a Tribute Ride in which he would ride almost 7,500 miles on his bicycle, touching all fifty states in just fifty days, ending in New York for the Tenth Anniversary of 9/11. Along the way his patriotic mission was to raise awareness and funds for the 9/11 Help America Foundation, an organization that helps our Wounded Soldiers and their families.

Dekh Bhai Dekh: Laughter Behind Darkness
###BREAK###
Seemingly naive village belle, Babli, who lives with her dad, Lala, and step-mother, conspires with her boyfriend, Shyam, to steal a Murthy of Bhagwan Shri Kishan from her estranged in-laws who had humiliated her. Shyam reluctantly agrees to assist her as he needs Rs.3 Lakhs to bribe a officer in order to find employment. They decide to involve local impoverished politician, Mayalal Yadav, who needs Rs.4 Lakhs to contribute to his political party, get a ticket to stand for elections as well as get his daughter married. They then involve an experienced alcoholic thief, Charan, to assist them. The four carry out the robbery from a Kishan Mandir and decide to travel to Delhi by the first train. They miss the train and end up in a mansion whose sole occupant is a woman named Amaa. The latter hesitantly agrees to let them sleepover for the night and even gives them something to eat. Mayalal is still hungry and wants more and asks Babli to approach Amaa - and it is this decision that will change their plans and their lives forever.

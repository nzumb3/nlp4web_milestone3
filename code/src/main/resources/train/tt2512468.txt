From Tuesday to Tuesday
###BREAK###
Despite his size, and his solid and threatening body, Juan Ben√≠tez seems to lead a life of tolerating mistreatment from others without ever unnerving and often agreeing in silence, swallowing his grief and humiliation. His boss at the factory where he works as an operator always harasses him, abusing his small power. He's undermined by the smug kids who attend the parties where he works as a bouncer for the extra money. He gets pressured, lightly but persistently, by his wife. However, he has at least one reason to swallow his pride. Juan has a dream of opening up his own gym, for which he still needs to get some of the money. And he's doing it, when one night after one of his routine days, he witnesses a terrible episode in which he makes a decision that will suddenly place him in a deadly crossroads.

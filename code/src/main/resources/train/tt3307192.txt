Ross Daly - The Circle at the Crossroads Ross Daly is one of the most outstanding protagonists of oriental music styles. Born in England in 1952, being Irish, he came under the spell of oriental modal music in the 60s in San Francisco. He travelled Central Asia and the Near and Middle East, until he was lured to the Greek island of Crete by its main instrument, the lyre. Ross Daly has now been in Greece for 24 years. Today he lives in Athens where he leads the "Lavirinthos" ("labyrinth") music workshop. A multi-instrumentalist of rare talent, he describes himself as a composer of "contemporary modal music". The particular features of modal music, its instruments, and its spiritual dimension, the clash of tradition and individuality, the island of Crete, and "Lavirinthos". These focal points of Daly's development are featured along a leitmotiv, given to the film by an old Cretan legend, namely the story of the crossroads.

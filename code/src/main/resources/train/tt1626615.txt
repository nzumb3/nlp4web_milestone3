In early 2008, after considerable debate and effort, the southern Senegalese village of Diegoune collectively decided to abandon the traditional practice of female genital cutting (FGC). But Diegoune didn't stop there. Continuing to actively promote the human rights of women and girls, Diegoune partnered with the organizations Tostan and Respect to create 'Walking the Path of Unity. The film gives voice to key players in the movement for the abandonment of FGC in and around Diegoune. From the rice fields to the central square to the local mosque, men and women explain with pride the reasons and events that led to the community's decision to abandon a traditional practice that they came to understand was threatening the well-being of their children.

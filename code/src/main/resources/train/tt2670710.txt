In July 2011, six Los Angeles firefighters bicycle 3,300 miles in 45 days across America to honor those lost on September 11Th. Staying in firehouses along the way, they battle severe weather, physical injuries, and group conflict, which causes them to question if they can actually make it to New York. They thought firefighting was tough until they embarked on 'The Ride for 9/11.' This ride raised funds for the Leary Firefighters Foundation and the Wounded Warrior Project.

Home: The Country of Illusion
###BREAK###
Lilia, a Colombian citizen, has lived in eight countries around the world. Now, at the age of 67, she grows old alone in Portugal, caring for an Alzheimer's pacient. I, filmmaker and daughter, ask Lilia if she has found home and if she will ever return to Colombia, her native country she hasn't visited for the past 40 years. 'Home' is a personal-approach documentary about loneliness and the sense of belonging.

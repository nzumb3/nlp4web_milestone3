Two Weeks
###BREAK###
A positive depiction of a young African-American fathers relationship with his family specifically, his young daughter during stressful economic times. The film is meant to showcase some of the extra efforts that are necessary for a young family to survive in 2009s economic atmosphere; both financially and personally with each other. This film is also meant to demonstrate that during this current state of economic despair, it is even more critical that families find ways to escape and get out and enjoy each others company even if its something as simple as driving to the neighborhood diner for breakfast, or turning off the television and opening up a book.

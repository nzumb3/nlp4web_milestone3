Colgate Ad boy Harsh Nagar and a fresh actor from Delhi, Shrishti Gautam, are in lead roles. The cast also includes Deepak Tijori in his first negative character. The story of 498A: The Wedding Gift centers on the theme of a widely misused provision of law in India, known as Section 498(A). Section 498a IPC was enacted to empower women and make it easier for the wife to seek redress from potential harassment by the husband's family. However, this law on dowry prohibition has come under severe criticism as this has been allegedly misused by unscrupulous women for vested interests in India and abroad. False implication in a criminal case, unjustified arrests, innocents suffering the stigma of criminals, loss of livelihood, social ostracization, and most of all a merciless attack on innocent people's dignity -- all qualify as gross violation of Human Rights. in real life, despite stipulations by United Nations, as well as Indian Government's attempt at protecting Human Rights, 3.5 million women were arrested in India in last 7 years under a law meant for protection of women themselves. Those arrested also included senior citizens, pregnant women and children.

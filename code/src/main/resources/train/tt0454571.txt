Water Street
###BREAK###
WATER STREET is a documentary exploring the fierce indie music scene in St. John's, Newfoundland. It captures, without narration, the excitement and uniqueness of this thriving musical scene. Shooting started in the summer of 2002 with a monster marathon of music spanning three long nights. Over 1000 people saw 22 bands perform 105 original songs. Characterized by diversity, the live performances crossed genres from reggae to alt country, rap, rock, punk and contemporary traditional music. This compelling story highlights 10 key members of the local music scene who tell us about the lifestyle, misconceptions about Newfoundland, success through perseverance, and the wildly diverse musical culture of downtown St. John's. Truly independent music combined with guerilla filmmaking has produced this inside look at the late-night life of rappers and rockers. Featured bands include Bareback, Trimmed Naval Beef, Mark Bragg, Eddy Stevens Band, Skank, Fergus O'Byrne, Geinus, Jenny Gear and the Whisky Kittens, Danette Eddy, Dermot O'Reilly, and The Discounts.

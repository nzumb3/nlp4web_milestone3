Gregory Frateur, Up Front
###BREAK###
Gregory Frateur, Up Front is a portrait about the young Belgian pop and jazz singer Gregory Frateur, creating his first semi-classical project Saga. Gregory is a special guy, he's more an artist than a musician, he's a self-made man and very ambitious. Sometimes called a diva. The movie is like a painting, we followed him in silence and try to show a young and ambitious person without digging into his personal life.

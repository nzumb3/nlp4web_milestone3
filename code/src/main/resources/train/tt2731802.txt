Mais Uma Canção
###BREAK###
Journey for Another Song is the portrait of a pursuit. As a photograph, it captures an artist's moments. As a movie, it spreads these images along time. Sounds, dreams, ideas, reflections from a restless musician, prepared to break up boundaries, both artistic and geographical. Bebeto Alves sets off from his roots and his cultural influences on the border between Brazil and Argentina. His search for the origins of his music takes him on an unexpected journey of discovery through Morocco, Spain and Portugal.

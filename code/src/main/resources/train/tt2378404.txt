Unforgettable Fire: The Story of a U2 Tribute Band
###BREAK###
This film explores the personal lives and challenges of the members of one of the longest running U2 tribute bands in the world. The audience sees the members morph from their daily routine into rock star doppelgangers by getting a glimpse of the band at home, jobs, and on stage mimicking one of the most established and popular bands in the world; U2. My objective is for the audience to relate their own desires to that of Unforgettable Fire's. We all have dreams but what is the true motivation behind these dreams? If it is simply to be a rock star and stand in front of an audience who loves your music then what is the difference in the destination between band and cover band?

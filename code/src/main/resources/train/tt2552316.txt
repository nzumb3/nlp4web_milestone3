Sagrada: The Mystery of Creation
###BREAK###
The Sagrada Fam√≠lia in Barcelona is a unique and fascinating building project by a brilliant, formerly controversial genius, Antoni Gaudi, with an army of workers, a history with many highs and lows and a myriad of questions raised. The biography of the edifice, which has been under construction since 1882 and is about half completed today, is the starting point for Stefan Haupt's film SAGRADA, el misteri de la creacio.

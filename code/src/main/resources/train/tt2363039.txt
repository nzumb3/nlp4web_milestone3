Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra
###BREAK###
The Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra documentary film presents a study of the Iraqi musical culture that was changing over the past years since the INSO formed early in the forties of the last century and to this day. For many years back, Iraq was never been stable, as every couple of years there were political issues, wars, military coups and other internal and regional problems. Those unstable conditions in addition to some internal society changes, affected the musical culture in Iraq during the last seven decades. The film discusses and shows how those obstacles reflected against the Iraqi National Symphony Orchestra and it's members from a perspective of the classical music genre.

In 150 years, twice marked by total destruction - a terrible earthquake in 1923, and incendiary bombings in 1945 - followed by a spectacular rebirth, Tokyo, the feudal city, has become the largest and most futuristic capital in the world in a transformation process fueled by the exceptional resilience of its inhabitants, and nourished by a unique phenomenon of cultural hybridization. Its epic story is brought back to life using exceptional colorized and restored footage.

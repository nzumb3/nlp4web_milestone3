Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy
###BREAK###
"Frank Gehry: An Architecture of Joy" is about Gehry's work of the 1990s: his breakthroughs in architecture and the extraordinary flowering of his work during this decade. It reveals Gehry's approach to his architecture through visits with him to some of his key works: The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, the primary example of his use of the Dassault computer program; the Frederick R. Weisman Museum in Minneapolis, which he designed before Bilbao and without the help of computers; the Vitra Museum at Weil am Rhein, his first European commission; the Energy Center at Bad Oeynhausen, a technical and cultural center; and finally, the DG Bank Conference Center at Berlin's historic Pariser Platz, a controversial building which Gehry himself thinks may be one of his best works, and whose construction we follow throughout the film.

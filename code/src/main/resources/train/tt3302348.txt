The Christmas Colt
###BREAK###
A father and his kids take an unexpected detour, and discover the true meaning of Christmas in this warmhearted tale for the entire family. Matt and his kids were en route to grandma's house when their car broke down in the middle of nowhere. Fortunately for them, local rancher Bonnie-Kate has a big heart, and a spare room. But lately poachers have been trespassing on Bonnie-Kate's land, and as the stranded family awaits rescue over the next few days, they agree to help protect her ranch. In the process, Matt and his children learn that it's not about what you get during the holiday season, but what you give instead.

The Golden Temple - Olympic Regeneration of East London
###BREAK###
Like filling the sea with sand. Following the process of Olympic regeneration in East London as a massive metaphor of the contemporary age. Like a kaleidoscopic blockbuster through which we are looking for a narrative discourse, hidden between a stadium, the largest mall in Europe and a small unorthodox church in an old industrial unit. There are people living around this, living into this magma, or for it indeed People with thoughts about austerity, temples and luxury, about facilities and the sense of community. We've been inside the apocalypse of capitalism, hidden behind a single finger, in this Golden Temple you can lose your way.

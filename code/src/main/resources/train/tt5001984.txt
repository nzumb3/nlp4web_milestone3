City East
###BREAK###
Split into four separate yet interconnected stories, City East follows the Grim Reaper as she seeks to fulfill a dying woman's last wish, a trio of guardian spirits fighting against the darkness, an inhuman psychopath hired to hunt down a thief on the run, and a world-weary street musician struggling with immortality. As this imaginative quartet unfolds--each one affecting the others both directly and indirectly--their individual tales weave together to form a dark, poignant fable about life, death, good, and evil.

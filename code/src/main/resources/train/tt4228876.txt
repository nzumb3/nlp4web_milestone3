Sam Klemke's Time Machine
###BREAK###
In 1977, Sam Klemke started obsessively documenting his entire life on film. Beginning decades before the modern obsession with selfies and status updates, we see Sam grow from an optimistic teen to a self-important 20-year-old, into an obese, self-loathing thirty-something and onwards into his philosophical fifties. The same year that Sam began his project, NASA launched the Voyager craft into deep space carrying the Golden Record, a portrait of humanity that would try to explain to extra terrestrials who we are. From director Matthew Bate (Shut Up Little Man! An Audio Misadventure), Sam Klemke's Time Machine follows two unique self-portraits as they travel in parallel - one hurtling through the infinity of space and the other stuck in the suburbs of Earth - in a freewheeling look at time, memory, mortality and what it means to be human.

8 Reels of Sewage
###BREAK###
On the cusp of 1970, adult film editor Belinda Brimhouse (Jacqueline Guzman) is exhausted with the ever-surmounting tasteless film reels, piling up under command of her seedy boss, Don Arrolls (Mystic Marlow). After being fired, Belinda sets out to produce a motion picture all her own, hoping to prove to business rivals like Mr. Whiteman (Art Roberts) that she has what it takes to finish a sophisticated erotic film, without all the crudity that's quickly becoming prominent in mainstream adult cinema. But the reality of the field and pressure from peers turns Belinda into a corrupt casting couch director, coupled with seemingly pointless mind games, innocent actresses like Janet (Samantha Poole) can hardly handle, but allow. How will Belinda prevail, with such an insisting palate, soured by new batches of uncooperative girls, all while a hired hit man is out to put a quick end to her, and her blossoming career? It's an untamed ride through the mishaps and brawls of a "bad" B movie production, pickled with all the trash you'd hope for; numerous negligees, greasy go-gos, playful pillow fights, starved, sex-trafficked slaves, and naughty, needle-pricking nurses! Everything's exploited! A psychological comedy compiled of piles and piles of puns that parallel real life at large. A picture destined for demeaning critical review, meant to ultimately be lost in some scum-saturated cellar, for none to view, and few to remember!

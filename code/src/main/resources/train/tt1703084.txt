Life: The Bill Macumber Story
###BREAK###
Life is the story of Bill Macumber, a man who in 1974 was living a normal life as a single father of three, a Little League coach, and an army veteran. His life was turned upside-down when his estranged wife, an employee of the Sheriff's Department with access to old case files and charges of sexual impropriety on the job hanging over her head. She told her boss that her husband had confessed to the 1962 double homicide of a young couple. A 1964 confession to two attorneys and a psychiatrist while under sodium pentathol by a man charged in a similar murder were not allowed to be heard by the jury when Bill Macumber went on trial. Is justice possible in this story of Life?

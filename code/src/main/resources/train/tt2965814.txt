The Shadow Scheme
###BREAK###
1936. Hitler is in power and the Nazis begin their expansion across an unsuspecting Europe. Stung by their lack of preparation in the build up to the First World War, the British Government knows that it cannot afford to repeat its past mistakes and turns to the automobile industry to produce the weapons of war required to stop the Nazi threat in World War Two. In this new documentary, experts and eyewitnesses reveal the history and workings of the scheme that resulted in the production of Britain's greatest war machines including the Spitfire, Lancaster, Mosquito and Halifax airplanes, and tanks such as the Churchill and Crusader. With exclusive new interviews, as well as archive footage and images from the Imperial War Museum, National Motor Museum Beaulieu, London Transport Museum and Heritage Motor Centre Gaydon, "The Shadow Scheme" also includes an extensive collection of digitized photographs, seen here for the first time, from the archives of The Coventry Transport Museum, revealing the history and people that made the Shadow Scheme a vital part of Britain's war effort. From director Dave Mitchell, "The Shadow Scheme" is the most complete documentary to date on one of the most fascinating stories from the Second World War.

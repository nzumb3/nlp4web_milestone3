The Light After the Tsunami
###BREAK###
This documentary explores the Obon custom of 'Matsuakashi,' held throughout Miyako city, located in Iwate prefecture on the eastern-most tip of Honshu. Matsuakashi is a custom where small bonfires of pine trees are ceremoniously lit in front of the entrances of homes during the evenings of August 1st, 7th, 13th -16th, 20th, and 30th. As the region has been historically ravaged by tsunamis many times in the past, there are very few historical records that remain which explain why the custom is still carried out to this day. Because Matsuakashi is held privately amongst family, its significance has not been passed down orally. Even the local elders are unaware of its origins.

Cinemensonge (Film-Lie)
###BREAK###
A story of partner relationships serves as a starting point for survey of conscience and its relation to reality, but is shot as a suicidal attack upon the faith in truthfulness of a documentary (lie is a dogma deforming reality). The love affairs of a father bringing up two daughters become a peculiar experimental verification of film theories as the screenplay was written by the author together with C.G. Jung, Epstein, Kracauer, Bal√°zs, Vertov, Bazin, Metz and Deleuze.

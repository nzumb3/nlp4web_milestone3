###BREAK###
A postman in a small Pacific Northwest town's horrifying dreams foretell a prophesy already fulfilled - now replayed in his mind - as penance for the fact that he did nothing to stop their outcome; while he stays on, still delivering the mail, long after everyone in the town is dead and gone - out of guilt and a misguided sense of duty to their memories.

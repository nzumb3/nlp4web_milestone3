One in Seven Million
###BREAK###
It's been four years since the band left home, one member quit and the other two kept going. Kevin and Chuckie find themselves in a new town, AGAIN, and are forced to work "real" jobs while pursuing their ultimate dreams of touring as a rock band. Follow them as they endure the trials and tribulations of band life. When they both develop love interests, things begin to change but not in ways you would expect. Choices will have to be made between love and money, and at what lengths they are willing to go to pursue their dreams. In their rock world, Kevin would never sell out, even if his odds were One in Seven Million.

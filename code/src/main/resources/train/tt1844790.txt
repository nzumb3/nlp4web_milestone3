The Black Dove
###BREAK###
Released after serving an 18 year sentence for a string of compounded criminal charges, country music idol Jake Williams is entering a world he has never known with one objective; finding his legendary Gibson Black Dove guitar. Along the way, Jake flirts with disaster as he falls back into his old hard-living ways until the daughter he has never known reluctantly enters his life. Her presence serves as a catalyst of change as they each learn forgiveness while Jake pursues the Black Dove and ultimately, his dream of playing music again. Jake's life becomes a taxing but rewarding journey as his dreams are gradually realized, not as he intended, but through his daughter's love and the redemptive power of the elusive Black Dove guitar.

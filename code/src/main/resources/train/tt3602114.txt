The Devil's Eyes
###BREAK###
In THE DEVIL'S EYES, a Catholic Priest, John, is kicked out from his Church for his excessive alcohol abuse and abuse of power. He attempts to get his life back together by moving to a new home, redesigning his life and becoming a greater, better man. However, as hard as he tries, the demons from his past life follow him from his old home to his new, and manifest in new forms unseen by John before. Strange occurrences plague his time spent in the new home, and the local rumors of a Priest's suicide in the home in the early 1900's don't help to soothe his consciousness. What follows is an 89-minute journey into depravity, religion, violence, death and demons. What is seen cannot be unseen!

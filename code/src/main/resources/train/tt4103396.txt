From Our Mothers' Tongues
###BREAK###
Phan Lam is 97 years old, and the Tang family matriarch. She is known to her family simply as Amah, the name given to a grandmother in her native Chinese dialect, Chiu Chau. From Our Mothers Tongues explores the space that exists between the family members, a space that is sometimes shared and other times divided. Over a 70 year period, they survived two civil wars, two unpredictable boat rides, unsympathetic state police, and overwhelming cultural challenges. Each family member had their own experiences and holds on to distinct memories, which inform the life they lead today. As the younger generation comes of age and have children of their own, they make choices about the languages and culture they choose to pass on or leave behind.

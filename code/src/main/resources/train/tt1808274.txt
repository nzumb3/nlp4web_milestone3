At the Jersey Shore
###BREAK###
Joe Lombardi -- a twenty-something man-child -- wants nothing more than to break away from his mundane suburban life and job at a local New Jersey newspaper. His editor, Mr. Simon, promises Joe a promotion to a big-time New York City paper if he writes one last, home-run article -- on the Jersey Shore dating scene. But Joe hasn't been down there since he was a kid, with his now-estranged mother; and he has a general disdain for the Jersey Shore culture. He reluctantly takes on the story and is writing about Danny, his best friend who believes that he can meet a wife in the clubs; Marc, a nerdy guy from high school who has now transformed himself into a club going, drug using, fornicator and Ashley, his boss's wild niece, who secretly aspires to a life as a fashion designer. Eventually, writing about these quirky characters opens Joe's eyes, forcing him to truly understand all that the area has to offer and making him re-evaluate his own life... and grow up.

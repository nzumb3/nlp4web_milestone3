Whenever evil surfaces, Lord Krishna will be there to destroy it. In the film, Hero plays a modern-age Krishna who fights against problems in the society."I had been to Tirupathi, Sabari Mala, Velankanni, Nagercoil recently and observed the devotees who visited the temples, Church and Mosques. Everyone came with their own share of problems. Is the problems solved by the God? This inspired me to make a film focussing on the problems of the society.

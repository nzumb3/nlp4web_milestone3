The Strike
###BREAK###
When a trio of struggling and increasingly desperate thirty-something actors -- Alberto, Molly and Richard -- discover that A-list talent agent Carlo Lombardi is taking classes at the yoga studio where Molly teaches, they concoct the perfect scheme to convince him of their talent: Lay siege to the yoga studio, tie Carlo up -- and with a gun to his head -- give the performance of their lives! A perfect plan! Now what could go wrong? 'The Strike': Just cause they have a plan, doesn't mean they've got a clue!

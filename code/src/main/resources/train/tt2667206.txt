Bukit Brown Voices
###BREAK###
Singapore's oldest cemetery is in an area known as BUKIT BROWN. In 2011, the Singapore Government announced that the construction of an 8-lane roadway cutting through the heart of the area would begin in two years. In its final year as an intact cemetery - during the grave-sweeping festival of Qing Ming - we speak to the descendants of those buried in Bukit Brown's jungled hills and witness age-old rituals passed down through generations. Through their voices, we see the cemetery, not as a place of the dead, but a site filled with memories and living heritage. Revealed too is the unexpected beauty of a Singapore that visitors rarely see - a secret garden hidden behind the gleaming towers of this Asian metropolis.

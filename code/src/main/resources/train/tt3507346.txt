Haiti Speaks
###BREAK###
Two things were lost in the frenzy of media coverage during the aftermath of the quake: historical context to the socio-political and economic status of the country and the Haitian voice. By exposing Haitian thought leaders, religious leaders, and ordinary citizens leading grassroots efforts for change, the film provides a platform for Haitians to shed the title of "Niggers Who Speak French" and reclaim their voice.

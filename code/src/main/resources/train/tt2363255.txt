People in primitive times connected through people. And then there was a time when people wrote letters to connect, and letters took long to arrive. With advancement in technology, snail mail has taken a backseat, and connecting with people is now at our fingertips. From time immemorial, lives have been connected with other lives... Kolkata is a city which is an amalgamation of primitive life and the best of the techno-savvy world. On one side you still have more than half of its population living below the poverty line, combating illiteracy, while on the other side, you have a sizeable urban population that is connected by mobile phones and computers.

Mundaka
###BREAK###
A thousand year old Basque fishing village reflects on the changes brought about by the introduction of surfing in the early 70's. Now, 30 years since the first surfers arrived, the village of Mundaka plays host to one of surfing's biggest events on the World Championship Tour. How the town people cope with the transformation of a slow-paced village into an over-crowded, hustling destination for surfers, spectators, media, and travelers exposes the fragile relationship between the town and the event.

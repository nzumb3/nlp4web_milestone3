Where does change come from? And how do you reshape the world when you're worried about food, shelter, and the water around your ankles? Close to the fire takes us to South Africa, Bangladesh, and the Pinoleville Pomo Nation in California, where three activists are working to ignite change. Farmers plant saline-tolerant seeds on land threatened by the rising sea, women run a cooperative bakery in Ivory Park, Pomos build a straw-bale insulated, sustainable home on their reservation. These three interwoven stories raise a question: are people at the margins as marginal as we think?

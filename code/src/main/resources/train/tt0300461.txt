Seven's Face
###BREAK###
A horrifying crime has been committed in Tokyo: a girl's body was found frozen in a block of ice inside a steel drum. The only lead the police are able to find is a web site calling itself "Seven's Face" that seems to know a lot about the case. Soon the information on the page changes, and a new murder victim is found matching the new details. Police detective Uchiyama finds several people who seem very suspicious, but none of them can be conclusively linked to the crimes. Who is committing these murders, and where will the next victim be found?

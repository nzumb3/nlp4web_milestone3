The tranquil haven of AL's Diner, harboring a scant collective of employees, patrons (including a hit man and his partner, a beautiful woman with a dark secret) and a devout Christian family, is thrown into chaos when a callow gang of four enters with a duffel bag of invaluable contents. After the gang's attempt to deliver the contents to the powerful and shady Maslow is derailed when one of them murders a cop inside the diner, suspicions and revelations arise among the group. While the gang struggles to keep control over the situation as more the police arrive, they quickly realize this is the least of their problems when Maslow comes to claim the contents of the bag.

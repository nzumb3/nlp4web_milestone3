The Wedding Present: Drive
###BREAK###
After an eight year hiatus, The Wedding Present reformed in 2005 to record the LP, "Take Fountain." Immediately after releasing the album, the band set out on a 16-month concert tour of Europe and North America. Thirdhand Films documented the North American leg of the tour, traveling alongside the band for eight of their tour dates and capturing the essence and intensity of the live shows. The resulting film incorporates some of the most comprehensive live footage of the band to date, as well as, interviews and candid behind-the-scenes footage.

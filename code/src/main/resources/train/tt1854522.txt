The year 1695. A young maiden by the name Johanne Nilsdotter is accused of witchcraft. Her persecutors end her life in the bottomless pits of the remote Djupkista waters in the Dunderland valley. In the years to follow, numerous horrendous events and tragedies strike the valley. More than three century's later, the young, aspiring theater director Laura arrives in the Dunderland valley. Together with an ensemble of Norways premier actors she will put up a play on the witch-processes. Inspired by true events.

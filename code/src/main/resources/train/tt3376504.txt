Mia Moolman (Tammy-Anne Fortuin) works for a Sandton events co-ordination company. The company has been commissioned by the department of Trade and Industry to do an event celebrating the most successful ad campaigns in the history of the SA advertising industry. This gala event will happen at Emperor's Palace to celebrate the success of major brands in our history. The CEO of the company, Theodore (Wynand van Vollenstee), has asked his employees to pitch ideas for the show and whoever comes up with the best idea will be awarded a promotion and a special bonus. Mia comes up with the idea to make the three guys from the old Castrol commercials, Boet, Swaer en Mogae part of the show. Her boss eventually agrees to this but she must go and find them in the Kalahari and bring them to Emperor's Palace in time for the big gala event. She finds them but encounters huge problems.

###BREAK###
Rattlesnake bites, electrocutions and how to love children- 'Everyday Awards' is an hour long journey into one of the most hilarious, tragic and entertaining communities in the world today. It began as a disgruntled walk through NYC with director Zefrey Throwell realizing that almost all of the monuments were in honor of men who had killed large groups of innocent people or who had stolen huge amounts of money from the public. Using this as a springboard to investigate what is actually worth remembering in the world, Throwell went to rural Mississippi and sought out remarkable and interesting people. 15 different touching voices that cut like a broken glass and sooth like a lover's neck, this is a must watch.

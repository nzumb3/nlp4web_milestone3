Asabiyyah: A New Social Cohesion
###BREAK###
The world has descended into chaos due to a global economic breakdown. Schools, food distribution, healthcare, gas, and means of communication are now only a memory. Democracy in the US has failed and the government has been overthrown. A new regime is hell bent on imprisoning Americans into collective work farms. In the darkness of chaos, an empirically-natured cult is gaining strength through terrorism, countless accounts of abductions and is competing with the government for power and control. If the US falls, the rest of the world may be close behind. The fate of the country, and likely the world, lies in the hands of one political idealist and two ragtag gang members. However, the government and cult are close on their heels and their safety is questionable at best.

Carnival Train
###BREAK###
From the big wheel to the dime toss, every ride and game on the James E. Strates Show travels by train along the Eastern Seaboard. The carnies who assemble and maintain the rides and man the games are often looked down upon because of their transient way of life. Carnival Train captures the magic of the midway as it comes together, town after town, and shows how carnies create a community and way of life that transcends place and time.

Armenian Echoes part one, Music is the very essence of the cultural identity of a people. In this film Hagop Goudsouzian continues his 7-month journey through Armenia in pursuit of his dream, the soul of Armenian Music. In the mini-series Armenian Echoes we touch that soul from ancient spiritual songs, through rural and urban dancers to the unsung musicians from isolated villages. In his first film on the music of Armenia, Armenian Minstrels, Hagop Goudsouzian spends a month filming renowned minstrels, featuring the Sayat-Nova Minstrel Song Ensemble. Now, in Armenian Echoes he continues his quest to capture and feel the sounds of Armenia. Part two features the Vardanyan Sisters Dance Troupe from Zolakar, highlighting the voices of Heghine Vardanyan and Ruzana Avedissyan, Maria Jelilian, a Canadian dance student at the Sofi Devoyan Cultural Center, the Choir of The Mother Cathedral of the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin with Ruben Sharbatyan conductor, Dzoragiugh's Edmon Safaryan on duduk, and the town's traditional folk group, with Khatchik Sogoyan, Gargan Hakopyan and Yura Hakopyan. The folk dancers of Dzoragiugh are also featured, as are Vanadzor's Bogdan G. Hovhannisyan, the famed singing Khatchkar maker, Prof. Alina Pahlevanyan of the Komitas State Conservatory, and Amra Daveyan, duduk soloist.

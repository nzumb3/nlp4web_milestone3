Vancouver Vagabond II
###BREAK###
Vancouver has become known on the world stage to spawn various rebel social movements. It is a city that artist and animator Heath Tait took his camera to the streets for a series of dramatic documentary Vagabond stories in the years straddling the 2010 Winter Olympics - the politics, the people, the scene. The Olympic Games were a Canadian smash, a wild party in the streets. In 2011 the Vancouver Canucks would bring about a 2nd street smash - of a different sort. Olympics, pro hockey, wacky politics, rich music and shocking spectacle - this is VVII.

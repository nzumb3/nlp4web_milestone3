Var blev ni av? (del 1:) avreglering
###BREAK###
Var blev ni av? (del 1: avreglering) is about the down-build of the former egalitarian Swedish society, once world-famous for the high and even living standard regarding ordinary people, where differences maybe were once smallest in the whole world and for which Sweden became justly famous. Have we left the Swedish model? is the main question put forward in this film. The facts speak: increased unemployment, wider economical gaps and poverty.

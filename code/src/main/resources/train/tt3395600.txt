Generosity of Eye
###BREAK###
Generosity of Eye is the surprising story of a major art collection transforming into education for African American children in the Harlem Children's Zone Inside that story are three other stories. The first is the story of the eye of a collector. Why does art collector William Louis-Dreyfus fall in love with the art -- and the artists -- he collects? The second is a story of generosity: How one man's passion for art and his passion for justice are joined in a single act of generosity. The third is the story of actress Julia Louis-Dreyfus discovering the depth of her father's passion for art, the people that this passion has brought into his life, and her search for the roots of his zeal for both art and justice. The film includes extensive conversions with Julia Louis-Dreyfus, her father art collector William Louis-Dreyfus, with several prominent contemporary artists, art critics and dealers, and with Geoffrey Canada, founder of the Harlem Children'z Zone.

The young urban indigenous and mestizo actors of Teatro Trono stir up their collective memories of the social movements that sparked the revolution that currently transforms Bolivia, creating performances for their itinerant theater-truck and the street. The group struggles to overcome their doubts about living up to their heritage... especially since they decide to manifest those who died in the massacre at the heart of the revolution. Their paralyzing fear is overcome by the most unexpected force: the spirits of the dead themselves, seeking delayed justice and creative transformation.

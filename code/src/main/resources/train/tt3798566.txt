Little Yellow Boots
###BREAK###
What do we pass on to those who come after us, for both good and for bad? And what difference can one person make in the world? These are the universal questions that occupy director John Webster in this personal cinematic letter to his great-grandchild Dorit, a little girl who will be born in the 2060's, and who's little yellow boots will walk on a very different shoreline to the one we knew. The story seamlessly weaves together past, present and future into a beautiful, moving and hopeful documentary film about the power of each of us to make a difference.

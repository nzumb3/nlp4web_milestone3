The Boys of Kingsbridge from Grammar School to Ground Zero
###BREAK###
Ten years after 9/11, the filmmaker shares the unique perspectives of his four lifelong friends, as they reveal, for the first time, their uplifting stories of survival, duty, and humanity as each of them dealt with being at Ground Zero on that fateful morning. A Bomb Squad detective, a fireman, an engineer for building 7, and an electrician give us a rare glimpse into the character of blue collar New Yorkers, faced with life and death situations. They reflect on how their sense of community, from growing up in an 'old school' neighborhood, influenced them and how they continue dealing with the legacy of that historic day. It's an intimate portrait of friendship and resiliency as told to their buddy, in a uniquely Bronx way.

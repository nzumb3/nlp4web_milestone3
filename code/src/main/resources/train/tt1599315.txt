###BREAK###
We can no longer stomach our food system. It's killing more and more Americans and costing billions in health care. 73% of Americans eat organic food, because they think it's healthier. But is it really the solution or just a marketing scam? When "organic" became a brand, everything changed. Small local farmers couldn't keep up with demand and big corporations went into the business. The philosophy and the label grew apart. Can processed gummy bears or bananas flown halfway across the world truly be organic? This film looks beyond organic for practical solutions for me and you. Local farmer's markets, school gardens, and urban farming are revolutionizing the way eat. Change is happening from the soil up. Get involved. Eat different.

Candy
###BREAK###
Two stories are intercut. Candy is a successful supermodel whom we hear interviewed (cliche after cliche), see on a shoot (she's the icon for a candy bar), and watch confront loneliness. Sandra is 13 or 14, moving into the self-consciousness of puberty, watching her older sister navigate romance, making decisions about boys, and drawing the eye of an older man. Can Candy face down the demons of a superficial life? Is Sandra at the base of the same arc, about to be discovered?

If I Was Your Girl
###BREAK###
IF I WAS YOUR GIRL is an intense pressure cooker drama centered on the chaotic affair between two interrelated lesbian couples. The story first chronicles the mentally draining relationship between Lynn and Stacia who have been dating for only a few months. Stacia is hopelessly in love with Lynn, a very beautiful and successful corporate exec who really doesn't reciprocate the same feelings as Stacia does. To Lynn, Stacia is liken to her "girl toy". She's fifteen years older and amusingly manipulates Stacia's sincere feelings toward her. On the flip side is the physically tumultuous journey between Rhonda and Toi. Rhonda, who happens to be Stacia's best friend from their time served in prison, is an aggressive butch lesbian who physically controls Toi, a passive woman who has acclimated herself to ill-treatment. As this intriguing story unfolds, we find where Lynn and Rhonda share similarities as abusers while Stacia and Toi are comparable to being their victims. Their lives are depicted through disturbing flashbacks revealing their dysfunctional conditions which are portrayed in a 24 hour time period leading up to the apparent tragedy that transpires in the end.

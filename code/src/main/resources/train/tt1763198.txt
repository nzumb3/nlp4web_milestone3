Brother Sister
###BREAK###
A film about brothers and sisters 'in heaven and on earth'. Memories of the author's brother who died in very young age lead into the story of the author's aunt: a German nun who found a close 'brother' in a Spanish saint to-be, Rafael Arnaiz. Her mission is to work for his international recognition. A piece of his rib as an official relic was the reward of her work. Rafael had died from diabetes 3 years before Sister Ingrid was born, having lead a life between arts, music, literature, good food and a sober Trappist abbey. A young, attractive guy as a perfect role model for a modern saint? BROTHER SISTER is a very personal reflection about the tightrope walk between inner and outer freedom.

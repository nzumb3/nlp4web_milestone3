I Wish I Had a House Like This
###BREAK###
A record producer in search of his big break finds his chance to record in the home studio of a hot shot record executive unexpectedly complicated by the appearance of a friend who was recently paroled from prison and in search of a place to celebrate his release. Pure Water may be from the hood, but he's got all the ambition of a true superstar and he's determined to make his dreams of success come true. When Pure does a big favor for a powerful record executive, the grateful executive does his best to repay the act of kindness by allowing Pure into his home studio for a free weekend recording session. Everything is going great for Pure until his old friend Drama comes looking for a place to party after being released from prison. As the weekend gets underway, it doesn't take long for Pure to realize that recording his demo, maintaining the house, and keeping his old pal Drama in check will take more effort that one man alone can muster.

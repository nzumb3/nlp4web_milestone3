Busking Hamburg
###BREAK###
'Busking' describes the art of performing on the street in return for donations. However, Busking is not only a performance but a whole lifestyle. The documentary 'Busking Hamburg' shows five different street performers that follow their passion. Anyone who experiences one of the many spontaneous street gigs by the band Denmantau, or runs into the singer/songwriter David Grabe while performing his emotional songs at the harbor, is immediately hooked. Crowds of people gather to cheer the street artists and party with them. And also former buskers like Mick M., Claas Vogt or blues musician Abi Wallenstein relate to this fascination.

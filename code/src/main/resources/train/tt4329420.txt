Babies Behind Bars
###BREAK###
Soledad O'Brien takes us inside a unique women's prison where babies are raised behind bars. 1 in 15 women enter prison in America pregnant. Typically, the mother is stripped from her newborn within 24 hours of birth, causing possible lifelong trauma to the child and mother. At the Washington Correction Center for women, inmates are able to live with their newborn for up to two years. Through this bonding the women are more motivated to turn their lives around. We follow Kristie Ebey, a newly incarcerated mother, as she fights to get into the program and keep her baby with her and Margaret Taggert who is just leaving the program with her toddler, facing the outside world for the first time as a single mother.

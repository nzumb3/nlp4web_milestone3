It's Brisbane Tonight: Wow!
###BREAK###
Rick Stinger is down on his luck. His comedy career is a disaster, but when he goes to pick up his film from the local TV station it turns out to be the best move he's ever made. When a storm hits and no guests are able to make t to the local tonight show, Rick is talked into impersonating each of the guests as the show goes live to air. Not knowing the actual guests are holed up in a local pub watching with mounting anger, and the shows sponsor is in the control room with mounting disbelief. What follows is pure hilarity. Will Rick save the day, with the real guests get their revenge, will the sponsor ever sell rugs again?

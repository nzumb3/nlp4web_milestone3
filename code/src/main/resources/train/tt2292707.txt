Hackers Wanted
###BREAK###
In 2003, a crew from Kevin Spacey's TriggerStreet production company appeared to interview Adrian Lamo. It was a brief talking-head piece on an unrelated documentary. No big deal. Or so everyone thought. The shoot went as those things tend to do, everyone shook hands, and one of the crew asked offhandedly "So, what would you do if the feds came for you, Adrian?" Adrian just laughed. 90 minutes later, he wasn't laughing - his voicemail informed him that he was a fugitive from the FBI. The resulting events were caught on film for days on end before becoming: "Hackers Wanted".

Jogwa
###BREAK###
Suli an innocent, happy carefree girl tethering on the brink of womanhood is unexpectedly forced into a life of servitude to the local deity when the uneducated, rural community in which she resides compels her to live a life of subjugation and serfdom on account of rampant superstitions that plagues the village. As Suli struggles to adjust to the new life unexpectedly thrust upon her, a far cry from the dreams and aspirations she once harbored, she meets Tayappa, a man forced to drape a sari and live the life of a woman and a homosexual as he too is a victim of the same circumstances that afflict her life. Brought together by the plight of their similar circumstances and wretched futures, Suli and Tayappa develop a warm and cherishing camaraderie, which eventually blossoms into love. The two gentle, wounded souls seek solace and comfort in each others company. Together they once again dream of living a happy, normal life, but are forced to face the wrath of a highly disapproving community that is hell-bent upon destroying their union. A heart wrenching tale that exposes the hypocrisies and exploitations of an oppressed society harrowed by archaic traditions and plagued by superstitions in the heart of rural India, Jogwa is a poignant tale of one woman's inspiring journey to break free from the shackles of discrimination, sexual oppression and servitude and find true happiness.

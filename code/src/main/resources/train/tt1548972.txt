Fora da Lei
###BREAK###
Lesbian couple Teresa and Lena made national news in Portugal when they applied to get married. Leonor Areal's camera follows them, one amid scores of reporters' cameras, as they deal with the denial of their petition, and, more significantly, with the negative fallout the publicity generates. Though seeking equal rights, in the process of being recognizable public figures, the two women and their daughters instead find themselves facing even greater discrimination in housing, work, and school.

The Mother of Invention
###BREAK###
Vincent Dooly is an aspiring inventor who dreams of winning an annual inventing award. There's only one problem... he's never made anything that's worked. Now, it's the last year he can enter and he has some stiff competition from Martin Wooderson, the smug wunderkind who has a long history of winning. But this time, Vincent has a plan... and it just might change everything.

Mariposa: Sa hawla ng gabi
###BREAK###
Set in 1994 Manila, the story is simple; an innocent girl caught in a web of horror. The main protagonist is a probinsiyana (country girl) named Maya (Erich Gonzales). Maya however is not the typical probinsiyana--she kills and skins wild monitor lizards who feed on their live stocks. Maya receives a telegram from her sister's friend Vivian (Ma. Isabel Lopez) obliging her to take a trip to the city about something important and that her sister Mona needs her. In the city, Maya discovers that her sister is already dead. Maya needs to raise 40,000 pesos to claim her sister's body or it'll be sold to a local university. Maya, innocent and all inquires about a tacky tattoo that has the name "Carlos" on her sister's arm. Maya assumes that "Carlos" must be someone special and perhaps can aid her into claiming her sister from the morgue. Restless Vivian paves the way. Maya will uncover terrifying truths about her sister and what happened to her in a journey that takes her into the darkest, most twisted corners of Manila. A trip that will change her forever.

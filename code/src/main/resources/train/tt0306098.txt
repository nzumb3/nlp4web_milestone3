A chance encounter on the boat! Rangi and Paddalu wheedle their way onto the boat much against the boatman's wishes. The next morning it is discovered that Paddalu has made away with the cargo on the board. Rangi is still around, probably to delay the police from catching the culprit. When asked, Rangi frankly tells her story. Paddalu is really not her husband but "her man". She is aware that the booty will not be shared with her, but with Passalu's beautiful young wife. Why then does she help Paddalu in his nefarious activities? "Because he is my man", is her simple answer which has eons of female subservience hidden within it.

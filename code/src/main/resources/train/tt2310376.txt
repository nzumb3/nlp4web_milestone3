The documentary Goli otok presents the history of the concentration camp built on an island at the Croatian northern seashore bearing the same name, during the clashes between Tito and Stalin from 1949 to 1955. The reconstruction of life at the camp and of the methods of political re-building is based on the testimonies of the former prisoner Alfred Pal, while the words of the former general of the Yugoslavian secret political police Jovo Kapicic reveal the establishment's view on the logic's and the motives that led to the creation of the Camp. This documentary also reveals more than a few non-published documents of the Yugoslav secret services shedding new light on the consequences of the Tito-Stalin skirmish that spelled doom for the condemned enemies of the state Stalin's allies.

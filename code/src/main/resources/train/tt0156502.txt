Edge City
###BREAK###
Two suburban girls fall victims of a rude, but harmless, prank by some boys whose origins are not clear, but the girls think they are from Philadelphia. Rumours make "almost rape" from the prank, and revenge is needed, so tension between kids from urban Philadelphia and suburban Springville escalates.

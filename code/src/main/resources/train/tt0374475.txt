The 3 Little Wolfs
###BREAK###
Why is this night different from all other nights? It's Passover at the Wolf house... and it may be their last! Join the three Wolf brothers as they navigate a breezy spring New York City day, culminating in an obligatory visit home to Long Island where their mother Sarah (Tovah Feldshuh), a natural incendiary with the tenacity of a cold sore, awaits them. Also awaiting them, a Seder for the ages, more eventful than the Last Supper. Well maybe not quite that eventful.

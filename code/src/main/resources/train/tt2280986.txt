In this found video footage horror genre feature, two brothers, Getty and Jessie Carmichael, drive 90 miles to Shallow Creek, Louisiana to honor their deceased grandfather's final request to spread his ashes over the Shallow Creek camp site pond. After the ceremony, they stumble across a viciously cannibalistic and mysterious cult, presumed responsible for the bloody massacres of various Shallow Creek, Louisiana residents. And now the Carmichael brothers are on the menu.

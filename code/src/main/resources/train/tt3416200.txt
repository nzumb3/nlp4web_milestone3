A man embarks on a journey to find ways to fill a human lifetime without becoming jaded and bored to death in middle age. People say that everything is too expensive to have any real fun. However, in this film we set about finding that the very best things in life really are free for all to enjoy. Even those life-long dreams, which are not entirely free can be fulfilled with less expense than you may think.

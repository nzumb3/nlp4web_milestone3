A Breath of Hope
###BREAK###
A Breath of Hope is the story of 27-year-old Rachel Nates - struck by the extremely rare and incapacitating lung disease, LAM, in the prime of her life - and her search for a lung donor. Told over the course of a single week in 2008 and through flashbacks of the months leading up to one fateful day, we watch as Rachel and her husband, Brian, wrestle with the monotony, pain, and frustration of awaiting an organ donor. With every struggle to catch her breath, we feel more deeply Rachel's pain and her helplessness, as she waits for the miracle that destiny may never deliver.

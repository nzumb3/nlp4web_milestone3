We Were Quiet Once
###BREAK###
Somerset was the picture-perfect small town, where life embodied a quiet, pleasant innocence - until September 11, 2001. United Flight 93 crashed in its sheltered countryside, claiming 40 innocent lives and forever changing the people on the ground. What lasting effects does a history-changing event have on a small town? How do those who have lived in anonymity for their entire lives deal with international attention? How do people memorialize a tragedy without perpetuating grief? Grief connected a small community with a nation. For many, that bond has sealed a sense of patriotism and delivered a positive response to a terrible tragedy; for others, it has chained them from moving forward. We Were Quiet Once follows three locals - Father Al, Terry Butler and Rick Flick - as they prepare for the 10th anniversary of 9/11.

Lace Bite
###BREAK###
To make good on a promise to a dying friend, Val Skelly convinced 39 women to put their lives on hold for 10 days to break the world record for the longest ice hockey game ever played. Little did they know what 243 hours in skates would feel like or how battered their bodies and minds would be. 'Lace Bite' chronicles the journey of this remarkable group of women in a fascinating and inspirational behind-the-scenes look at the game. At the 11th hour, when players broke down and lost their way, they were held up by the same cystic fibrosis community they inspired. A heart-warming story of community, a love of hockey, and the passion to make a difference. And a great Canadian music soundtrack.

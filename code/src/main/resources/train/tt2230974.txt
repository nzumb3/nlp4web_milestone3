Sammy's Suicidal Tendencies
###BREAK###
Sammy is a struggling musician who lives in his mom's basement. He calls a suicide hotline supposedly because he wants to kill himself. In reality he is just a lonely guy who wants an audience to listen to the final three songs of his unfinished album. Gloria, the suicide hotline operator, humors Sammy and we see the songs dramatized as a series of short films. In each, Sammy is the broken hearted guy who just wants to win the girl. But will death win out instead? Find out in 'Sammy's Suicidal Tendencies'.

The Story of Lotus
###BREAK###
The pretty girl Lotus, who lives in the Wuyi mountains in the south of China, lost her husband just after their marriage. This causes several difficulties for the newly-widowed Lotus; the sadness of losing her husband, the misunderstanding from her father-in-law, and their dispute in dividing the family properties. Lotus has to deal with this all by herself and support the family. Her softness and virtuousness wins the love of a bus driver who is kind and honest, and of a quarry manager who is powerful and rich. This forces Lotus to make a decision.

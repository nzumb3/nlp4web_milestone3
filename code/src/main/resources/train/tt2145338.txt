The Curse of the Death Cat
###BREAK###
The Curse of the Death Cat documents true, exaggerated and probably false stories about the punk band "Death Cat". The story is told through narration as well as a members, friends, family and cult members of the band. We move through the entire career of the group from their formation to there 'end'. Stockpiles of b-roll concert footage, past interviews, and decorated with mostly all music from the bands album give a complete feel to what this movie is about.

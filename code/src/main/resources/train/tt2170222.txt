Happy Cancer Chick
###BREAK###
Now that Lola, an actress and a 5 year cancer survivor has beaten the Big C, she can't land a commercial gig because casting agents think she's too happy, no one wants to donate money to her walks and marches, and it seems she is being kicked out of the PINK world she was a part of for so long. Will Lola be able to remain PINK to help save more boobies or will she have to leave for good?

There's Something About Metal
###BREAK###
Finland: a country of extremes. The repressive winters and vast dramatic landscapes give way to wild nights of drinking and a powerful appreciation of music. Metal music in Finland is not a sub culture, it is part of the mainstream. The unsigned band Baton Rogue Morgue are in the process of recording their third album and have high hopes. Band members Domino De La Rogue and Lee Angel Morgue open the door to their Heavy Metal lifestyle. They travel to two Metal music festivals to party hard and gain some inspiration for their new album. At the festivals we meet the fans and chat to the lineup of bands in an attempt to understand why Metal music has taken such a grip on this nation.

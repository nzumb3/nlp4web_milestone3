Bugaboo
###BREAK###
BUGABOO is a Silicon Valley film. It has been produced by people who live and work in Silicon Valley and who have prospered with the high-tech boom of the nineties. The Internet and the personal computer, while creating Silicon Valley, have also created armies of well-paid Indian professionals who lead a curious existence: as professionals they constitute the epicenter of America's recent growth binge, but as individuals they continue to stay inside cocooned, secure Indian communities which are quite divorced from all things American. A group of such engineers defies the even flow of this existence by introducing "random disturbances" into their lives. These deviations from normal routine punctuate the film until they finally lead to a "grand deviance," unthinkable for sober, law-abiding engineers from India. It is then, at the end of the film, that they discover simple solutions to seemingly complex problems in their lives.

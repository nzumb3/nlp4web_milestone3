Saving Football: America's Game at the Crossroads
###BREAK###
Football was always violent. Americans wanted it that way, just not too violent. Injuries were common, but rarely fatal. A former pro might end up crippled in old age, but given all the sport's pleasures and benefits, the cost was acceptable. Until 2002, when signs of Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, CTE, were found in the brain of ex-Steeler Mike Webster. New research on concussions and routine head blows shows that football's dangers are immeasurably higher and that young boys as well as old pros are at risk. Saving Football: America's Game at the Crossroads poses what have become urgent questions: Can we make football safe enough? How safe do we want it to be? How safe can it be and still be football?

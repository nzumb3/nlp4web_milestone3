Sonica Sequence
###BREAK###
The concept of the sessions are to create unexpected and open musical situations interacting with the public space and a spontaneous audience. The musicians do not rehearse in advance and the sessions are not announced to a public audience - it just takes place. All to create the best conditions for a musical meeting free from expectations and as present in the moment as possible. The sessions will be recorded and filmed in high quality and will be part of a documentary film and released as an album including all of the international sessions in the Sonica Sequence. The Sonica Sequence is an ongoing project where musician and composer Lisa Nordstr√∂m meet international musicians for an improvised site specific sessions in Cuba, Indonesia, Japan and Sweden.

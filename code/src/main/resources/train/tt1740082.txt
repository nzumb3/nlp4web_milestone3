Blackfire: A Modern Warcry
###BREAK###
Fighting for truth, justice, and the Native American Way, the Navajo punk band, Blackfire, has rocked the world for 20 years. Their mix of traditional vocalization and electric guitars is internationally embraced. Nationally they have been recognized for the quality of their music, receiving NAMMY's for 'Record of the Year', 'Group of the Year', and 'Best Pop/Rock Album.' At home, where they use the income from their music to fund youth programs and a community center, they are at best taken for granted. At worst, they are viewed as rebels and half-breeds in their fight against corporate greed and the desecration of sacred grounds. Fiercely independent, this family finds a way to maintain its values, integrity, and freedom while working in a highly competitive industry.

Life Changes
###BREAK###
Hidden in forgotten corners of Palm Beach County, Florida, an epidemic rages with young teens having babies. Almost all mothers are minorities. All are poor. Not one teen mother planned to get pregnant. Invariably, the baby was 'an accident,' or 'it just happened,' or 'it wasn't his/her fault.' The one constant is that none of these girls could survive on their own. 'Life changes' follows four girls from pregnancy to their child's third birthday. One girl got pregnant at 12, another at 13, and two at 16. The younger girls are Latina, and the older girls are African-American and Haitian.

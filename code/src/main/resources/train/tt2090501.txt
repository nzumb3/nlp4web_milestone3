Francis of Brooklyn
###BREAK###
Pvt. Francis returns from serving in Iraq as a broken alcoholic who has lost all passion for life. An encounter with a fellow veteran, now destitute, initiates a spiritual crisis that leads the young man to renounce his family's wealth and to seek out a more meaningful life among the homeless and rejected on the streets of Brooklyn. Soon a growing fraternity of assorted and eccentric oddballs form around Francis as these modern day friars seek to muddle their way towards enlightenment. A series of funny and often irreverent vignettes, adapted from the true story of St. Francis of Assisi, all illustrating the simplest joys of a life based on humility, faith and compassion.

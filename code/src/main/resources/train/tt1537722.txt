Beyond Limits
###BREAK###
At 19,340 feet, Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania, Africa is the tallest free-standing mountain in the world and a daunting climb for any person to attempt. Born with cerebral palsy, Bonner Paddock disregards conventional limits in hopes to defy his condition and inspire others. Despite a weak lower body, spastic leg muscles, zero sense of balance and lack of climbing experience, Bonner is fully committed to challenging the impossible task of climbing the mountain. His mission is not only of a physical nature, but one of inspiration. He hopes to help children living with disabilities overcome their own obstacles. All the money raised for Bonner's climb will go towards just that: the first Early Learning Center to serve children with and without disabilities in his own backyard in Orange County, California. Not a mountain climber by his own admission and with only a few months of training under his belt, Bonner soon learns there is no preparation for what he finds on the mountain. Over 8 days, 64 miles, shear cliffs, sub-zero temperatures, and ever-thinning oxygen, Bonner is forced to confront what most would consider catastrophic. Perseverance and the sheer will to succeed overshadow any doubts that enter his mind; the summit Kilimanjaro and silence his critics, Bonner will go beyond limits. Academy Award Nominee Michael Clarke Duncan boldly narrates this stirring true story documentary.

The Leopard in the Land
###BREAK###
Artist and Disney designer Joe Rohde sets out on a month-long horseback expedition across the Altai Mountains of Western Mongolia with the intention of painting large scale landscapes to raise funds for Snow Leopard conservation. Facing blizzards, rebellious camels and the rapidly approaching Mongolian winter, it is a pilgrimage that explores why we travel, how we interact with the world, and the monumental effect that has on everything else - including the elusive and enigmatic snow leopard.

Paul and Gwen have never met when they are awake, but in their sleep they have been trapped in a room together for the past two weeks. In these dreams, both of them find a comfortable confidence in themselves that they don't have in the conscious world. They find themselves growing more and more distant from their real life relationships and obsessed with their dream world. The attraction to one another is reaching an uncontrollable peak that they may never be able to return from.

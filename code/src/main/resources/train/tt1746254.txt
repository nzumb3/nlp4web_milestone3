The Road to Nasiriyah
###BREAK###
The Road to Nasiriyah is the extraordinary journey of two American filmmakers to document the unprecedented looting of archaeological sites following the 2003 Iraq war. The film is a poetic meditation on postwar Iraq and an intellectual thriller that ends in a dramatic kidnapping. The journey includes characters whose stories become intertwined - an Iraqi archaeologist who risks his life to protect sites, our interpreter who quotes Hegel and Shakespeare, and a man who plays both sides for profit; protector and looter. This is a story about the chaos of war and the loss of values. It's a cautionary tale about a dark time when the beginnings of recorded human history, buried in the sands of southern Iraq, were destroyed.

Bye Bye Havana
###BREAK###
Cuba stands pummeled by an unworkable socialism and a voracious consumer appetite. What began some 50 years ago seems spent, "patriotism or death" are simply not enough. Cubans want other choices, other points of view, and they can't wait any longer. Bye Bye Havana is 90 miles from being political. This fast-paced stream of conciseness documentary presents a unique flavor of irony, carried by an eclectic soundtrack featuring Latin Grammy Nominee X Alfonso, hip hop by Free Hole Negro, pianist Roberto Carcasses and jazz poet Telmary. The following appear on the films soundtrack: Francis del Rio X Alfonso Free Hole Negro Roberto Carcasses Telmary.

A road movie of the soul, Les Equilibristes, a documentary feature film, is shaped by the childhood request of the director who, at age seven, asks: 'God, let me live till I'm 20.' Now 59, Daneau questions death through her meetings with people to whom she is connected either through rituals, professional activities or their state of health. The question at the heart of the film is: Can death be tamed? Filmed in Quebec, Switzerland, Spain and the United States, this personal journey is a dynamic, courageous and disturbing encounter with the curve of humanity: birth, life, death.

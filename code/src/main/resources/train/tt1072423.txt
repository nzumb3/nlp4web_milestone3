The Art of Pain
###BREAK###
INSPIRE AN ARTIST, RUIN HIS LIFE - The peace of the mall movie theater is about to be shattered! Jack, a stagnated painter, must train new theater employee Marcus, a rage filled, motorcycle-riding martial artist. Marcus hits on Jack's actress girlfriend Sharon, and really gets the goat of comic-loving sci-fi geek, Nick. More tensions flare when Jack's boss announces a coveted career launching painting contest. Turns out that Marcus studies the art of Ninja under the diabolical, pastrami-loving Nobu. After dishing out a nasty kung fu beat down, Nobu decrees that until Marcus can demonstrate his creativity, he will never earn his black belt. With a psychotic need to prove himself boiling up, Marcus latches onto the words of his hero, zombie film maven George Romano: "Great art comes from great pain." Suddenly, Sharon and Marcus are in bed together and Jack has found some gut wrenching inspiration to paint with. Wowed by his friend's new zest for art, Nick presses Jack to begin illustrating his comic book about sexy women and swamp dwelling ape-men. This deviation from painting burns up Marcus, who believes he is establishing his legacy through Jack's art. Donning ninja garb, Marcus sets out to further "inspire" Jack. What follows is a bloody trail of betrayal, murder and maiming that only a ninja can inflict. Now, painting in a frenzy, Jack must fight not only for his art, but his life. Be ready for one shocker of an ending!

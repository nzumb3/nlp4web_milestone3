Constraints
###BREAK###
CONSTRAINTS is the story of a former nude model whose portrait is used to explore notions of exploitation vs. empowerment. While visualizing the tenuous line between 'art' and 'pornography,' the film extrapolates the details of the model's former lifestyle: why it started, what happened at shoots, and why it ultimately wasn't for her. Through aesthetic mystery and underlying tension, the documentary illuminates certain paradoxes of representation - the difference between intent and viewership. Told through the words of a former model this tale of personal regret is made even more urgent because 'what goes on the Internet, stays there forever.'

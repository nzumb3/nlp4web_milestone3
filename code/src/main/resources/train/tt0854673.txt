Pursuit of Honor: The Rise of George Washington
###BREAK###
The French & Indian War serves as George Washington's training ground for life. As the war winds down, he falls in love with Sally Fairfax, the wife of his best friend. But Washington also courts Martha Custis, the wealthiest widow in Virginia, who knows of his love for Sally. George and Martha marry, and Washington becomes America's most powerful land baron--and one of many wealthy Americans treated as second-class citizens by a nationalistic Great Britain. The American struggle for equality turns violent, and Washington must make his most difficult choice of all, risking everything for the sake of a new concept...liberty.

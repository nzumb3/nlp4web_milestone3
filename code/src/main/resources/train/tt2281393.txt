On the Road with the 2009 Phantom Regiment
###BREAK###
In the Red Violin, Phantom Regiment tells a poignant story of love, deception, forgiveness and redemption. Act 1 focuses on a young, poor musician trying to support his new bride. After finding a magical violin, he becomes a virtuoso and is showered with praise and riches. He is carried away by sudden fame and adulation in Act 2, and after a triumphant concert, a seductress steals his heart from his loyal wife. Act 3 opens as he's in a rapturous nightclub dance with the seductress. At the opportune moment, she steals his violin and flees into the night. Distraught to the point of hysteria in Act 4, he curses his stupidity and begs his wife for forgiveness. Reunited, they set off to confront the thief, and upon finding her, recover the violin. And then, in true storybook fashion, they live happily ever after. On the Road 2009 is an up close and personal look at one of the toughest, yet life-changing, summers in Phantom Regiment history. A critically acclaimed film by Robert Cawthorne and winner of the 2010 On the Waterfront Film Festival, shot entirely in HD, this documentary follows the 150 members and staff every step of the way. From inside the design meetings to the final step off in Lucas Oil Stadium, you'll have unprecedented access to one of the World's most beloved Drum Corps. This is our 2009 story.

Masti Express
###BREAK###
Mumbai-based Raju (Rajpal Yadav) drives a beat-up auto-rickshaw, lives with his wife, Seema (Divya Dutta), an adopted son, Babu, and invests in lottery tickets much to the chagrin of Seema who repeatedly threatens to kill herself by jumping under a train. When he attempts to secure admission for Babu in Bata Ryan School, he is not only refused but also humiliated by the Principal. Hoping to ensure a decent education for Babu, as well as improve their lifestyle, he decides to enter into an auto-rickshaw race that will get the winner Rs.10 Lakhs - fully aware that his auto-rickshaw may not live up to this challenge. Even after he finds out that the race, organized by a gangster named Veerubhai, who already has him in his bad books, may be 'fixed', he is determined to win. Things will not at all go his way when his rickshaw gets run-over by a lorry and he may end up not only never taking part in the race but also being compelled to take up a new line of work altogether.

Peasant's Daughter
###BREAK###
In the eighties, my father bought my grandfather's farm with his brother and sister. The three of them transformed this traditional business into an organic farm along with a supermarket. The more the company grew, the stiffer their cooperation became. Twenty-five years later, their idealism has turned into a quiet but deep-rooted family feud. Being a peasant's daughter, those difficulties made me long for the anonymity of the city. In the movie I have made about these long-concealed difficulties, I have found sadness, in myself and my family.

Pop-Up
###BREAK###
THE STORY "Pop-Up" is a drama comedy with three interweaving stories: An unemployed father finds a camera containing a single photo of a woman's face. Smitten, he tracks her down. A Romanian immigrant attempts to overcome her heartbreak by giving away home-made pop-up cards. A sleep-deprived theatre director seeks deadly revenge on a scathing critic.

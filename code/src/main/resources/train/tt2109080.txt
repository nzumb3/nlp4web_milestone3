The Bridge
###BREAK###
In the rainy season the rivers rise and Chimanimani, one of the most beautiful regions in Mozambique, is cut off from the rest of the country. A natural reserve will be created. The main attraction is Mount Binga, the highest point in Mozambique. This reserve will benefit the local community. However, a bridge must be built. The entire village participates in the construction. It is a celebration of human labour!

Nirvana 13 is a story about a patients's cry for relief from agony and a nurse who is silently wishing for the same. The two have a conversation about their struggles with morality and helplessness and their constant quest for a way out. This provokes different perspectives of the pragmatic and spiritual aspects of life and death. The ultimate outburst of questions on morality and helplessness is at the crux of this psychological drama.

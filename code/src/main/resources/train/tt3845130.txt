Salavat Yuzeev's debut feature film tells a modern story of love and sacrifice. Set in modern Kazan, the action is constantly crossing borders of the real and surreal, tradition and modernity, art and nature. In just 110 minutes the director explores the meaning of love - the erotic and platonic, spiritual and fraternal.

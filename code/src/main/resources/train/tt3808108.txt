Family Tree
###BREAK###
Written by Karen Anderson, the movie is a dramedy that tells the story of an African American family that do not like each other, but is forced into having a family reunion by one of the members. The story explores family dynamics and what is family. Is it blood or relationship? It will make you laugh so hard you are going to pee your pants. But like the nature of most families, you might find yourself crying and thinking about someone you love. The family matriarch, Flora Jones, is challenged by her granddaughter, Kate to have a family reunion. Flora knew her children couldn't speak two kind words to each other, less lone share a meal or party together. Kate Jones Blaylock from first glance is an average 20 something year old woman with a job and normal family life. She has her ideas of what a family is and is NOT. Her family falls into the last category. As the film progresses and we meet members of her family we discover a group of people that are not very nice. Soon we discover they don't even like each other. In spite of it all, they do love each other and want what is best for each other. Although their best for each other might be a little off center. Yet the thing the one thing the viewer will notice, before Kate ever does, is that all of these people have their own secrets. These secrets begin to unravel as the plot unfolds.

Bandits
###BREAK###
On the evening of November 18th 1983, seven young Georgians with a dream hijacked a Soviet passenger plane. The terrorists' aim: a dramatic escape into the glittering west. What started out as a naive fantasy quickly became a nightmare whose events leave an indelible mark on the psyche of the Georgian nation. Zaza Rusadze directs "Bandits", a film retracing the roots of the escapade, its victims, its survivors and its myth. In an era defined by terror, "Bandits" is a timely examination of the human side of terrorism.

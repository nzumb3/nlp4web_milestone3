Bianca
###BREAK###
Triton wakes in a dirty toilet block in the middle of nowhere, bleeding and alone. His only possessions are a wallet containing a confusing letter, a ring, and a photo of his smiling self at the beach with an unfamiliar woman by his side. On the back of the photo is the number 82222222. He sets out to discover what these objects mean and how he got there. Surrounded by emptiness and desolation, Triton grasps at fragments of lost memories which circuitously lead to Bianca. He thinks his journey is complete, but soon questions whether he has found the woman in the photograph.

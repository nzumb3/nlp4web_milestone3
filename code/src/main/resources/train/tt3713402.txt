In the Heart of Pain
###BREAK###
When Alexis was thirteen years old, he found Cesar beating his mother and trying to rape her. So Alexis killed him. Six months later when he came out of jail in a battle to the death of Cesar's son, he also killed him. When he got older he killed a man to rob him, and that crime remained unpunished. But two years later he was accused of a crime he did not commit, and went to jail. In jail he complained to God, but one day God will answer.

Old Dog New Trick
###BREAK###
Follows Steve Scorfina, a founding member of REO Speedwagon and Pavlov's Dog, as he balances a life in antiques-dealing with a re-launched career as a blues-rock band leader, guitarist and vocalist. Scorfina grew up in the garage rock era, came of age in the psychedelic 60s and expanded his repertoire in the exotic fusion of progressive rock. Shaped by the music of his life and misadventures in and out of drugs, relationships and day jobs, Scrfina eventually finds his roots in the St Louis Blues.

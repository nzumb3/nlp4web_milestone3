Let's Rob the Cheese Shop
###BREAK###
While procrastinating for their mid-terms, three friends, attending college in New Orleans, haphazardly plan an inside robbery of the business where Daphne works, a gourmet cheese shop. Daphne, who outwardly appears the sweet girl-next-door, is certainly far from it. Daphne is entrusted with the nightly closing the Cheese Shop, and occasionally, during idle time at work, she fantasizes about robbing the place. When she inadvertently presents her fantasy to her guy friends, (Alex, who has an open crush on Daphne, and Vance, who once consummated a crush with Daphne), they rush aboard. That night, they decide to 'case' the Cheese Shop. After some brainstorming, they construct a foolproof plan. Alex and Vance will stop by the Cheese Shop, while Daphne closes the shop solo. Then, they will over-power and lock her in the bathroom. The money set aside for the night's deposits will be taken, and Daphne will appear to be a victim of armed robbers. They think it's genius. Once alone with Alex, Daphne states she has misgivings about the plan, and discloses all the bad luck, which followed her previous 'breaking the law' moment. Meanwhile, Vance is ingesting various pharmaceuticals, and is quite intent on carrying out the plan with, or without, their consent. Over the course of 24 hours, details of an awkward love triangle unfold as two of the friends back out of the robbery while the third meets the MILF of his dreams: Sexy, dangerous, and a mom . . .

Antarctica: Ice World Pioneers
###BREAK###
Filed over a period of 5 years, Antarctica: Ice World Pioneers tells the epic story of ingenuity, perseverance and achievement of the team that conceived and built one of the most advanced science research facilities on the Antarctic continent - South Africa's base: SANAE IV. Stunning visuals, an original music score and a compelling narrative depict extreme hardship and happiness, failure and victory, incredible beauty and uncompromising weather conditions - and the tragedy of those who paid the ultimate price while working in this merciless wasteland. This is a story told through the eyes of ordinary people who work in that place we call Antarctica, towards an end that may seem distant and beyond the realities of our everyday life, but which adds more to the survival of our planet than any other scientific endeavour on earth. This is the story of Antarctica's modern day ice world pioneers.

Let's Go to Berlin
###BREAK###
The protagonists, 6 members of the Ukooflani collective, plus 'Upendo Hero' (the love hero), a mysterious character who spreads the message of love for public space explore Berlin, interacting with local citizens/activists, artists and the so called 'creative class'. They try to understand why and how 'gentrification' should and can be stopped in both European and African metropolises by making the 'creative class' aware of its own political and cultural power. Twende Berlin film documentary is an occasion for both: European and African urban citizens, a way to twist and subvert stereotypes and become both an object of social and cultural investigation to discover ourselves again, in the eyes of a group of African hip hop artists and their super hero.

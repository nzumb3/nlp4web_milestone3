The Crooked Mile
###BREAK###
An Irish road movie shot on location in Jersey and Dublin featuring the journeys of two characters, Elliot a twenty something medical school drop out and Anna a nine year old adult. Fast tractors, flash cars, Ferris wheels, a gold fish with an odd name and the search for a 50's movie icon in Tramore.

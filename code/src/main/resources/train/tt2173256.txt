Two Hands to Mouth
###BREAK###
Eight blind folded guests assemble at a secret pop-up restaurant. Chef Michael Bradori is back, sober and ready to reclaim his former glory. Food, wine, greed and lust fuel the appetites in the room. Everyone dives into the experience when things take a shocking turn. The dining room is transformed into a minefield of political and personal danger. Under threat of guns and violence, the two banker guests must defend their indefensible actions with their lives. Dark. Comedic. Stylish. Intense. Revenge is a dish best served piping hot.

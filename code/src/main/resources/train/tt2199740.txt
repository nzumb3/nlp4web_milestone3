The English actor, Pete Postlethwaite, having been in Australia for film work, runs into a former schoolmate, Bill Johnson. Johnson's son had died in a sad and shameful situation of racial prejudice. Postlethwaite sets out to investigate the social status of indigenous people in Australia, uncovering many cruel and prejudicial aspects of law and administration. He hosts a gathering of many of the victims of such treatment, many now elderly. Though having carried wounds all their lives, they have a sort of resilient strength that is remarkable and uplifting to Pete. As an Englishman, he had had no idea of this disgraceful aspect of the government of what had begun as British colony under British legal principles.

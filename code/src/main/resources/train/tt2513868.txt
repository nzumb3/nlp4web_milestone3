Wild Things
###BREAK###
Wolves, coyotes and other native carnivores balance ecosystems and keep wilderness healthy. But they are also seen as a threat to livestock, and for over a hundred years ranchers and federal government trappers have slaughtered them in a battle against nature that is costly, brutal, and not very effective. Wild Things introduces audiences to progressive ranchers who are learning to coexist with these animals successfully. They are using new technology, and rediscovering old methods of animal husbandry to create a better future for livestock, wildlife and wilderness. Wild Things also features scientists, conservationists and even former Wildlife Services trappers, who believe it is time for a major change in the way we treat our magnificent native carnivores.

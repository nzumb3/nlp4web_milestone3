Marranos
###BREAK###
What if your family, part of a religious minority, had been living for hundreds of years in a country known for its traditions of tolerance -- a place where you'd become prosperous, influential members of society. And then, one day, word came down that all would be lost unless you renounced your faith. What would you do? MARRANOS, a feature-length, independent film, tells the story of Spanish Jews, nearing the turn of the 15th century, whose lives were changed forever when the call went out: convert or die. Some resisted. Many fled. And many others took the offer -- outwardly -- while struggling to remain Jews in their hearts. These were the Marranos.

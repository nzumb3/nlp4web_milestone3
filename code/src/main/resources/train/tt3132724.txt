Hot Lead Hard Fury
###BREAK###
The year is1976, and in the mid-west metropolis of Steel City a dangerous and addictive new synthetic form of cocaine known as "Voodoo Blue" finds its way into the streets-and with deadly results. Undercover cop Chuck Beefer is part of an elite task force assigned to stop it. But when his cover is blown on a drug sting, Beefer sees two of his partners- including his martial arts mentor Solomon Link- killed at the hands of a deadly Vietnam vet known only as "The Cowboy", while Beefer himself is left for dead. But Beefer returns amidst suspicion of corruption within the force, so Beefer's Police Capt. Columbus Jackson secretly assigns Beefer to an unofficial 'phantom force' in order to find out who is really behind the influx of this deadly drug- and the leak in the police force. With no badge- and with a bitter and explosive partner named Jack Hammer, the two men dive deeper into the seedy underworld of Steel City and make their way through a cast of deadly and bizarre characters-as well as a gang of lovely and lethal ladies- before they realize just how against the odds they truly are.

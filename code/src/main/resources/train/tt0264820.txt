This Tamil remake of "9 to 5" has three women working in the same office (Revathi, Rohini, Urvashi) who are constantly harassed by their lecherous boss (Nasser). The three decide to gang up against him, but a strange accident complicates things when the boss lands in a hospital and the three women end up with the dead body of a terrorist. Very watchable comedy, one of Singeetham Srinivasa Rao's best.

Voz de Murga
###BREAK###
Uruguay, a small country that has managed to come up with a complex form of art. A professional performance with a constant need to discuss the previous year's events and reflect on them in public. A popular theatrical event found during carnival, watched by more people than any other event year-round. A genre that evolves together with the country, representing the best and the worst Uruguayans can give. Because murga is the voice of Uruguay, a voice that nobody has been able to silence.

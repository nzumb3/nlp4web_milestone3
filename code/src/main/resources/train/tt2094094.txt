Return to Vengeance
###BREAK###
The movie centers around Lorenzo Lamas as the mysterious drifter known only as Brady. He innocently rides into a small southern town and is immediately drawn to the rescue of a young lady in distress,(Ms. Barr) against a well organized gang of cut-throats (literally) known as "The Blades". The leader of the gang (Timbrook) vows revenge and thus sets in motion a dramatic, action packed ride. Daniel Baldwin plays "Bart" the bartender who owns the watering hole where the events unfold. He teams with tough guy Lamas and fights back to back with him to save his business, the town, and the beautiful heroine. Tammy Barr's portrayal of the sweet, innocent leading lady will bring a tear to your eye.

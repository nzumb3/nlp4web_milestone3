Apatía, una película de carretera
###BREAK###
On a palm Sunday, two friends meet and part to follow each his own road. One is looking, across the country, for a girl that left him after having his abortion. The other one is looking, through reflexion and violence, for a way out of his own tragic existence. A holy week, a third world country, a chance to experience gain and loss, to walk a path previously unknown. A chance to learn and understand that life's about the journey, not the destination.

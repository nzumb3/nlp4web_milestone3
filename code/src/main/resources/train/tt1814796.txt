Minds, Adolescents
###BREAK###
MINDS, ADOLESCENTS is about these fraternal twin brothers who get separated at birth. Michael knows he has a brother but Nathan doesn't know anything about his past. We see their stories unfold in the film and how opposite they really are from one another even though they're linked by blood. The question we are faced with is if their lives will cross paths and if they do, how will they react to one another?

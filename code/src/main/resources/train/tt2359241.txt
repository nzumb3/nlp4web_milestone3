Possession
###BREAK###
Five friends find an old bunker in the forest. There, they meet a demon that resumes to split them up. Possessed by the Demon attempting to split them up into five parts - making each of them to attempt to take possession of one friend - in order to play them off against each other. Only one of them is strong enough and smart enough to unite all parts again. The others have to die... A contemporary quality horror film with brains, successfully spoofing classic 80's splatter films, while building on the growing prominence of its creator, Ralf Kemper, director of Toxic Lullaby and winner of New York Horror Film Festival Best Picture Award.

Al Jaar Qabla Al Daar
###BREAK###
The video for this documentary was filmed by eight Palestinian families living in various neighborhoods in the city of Jerusalem, a place where the usual sense of 'neighborhood' is broken by occupation and conflict. It was filmed over a month in September 2009, with a PTZ CCTV camera that the residents installed on or close to their own homes, at a point of vantage. The voice-over is that of people speaking over the video live as they watched, and controlled the camera from inside their homes. Sometimes the voice looks for an image, at other times image provokes voice, or they separate into distant landscapes and innermost thoughts. The footage, previously seen as a video installation, was edited into a feature-length documentary in 2011.

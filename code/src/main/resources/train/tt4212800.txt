Wakers
###BREAK###
A father reads a story to a young girl about a rebellious young girl who lives in a dreary, black and white version of New York with her religious fanatic mother. After trying an experimental new drug given to her by the mysterious "Cultural Olympiad" she finds herself in a vivid, colorful fantasy world - but with one catch. As she and her friends enter the hallucinations, they begin to drop off, one by one. Is it the drug killing them - or is there something more sinister at play? As the dark force causing these fatal mishaps begins to manifest itself into a living being, Blessing's mission becomes stopping it - or him - at all costs. Meanwhile, a man named Bug Lord, who controls the flow of the drug into Blessing's world suffers for all of her sins.

Dry Branches of Iran
###BREAK###
"Dry Branches of Iran" follows a young dancer who one day wakes up in an Iranian prison cell without any recollection of how he ended up there. Slowly he starts remembering what happened to him and in doing so, we get a glimpse of the current explosive political situation in Iran and the entire Middle East. "Dry Branches of Iran" is a film about injustice, remembrance and political consciousness. Did his family forget about him? Do they know he is still alive? Was the Twitter revolution pointless? Did the international community forget about the protesters? As a tribute to all the images on You Tube and Facebook the film was entirely shot unofficially and clandestine on smartphones. The scenes are acted out by a group of Iranian actors who wish to remain anonymous and therefore their faces are out of frame.

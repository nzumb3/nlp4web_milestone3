America Will Never Forget Their Sacrifices

The film was inspired by the 'Honor Flight' program of taking veterans to see their memorials. Many are to frail to make the physical journey. Our objective was to capture the essence of the experience for veterans so that they could witness the gratitude of the nation. The film is to be reproduced on DVD and on line and presented for no charge to those who would help us ensure as many veterans as possible see it. All work on the film was done pro bono. The entire production staff are veterans.

Love... And Other Bad Habits
###BREAK###
Mei (Zoe Tay) and Chin Wei (Chen Han Wei) are a divorced couple who might be on the path to reconciliation and a rekindling of romance when their best friend, Suzy (Kym Ng) comes between them. Mike (George Young) and Jess (Carmen Soo) are two professionals who seem to be more dedicated to their careers than each other, until a workplace dilemma forces them to, literally, take action. Add to the mix a difficult client, Mrs Cheng-Cheng (Irene Ang), and the tension is set to explode. Darrell (Ian Fang) has a crush on schoolmate Ann (Kimberly Chia), but is afraid she thinks he's too crass and lowly for her. Enter social media, and a case of mistaken identity, turns their lives upside down.

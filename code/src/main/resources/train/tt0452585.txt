Apartment 202
###BREAK###
John is a struggling San Francisco musician who can't find a girlfriend. Zack, his roommate and best friend, is a wannabe comedian who likes to play the field. When the two fall for a pair of beautiful and strong-willed foreigners, John convinces Zack that they have to do whatever it takes to help the girls stay in the country -- even if it means getting married and living together. A comedic clash of cultures transforms the apartment, and John and Zack find out that they have a lot to learn about love and life.

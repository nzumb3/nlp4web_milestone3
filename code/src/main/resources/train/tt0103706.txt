Another Girl Another Planet
###BREAK###
An ordinary-looking guy proves to be an unusually successful womanizer, and his East Village apartment begins to assume aspects of Grand Central Station. He is so attractive to one of the women he seduces that he has to let her know in a forceful way that he's not available for long-term romance. In addition to his other good qualities, he's a bit of a jerk.

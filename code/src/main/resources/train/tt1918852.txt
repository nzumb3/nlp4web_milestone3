Hiding Behind The Green Screen is an innovative, experimental and creative documentary aimed at heightening awareness around the marijuana culture amongst youth in New Zealand. Four young men are given the opportunity to be mentored by two accomplished New Zealand musicians - Frances Kora from the band Kora and Rio Hemopo from the bands Trinity Roots and Fat Freddy's Drop. Together they embark on a journey of self-discovery where honest discussions are shared concerning the negative impact marijuana has had on their lives. The young men are challenged about their previous life choices and are encouraged to break free from drug addiction by realising their creative potential through their passion for music.

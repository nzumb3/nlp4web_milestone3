Horn
###BREAK###
HORN is a lived documentary that creatively investigates the issue of rhino poaching by focusing on specific anti-poaching units in South Africa's Waterberg region. The intention is to determine how effective anti-poaching as a solution-driven method is to combat the surge in organized poaching. A key dimension is the assessment of rhino monitor training as a forward-looking strategy that serves the protection of not only rhinos, but also the betterment of the wider community. This includes an evaluation of the physical and psychological impact of such training by following an actor (Jeffrey Mundell) playing a specifically created character (Michael Harris) within a real-life training situation. The intention is to thereby explore sustainable solutions to this dilemma while simultaneously commenting on the wider socio-political context connected to the survival of the South African rhinos. By including the contributions of significant political and community leaders in South Africa as well as figures working at the forefront of rhino conservation, HORN not only highlights some of the problems facing rhino conservation, but it also points out some of the significant social problems facing the communities in the affected areas - specifically in relating to education, health, security and accountability.

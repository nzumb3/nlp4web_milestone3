Untouchable: Children of God
###BREAK###
In the brothels of India, young girls perish every day. Some die quickly from murder or suicide, others from diseases like HIV/AIDS. Thousands of Nepali minors are locked into rooms, where they are beaten, starved, drugged, burned and raped by their captors and countless men who use and abuse them. It is estimated that over 10,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal to India annually, cruelly driven over the border by force or lured by the false promise of work. The average age of a Nepali girl trafficked to India is 13 years old. A mere 1% of these sex slaves ever escape or get rescued. The red light areas of India are dangerous, lawless places ruled by mafia and gangs. Despite these seemingly insurmountable odds, there are a growing number of abolitionists and social advocates taking action to help end this brutal form of modern day slavery. Featuring rare footage from inside the brothels of India and exclusive interviews with survivors and those serving on the front lines, UNTOUCHABLE: CHILDREN OF GOD highlights stories of hope and the heroes risking their lives to rescue and protect these forgotten angels. Look into the eyes of young survivors as they share their stories and you will be touched by the untouchables.

###BREAK###
Mehmet Murat Ozyurt is a man who passes his days doing nothing. He goes out of his house in the mornings, spends time in the shopping malls and wanders around in various places of the city with no specific purpose. In the evenings he always goes to either an exhibition opening or a film premiere where he finds the opportunity to have a couple of drinks and socialize with his friends. Mehmet Murat whose days are always spent in similar ways sees himself as the dervish of modern times.

One of the most unforgettable TV comedies of the 1980s was doled out thirty seconds at a time, an unending series of wacky, ultra-fast-paced commercial spots for the Southern California electronics chain, The Federated Group that starred 'Fred Rated,' the half-insane, 'BassOMatic' - style, parody of a spokesman played by Shadoe Stevens. Shadoe and his gung-ho skeleton team cranked out endless, memorable, frenetic nuggets of Dadaist, Monty Python-esque video art disguised as VCR and car stereo ads -- amassing over 1,100 hilarious commercials in six years, and leaving an indelible mark on the psyche of every L.A. TV-watcher. This documentary about Shadoe includes the 'Best of Fred,' 'Shadoevision,' the even-more-bonkers 1986 Sci-Fi comedy cable special, out-takes and newly uncovered material not seen for 25 years.

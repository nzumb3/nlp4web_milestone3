Improvisation is a much needed skill in New Orleans, in music an in life. So when Swiss musician Simon Berz and Dutch Artist Kaspar Koenig brought their art project 10x10to11 to New Orleans, building instruments from trash and inviting local artists to perform improvise with them, they tapped into an exciting scene of musicians and a city where the social factor is at the heart of music. Liquid Land follows these musicians and their performances, but finds its own visual language, creating a conversation between music and cinema.

Other Voices is a documentary film based on the testimony of Albert, a 21-year-old young man, diagnosed with Aspergers Syndrome. His thoughts inside a maze, the conversations he has with a friend from his town and a trip to Brussels visiting the Tintin Museum bring us closer to his particular way of living and understanding the world.

This feature-length documentary film is about a group of men exploring their vulnerable selves through a men's group in North Idaho. Eight men sit in a circle every Wednesday night, and fall and catch each other as challenges are faced. The film portrays Chris, Robert, Wayne and Thomas who are on their individual journeys toward realizing their purposes in life. Six months after joining the group, rookie Chris frees himself from his burden of his estranged father, while the group's oldest member, Robert, reaches for courage to embrace his relationship with his girlfriend. For Wayne and Thomas, the group is the ultimate support, as Wayne faces the loss of his business and Thomas faces the loss of his father.

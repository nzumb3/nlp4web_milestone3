Every Three Seconds
###BREAK###
In a world where so many are searching for meaning, we now have the opportunity, for the first time in human history, to be part of something absolutely amazing. We, the generations alive right now, could be the ones to end hunger and extreme poverty everywhere. We've cut both in half since 1970, and now it's time to finish the job...to make poverty history. EVERY THREE SECONDS tells the compelling stories of five everyday people (a kid, a college student, a thirty-something and two seniors) who stepped up and took action in the fight against hunger and poverty, and who, in the process, ended up both transforming themselves and changing the world.

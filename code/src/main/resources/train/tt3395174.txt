Posh Corps
###BREAK###
Posh Corps documents the personal stories of Peace Corps volunteers as they help develop rural villages in South Africa. Volunteers in South Africa struggle with extreme economic disparity, exceptional cultural diversity, and the lingering effects of Apartheid. They come to terms with their own expectations, and they speak out against the popular notion that South Africa is an easy assignment.

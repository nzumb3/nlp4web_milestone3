Lucas is 46. A great cop, running arms trafficking in Marseille. Maya is 25. A young narc in Paris. As they often do, guns meet drugs. And Lucas will meet Maya. Not necessarily by accident. Busts, heists, informants... their investigations will become entangled. So will their lives. Because their story began long before their meet-up.

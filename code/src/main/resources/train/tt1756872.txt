Wise Women of Sedona
###BREAK###
This documentary/art piece, the first film for Sedona filmmaker Kathy Douglas, is an exploration of the basic belief that wisdom is everywhere, asking what would happen if people took the time to look deeply in their own communities, what discoveries and treasures would be uncovered. The result is filled with spontaneous stories and intimate moments rich in wisdom. The women interviewed would not describe themselves as wise, although others who have taken time to know them probably would. To think that these are the only women in the areas around Sedona who have stories rich in wisdom would be to miss the point. Wisdom is not a person, it is a part of each of us, if we pause and listen deeply it is revealed.

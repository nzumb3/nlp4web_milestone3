Blokes
###BREAK###
Every few years best-mates Nudge, Magic and Two-Bags head into the Australian bush for a good dose of laughs, beer and fishing - but this year, things didn't quite go to plan .... Filmed in the visually stunning outback of North Queensland, Australia, 'Blokes' is a comical road-trip into both Mother Nature's bush and the politically-incorrect psyches of a blue-collar Aussie family-man, bed-bouncing bandicoot and romantically-rusty tragic. These blokes are off-work, off-road and off-ensive!

A Little Party
###BREAK###
Tom, a West Coast transplant, has just bought his first home in Los Angeles. Persuaded by Gabriella, his beautiful Italian girlfriend, he decides to throw a housewarming party. His old friends from Boston fly in to join his new friends from California. The guest list includes a shady lawyer, a straight-laced pastor, a TV-addicted real estate agent, a convicted killer, a karate-kid law student, a conflicted cop, a short-fused ex-Marine, and a mouthy Italian. When an uninvited, six-foot-six hitman - sporting dreadlocks, a top hat, and a bright pink shirt - shows up to collect a debt...the party's over.

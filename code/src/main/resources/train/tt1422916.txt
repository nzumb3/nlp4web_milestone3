One Hit from Home
###BREAK###
Baseball superstar Jimmy Easton returns home after a devastating knee injury cuts short his promising career. In search of a new purpose for his life, Jimmy faces dark memories from his past as he tries to make peace with a world he once left behind. His life takes a transforming turn when he is involuntarily thrust back into the world of baseball - not as a player, but as the coach of an underachieving college team struggling to rise above mediocrity. Coach Jimmy's rocky relationship with Brandon Elliott, the team's only star, forces both of them to deal with their similarly checkered pasts. One Hit From Home is a unique sports drama that explores the unpredictability of life and reminds us that we can find hope in the midst of broken dreams.

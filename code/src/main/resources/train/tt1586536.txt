Richard Gere is My Hero is a heartwarming, character-driven romantic comedy with political undertones by Tashi Wangchuk and Tsultrim Dorjee.The story follows a group of young Tibetan friends living in Mcleod Danj, India, headquarters for the Tibetan government-in-exile. Nyima, who calls himself Richard and is a great admirer of Richard Gere for his acting and activism, has dreams of also becoming a famous actor and helping his beloved motherland. While Nyima and his friends go on whirlwind adventures through the city, a love triangle almost detours them from meeting their goal of performing in the Tibetan Youth Congress drama competition. Through the escapades of Nyima and his friends, Wangchuk and Dorjee show us how the many layers of life-including the romantic and the political-can be imitated in art.

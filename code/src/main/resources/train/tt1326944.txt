Joe Farmer has a problem. It seems that he has some strange happenings in his cow pasture. Joe elicits the help of Detective Nilbert Futzman and his "crack" team of investigators (Dr. Patty Pyerson, a poopologist, Peter Panskey, a UFO expert and Ellen Burley, a psychic) to help him solve the mystery. What ensues is an adventure of idiotic proportions that raises the bar for idiocy to new idiotic heights!

The Quest for Suki
###BREAK###
The story of 22-year-old Julius Plum on his quest to avoid three things: a mysterious man in a suit trying to kill him, being thrown into prison for a crime he didn't commit, and most importantly, the self-realization that he might be a complete fool. Julius lives in a larger-than-life New Mexico, where 70 years ago the bitter War of New Mexico almost destroyed the Southwest, and as a result, everything today is a bit... stranger. A local museum proudly claims to hold 'The Bluest Painting in the World.' Caffeinated Malt Beverages are still legal. Brain-eating amoebas are harvested in glowing syringes. And a sinister plot is out to ruin Julius' life for no good reason. Sometimes life is just absurd.

Mommy, I'm a Bastard!
###BREAK###
A young filmmaker considers his adoption and the three distinct clans linked by his birth. But what begins as a tribute to kinship soon evolves into something different with the emergence of a lingering feud between his biological families. "Mommy, I'm a Bastard!" is a journey of self-exploration, a vibrant mix tape weaving threads of Hollywood, Cherokee chieftains, Reaganomics, Jews, WASPs, and misunderstanding.

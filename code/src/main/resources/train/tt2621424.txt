Broken Song
###BREAK###
Git, Costello and Willa Lee are street poets, hip-hop artists and songwriters from north Dublin. For these young men self-expression in the form of poetry, rap and song has become a spiritual experience. Their aim is simply to articulate the chaos that surrounds them and to fight it with their words and voices alone. In the end, the place where they live and their words are one and the same, constantly in flux, full of darkness and light. It is proof that these suburbs - that have bred darkness, murder and hate - have also inspired poetry and these unlikely artists are using words alone to fight back.

Minotaur
###BREAK###
A sardonic cinematic meditation on being a pop star. It recounts the desperate hours of a fictional performer who is equal parts Elvis Presley and Frank Sinatra. Not only does the Minotaur have the world on a string, but he has a hot tub shaped like a champagne glass, into which he lures unsuspecting beauty queens for the sole purpose of drug-addled kinkiness.

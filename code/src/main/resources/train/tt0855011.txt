Mrs. Ratcliffe's Revolution
###BREAK###
She left the land of Marks & Spencer and went to the world of Marx and Lenin. Mrs Ratcliffe's Revolution is a feelgood comedy following one dysfunctional family's journey from 1968 West Yorkshire to 19 below freezing East Germany and back again. Mr Ratcliffe fought for the cause, but his wife fought for their family: a teenage sex goddess, and a twelve year old communist spy. Will Mr Ratcliffe throw away his party card and fall in love with his brave new wife?

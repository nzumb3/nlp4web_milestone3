No Place Like Home
###BREAK###
Filmed in roughly one month between the end of October and the beginning of December 2005, Courtney Sell's film is an honest portrayal of "Defend New Orleans" Creator Jac Currie's life after Katrina and one of his first trips back to the Gulf Coast after being stranded in New York. It shows Defend New Orleans' transition to a valid social aid project and documents some of the destruction in New Orleans and on the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Shot entirely on a hand-held hi-8 video camera, No Place Like Home, features a moving soundtrack made by musicians personally connected with the subjects and interviews with friends who survived Katrina in New Orleans. It contains some of the earliest produced footage of Post-Katrina Mississippi.

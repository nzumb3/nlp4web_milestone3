Il lago
###BREAK###
Along the shores of a lake, man and a woman face together the autumn of their life. In a garden apparently located in Japan, a heron becomes the messenger of ominous forebodings. An elderly woman watches the innocent wisdom of the void. The meeting of two cultures and a love story that has endured the wear and tear of time, in the search for a deeper meaning to life and death, between the notes of a song and the verses of a poem.

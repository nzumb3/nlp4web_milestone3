Nowhere People
###BREAK###
Nowhere People tells the story of small town guys who happen to play music. Jeremy, their ringleader and bassist returns to town after some time in Seattle pursuing music, in hopes to bring the group together again for a local gig. As the rehearsal day progresses, so do the tracks on their third-rate demo tape, and through their music they take us on a journey about passions, failure and wanting to be someone in life.

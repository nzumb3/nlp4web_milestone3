Externsteine
###BREAK###
Externsteine takes as its subject the rock formation in north Germany which attracts neo pagans, new agers and neo Nazis to seasonal celebrations in which each cult relates Externsteine's extraordinary landscape to their own version of ecological , spiritual and political mythology. Using documentary and fictional means, Externsteine unravels how German Romanticism, contemporary political extremism and new-age spiritualism rework different ideas about history, myth, nature, community and human identity.

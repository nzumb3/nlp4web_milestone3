Maverick Mother
###BREAK###
Tired of waiting for the perfect partner, and alarmed by the deafening 'tic-toc' of her biological clock, 39 year-old filmmaker Janet Merewether decides to become a single mother by choice. She joins a waiting list for a donor insemination program, but while waiting has an affair with a Swiss man and falls pregnant. Her journey now becomes that of solo motherhood by chance. Janet documents her experiences through personal and at times irreverent video diaries and performed studio reconstructions. The film interrogates the nature of 'family' in contemporary western society and contemplates the past, present and future concepts of solo motherhood, and the attitudes of women who, rather than being 'left on the shelf' by men because they are too smart, too funny, too 'ugly', too talented or too independent, embrace their own sexuality and fertility to immerse themselves in life's greatest love and greatest challenge.

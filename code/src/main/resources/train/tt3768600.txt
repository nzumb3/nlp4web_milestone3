The Garage

The Garage' brings people together around stories, tall tales, and conversation. Located between the forest and the ocean on the North Shore, it provides a forum for support and solidarity between men, women, children and elders, who come together around Normand to do various repairs and to share local feasts including trout, clams, and moose.

A debuting filmmaker travels to a sparsely inhabited area, were his great-grandfather ruled a sugar factory. He talks with some indigenous about their need of land, their opposition to the "white man culture" and their traditions. The filmmaker looks at the rustic production methods of the indigenous and their frugal consumption lifestyle and claims to have "learned" the harmonious relationship that indigenous populations have with Nature.

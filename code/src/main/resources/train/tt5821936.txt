"Cartoon Camera" traces the history of animation camera techniques used by Disney animators from the earliest days of makeshift down-shooter cameras and the groundbreaking Multiplane Camera of the 1930s to camera capture techniques of today and beyond. Host Leonard Maltin explores the history of Cartoon Camera at the Disney Studio, with insights from the people who created the movie magic from Disney Legends Don Iwerks and Ruthie Tompson, a pioneer for women behind the camera, to contemporary "digital cameramen" Tom Baker, Terry Meows, and Evan Goldberg.

###BREAK###
When selfish artist, Jason Winters, lost his girlfriend Gabby to a shady gallery owner, he intended to get even. Unfortunately for him, the target of his revenge is also a target of the FBI. Together with best friend, the lackadaisical Kip, Jason quickly finds the comeuppance plan they've hatched is spiraling into something out of their control in increasingly unexpected and ugly ways. As the three find themselves entangled in the unfathomable, they not only need to unravel the tripwire web that ensnares them, but also what's real within themselves. In a society where what's wrong is right, how can three people seek out a truth higher than desire and life itself?

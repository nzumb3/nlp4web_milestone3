100 Men
###BREAK###
Gay men have never had it so good. The degree of social acceptance they have now was unimaginable half a century ago. This film charts that revolution through a countdown of 100 men, just a few of the men that director Paul Oremland has had sex with over four decades. But this is not a film about sex; it's a film about social change - told through the prism of Paul's journey as he meets up with men he has not seen for years.

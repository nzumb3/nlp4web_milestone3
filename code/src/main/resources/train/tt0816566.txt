Loose Change
###BREAK###
The salesman, the criminal and the mama's boy; for Dean, Jake and Tommy times are tough, jobs are scarce and the money is tight. Three friends living in an ordinary town with ordinary lives have an extraordinary idea only it's the most ridiculous thing they have ever attempted. With Dean's exceptional skills of persuasion, and the help of Jake's criminally eccentric partners, Lendo and Cornelius, they decide to change the rules of opportunity with the possibility of riches in the most unexpected of places. Within the Inner City Shopping Mall is the score of the century; maybe. Armed with conventional supplies, black face paint and their skewed sense of loyalty they focus their energy on the blue rippling water of the Mall's wishing fountain, and the treasure laying at the bottom. Loose Change, what do you wish for?

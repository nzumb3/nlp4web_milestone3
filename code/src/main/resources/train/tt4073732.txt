I spent weeks filming in Marseille's Quartier nord, a district of the city mainly known in the media for its drug trafficking, gang shootings and kalashnikovs. There, I met an amazing person, named Yvan Sorel. He runs a MMA (Mixed martial Arts) club in the middle of this neighbourhood. Day after day, all on his own, with no support from the state, which gave up on this area a long time ago, he fights to keep the children and teenagers on the right path. It's a film about violence, education, moral values, faith and dignity.

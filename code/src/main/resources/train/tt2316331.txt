With the unique involvement of the music teacher, the children learn soon how to play an elite instrument. Gino Romero Ramirez came as a young man from Colombia to Europe to study music. He lived for a long time with the fear of deportation, but now he has a German passport and teaches violin for living. The project is unique in Hamburg and is funded by donations. About one-third of the students come from Gypsy families, children of Turkish, African, Indonesian, Serbian and Central American origin. A touching film for parents and educators.

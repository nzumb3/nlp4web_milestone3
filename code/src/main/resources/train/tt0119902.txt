Stuart's roommate/co-worker, Ricky, is a struggling actor who cannot get an acting job and frets about his hair turing gray and meeting the perfect woman. Stuart and Ricky are friends with Jack and Clare Sadler, a couple trying and trying to concieve a baby, but cannot get it done. Finally there's Gina, Clare's younger sister, who cannot stand letting go of her past as well as being alone at family get togethers and tries bringing an assortment of dates to each gathering.

Ordinary Extraordinary Junco: Remarkable Biology From a Backyard Bird
###BREAK###
Say hello to the Junco, a common and abundant, yet amazing and diverse, group of songbirds. The same bird that can be found in the backyards of millions of North Americans has played a starring role in scientific discoveries for nearly a century. From the Appalachian mountains of Virginia to Wyoming's Grand Tetons--to remote highland sites in Mexico and Guatemala--to a small Pacific island 200 miles offshore--join researchers in their quest to understand evolution, animal behavior, physiology, and genetics by studying the Ordinary Extraordinary Junco. Designed for public and student audiences, this feature-length (88 min.) film is comprised of eight shorter (3-20min.) segments suitable for use as teaching modules.

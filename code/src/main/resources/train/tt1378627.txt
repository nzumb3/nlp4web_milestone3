Aimless
###BREAK###
Aimless is the interwoven tale of three unconventional people looking for direction in life. Nathan is a jaded businessman, whose business just happens to be espionage and assassination. Percy is a balding sad-sack - a man so wretched he considers a mouse called Alan his best friend. And Zara is only a hair's breadth from returning to the insane asylum, which is unfortunate as she's about to get a nasty surprise. As our three protagonists find themselves swirling down the plughole of life, it's up to them to grab onto the greasy sink-hair of hope. They can either give up and admit defeat - or throw themselves headlong into new, confusing, and often frightening existences. With loved ones being kidnapped, mental states collapsing, genetic manipulation, vigilante violence, snipers, secrets, dead friends, clown fetishists, Glock-wielding mums, and two ever more confused narrators, it's hard to tell which option is more dangerous. Can Nathan, Zara and Percy escape their aimless lives - and do they even want to?

In My Life
###BREAK###
Shirley Templo (Vilma Santos-Recto) is a ruthless woman. Many people deal with her strong attitude only for fear of her cold stare, or her outlash. She works as a librarian in a school, and lives in a compound that is owned by her ex-husband, Benito Salvacion (Tirso Cruz III). Many of the Salvacion family members that live near the compound, even including her eldest daughter, Dang (Dimples Romana), plead with her to sell it so they can make a profit, and she can move to a more suitable living area.

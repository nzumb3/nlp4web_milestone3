Cilantro y perejil
###BREAK###
This is a comedy about couples within the same family, striken by crisis, leading to the philosophical and practical question: is it worthwhile to stay together? Susana and Carlos have been married for ten years. He works all day to survive the economic crisis, and she leaves him. Her younger sister, Nora, films the separation for a school project, and tries to save her own relationship with Jorge, a young rock and roll musician. Even the children of Susana and Carlos are not spared the conflicts. And Adela, Susana's grandmother, finds love with Genaro, an antiques aficionado. The answers and conclusions in the film are fun, unpredictable, and very human.

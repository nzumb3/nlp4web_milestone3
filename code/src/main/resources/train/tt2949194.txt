Common Ground show how the Mexican tradition of Day of the Dead is embraced - but also transformed - into a lively multicultural celebration in the U.S. Each November, the only gallery in Watsonville, California pulses with activity during its annual Dia de Muertos exhibit. Community members create a diverse array of altars, while reflecting on the lives of their loved ones, their own traditions, and what unites us.

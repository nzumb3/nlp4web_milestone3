As High as the Sky
###BREAK###
Margaret has always been a little... particular. But since being jilted by her fiance, her obsessive-compulsive behaviors are in overdrive. The last thing she needs is company. Showing up on her doorstep unannounced, Margaret's nomadic older sister Josephine (with ten-year-old daughter Hannah in tow) is initially an unwanted jolt to her carefully regulated life. But their playfulness eventually wins her over and she begins to loosen her neurotic control on life. However, when Margaret discovers the real reason for her sister's visit, she's forced to confront the betrayal... and the long suppressed grief at the root of her fastidious behaviors.

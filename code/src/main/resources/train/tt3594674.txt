Traffik Jam
###BREAK###
In this dark comedy we are put inside the head of the confused loner Edmund Valentine, as he battles depression and desperately tries to find appreciation and a sense of self worth. Completely filmed in a first-person narrative, we begin as the character contemplates his suicide, and continue through his life watching many half finished projects, failed human connections, docu-style observations, and misguided trains of thought. Filmed through out the boroughs of New York City, TRAFFIC JAM is the story of artistic integrity and a disillusioned search for honor.

Leimert Park: The Story of a Village in South Central Los Angeles
###BREAK###
This film documents and celebrates the deep spirit and the profound struggles of a small group of extraordinary artists and musicians who transformed a few blocks of modest storefronts in South Central Los Angeles into a vibrant and inspiring cultural oasis. The film focuses on the ex-homeless Richard Fulton, whose coffeehouse, Fifth Street Dick's, became a gathering spot for the community, and ultimately sparked a remarkable underground renaissance of African-American art and culture. Also included are interviews and performances by Dwight Trible, Lady Walquer Vereen, Kamau Daaood, John Outterbridge, Billy Higgins, Horace Tapscott, and more.

Beneath the Rock
###BREAK###
For generations a block in Brooklyn has been controlled by the local police brass. They run an illegal underground casino that lies beneath the bedrock, with the residents above serving as its work force. The residents have been content, until they are stricken with tragedy. Some of the residents will do anything to expose the criminals -- even set them up to destroy each other.

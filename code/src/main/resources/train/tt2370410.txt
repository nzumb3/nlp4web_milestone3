Revelation Trail
###BREAK###
A frontier preacher's life is destroyed when a gruesome power consumes the land; he now must make the choice to give in to ruin, or find his purpose in the fight against the mysterious undead. Joined by the town lawman (who has entirely different personal demons to confront), the two men learn the extremes they're willing to go to in order to make it to the next day, as well as the depths people will go to when they truly believe in something.

Jonna's Body, Please Hold
###BREAK###
Take the bizarre ride into the inner world of 'Jonna's Body,' where life's daily chaos is corralled by Pearl, Jonna's loyal, sassy internal receptionist, as she fields calls from a parade of off-beat body parts with never-ending needs. As we journey through Jonna's Body, we meet characters like Sgt. Coif, leading a battalion of unruly troops; Upper Back, frantically knotted and uptight; 'Uta' and 'Ula,' straining to be free from their brassiere imprisonment; and Jonna herself, a young woman trekking through life, heedless of the groans and grievances from the body she has come to take for granted. This innocent mayhem dives into darkness when Jonna's Body is invaded by two 'outsiders', killers with no regard for Jonna's Body, Jonna's receptionist or even Jonna's life. Suddenly, the body parts we've come to know through their hilarious conversations with Pearl must unite to battle the villains, and Jonna must rely on these neglected allies and somehow muster the strength to join them. Told through tour de force comedic writing, matched by a visual world of sumptuous vibrancy and playfulness, Jonna's Body, please hold shines equal parts light and dark - representing the universal trials and profound beauty of life itself.

Perhaps, for this reason, four possible successors have been invited to the main lounge: Victor, the most prestigious member of the organization; Satine, expert in all the internal ins and outs of the firm and who controls many of the wires that make up the power; the ancient Archimedes, a practiced and adept master with many years of experience; and Balthazar who is rising fast in the Firm. Soon all their true intentions would come to light.

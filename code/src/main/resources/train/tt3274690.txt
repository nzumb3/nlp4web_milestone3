Nathan's Kingdom
###BREAK###
Nathan's Kingdom is an imaginative coming of age drama about Laura, a 19-year-old outcast, who will not surrender Nathan, her 25-year-old autistic brother, to social services, and she takes him on an impossible quest to find a fictitious kingdom that only exists in Nathan's imagination, but proves to be so real; it changes their lives forever. To cope with the hardships of a broken home, Laura spent her younger years hiding her emotions and playing with her self appointed best friend, Nathan. Together, they invent a fictitious safe haven called "The Kingdom" and promise each other to one day find it. Ten years go by and adulthood sets in. Laura takes Nathan with her to live in Los Angeles while she works as a professional actress, but things don't go as planned. Nathan demands that they go find his kingdom and retaliates against her when she does not keep her childhood promise. Laura fails at her career and ultimately loses all hope in herself. With no money, no place to live, and nothing to lose, Laura decides to take Nathan on a road trip to find his kingdom.

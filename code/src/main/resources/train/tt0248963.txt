Malaysia's first digital film is an urban comedy set during one day in Kuala Lumpur. It features four entwined stories about desire, where people's paths cross in unexpected ways. A suicidal young man mourns the death of his step-mother, who had come into fatal contact with an apple. A bubbly DJ on the eve of her wedding catches her fiance in an unexpected sexual encounter. A dapper restaurant owner falls for his double. And a bookshop clerk resorts to black magic to get the attention of a girl with a fetish for cook-books.

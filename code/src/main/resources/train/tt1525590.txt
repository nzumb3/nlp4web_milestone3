You People
###BREAK###
"Kids just aren't into board games anymore!" That's exactly what board game creator Felix Steiner discovers after losing his job at one of the country's largest game producers, Molton and Benter. His luck suddenly changes along with fellow game creators, Patty and Jerry, when they accidentally stumble onto a new board game concept. They appropriately name their new creation "YOU PEOPLE", a game which revolves around ethnic stereotypes. Unlike the other boring, family-friendly creations of their pasts, You People is fast-witted, mean-spirited and extremely offensive, making it an instant hit. With a little help from "ego and greed", the creators of the audacious board game, find themselves at odds with each other about the managing of their new empire. Internal bickering ensues when the game fails to land on the shelves of the world's largest retailer, WOEMAX. Meanwhile, a disaster is brewing. Things backfire when Felix, Patty and Jerry realize that anyone who plays the game becomes unusually derogatory toward other cultures. The game's theme insights riots and mayhem in cities around the world, and puts the trio in the cross hairs of an angry public. Frantic about incoming death threats, Patty and Jerry flee to Mexico, leaving Felix holding the bag. With his life being threatened daily, a bitter break-up with his girlfriend-The Happy Waitress, and a nasty family curse- left by his adopted father, Felix will have to decide weather to reinvent the game with a more positive message, or join his friends in Mexico.

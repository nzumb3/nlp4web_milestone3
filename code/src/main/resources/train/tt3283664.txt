Sevkat Yerimdar
###BREAK###
Sevkat Yerimdar is a rather 'traditional' Turkish character most of us in Turkey met through the famous "Oldu Tesekkurler" (Ok, Thanks...) skits shared all around the social media. Sevkat Yerimdar, with his most prominent features of being ill-tempered and nosy, have risen among the other characters from the skits and after a short journey through television he is ready to meet the cinema audience. We talked to Turkish TV gurus, script writer Erol Hizarci and director Bulent Isbilen, about their project, the future of their sector and the current political climate of Turkey.

Liberia: The Secret War
###BREAK###
Deep in the jungles of Liberia and Sierra Leone, a new kind of war is born. Warlords take command. Boys turn into killers. But amidst the chaos, there's a hidden harmony. Part tribal. Part hip-hop. Part Hong Kong action. JuJu they call it. Produced ten years before BLOOD DIAMOND, LIBERIA: THE SECRET WAR focuses on JuJu magic, the life-force Liberians believe gives our world its very meaning. LIBERIA won at the Vues D'Afriques film festival, screened at the Vancouver International Film Festival - and has been used to teach post-colonial theory at the university level.

Outras Estórias
###BREAK###
Five stories by Brazilian writer Guimarães Rosa: in the hinterland of the State of Minas Gerais, Brazil, a man fears for his life after having killed one of the dire Brothers Dagobé, outlaws who have great influence over the region; a hitman asks a doctor what's the meaning of a name he has heard; in a farm, the landowner decides to share the use and property of the estate among his employees; a man falls in love with a girl, but she's said to have a dreadful disease; and the local butcher spends half of his time running after his mother and daughter, both utterly mad.

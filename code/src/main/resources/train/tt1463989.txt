A Different Conversation
###BREAK###
"A Different Conversation" explores the experiences of college students on a trip to Jerusalem. Drawing from multiple religious and cultural backgrounds, these students generated individual and collective narratives as to how religion is both relevant and alive today. Within the context of Jerusalem's political tensions, the students explored interfaith dialogue and the interactions of the many religious traditions that inhabit this sacred space. Moreover, this space induced moments of self-reflection - forcing them to better understand themselves as individuals in a rich religious community. This documentary approaches Jerusalem from a different perspective - one focused not on politics or violence, but on religion and the people it affects.

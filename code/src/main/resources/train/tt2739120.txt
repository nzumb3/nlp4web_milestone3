Stolen Education
###BREAK###
In 1956 eight students testified in a federal desegregation court case. As Mexican Americans, they were placed in three years of first grade as a way to discriminate against them by the all White school board, administration and faculty. Stolen Education documents the journey to recapture the remarkable story of the schoolchildren who changed educational history in Texas and to confront the continued inequity in public schools today.

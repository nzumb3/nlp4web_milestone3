Revenge of Mr. Willie
###BREAK###
Sexploitation at its finest, Revenge of Mr. Willie, serves up the terrifying tale of a penis brought back to life from the great beyond. Set in present day Los Angeles, Revenge of Mr. Willie utilizes the same conventions of B-grade "back-from-the-dead" horror films, scantily clad women and cheesy special effects, while adding a new twist. The characters aren't being stalked by a zombie or evil poltergeist, it's something much more terrible, a severed three inch penis that can fly!

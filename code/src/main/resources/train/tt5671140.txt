Deep in the jungle of southern Mexico lies the ancient Maya city of Uxul which is being investigated by researchers from the University of Bonn, Germany under the direction of Prof. Dr. Nikolai Grube. Since 2009, excavations have taken place each year and significant discoveries have been made. In 2015, the 'Uxul Archaeological Project' utilised new ways to document monumental architecture like pyramids and palaces: 'Scanning the End' tells the story of how researches use laser scanning and photogrammetry to create a digital copy of Uxul and demonstrate the advantages of digital archaeology.

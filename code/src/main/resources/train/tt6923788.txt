Tango on a Visit
###BREAK###
'Tango on a Visit' is a light-hearted documentary exploring the Argentine Tango as a highly-addictive social phenomenon - even for those living very far from Argentina. Five dancers from the Black Forest reveal their own personal and unique experiences. Soon, it's clear - tango is so much more than just a passionate-looking dance. Beautifully challenging - tango is no walk in the park!

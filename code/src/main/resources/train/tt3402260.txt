The Bride of Frankenstein
###BREAK###
The Bride of Frankenstein is a family friendly "not-so-horror" movie brought to you by SPHERE. Come and watch the Monster with the help of the wicked Dr. Pretorius cajole the good-intended Dr. Henry into making a Woman-Friend for the Monster. Enjoy this hilarious and smart comi-tragedy, presented in full theatrical SPHERE style. Prepare to be dazzled by the superstar studded cast and crew of the movie, all adults with developmental disabilities. This very special edition of this Classic was adapted and directed by Valerie Jensen and Emily Pambianchi.

Pigalle
###BREAK###
In the seedy neon-lit underworld of the Pigalle district of Paris, animalistic survival obscures all moral codes. Rival drug dealers use three minor figures as pawns in their murderous manoeuvres. Divine is a transexual, a performer in a club, the lover of Fifi, a man who's a street hustler and petty thief. Fifi, in turn, loves Divine but flirts with Véra, a striptease dancer and peep show attraction. When Divine is bullied into giving information to one drug dealer, the opposition uses Véra as bait to enlist Fifi as a hitman.

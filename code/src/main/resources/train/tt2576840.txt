Happy Birthday Woody Allen & Keep Going
###BREAK###
Happy Birthday Woody Allen & Keep Going is a farcical look at the independent film industry. A director and his friend loos cash on the way to New York City but still need produce a film, or else. No one is whom they seem and the boundaries between film and real life blur. The inspiration for Happy Birthday Woody Allen, And Keep Going came to Mr. Zawislak while in New York City completing an art project which featured a temporary art installation of his original art piece: Allen Gum in Times Square.

John of God the Movie
###BREAK###
Brandon, a down and out cameraman/wannabe-director gets the call of a lifetime. His assignment is to go to Congo/ Kinshasa and direct a documentary about John of God, a famous musician. The problem is, John of God is an over the top narcissist who never let's down his guard. He's hiding a terrible secret. Brandon hires a local producer, Guy, to organize the shoot for him. The problem is, Guy is not a real producer and has never met John of God. As a result, Guy has to find creative ways to get the job done. What we get is a comedy of errors and a film that is non stop fun from beginning to end.

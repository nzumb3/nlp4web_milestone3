For What It's Worth
###BREAK###
It's summer in northern California. The days are long, vineyards canvas the hillsides, and towering cottonwoods shade cool bends in the river. After selling her Silicon Valley start-up, forty-something Jen just bought a remodeled farmhouse and is moving to the wine country to live deliberately. Along comes Sonny, a smart, cocky 19-year-old with enough smarts and talent to be anything. But the only thing Sonny cares about is his job at the local antique store which is dealing in more than just furniture. Jen's busy contemplating her new life, and Sonny's busy casing her house. But, when they end up alone together, something unexpected happens, something that causes each of them to reconsider what they know about other people and themselves. Over the course of the summer, Sonny gets in deep with the wrong people, Jen gets in deep with Sonny, and by the time harvest rolls around, they're both headed for tough realizations and even tougher choices. For What It's Worth is the story of two people at very different stages in life who face the same modern question: in a world where so much of what we need is right at our fingertips, what is it we really want?

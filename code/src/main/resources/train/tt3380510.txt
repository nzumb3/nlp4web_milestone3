Brêngênging Sala
###BREAK###
Brengenging Sala is a story of life. It captures the essence of a particular place out of time. It's a time capsule for a culture, translating into pictures and sound something that escapes translation by words. It's six traditional markets and a thousand people going about their everyday lives. It's the collective energy of a civilization. It's pictures and noise, an artistic ethnography.

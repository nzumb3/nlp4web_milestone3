Skinning the Cat
###BREAK###
Ned is a frustrated man with a troubled background. Early one summer morning, he kidnaps Bruce, a successful business man used to getting what he wants. Ned takes Bruce to an abandoned warehouse and begins an interrogation that reveals deep secrets kept by both men. They are both changed by their time together, but neither knows if this change is for the better or not. Skinning the Cat is about taking responsibility for the past. Whether it was something we did, or had done to us, can we come to terms with what has happened and move forward? Skinning the Cat offers no answers, only possibilities.

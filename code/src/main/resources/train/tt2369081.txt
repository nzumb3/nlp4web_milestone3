Main Street Speaks
###BREAK###
The Economy! The Economy! The Economy! It's the single most important issue facing Americans today. This is the documentary Main Street has been waiting for: Campbell Films asks hard-hitting questions about the true human consequences of the economic downturn. But despite a consensus that times are tough, this film reveals the startling tenacity, strength, persistence and patience of the American people in the face of hardship. The interviews give a voice to everyday Americans as they struggle with housing, student loans, unemployment, loss of disposable income, hunger, loss of mobility, depression, and the very dire reality that their children will be facing a life with severely limited opportunities. These heartrending first-hand reflections on the economy, the government's responsibility, and how to cope with financial crisis will move you deeply. Listen, as members of the working class offer practical, inspired solutions and astute observations on how our country can recover from what one participant calls the "depression they're not telling us about". Hear from business owners about downsizing and the loss of savings and assets, and finally from two economists who shed light on the housing bubble, the disconnect between Wall Street and Main Street, and how stagnant wages are crippling the future of American markets.

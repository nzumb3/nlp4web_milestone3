Noseland
###BREAK###
NOSELAND is a humorous ode to the world of classical music and some of its star musicians. It features the world famous violinist Julian Rachlin and many other great classical musicians, alongside John Malkovich and Sir Roger Moore. Although it is a feature length documentary, it crosses genres into fiction and comedy. As a mockumentary it shows classical musicians like never before: private, crazy and authentic.

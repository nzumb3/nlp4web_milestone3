Light & Shadow
###BREAK###
A year and half in the making, shot simultaneously on and after Revenge of the Great Camera Shootout 2012, Zacuto presents a Steve Weiss film, Light & Shadow. If you have only one takeaway from Light & Shadow, let it be a reminder that cinematography, like all art forms, is something that comes from within. The technical can be taught, and anyone can pick up a camera and learn how to operate it. The big question is this: can it be learned or are you born with it? With or without this born talent, its still upon you to keep learning and honing your craft.

Invingatorii
###BREAK###
A period of time lived together with all four generations of CATUNA FAMILY, at there home, in the hamlet of POIANA CATUNENILOR. We are going to hear their stories about the old passed time or we are going to watch them how they work now in their place. A period as big as a history. We'll discover, by accompanying them, a life style that did not disappear entirely. Maybe at the end of this trip, we'll find out who we are and where we are coming from, what's the role of life in nature and - why not? - what's the real meaning of our existence in a certain time and space.

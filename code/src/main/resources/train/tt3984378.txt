In the Mind of the Damned
###BREAK###
A young man has a series of strange dreams which fade further and further into reality until they are indistinguishable from his real life. Following a mind altering experience, the main character is confronted with a somewhat aloof good spirit and a much more direct evil spirit that try and point him back to reality. Meanwhile the dreams only become more intense.

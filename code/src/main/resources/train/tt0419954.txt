McDull, Prince de la Bun
###BREAK###
To secure a better future, Mrs Mc sends her son McDull (who is a piglet attending kindergarten) to many different classes and she has also bought her grave on mortgage. Inspired by J K Rowling, Mrs Mc tries her hand at writing. At bedtime, she tells McDull the story she wrote although McDull keeps asking her to read him Harry Potter instead. The story she wrote is actually the story of McDull's father, McBing, Prince de la Bun.

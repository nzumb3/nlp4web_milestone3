Is the father of her Alien/Human hybrid twins an Alien, an Angel, or the Anti-Christ? Kendra dreams that she has had Alien twins abducted from her by an advanced species of Aliens. When her husband takes her to see a doctor, she is told she can't have children. She sees a hypno-therapist, Dr. Farrell, who uncovers lost memories of her abduction and impregnation. Kendra joins a UFO support group and visits Area 51 where she witnesses secret government tests of captured UFO's.

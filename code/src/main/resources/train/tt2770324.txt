Rome, 2012 50 years of Italian history retraced through sticker albums, collections, exchanges, games. Angelo is 50 years old, and has one and only, insuppressible desire: to find the last sticker he needs to finish an album that he started when he was 10. Among psychoanalysis, amazing encounters, football players from the past and famous and unknown collectors, a tender and surreal journey around Italy, between past and present, following the Peter Pan that hides within each and every one of us.

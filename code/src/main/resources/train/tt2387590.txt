MONTESPANA brings together two outstanding professional guitarists, Jose Cortes, "El Pirata", a Flamenco master from Granada, Spain, and John McLellan who performs throughout the United States with the group "The Clintons". They attempt, via the Internet and Skype, to create a song together, bridging thousands of miles and centuries of cultural differences. The film was shot on location in Spain and Montana.

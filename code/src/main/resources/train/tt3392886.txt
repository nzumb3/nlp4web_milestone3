###BREAK###
Since his childhood, Tiao Nithakhong Somsanith, a descendant of the vice-king from the former monarchy of Luang Prabang in Laos, has been initiated to the arts of the Court, the jewel of which is the art of gold embroidery. Today, immigrated in France, he carries on this creative tradition that tightly links him to the land of his ancestors. The embroiderer artist, filmed both in his adoptive city of Orléans and in Luang Prabang where he was born, shows the richness of the technique and symbols of his art. Through this work of memory, he also reveals the double fight he is conducting to save this unique heritage and, at the same time, try to rebuild a personal life in exile.

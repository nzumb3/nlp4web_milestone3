Rabbit Stories
###BREAK###
Meet Ted and Kate, a miserable suburban couple who destroy the last of their marriage battling for the affections of a secondhand motorcycle in a bazaar love triangle. Then there's Mac and Lila who fall in love through Plexiglas as Mac counts his final days on death row. And last but not least, there's Nadine, who endures a torturous and ridiculous spiritual purification process by ashram cult members in hope of settling an old score with her long lost father...the cult leader. Lives and loves intersect in meaningless ways, soul mates come as strange bedfellows, and in the end love is a lot of things, but mostly...love is weird.

Park
###BREAK###
It's noon at a remote foothill park in Los Angeles: April is there to commit suicide; Krysta and Dennis tryst in his car while her co-worker Ian waits in a dog-shampooing van; Dennis's wife Peg and her best friend Claire have followed Dennis and plan guerrilla warfare; and four 20-somethings from the same office are talking in a van. April seeks Ian's help (lubricant, a hose, a lighter) and he asks if he can join her; Claire and Peg trap the lovers in Dennis's car then have a heart to heart; Nathan and Babar disclose to Meredith and Cheryl that they are nudists while Meredith insists the men are gay. Disrobing and disclosures follow. Is it just another day in L.A.?

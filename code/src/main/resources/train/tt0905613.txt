Hamlet in the Hamptons
###BREAK###
Daisy and Julia rent a beach house in the high class area of the Hamptons for the summer. Adrian is a former lover of Julia visiting his friend Max and staying with billionaire Jet Sinclair. Over a week of parties, affairs, arguments and drugs, the men circle Julia with desire. While trying to keep Daisy away off drugs, Julia tries to decide between Max and Jet. Filmic references abound in this intelligent American independent production that takes a scalpel to the shallow over-belly of rich youth. Low budget and shot on grainy black and white, Love in the Hamptons is reminiscent of early Jarmusch and hopefully presages a new talent.

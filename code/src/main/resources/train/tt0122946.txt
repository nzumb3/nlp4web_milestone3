Animal Room
###BREAK###
Exasperated over their lack of viable solutions to problem students and growing school violence, teachers and school administrators institute a trial program whereby they can lock away those kids who "don't fit into the mainstream profile." Brainy malcontent Arnold Mosk - despite strenuous objections from his school counselor - is labeled a trouble student and herded into the program for dropping acid to escape his problems, both those at school and at home. While old friend Gary Trancer tries to reconnect with and support Arnold, sociopath Doug Van Housen takes cruel delight in leading his gang of violent school thugs to torment and bully those around him, especially Arnold, leading to tragedy.

A former hippie-turned-messiah, his wife, and their son - a wunderkind artist, writer, and inventor - flee the conservative Bulgarian society on their chaotic Noah's Ark constructed inside a crumbling basement in downtown Sofia. He Who Travels Alone examines this family over the span of a decade, offering an intimate look at their self-imposed exile into eccentricity and their dogged pursuit of spiritual growth.

Debutante
###BREAK###
'Debutante' is a documentary film that explores why young women still bow to society. Debbing is a rite of passage, designed to bring a young woman into adulthood. The film follows the experience of high school senior, Cassidy Cloninger who joins a debutante class in her home town of Cary, North Carolina. She participates in a six months regime leading up to the Cary Debutante Ball Society's gala. Cassidy's an athlete, a star on her school's swim team, and at first is dubious about being a debutante. It's going to cost several thousand dollars and plenty of time and effort. It involves exhaustive shopping for the perfect dress, formal photograph sessions, throwing and attending formal parties and learning the ropes of proper attire, manners and decorum. There will be many hours of dancing lessons for her, her dad, her date and the 16 other Cary Debutantes who she doesn't always get along with. All of this is to prepare for the big 'Cinderella' night of the Cary Debutante Ball in December, 2007.

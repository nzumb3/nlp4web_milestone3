A comedy about ordinary people taking part in a dance competition. China hosts the Olympics for the first time. The whole country is excited. The forgotten generation, the same age as Red China - once passionate in their youth, then sent to the countryside in every corner of China for re-education - wants to be a part of it. A group of people - a security guard in his middle age crisis, a desperate housewife, a fame-seeker and her admirer, an odd couple at their fifties, started their own dance team. They practiced; they dreamed; they struggled. Is this for real or it is just a dream?

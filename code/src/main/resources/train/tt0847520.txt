Scar
###BREAK###
While driving to her hometown Ovid, Colorado, to visit her sheriff brother Jeff and niece Olympia, Joan Burrows recalls her traumatic experience with best friend Susie when they were teenagers. Joan and Susie, smoking pot in a cemetery, decided to snoop on Bishop the caretaker at the funeral home. Joan falls and hurts her knee, so Bishop, having found them, invites the girls inside to clean the wound. Soon they are sedated with chloroform and submitted to a cruel torture - a sick game where Bishop tells each girl to ask him to kill the other to stop their own suffering. When a copycat killer starts killing Olympia's classmates, Joan tells police that Bishop is back (or someone who looks just like him) but nobody believes her.

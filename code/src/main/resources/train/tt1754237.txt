Music High
###BREAK###
Jazz was the orchestra conductor of a highly acclaimed music program at a prestigious public school until everything went downhill after a budget was cut and a principal was punched. With his teaching career in jeopardy, he finds himself at San Diego High School. Now Jazz must turn around an unruly classroom deeply divided by cliques and varying music genres. His first attempt at unification fails catastrophically, but with the help of a new teacher's assistant, Ms. Candi Piper, Jazz proposes an idea that could shake up the status quo and motivate the students to become the artists they have the ability to be. But, could forces within and outside the school cause the demise of Jazz's plans?

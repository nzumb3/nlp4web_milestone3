Nightfur
###BREAK###
An introspective astrophysics major visits a remote lab to work with his mentor, Dr. Roberts. After his arrival, he finds that a young woman from the metaphysical side of the fence has been taken in by the doctor. She is found to be sensitive to a mysterious signal coming from the depths of space. The unexplainable phenomena that occur force Frank and Dr. Roberts to look at life from a different, unscientific, angle. When Helen's forest dwelling spiritual guide enters the mix they find that logic, love, and jealousy become easily entangled in the presence of the unknown. Nightfur is a quirky, surreal romance film with elements of science fiction and fantasy. The film features music by world renowned Band Of Horses, The Parson Redheads, The Stevenson Ranch Davidians, Lucy Langlas, Black Nile, and more.

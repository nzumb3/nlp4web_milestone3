Memorias del Futuro
###BREAK###
A woman writes love letters to a man who has abandoned her. Her passion and frustration intermix with the larger chaos of Mexico, drawing a parallel where a single personal tragedy mirrors the struggle of an entire country trying to find itself. Linking a film-essay to a direct cinema style, its visceral images reflect an adventurous production that led a pair of filmmakers through a four-month journey, living in a minivan on the back-roads of Mexico.

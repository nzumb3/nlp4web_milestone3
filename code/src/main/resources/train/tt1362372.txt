Margaret has few options after her girlfriend dumps her - alone and out of work in a week-to-week motel, she is literally going nowhere. On tv, blonde anchorwomen drone, giving quirky factoids and heart-wrenching tragedies equal airplay. Tv-time is fast-paced and alluringly painless - out of desperation, margaret imagines herself the heroine in a daytime tv drama. The heroine's husband has served divorce papers, but rather than submit, she is living on the lam in her suv after abducting their six-year-old son. Margaret's heroine also feels powerless, however this hyped version of herself moves throughout the city facing obstacles and taking action - her television version of herself has an arc and an ending - and margaret is transfixed.

Cupid's Requiem
###BREAK###
Will Powell rouses himself awake from a deep sleep. He lights a cigarette then slowly meanders into the next room where his ex-girlfriend, Andrea Wilson, is duct taped to a chair. He sits across from her as though this is a completely sane manner in which to explore their recently broken relationship, and he and begins to tell her how much he misses her and wants her back. What follows is a journey into their failed relationship. It is a funny, poignant, visceral retrospective. The verbal war the two wage ultimately reveals two equally flawed and damaged young people whose relationship sadly served only to enhance and magnify their respective imperfections.

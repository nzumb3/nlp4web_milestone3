Cathy and Martin Ward, a stereotypical North American suburban couple, fight for years to adopt five siblings from a remote Ukrainian orphanage. When they finally succeed, a new drama unfolds. A sensitive and emotional oldest girl Yuliya, who is eighteen, finds it unbearable to accept that the younger siblings don't need her care and protection any more. She forms much stronger bond with her adoptive father Martin than with Cathy, her adoptive mother, and rebels against suburban values. Yuliya's struggle to find her place in a new family becomes an ultimate test of her adoptive parents' ability to love unconditionally.'

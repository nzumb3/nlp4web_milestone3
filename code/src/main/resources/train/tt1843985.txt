###BREAK###
Four time zone changes, 4,000 miles, lakes, rivers, prairies, gorges, and mountains; This is MichCanSka. We began with a lap around the famous SOO - 500 Racetrack in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, and we ended the ride atop the 'Top of the World Highway' in Tok, Alaska. The geographical highlights are nothing short of spectacular, and the journey is sure to endure the test of time. This trip of a lifetime has become an epic adventure bound for the history books of organized snowmobiling. Completed on March 8, 2010, in 21 days, by 54 determined riders, MichCanSka was a word that never existed before. MichCanSka now represents a dream for so many who live with Diabetes. It marks the beginning of a North American journey for a cure.

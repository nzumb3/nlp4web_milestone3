The Craic
###BREAK###
Two Irish actors (Jimeoin McKeown, Alan McKee) flee from 1988 Belfast after a violent confrontation with a leader (Robert Morgan) of the IRA and illegally enter Australia. Seeking acting work, the two fear immigration officers. McKeown happens to get selected as the bachelor on a TV dating game and wins a trip to Queensland just as the pair's apartment is raided by immigration. McKee escapes just in time and joins his friend. Meanwhile, the IRA leader is sent to Australia in a witness protection program after he gives up some of his former colleagues. The two then spend the remainder of the movie being pursued by the immigration officers and the vengeful IRA head.

Daughter
###BREAK###
Celebrity reporter Kate Reynolds has the career that every young starlet in Hollywood dreams of. Fame, family, fortune. That is until, everything comes crashing down at once. On a journey of self-discovery, Kate seeks out her parent's childhood home - a small town in Tennessee, where maybe she can start over. Here she meets a local conspiracy theorist and self-proclaimed expert on the mythological chupacabras - and learns that not everything is what it seems.

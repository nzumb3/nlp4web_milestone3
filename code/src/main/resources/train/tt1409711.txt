T Is for Teacher
###BREAK###
This documentary charts the experiences of four trans-gendered school teachers who wish to transition whilst employed within the North American school system. Director Rohan Spong travels to New York, Minneapolis, New Mexico and Arizona to interview these teachers about their struggles and triumphs, covering issues such as gendered bathrooms, the impact of transition on students and the depiction of trans-gendered people by mainstream American media. Along the way, he engages students, parents, school administrations, a newspaper editor and conservative church groups in a discussion about the lessons learned from bearing witness to these remarkable trans-women's courage.

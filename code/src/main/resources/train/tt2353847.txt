Blanc
###BREAK###
Private Detective Jack Holiday (James Davies) is back in LA. But why he's returned, and more importantly, why he left, unravels four years earlier. Coerced into an unlikely alliance with crooked cop Tony Malloy (Darren Freebury-Jones), Holiday finds himself riding shotgun into the belly of the criminal underworld, caught up in a web of murder and double-cross that stretches from the gutters of downtown to the corridors of Beverly Hills. This is the story of a man searching for answers. This is the story of a man searching for redemption. This is the story of the men who wish to destroy them both. This is the story of Blanc.

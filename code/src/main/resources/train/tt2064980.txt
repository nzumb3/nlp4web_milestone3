Theatre of the Deranged
###BREAK###
Andy the Arsonist wishes you the warmest of welcomes to his Theatre Of The Deranged for a wild night of thrills, chills and spills. Under the eerie light of his dusty projector, your host and resident pyromaniac will treat you to five short films from some of the best horror writer/directors in the indie scene. He'll take you on a demented adventure across the English countryside, through surreal backyards and nightmarish homemade homicides, only to be eaten alive by award-winning adult film sensation Sophie Dee. But first, for the sickest of amusements, he'll pay your admission to a sinister carnival along with horror legend Shawn C. Phillips. As you witness fortunes told and fates sealed, you'll wonder when this dark, mysterious venue opened for business, and whether you'll ever escape.

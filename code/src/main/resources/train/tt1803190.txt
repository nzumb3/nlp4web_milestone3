What do you do when the man you loved lies dying of cancer and hands you a suitcase containing reels of undeveloped 8mm film? It's footage of an amazing trek made in 1976, high up in the Himalayas, that turned out to be a life-changing journey with irrevocable consequences. Mila's Journey follows Mila & her decision to return to India after more than 30 years. The film juxtaposes modern images with the old 8mm footage & pays homage to romance, adventure, spirituality, freedom and female independence. The film shows one Dutch woman's attempt to answer the question 'what would happen if I went back?'

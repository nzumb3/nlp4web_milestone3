###BREAK###
An old roll of film from the summer 1965 shows a party in an apartment on Fersens road in Malmö. It shows local popidols from bands like Namelosers and Gonks, but also common pop guys and girls. They gather around some exclusive guests: Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones from Rolling Stones - the first international popband that visits Malmö. 40 years later the film creators meets some of the guests at the party. Rolling Like a Stone is a documentary about the people who had their identity shaped during the years in the mid-sixties. It is also a film about the difficulty of growing old with your dreams, and living in the present.

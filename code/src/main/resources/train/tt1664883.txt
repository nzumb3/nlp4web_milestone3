Streets of My Childhood
###BREAK###
Follows the personal journey of the filmmaker, who miles away from her home country of Iran, is left to be a distant witness, a distant witness to tragedies that affect her in unimaginable ways. This film is a tribute to the Green Movement of July 2009, and those who with courage stood up against the violence of the regime and used the contemporary media to project their voices.

A Season of Love
###BREAK###
Migratory birds visiting south Indian coastal villages from Central Asia and other places build a unique relationship with the local community. While migration in birds is motivated by needs of survival, people's response to them has evolved over the years in the face of changing conditions of life and environment. The perceptions of migratory birds among people fall into a fascinating cycle of human faith and caution within which the birds negotiate their instincts for survival and continuation of life. In the mode of a personal journey, the filmmaker tells the story of people's conditions and awareness while revisiting a few villages and habitats, and reflects on traditional, non-activist mode of conservation wherein visiting birds symbolize a graceful notion of a season of love.

Toxicity: Hunters Point
###BREAK###
After years of toxic waste dumping by the Navy, residents of the impoverished neighborhood of Hunters Point, San Francisco are being affected by the harmful contaminants in the air and water. Hunters Point was categorized as a SuperFund site in 1989, declaring it as one of the most toxic sites in United States. Despite that, the neglect given by the Navy is appalling, even till this day. This documentary intends to expose the human side of this forgotten site and the negative implications that the government continues to ignore.

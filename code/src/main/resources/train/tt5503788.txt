###BREAK###
This is a unique theatrical interactive movie about a girl trapped by a psycho-killer in an abandoned sanitarium. She must find a way to escape the maze-like facility and potentially help those who are also trapped there. The audience members who want to participate in the movie give their cellphone numbers to the producers before the movie plays. During the movie, the girl tries to phone someone over a cellphone and randomly chosen audience member's cellphone number is dialed. The movie lets the chosen audience member to decide what course of action the girl should take next. The audience member says over the phone what the girl should do next and then unique voice recognition technology developed specifically for this interactive project uses this to select which of the prerecorded responses the girl will give that's in relation to what the audience member has said. This way, a unique illusion is created that the girl is actually talking to the audience member. Each time a decision needs to be made a different cell number will be dialed. These decisions range from which path to take and which item to examine to which, if any, person in danger there the girl should help. There are multiple endings ranging from gruesome to good.

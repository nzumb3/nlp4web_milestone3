Growing numbers of men and women believe the city is a maze. They are leaving their jobs, their families, their entire lives behind. Every day, they walk the streets, opening doors. They are searching for a door they are convinced has been lost for thousands of years: the exit. What's behind it? Something else. Something new. Using a strange system of maps, symbols and measurements, one believer - Alice - now thinks she has found it.

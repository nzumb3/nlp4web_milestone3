Ten years after the crime of embezzling funds from the company is pinned on him, Fred takes matters in to his own hands when his Lawyer proves to be slapdash in handling the case. He realizes Mr. Kitinda is working behind his back with the Company lawyer to coerce him into accepting the allegations and pocket a small amount to annul the case. Justice being his impetus, and his wife's life hanging on the thread, he wills himself to counter their motives and wrecks havoc at his lawyer's residence.

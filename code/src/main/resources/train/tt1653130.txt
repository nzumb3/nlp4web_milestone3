Damaged Goods
###BREAK###
Damage Goods is a comedy with a serious heart. Twenty-one year old Delk was removed from his birth family at the age of three and put in the care of gay foster carers David and John with whom he still lives. Twenty-three year old Josh has just broken up with his girlfriend, telling her he is gay. Following a series of chance meetings the two find themselves in the same restaurant. After a promising first kiss and conversation, they leave alone and it is left up to Delk's friend Rowan to get the two together while he hooks himself up with Josh's ex-girlfriend in the process. Josh & Delk's first arranged date quickly goes pear shaped when Delk runs into the 'Wicked Bitch of the North'.

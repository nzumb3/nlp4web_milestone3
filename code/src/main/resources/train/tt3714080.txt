'The Next Step' is the story of the quiet and self-conscious Richard Floyd, along with his three friends Will, Myles, and Stew. Upon entering their last year of high school, and knowing that after graduation the four will all be going on their separate ways, they decide to make it a year to remember and do anything they can think of together. However, when Richard meets the new girl Holly and quickly become almost inseparable, tension slowly builds between Richard and his friends, especially Will, who feels neglected and alienated by Richard. Things don't improve when Richard begins to think he's falling in love with Holly, even though she had insisted that they remain only friends.

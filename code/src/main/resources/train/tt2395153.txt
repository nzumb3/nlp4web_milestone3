Benjamin Wolf
###BREAK###
Wolf, Carlos and Dum Dum join the same gang, but have no idea of each others existence, until they are classified together for an assassination. An unfortunate turn of luck ensures that the mission fails and their leader gives the men, out of frustration, an impossible last-change task to prove their loyalty to him. In the meantime, a rival gang has hired a professional hitman to kill the men before completing the task, and also has a personal feud with one of them.

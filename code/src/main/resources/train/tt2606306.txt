The film follows five orphan brothers (all cast by real-life biological siblings) who struggle to survive together in a desolate Appalachian community riddled with economic stress. Over the course of one summer, they each make a personal journey of their own, whether it be catching a legendary fish that resides in the lake or committing various crimes about the town to support the family. Their endeavors later lead to rifts in their relationships, and in turn, become testaments to the strength of brotherhood.

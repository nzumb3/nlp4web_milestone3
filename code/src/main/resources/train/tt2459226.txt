Elephants Cannot Jump
###BREAK###
On 2008 we went on a trip to Asia in search of elephants. Soon we realize the main part of these animals was threatened: the ones domesticate are forced to work and the wild have not space to live in the jungle. As we got involved deeper in Asian culture and researched on the Asian elephant's reality, we realized that it was far more complex than what it seemed at first, a big contradiction: elephants are a mythological symbol of greatness and good luck, but in the reality there is no respect for them. We found a hope for the future in a project than look forward educate people from Asia an the rest of the world, in order to create consciousness for this majestic animal.

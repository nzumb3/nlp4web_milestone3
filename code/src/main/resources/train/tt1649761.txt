Harvest of Innocents: Investigating Chinese Organ Murder
###BREAK###
Tens of thousands of Falun Gong practitioners may be being murdered for their organs in China. The Chinese government denies this, but four years after the allegations surfaced, three separate investigations have uncovered compelling evidence that Chinese courts, hospitals, labor camps, and prisons are involved in a conspiracy to illegally execute imprisoned Falun Gong practitioners and harvest their organs for profit. 'Harvest of Innocents' brings together these investigations in the hope that the issue of Chinese organ murder can be addressed and resolved by both China and the world. 'Harvest of Innocents' also examines the history of China's transplantation industry, the origin and context of the allegations, and the response of the international community.

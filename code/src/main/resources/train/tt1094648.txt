Mothers
###BREAK###
The stories of conflicts and private dramas, that recount history, are revealed through the experiences of mothers who live in war ravaged lands, with the ever constant fear that their children will never return. The pain of losing a child, whether he be victim or killer, is profound, destructive, unjust and senseless. The suffering caused by the loss of a relative is universal whatever the race or creed. Israeli and Palestinian mothers, who have experienced such terrible drama, help us to understand it through their accounts. The mothers who testify all have different viewpoints, social and cultural backgrounds yet they all agree that no more innocents must pay for faults which are not their own. They are stories of pain and anger in a land where forgiveness no longer exists. The parents of the Parents Circle (the only organization which unites Palestinian and Israeli parents of victims) explain how they are trying to build a better future for the generations to come.

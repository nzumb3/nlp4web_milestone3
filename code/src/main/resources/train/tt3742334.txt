Drawing the Line
###BREAK###
Drawing The Line is a revealing tale about Australia's oceans and the men and women who depend upon it for their livelihood. The ocean is a fickle mistress, friend one day foe the next, but the Australian Fishing Industry faces a threat that is far greater than any they immediately face at sea. Australia is currently in the process of implementing the world's largest marine reserves network, in doing so the Australian Government has turned its back on the science and an industry that is a world leader in responsible fishing and environmental practices. Drawing The Line is a warm, larger than life tale, of characters that are in a fight for the survival of their rapidly contracting industry. A story of champions, working for the betterment of the environment and a country that may well turn its back on them.

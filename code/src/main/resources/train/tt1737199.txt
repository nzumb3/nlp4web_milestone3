La casa por la ventana
###BREAK###
On New Year's Eve, Julio Saez Jr. (Walter Cornas, Filmatron, El Hada Buena), a recently graduated architect, under pressure from his father, throws a party. The plan is that he will rub shoulders with high society, but this night he discovers the problems of being a host he must overcome. His house fills with young rock 'n' rollers, and everything really starts to escalate when his uncle, an ex-rock star Lorenzo Saez (Miguel Barriga, of the Chilean cult band Sexual Democracia), shows up seeking refuge at the party from a pair of extravagant moneylenders. Julio will have an unusual night, and this will certainly be the party of a lifetime.

A Positive Peace
###BREAK###
'A Positive Peace' documents the creation of 'A More Convenient Season' - a contemporary, multimedia classical work for orchestra, all female choir, and 4 young soloists. Arts patron Tom Blount commissioned Brooklyn based composer Yotam Haber to write this piece in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the 1963 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. This film follows the composer, the singers, and a talented team at UAB's Alys Stephens Performing Arts Center, as they produce and premiere an amazing work of art about a seminal turning point in our nation's Civil Rights Movement.

The Tour: The Legend of the Race
###BREAK###
The Tour - The Legend of the Race sheds a new light on the last 100 years of the Tour de France, now considered one of the world's most popular sporting events. The Tour has lived through a century of rich history, with ups and downs, triumphs and scandals, continually evolving with the times. Throughout it all one key characteristic has remained the incredible power of identification the public has with the Tour cyclists, mythical figures that seem accessible and inaccessible at the same time. In order to reflect this human dimension of the Tour, the film tells the story through a selection of its emblematic heroes. Emblematic of the Tour, but also emblematic of an era, embodying in the film their generation: Coppi, Bobet, Anquetil, Poulidor, Merckx, Hinault, Indurain, Armstrong... Fully archive-based and colorized, "The Tour" cleverly weaves together all these individual stories with the story of the Tour de France itself, with the goal of creating a timeless and epic sports saga.

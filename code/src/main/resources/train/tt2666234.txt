Creating America's Next Hit Show
###BREAK###
A comically sexy, wild and crazy story about an independent producer's efforts to create, produce and distribute a half hour hit scripted comedy TV Show and what that show feels like shot with a couple different casts. The glitz of ENTOURAGE, the fashion of UGLY BETTY, the bizarre entanglements of DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES, our series has it all and more. Why? Because it's set in Aspen, playground for the rich and famous where people indulge in all the excesses of life, pause to wonder .Is that all there is and then party on. Our characters may be extreme at times, but deep down they're just human beings, who like most of us are searching for meaning and balance in their lives. Of course, most of them aren't searching to pay the rent, because they've got a shitload of money.

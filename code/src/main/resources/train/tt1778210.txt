Burning Ice
###BREAK###
David Buckland invites artists and Arctic scientists onto his ship, the Cape Farewell, for a trip along the western coast of Greenland. The scientists conduct research on climate change, and the artists, who include singer-songwriters, photographers, a comedian, performance artists, and others, absorb it all in hopes they will turn it into art - art that will tell the world about what they've seen and felt. Interviews with the participants mix with footage of the voyage and scenes of performance.

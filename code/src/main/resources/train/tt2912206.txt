Laszlo Somogyi Singer is a Hungarian Jew born in 1929 who has survived the Holocaust and Stalinism. During a full school year, the elderly man is visited by a group of students who question him about his past. The task, though, is tougher than imagined. There is the problem of finding a common language and ground where memories can be shared and passed on. Co-directors Elena Hazanov and Claudio Recupero film this encounter of distant generations trying to understand the process whereby the gap to the present is bridged.

The Heiner Affair: A Play
###BREAK###
This film poses a simple question: If a 14-year-old black girl is pack-raped by four older youths, should the police always investigate and seek justice on her behalf? On the one hand, in Queensland, in the case of Anna, the powers of government effectively answered no. In Anna's case, Queensland government officials refused to act - and even destroyed the evidence. The police, crime commissions, and even the Queensland governor declined to get involved. On the other hand, a few ordinary people in a small country town believe that the rule of law should be the same for all, that Anna deserves justice, and that it is past time to answer the above question with a resounding 'Yes'.

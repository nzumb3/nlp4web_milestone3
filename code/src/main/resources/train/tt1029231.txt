Unknown to them, a dark force is growing in another part of the world. Kaal, an evil genius, is selfishly misusing his powers to spread fear, death and destruction. And he is being assisted by an army of very dangerous beings, which he has created himself. Not long after Kaal's plans are put into action, both Rohit and Krrish find themselves faced with a crisis of epic proportions, which only they can resolve, together.

Film tells the compelling tale of two young men, Grant and Sasha. By the chance, they came to the film production studio to take part in a casting where the director has paid an attending to them. The director offered an unexpected experiment to the guys. Along with the offer to make a movie about their real life, the friends got the camera to their hands. And they made the movie, they did not hit anything from the camera lens. The guys and their friend who was shooting the camera are look like 'the syndicate of good luck'. It does not matter what they need to do - to find money or to catch a girl - they can do anything.

The Meaning of Life
###BREAK###
Ever wonder what the purpose of this life you have been given is? How did you come about and what are you to do? What are your responsibilities and what should you make of what has been given, if anything? What is all this stuff in front of us and if we are to understand what is in front of us, then what are our obligations to it? Why is life so hard and why do we suffer? What are methods that we can utilise to overcome and dominate not only our own sufferings, but also our own life? How can we become master of our own destiny and take our place in life that we were built for? These are some of the many questions that this comprehensive philosophy course will attempt to tackle. Please sit back and enjoy as we raise the most important topics relevant to all of humankind.

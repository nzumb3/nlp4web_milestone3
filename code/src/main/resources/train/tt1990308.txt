Ratstar
###BREAK###
When Orson, a sensitive, misunderstood android stows away on Renee Hamilton's cargo ship, they don't fall in love (yet). But when they return to the science base where he lives, something has gone terribly wrong. Mutated, flesh eating rats wreak havoc on Renee and Orson as they try to save lives, and each other, amid terror and mayhem. Served with just the right amount of cheese, Ratstar is a tasty morsel for the most discerning of "B" movie aficionados.

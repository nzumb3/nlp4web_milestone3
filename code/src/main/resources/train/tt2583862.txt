Too Cold Out There Without You
###BREAK###
When the Rev. Christopher Fike was ordained in the Episcopal Church he was a straight, married mother of two. Five years later he had completed his transition and now identifies as a man. 'Too Cold Out There Without You' is a post-transition story that looks beyond the act of transitioning and instead focuses on the transformations that take place in Chris's relationships and the church as a result of his transition.

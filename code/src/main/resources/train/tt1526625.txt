Perfect 10
###BREAK###
Mara, now hovering between the plus-size and regular-size worlds, leaves her husband at home and drags her equally outcast best friend to their ten-year High School reunion. Mara wants a second chance with her unrequited first love and learns he's come back for her. Perfect 10, a semi-autobiographical tale, is a film about identity, self-respect and the beauty of dysfunctional friendship.

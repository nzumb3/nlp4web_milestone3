Intensivstation
###BREAK###
The film INTENSIVE CARE depicts the everyday work of doctors and nurses at a Berlin ICU. It allows an insight into the mental and emotional challenges the staff is facing on a daily basis, dealing with decisions that have far reaching consequences for their patients. Often it is the staff of the intensive care unit - the doctors and nurses - that are confronted with difficult ethical questions that their patients haven't yet had to consider. Questions with no easy answers. How do we want to die, and how do we want to live?

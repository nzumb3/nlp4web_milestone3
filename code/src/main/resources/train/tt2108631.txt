The Last Hope
###BREAK###
The main character is an old (Peter Williamson) man who questions his way of life. While he accepts the fact that he is becoming senile, he wonders why he is still single. He reminisces three girls he really loved in his life. The passion brought on by his memories about these relationships makes him forget his imminent death. This half length film that sublimates an unstable man is a typical example of how Harold Martinez subtly combines drama and psychology with a message of hope.

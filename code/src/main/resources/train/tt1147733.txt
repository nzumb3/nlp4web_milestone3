For Never
###BREAK###
Spawned by a hateful upbringing and trapped in a dead end marriage to a selfish trophy wife, budding real estate broker John Slides finds himself caught within a torrent of lust and greed. With an empty gas tank and a dead cell phone, John seeks refuge in a mysterious house in a remote New Jersey suburb. But rather than finding a welcoming stranger, he's cast inside a confusing, grotesque maze of hell where the weirdest people in impossible dimensions haunt him to the brink of insanity. This heart pounding, psychological thriller thrusts you onto a fast paced roller coaster ride filled with unexpected twists and turns of a cult classic. Smattered with skillfully placed subtle clues, "For Never" is even more entertaining the next time around.

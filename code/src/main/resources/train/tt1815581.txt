Air Transport Auxiliary
###BREAK###
The Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) was a British World War II civilian organisation that ferried new, repaired and damaged military aircraft between UK factories, assembly plants, transatlantic delivery points, Maintenance Units (MU), scrap yards, and active service squadrons and airfields-but not to aircraft carriers. It also flew service personnel on urgent duty from one place to another and performed air ambulance work. The documentary tells this remarkable but unknown story, through interviews with surviving ATA members, ATA historians, archive footage and re-enactments.

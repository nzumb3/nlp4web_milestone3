More Than Bricks and Mortar: The Damongo Project
###BREAK###
A documentary film that follows a five week collaboration between a small group of students from the University of Manitoba and local construction workers in a rural village in Northern Ghana. Together, the team constructed a new boarding house for a group of school girls from the region. The unique project was built entirely on-site without power tools. From mixing mortar to making sun-dried bricks, the architectural and design students learned new building methods from local construction workers. The film branches out from the job site to provide a glimpse into the local community and explores educational environments. The documentary is based on a course titled 'Service Learning In A Global Community' lead by Kelley Beaverford.

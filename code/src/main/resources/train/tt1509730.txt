30 Days in the Bowl
###BREAK###
Set in the city of the 'new' New Orleans, producer Michael Agresta and his crew of three young filmmakers set out over a period of thirty days in the summer of 2009 to capture a fresh perspective on the renewal of hope and vitality in a city that calls the arts and entertainment its thriving pulse. A glimpse into the heart of creative flair and laissez-faire that gives New Orleans (Katrina who?) a character all its own.

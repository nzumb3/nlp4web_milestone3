The Lost Generation
###BREAK###
Heavily influenced by true events of occupy movements and protests across the world over the past 3 years, The Lost Generation portrays a very entertaining yet relevant depiction of our current media and society. We are invited to follow reality TV star SJ - the inspirational female lead, on an epic fight for survival in a dystopian presentation of our present-day world. The Lost Generation exists in a world governed by a corrupt media who have the police and government in their pocket. Able to scandalize the government through mass surveillance, the media creates propaganda on how to live a life - and leaves desperate civilians in its wake. But there is hope. They are called The Unknown.

Sábado, una película en tiempo real
###BREAK###
"Mother" stands out on the front of her black t-shirt, "Fucker" on the back. And as angrily as these words sound when combined into a curse, is how Antonia behaves. Because she is pregnant, and Victor, who slept with her, is getting married in a few hours to Blanca. Incensed, and looking like a black angel of revenge, she searches out her rival, already in her white wedding robes, to confront her with this fact. Her neighbour Gabriel, a film student, has agreed to record everything on video, to soothe Antonia's fury. When Blanca learns, in front of the camera, that her future husband has betrayed her well and proper, she hired Gabriel at short notice as a cameraman for a wedding video of a quite different kind. Blanca finds her husband having a shower, drives him out into the street and exposes this Latin lover, not just verbally. "We have over a million sperm and you have just one egg to be fertilised", the womanizer argues, driven into a corner out in the open. Even better than his biologistical legitimation is the motto borrowed from computer technology: loyalty is like working on the computer. You can always only work on one file at a time and don't see all the others in front of you, you are, so to speak, loyal to one file. The camera in this breathlessly rapid parody of cinema-verite changes its perspective many times before finally settling on Blanca, with an unmoving, rigid look, intending to observe her having a fling.

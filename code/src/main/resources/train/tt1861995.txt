Build Something Modern
###BREAK###
Build Something Modern is a touching and revealing film about people and their special relationship with the things they create as they reflect on it many years later. The film tells the little known history of architects in Europe designing hundreds of Modernist buildings for Africa in the 1960s and 70s, without ever going there.

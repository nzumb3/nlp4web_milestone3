A Date with Ed: Reunion Tour
###BREAK###
A Date With Ed: Reunion Tour is a documentary chronicling a young filmmaker's journey across the Canadian landscape to save a dying friendship and reunite a band that only existed for one afternoon. On the heels of a lack luster career as a competitive skier, Matt (the filmmaker) seeks out his two former best friends to help him find his way back into the greater moment around him. It is an intimate look at a personal journey to live out dreams, hold on to friendship, move into adulthood, and to be in your place and of your time.

Where the Change Is
###BREAK###
Where The Change Is is a semi-fictional film about two young filmmakers attempting to reach the ultimate millennium party. The end result, however, is a socially relevant documentary involving a cross Canada train trip. Where The Change Is was shot on the Via Rail Trans-Canada train through the 1999-2000 new year (we were near Melville Saskatchewan when the ball dropped), and combines interviews with passengers on the train and an interesting mix of fictional and non-fictional events, similar to the 'third person' documentary feel found in much of Christopher Guest's work (namely Waiting for Guffman) and The Larry Sanders Show.

H I Jew Positive
###BREAK###
Every day, Catholic Poles discover that their parents kept their true identity hidden from them - the fact they were Jewish, second and third-generation to Holocaust survivors. It happens to people of all ages from all socioeconomic backgrounds, in villages and in big cities. These are The New Jews of Poland. This is a story about the search for love and identity, a journey that began in Warsaw, moved to Israel, and returned to Poland. A voyage of people whose identity has been shattered.

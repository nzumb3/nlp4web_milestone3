###BREAK###
While a film crew is shooting a B action movie, two of the main actors (the hero and villain) are seriously injured and they lose their memories. The director and producer attempt to jog their memories by showing them footage from the movie they are working on. The actors suddenly retrieve their memories, but only as their characters. Soon, they break into the real world, one as a James Bond-like secret agent, the other as a power hungry terrorist. All hell breaks loose as the director tries to return things to the way things were by restoring the true memories of the actors and bringing their relationships back together...

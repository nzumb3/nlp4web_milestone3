Merqana
###BREAK###
"Merqana" explores the social universe of qat, cutting through an only apparently ordinary day in the plant's commodity chain. It follows the fascinating work of Ramadan, a young farmer; Jarso, a successful merchant; and Amir, a young religious leader with a passion for long chewing sessions and traditional Sufi chants. The film unfolds the ways this little-known plant has become extremely popular among the people of Harar, becoming the main source of income for poor farmers and wealthy businessmen.

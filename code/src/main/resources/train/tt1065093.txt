Jealousy
###BREAK###
Brian Young and Nate Beckman star in this 97 min. drama of friendship and trust, or lack thereof. Having been friends their whole lives, they risk everything by getting into a fight that may never bring them back to see each other again. Envious of each other, they can't help but argue to whatever end. Set in St. Louis, it makes for a scenic drama that turns into somewhat of a nightmare. The loss that the two encounter may never be forgotten, but there is one turnaround that they didn't expect. Maybe a lost friendship can be re-found and perhaps piece their lives back together.

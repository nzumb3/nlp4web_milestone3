Black Market Kidneys (BMK)
###BREAK###
Ava Richards (Sarai Goley) is in town to enjoy the hedonistic festivities of Spring Break 2007. Unbeknownst to Ava, however, a sadistic serial killer is targeting college students; picking them up in bars and harvesting their organs. She meets a stranger in a local bar, and the next thing she knows, she is in a dark basement. Too weak to escape on her own, Ava must hope someone will come a long to save her.

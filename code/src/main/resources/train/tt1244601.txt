Nikki: A Girl Who Has Rett Syndrome
###BREAK###
Nikki, a twelve-year-old girl, suffers with the most physically debilitating autism spectrum disorder, Rett Syndrome. She is unable to communicate conventionally, yet her courage, strength, presence, and smile captured filmmaker Michael Knowles's heart and mind and inspired him to go on a journey to understand what was going on inside of her. This documentary is the result of that endeavor. Rett Syndrome isn't well understood, and this lack of understanding can cause people to shy away from girls who have it. This documentary brings awareness to this disease, but also, through allowing the audience to get to know Nikki, helps them realize that knowing a Rett girl can brighten their lives.

S.A.D Sitting and Drinking
###BREAK###
Four inglorious bar studs; in our world where humanity is locked in an IT-driven, high-tech connected 'Internet of Things'. These studs talk the walk and walk the talk on the side streets of Bangkok, Thailand. People go and come, others feel outlandish, some bump into walls and zombies gaze into smart phones. Does it get any more up-side down when the bar studs bonded by fate, undecided and discussing life as they know it and usually letting things slip and slide by the by, spontaneously take it upon themselves to make a real stand, sitting of course. It's S.A.D but who cares? Actually these guys do!

Shell Shock
###BREAK###
Tom was a soldier, a British veteran of an anonymous war from the 1990's. Whilst serving, soldiers under his command were separated from the rest of his patrol and ambushed. His search for them leads him to a traumatized soldier, shaken and confused by something he has seen inside a farm Building. Tom enters the building. What happened in there will haunt him forever. He returns a decorated hero but he can't forget. Unable to handle his life and family in the UK, Tom now lives a nomadic existence, his search for isolation leading him to Tokyo. But wherever he goes, whatever he does he's haunted by the evil images of that day. Amongst the debris of his life he meets Asami, a Japanese woman. Disillusioned she is an outsider in her own country because of her mixed race, and her job in a Love Hotel shop. Tom realizes this maybe a chance of salvation, and his spirits raise when she accepts his invitation for a date. Dinner and sake breaks the barriers between them, the passion flows as time passes. However Tom can't escape his past and his redemption is threatened by the visions of what he saw and did. As past and present collide he realizes he can't run from the past or his future.

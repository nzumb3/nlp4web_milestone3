Connected
###BREAK###
Connected tells the story of a devoted couple who can communicate telepathically with each other. After an uncharacteristic row one morning, Jack leaves for work. Minutes later, Louise tries to send him a message to apologize. Distracted, he drives into an oncoming vehicle. Louise feels the impact. His death rips her apart. But 4 months later, still shocked, guilt-ridden and drinking excessively, she starts to receive blank text messages from him. Then she sees him, or at least believes she sees him, at her young son's end-of-term concert. The next morning he is in their kitchen preparing breakfast and explaining that he has 24 hours to spend with her. The next 24 hours changes her life as much as his death did.

Praise Band: The Movie
###BREAK###
Imagine The Monkees meet modern praise and worship music. Add a dash of realism and drama, and you've got Praise Band. The funny, yet touching story of one band's efforts in a small town church. Through their growing music ministry, the band not only reaches out to their community, but also grows in their own individual walk with God. Matt Young, the new worship leader, is hired by Pastor James Monroe to serve Crossroad Community Church. However, these young church leaders meet with much opposition from members of their congregation who still cling to traditional roots. Led by church treasurer Wayne Wilson, the congregation resist the idea of change and this new style of worship. Can Matt, along with band mates Mark Lewis, Luke Daniels and John Collins change the minds of this dwindling flock before it is too late? Praise Band - on Wednesday night they're an average band, but on Sunday morning they're praising God!

A Carol of Christmas
###BREAK###
The story begins on the eve of Christmas. Ebenezer Scrooge is a rich old man interested in only one thing, money. He is not going to let anything get in the way of him making a buck, not even the festive holiday season. Even when his only employee, the humble and loyal Bob Cratchit, asks for Christmas day off Scrooge is reluctant to give it to him. Scrooge will not even help the poor and hungry during Christmas. Not even his only living relative Fred changes his spirits. He is content going home that evening as if it were any other day. The Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come shows Scrooge images from his future. These ghastly images show what will happen if the coarse of events do not change, and Scrooge remains the person he is. He shows him the fate of Tiny Tim, and the fate of Scrooge himself. Nothing but pain and hurt are in his future, and Scrooge sees the error of his ways. He realizes he must change. By the end of his journey Scrooge is a changed man. He makes right all the wrong things in his life. He helps Fred, Cratchit, and Tiny Tim. Most importantly he learns to keep Christmas all year long. He can finally understand what Tiny Tim had said all along, 'God bless us, everyone.'

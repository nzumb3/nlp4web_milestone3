Federico, shaped by a generation that believed it possible to bring about utopia, tries to survive the changes of the 21st century, but is trapped in a dead end street. Herman, his friend and revolutionary companion , mutilated by war injuries, finds a way to express his ideals, struggles and hopes through painting. With his young son, he retires to the countryside, where Flora, a pragmatic and generous woman, helps with the household and the raising of his son. Herman dies from a long standing illness. Federico, forced by his friend, made a death bed promise to care for Daniel. Hope is not a utopia that is reached through a specific action. Federico learns at Daniel's side that the future, like love, is not conquered but fashioned day.

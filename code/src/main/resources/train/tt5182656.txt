Khamosh! Adalat Jaari Hai is an adaptation of Shantata! Court Chalu Aahe, a Marathi play written by playwright Vijay Tendulkar in 1963. The story begins with a group of people, who are planning to stage a play in a village. Since one of the cast members doesn't show up, a local is asked to replace him. To make him understand the courtroom procedures, a rehearsal is arranged with a mock trial. The story takes a twist when the pretend-play suddenly turns into a grim charge as lines are blurred between reality and fiction. Miss Benare is charged with foeticide, as well as accused of having an illicit relationship with a married Professor Damle, the missing member of the cast. Unfulfilled desires, gender discrimination, redundant social customs and the sources and manifestations of power emerge in this gripping drama.

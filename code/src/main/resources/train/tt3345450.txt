Eddie Reynolds y Los √Ångeles de Acero
###BREAK###
After 30 years, a rock band rejoins when Bono, from U2, shows interest in buying one of their songs. The gathering brings up old fights between Eddie, the lead singer, and Santos, the guitar player. Bono postpones the deal indefinitely while Eddie tries to put the band together one more time. Soon, the old folks start to play gigs again, while Lucia, the drummer's teenage daughter, renews their rocker style up... A comedy about friendship, rock and roll craziness, second chances and dreams that come true, but thirty years later!

La cavale blanche
###BREAK###
A poetic inquiry following the paths of Stephan and Henri, two men who died in their forties a few years ago, one in Brussels and one in Brest. Their moving destinies, apparently ordinary and unconnected, are brought to a mythic dimension when, at the scale of the individual, and in a world wrought by Faustian temptation, the drama of all existence is played out, with its limits, desires, search for meaning, and renunciation.

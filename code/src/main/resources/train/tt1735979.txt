Then, just days before Christmas, he meets and befriends a young troubled boy, Tim Jr., who simply wants Santa to bring him a new Dad for Christmas! After falling for both Tim Jr. and his mother, Isis, Happy now has things to consider. Will Happy live up to the expectation of 'Dad'? Can he leave all his number one hits behind? On the other hand, will Isis reveal her 'secret' and one day love again?

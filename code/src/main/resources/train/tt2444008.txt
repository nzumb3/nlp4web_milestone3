Children of Conflict
###BREAK###
Children of Conflict is about the kids who grew up in the IRA dealing with the British Occupation, and had to learn how to survive being born into a war. Our story centers on a Irish daughter of the I.R.A, Bernedette Laub, who ran away 20 years ago to protect her son, but has returned to find closure from the tortures of her childhood. In the end, and to our surprise as we were filming, she finds it in the forgiveness from a British soldier she had sworn off as the enemy.

Fractured
###BREAK###
After awakening from a coma with no idea who he is, Dylan White (Callum Blue) creates a safe and normal life for himself. It doesn't last long: horrifying visions start to interrupt his waking moments. Following clues that take him to the dark underbelly of New Orleans, Dylan meets his arch nemesis Quincy (Vinnie Jones) and soon finds that both his life and soul are in danger. FRACTURED is a trip to the dark side, noir-style: bad men, bad dames, bad sex and bad intentions.

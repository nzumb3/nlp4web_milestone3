According to some beliefs prevalent in the ancient Palestinian culture, when a Palestinian dreams that s/he is wearing a coat or a dress which is larger than their original size, the interpretation of the dream would be that the Palestinian would be likely to bear over-burdened responsibilities. This case of over-burdened responsibilities is indeed what Palestinians witness these days whether they are living inside or outside the Palestinian lands. The only unjustified excuse for their suffering is Being Palestinians.

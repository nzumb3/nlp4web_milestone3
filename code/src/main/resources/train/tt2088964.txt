Up Not Down
###BREAK###
Welcome to the world of rock climbing in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Wyoming. Climbing in the Black Hills has a rich history that spans nearly a century. This film takes the journey, from the earliest pioneers; Herb and Jan Conn, to the climbers who are pushing the standards of today. Funded by the South Dakota Artist Council and Kick starter this film has been in the making for over three years. My hope is that it will expose people to a world they did not know existed, and inspire them to create their own adventure's.

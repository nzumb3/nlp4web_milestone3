Carpool Guy
###BREAK###
Joel Goodman is a hotshot advertising executive angling for a promotion, but he feels stuck - not least of all in traffic. A seeming answer to his prayers comes in the form of a homeless man whom Joel pays to sit in his passenger seat so he can use the carpool lane. The two form an unexpected bond, and Joel comes to realize that sometimes changing lanes can change your life.

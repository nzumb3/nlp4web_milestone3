Pig Business in Chile
###BREAK###
The residents of Freirina, Chile blockaded the world's biggest factory pig farm just outside the town which was sickening them with toxic stench and depleting the valley's precious water. Special forces attacked the blockade and their spokesman was seriously injured by private security guards. In response to nationwide outrage at the violence against the protesters, the government announced stringent environmental requirements which the company was unable to comply with, and so closed the factory farm.

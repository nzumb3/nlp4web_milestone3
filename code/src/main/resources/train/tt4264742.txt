A Day in the Life of the Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk
###BREAK###
This High-Definition documentary special presents an intimate view of life aboard the United States Coast Guard Cutter Mohawk as it patrolled the United States south coastal region in February and March of 1999. Director Stuart Calcote's High-Definition camera crew spent twelve days aboard the Mohawk as it sailed on a course from Key West, Florida, to Roosevelt Roads Naval Base in Puerto Rico. Every aspect of the crew's life and work on board the Mohawk was documented. From early morning revelry to taps at night, from high above the bridge to the depths of the engine room, this program follows the lives of the U.S.S. Mohawk's officers and crew as they guard the shores of America.

Vencidxs
###BREAK###
Over 100 testimonies from survivors of the Second Spanish Republic (1931-1939) and the Francoist repression (1936-1976) they narrate their own history and speak directly to young people. Vencidxs (Defeated) is the biggest project of recovery of historical memory ever made in Spain and it's made without institutional financial aid. The Spanish genocide is still a taboo subject in Spain and thousands of families cannot recover the bones of their ancestors. But the Franco era ended with the lives of more than 113000 people and Spain is the second country in the world with more mass graves, after Cambodia.

Main Aur Charles
###BREAK###
Meet him once and your life will change forever. The movie revolves around Charles, an enigmatic con man and a vicious killer, and the lives he touched with his inescapable charm and mysterious personality. We follow Charles, who is literally evil personified, as he manipulates innumerable people to facilitate his jail break. The thin line between his victims and accomplices include a copywriter of an international ad agency clinging on to Charles for hope, a royal princess seeking adventure in an otherwise bland life, a young hippie girl hopelessly drawn towards him, and an innocent law student Mira madly in love with the dreams sold by Charles amongst various others - from a financial wizard, an extortionist from Haryana to a helpless prison supervisor. Bit by bit, the character of Charles is revealed through all those who encountered him. Probably the only person who interacted with Charles the least, Commisioner Amod Kant, was affected by him the most. We see the impact of Charles on all through the eyes of Amod Kant - and their ever raging battle of good and evil, where good eventually wins but evil always resurfaces. This story, set in the 1980s, shows how Charles escapes from India's most securely guarded prison and is then subsequently arrested once again in Goa. It reveals the story behind the seemingly simple cat and mouse game between Amod Kant and Charles. But more importantly, the movie gives the world a peek into the dangerous mind of Charles, how he led different people to perceive him differently, how he filled the vacuum in their lives and ultimately, his dark world where right and wrong blend into a charming and mystique grey existence.

Return to Reichenbach
###BREAK###
One-hour documentary that weaves together the stories of two women - one orphaned by the Hitler regime and the other possibly the Nazi guard who protected her. The film intimately explores and contrasts their WW2 experiences and crushing losses, and witnesses their fraught reunion more than half a century later. RETURN TO REICHENBACH gives audiences a rare opportunity to intimately experience history through the eyes of an everyday German woman and a Jewish girl.

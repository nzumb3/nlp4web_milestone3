INSIDE STORY THE SCIENCE OF HIV AIDS is a media-based initiative designed to educate the sub-Saharan African public about the basic science of HIV and AIDS. At the center of this initiative is a unique feature-length film that brings together the best of fiction and non-fiction storytelling in order to unravel the mysteries of HIV. Audiences are engaged and transported to a vibrant, inner world where hard-to-grasp science is transformed into a compelling visual reality. The aim is to demonstrate the science of how HIV works in a personal, practical, and memorable way. Misunderstanding is replaced with facts, demystifying the virus, and motivating informed health decisions.

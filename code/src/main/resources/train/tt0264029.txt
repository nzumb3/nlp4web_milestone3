Shows the life of some 1500 families of landless rural laborers who, for the first time in 1985, occupied an unproductive large landholding, the Annoni plantation in Rio Grande do Sul. After camping out for years in tents, facing down the police and negotiating with the government, the former landless laborers have managed to turn their dream into reality, and are now successful small farmers.

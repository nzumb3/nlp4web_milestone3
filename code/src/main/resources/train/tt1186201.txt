###BREAK###
Within days of the coalition forces entering Baghdad, Fidelis Cloer has arrived as well. He sells armored cars. Over the next few years, he sells more than 200 in Iraq. We watch him examine the wreckage of destroyed vehicles, gathering information on how to improve his product. He talks about his competition. We visit a testing center in Bavaria where Cloer's researchers blow up vehicles. Talking to the camera, Cloer gives advice on safety and blending in. Near the end of the film, he's in Kabul, repeating his pattern of research and sales. He's philosophical, confident he'll always have work.

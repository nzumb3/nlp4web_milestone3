Our story concerns a couple in their early 30s - Paul and Molly - who inherit a river house on a plot of land just outside of Austin, Texas. They excitedly spend their nights and weekends there, fixing it up and trying to get a hang of rural life. Gordon, a farmer in his 50s who has leased and tended the acreage for decades, is hesitant to accept his new landlords as members of his home; Molly and Paul have not yet earned their country credentials, so he takes it upon himself to test their fortitude. As Gordon's trials intensify the couple is faced with the threatening consequences of their own inexperience.

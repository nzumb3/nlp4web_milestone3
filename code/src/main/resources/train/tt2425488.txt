Following the Trail of a Lost Collection
###BREAK###
In the confusion of the end of the second world war and the following years, precious paintings, sculptures, books and other objects disappeared as war-booty to Russia. Until recently, among these missing art objects was a unique collection of drawings by ancient European masters such as Rembrandt, Dürer, Holbein, Grünewald, Titiaan and Tintoretto, which once belonged to the Dutch banker and art collector Franz Koenigs. The film "Following the Trail of a Lost Collection" tells the story of this collection, a story of robbery, political intrigues and greed, full of dramatic events.

To My Brother in Exile
###BREAK###
"To my brother in exile" recalls the progressive imposition of terror in Stalinist Romania, mirrored in the unique correspondence of two brothers, Vladimir Ghika, prince, priest and martyr, and Dimitri Ghika, former Romanian Minister of Foreign Affairs, exiled in Switzerland. The documentary follows the thread of the letters sent by Vladimir Ghika from 1948 to 1952, tracking the political changes of Romania under the Iron Curtain through re-enactments blended with historical photographs, stock footage and dramatic eye-witness interviews.

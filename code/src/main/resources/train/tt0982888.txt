Khanna & Iyer
###BREAK###
Fellow-collegians Aryan Khanna and Nandini Iyer fall in love with each other and want to get married, however, their respective parents, wealthy builder P.K. Khanna and equally wealthy MLA Ramanna Iyer, want them to marry in Punjabi and Madrasi families respectively, with Nandini's marriage already being finalized with U.S.-based Shekhar Iyer. Aryan and Nandini decide to elope and end up in the Dora jungles closely pursued by Iyer and Khanna and the Police, amidst a lot of media publicity. Iyer and Khanna display mutual loathing, mingled with Madrasi and Punjabi expletives. Both decide to change their tactics, temporarily declare a truce in order to placate and get their respective children back, and then carry on later with their mutual hatred. Little do Iyer and Khanna realize that their children have been robbed, are lost, tired, hungry, and have now been abducted by dreaded trigger-happy terrorist Donga - who may end up killing both of them - and anyone else who dares to interfere.

'The knights' movie tells us about real events happening several years ago in Chelyabinsk, Russia. Several men likes Tolkien books. And when hardship came in their life, these guys decide to hide in forest. There they built a knight castle and only this defend may save them from guns of robbers. The film is reconstruction by own strength of witness who saw those events. That's why film is not very professional, but it's very important for those who wants to know this story because nobody else wants to tell about it.

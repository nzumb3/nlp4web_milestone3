Tro, Håb og Grønland
###BREAK###
Faith, Hope and Greenland is a visual and poetic journey into the very hearts of the people of Greenland. Told in a natural, honest and non-accusative manner, its four main protagonists advise the viewer on the underbelly of colonisation, its effects on an ancient, nomadic culture and on the individual mind. However, the film is built upon hope, and throughout the entire film we get an idea of the intensity and speed with which the people of this remote country, are regaining their self-respect and redefining their collective identity on their own terms.

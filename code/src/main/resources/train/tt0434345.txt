Snow White
###BREAK###
Nico spends most of her time in the local club with her best friend Wanda (Zoé Miku). She is able to afford her extravagant life-style by maintaining an affair with the clubs' owner, Boris (Stefan Gubser). Wanda on the other hand couldn't be more different to Nico, stemming as she does, from a lower working class background. Wanda is determined to take advantage of her good looks to make as much money as possible. Nico is intelligent enough to see through her own superficial lifestyle, but too indecisive and unsure as to how to change it. One evening in Boris' club, she meets the front man of the Hip-Hop band «Menace Evasion». Paco (Carlos Leal) is critical towards his success, aware that his songs are being played in supermarkets but that no one cares to listen to his lyrics. Fascinated by Paco's provocative style Nico decides to confront him backstage and the two slowly fall in love with each other. Nico is impressed by Paco. A «rebel» who uses words like «message» without irony. She arduously tries to incorporate some of Paco's rebellious approach to life into her own world, with self-destructive consequences.

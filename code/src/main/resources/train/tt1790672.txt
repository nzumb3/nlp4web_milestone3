David & Kamal
###BREAK###
A 9-year-old American Jewish boy, David, meets a poor 9-year-old street urchin of Arab descent, Kamal, who sells postcards to tourists in the stone-enclosed Old City of Jerusalem. At first glance, Kamal seems bright and energetic, but in reality he's suffering under the tyrannical presence of his grandfather who oversees the living of his family, which includes Kamal's mother and two sisters.

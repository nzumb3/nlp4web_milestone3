Zoo Zappers -Too Hot -The Movie (from Disco to Disco)
###BREAK###
In a dystopian future where tabloid journalism and state-sponsored designer drugs control their minds, the protagonists of Zoo Zappers meander through a cultish and corporate media-controlled Berlin in a drug and celebrity culture-induced haze. This feature film splices Natz Spetsman aka Purio's video work from 2007-2010 in a fashion reminiscent of Alexander Kluge, while incorporating various sub- genres such as music journalism and the making-of of a pop culture movie that was never made. The result is an indictment of the Mass Media by the means of a playful postmodern Brechtian narrative.

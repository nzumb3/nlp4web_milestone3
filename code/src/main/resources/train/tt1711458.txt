Hard Boiled Sweets
###BREAK###
Mob Boss is used to getting whatever he wants; he runs Southend, gets all the best women including the gorgeous, sought after Porsche The Sherbet Lemon and has one million pounds in dirty cash stashed in a briefcase at his home. However, nothing in this world comes without a price, and this weekend his boss and top-dog London Mobster, Jimmy The Gent is coming to collect the money which belongs to him. Meanwhile, reluctant ex-con Johnny The Glacier Mint is forced into pulling off a heist to get his hands on the cash himself. What none of them realize is that seven other dangerous criminals also have plans to get their hands on Jimmy's money and will do whatever it takes to get rich.

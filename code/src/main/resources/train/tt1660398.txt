New Beijing: Reinventing a City
###BREAK###
As China emerges as the new economic powerhouse of the 21-century, no one can disrupt the biggest construction boom in the world's history. We marvel at the Beijing's bright new face as international architects create new icons - the Watercube, Birds Nest, Stadium, and National Theatre. The architects of the iconic buildings and their visions for the future contrast with those of heritage activist Zhang Jinqi. His photography exhibition 'Memories of China' documents the last heritage districts of the old city which are soon to be demolished. With 400 cities of the size of Beijing to build by 2020 the China has little time to reflect on the past.

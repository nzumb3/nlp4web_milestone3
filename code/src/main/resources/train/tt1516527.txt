Dancing with the Storms
###BREAK###
Storm chasers are people who have a passion for finding and documenting wild weather conditions, thunderstorms, high winds, or tornados. These men and women often put themselves at great risk when they want to experience these powerful natural forces at close range. In Switzerland there is also a small group of storm chasers that, during the summer, is underway almost daily throughout the country and even beyond, looking for summer storms, heavy hailstorms, and tornados. They document and film their experiences.

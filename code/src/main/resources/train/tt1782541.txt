Tantrum
###BREAK###
Rock band Tantrum was the most popular band in Peoria, Illinois in the late 80s. Founded by four teenagers writing original music, they soon learned they could make more money by playing cover songs in local bars. They took advantage of the 80s hair metal look and 'party all the time' mentality to bring Peoria a show they'd never seen. Although they gained quite a following, the band ultimately liked partying more than the music and finally broke up after a 10 year run. The entire film was shot in a five year period from 1987 - 1991. The director had put the original tapes away and never assembled the film until now. The authentic 80s clothes and conversations have aged like a fine wine. But ultimately it's the story of every band, in every garage around the country, in every era. The story is a common tale of potential derailed. But in the end, each member of Tantrum is still making music, just in new directions.

Dad
###BREAK###
A young boy whose parents are divorced finally gets to spend some time with his dad. On a beautiful summer day the two of them go fishing, surrounded by unspoiled nature, as if they were alone in the world. As emotions slowly surface, the distant world around them eventually step in..."Venice Critics' Week's programmers wrote that Dad was "a film of suggestive images, evocative sounds, lyrical connections and secret intermittences of the heart whose symbolic value elaborates a story that has not been made by strictly consequential events." They added that the films's spirituality is worthy of the masterpieces by Tarkovsky and Sokurov."

Teahad
###BREAK###
The election of Barack Hussein Obama as President of the United States in 2008 set in motion a chain of responses from the powerful machinery of right-wing religious, political and corporate organizations. TEAHAD, an experimental documentary, examines the astroturf movement known as the Tea Party as well as its ominous presence in the national political discourse at a time of severe economic distress. A hint of right-wing authoritarianism hangs in the air as various pieces of the Tea Party story are assembled to create a heightened sense of the mania that characterizes the movement. The faces of the movement's rank and file are seen in intimate detail as salient voices are heard articulating the precepts of the movement and its radical antecedents.

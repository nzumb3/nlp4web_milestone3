Part & Parcel a Yoga Documentary Satsang
###BREAK###
Part & Parcel is an intimate conversation with unorthodox characters who have dedicated their lives to the study and practice of Yoga in different forms. A personal glimpse into the essence of Yoga through their unique vision and our own journey looking for answers. Is it a religion, a fitness fad, a scientific discipline perhaps? Along the way, we will take part in the practise of the most traditional Sri Patanjala Yogashala temple in Mysore and venture further down the coast, where Bhakti Yoga, the yoga of devotion is practiced along with surfing, in the world's first surfing ashram. From the pioneering academics in Britain to the Indian Swami living in a modern cave, we gain insights beyond the marketing stereotype and into the contrasting aspects of contemporary and millenary practices. Part & Parcel is a colourful collage of philosophy, history and personal paths into Yoga.

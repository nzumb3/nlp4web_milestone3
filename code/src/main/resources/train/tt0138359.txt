Chillicothe
###BREAK###
A dry-witted narrative that follows a year in the life of six friends who have found themselves trapped in a rut in the time following college. It's been four years since graduation, and Wade Hinkle, the group's most cynical bachelor, is still stewing over the loss of his social life. A series of weddings splits the group apart until the bizarre death of a college mate.

Once upon a time there was a tiny sugar producing township called Tully in Far North Queensland, Australia. Tully is renowned for its endless sugar fields and ... Rain. One day the townsfolk were shocked by the devastating news that Brazil had dumped its sugar on the world market. "What will we do?" they cried, "we will all be ruined." Not being one to resist a challenge, life-time resident and Rotary Club member Ron Hunt calls a meeting with the town leaders to see what can be done to save Tully from financial rack and ruin. Ron proposes to build The World's Biggest Gumboot in honour of Tully's record rainfall of 7.98 metres in 1950. Roger Chandler a prodigious frog sculptor says the idea was based on his boot trophy presented to the Tully Boot Scooters complete with a Green Tree Frog clinging to the side. Ron Hunt not eager for Roger to build the boot commissions the "outsider" Bryan Newell. Ron gives Roger the job of carving his 140th frog. Still feeling rejected Roger can't help but sabotage Bryan's boot building project with his oversized frog. As the boot goes further and further over the deadline Ron starts to have misgivings about Bryan. Six months later the town wants to know where their $90,000 boot is? How will this effect Ron's reputation? Will the Big Golden Gumboot with the green frog clinging precariously to the side, make a difference to the town's overall economy? Only time will tell.

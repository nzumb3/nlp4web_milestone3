Alice in Wonderland
###BREAK###
An adaptation of the 1886 musical Alice in Wonderland: A Dream Play for Children by Henry Saville Clark and Walter Slaughter. James Fotopoulos' feature length film Alice in Wonderland, inspired by a 2003 Lewis Carroll photography exhibit, propels the Clark/Slaughter musical score into the 21st century digital age. Sculptures, drawings, text, and original music are used to explore the late 19th century's evolution of painting, literature, and theatre into early photography and moving pictures. The piece probes the interplay of art and science and in exploring these ideas certain lives and themes are touched upon - the relationship between John Ruskin and Lewis Carroll, Ruskin's theories on drawing, Thomas Eakins' painting and his use of photography, the burgeoning of early cinema with Eadweard Muybridge and Ã‰tienne-Jules Marey, the notions of the amateurism and professionalism in art and the archetype of the condemned artist. The work is presented in two acts remaining faithful to the musical's original construction based upon Carroll's narratives.

Ignacio Sánchez Mejías: Más allá del toreo
###BREAK###
This is not a biography about a bullfighter. It is a documentary film about the Art and the Death. It's, therefore, a different vision of the "bullfighting chronicle" of one of the most outstanding men of his time. Ignacio Sánchez Mejías was a playwright, actor, aircraft pilot, a polo player, he gave a lecture in the Columbity University of New York about bullfighting, he was Chairman of the Red Cross of Seville and Chairman of the Real Betis Balompie Football Club. He was a close friend of Federico García Lorca and Rafael Alberti and patron of the Generation of 27's.

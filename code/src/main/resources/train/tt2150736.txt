The Shoah of Europe's most ancient Jewish community, that of Thessaloniki and the unknown story of rescue - only 60 km south of Thessaloniki - of the Katerini Jews, Greece's smallest Jewish community at the time. Historic memory and its destruction, collective trauma and the construction of the official version of events as well as stereotypes and prejudices are issues dealt with by the documentary. In addition to personal testimonies, interviews with renowned historians as Steven B. Bowman, Kathryn E. Fleming, Rena Molho, Stratos Dordanas, Maria Kavala, Paris Papamichos-Chronakis.

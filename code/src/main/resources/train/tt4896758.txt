Thank You, Surf Again
###BREAK###
'Thank You, Surf Again' chronicles the activities of non-profit 'Surf For Life', a voluntourism organization that takes teams of volunteers to impoverished coastal communities. The film documents the building and completion of a high school in Nicaragua and relief efforts in the wake of Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines. Challenging the stereotypes of surfers as self serving thrill seekers, 'Thank You, Surf Again' profiles several surfers who dedicate themselves to community development in the areas that they visit. Professional surfers Chadd Konig and Holly Beck are joined by the core Surf For Life team and other surf-centric organizations to launch education, clean water and relief programs throughout the developing world. Shot with RED cameras, the production involves the expertise of many veterans in both the non-profit and media production worlds. The impressive growth and success of Surf For Life is a testimony to the timeliness of the volunteer ethic emerging in international travel. This film serves as call to action for travelers to deepen their cultural experiences through volunteering at their destinations.

Boys of Summerville
###BREAK###
Peter Davis, a big city business man, begrudgingly goes back to his little hometown of Summerville to settle his late father's estate. When he gets there, he finds himself once again seduced by the pace of the small town life as well as caught up in the one thing Summerville prides itself on: Softball. While Peter renews his hometown friendships with Murr, Rocky, as well as many other eccentric characters, he finds himself falling for Summerville all over again... and also for a new face in town, Samantha. As Peter is torn between his new life up north and his old one down south, he is forced to make a decision on what is more important to him: The security of what he has, or the memories of what he almost lost.

Nine years later, yearning to escape to the big city, Kong devises a plan -- rob his father for the cash. Again, the plan goes awry. Another nine years later finds Kong and Yi in the big city. Chi, now a fugitive, re-emerges on their wedding day. The men fight, causing Yi to fall from the wedding yacht into the water, where she encounters the still trapped boys and sets them free.

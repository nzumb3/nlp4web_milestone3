Blue Moon
###BREAK###
Can a love that bloomed under a Blue Moon truly last forever? At a quiet home in Boston, Massachusetts, an elderly Filipina named Corazon is writing a love letter. Knowing she doesn't have much time left, Corazon is writing to every man named Manuel Pineda who's listed in the Philippine directory, identifying herself as his long-lost love. In the Philippines, an elderly man named Manuel Pineda is diagnosed with cancer, and told he only has a few months to live. Manuel decides that before he dies, he wants to find the woman he loves most, whom he hasn't seen in decades: Corazon. "Blue Moon" follows Manuel's daunting search for Corazon all over the Philippines. He's joined by his emotionally distant son Rod and recently-separated grandson Kyle. As Rod and Kyle accompany Manuel in his search for his lady love, they discover that there were actually two ladies named Corazon in Manuel's life: the nurse whom Manuel married after World War 2, and the spunky girl who was Manuel's first love in 1938. The blossoming of young love between the dashing young Manuel and the two Corazons in the Forties is counterpointed with the dying Manuel's search for his one true love in the present day. But which Corazon is it, and will he find her before he joins his Creator?

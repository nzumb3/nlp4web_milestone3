30 Ballparks in 30 Days
###BREAK###
The four of us (Travis, Joey, Pedro and Glenn) work as video editors in Philadelphia. We all share a common passion for baseball and that is our bond. When the opportunity to attempt 30 ballparks in 30 days arose, we eagerly jumped on board - baseball road trips are a passion of ours but one of this caliber is like a dream. Our trip started out for baseball and for the ballpark but it turned into something much more - the people we met, the things we saw and the food we ate made this trip not so much about the ballpark, but about the experiences along the way. In the end, it wasn't so much about the destination as it was about the journey. To bring as many people as possible along for the ride, we filmed a movie and kept a journal. The result is a loving tribute to the game of baseball, the culture that surrounds it, the history that enriches it, and, above all else, the fans that define it. So come explore our site, watch our videos and check out our movie, scroll through our photo albums and read our book - come join the journey.

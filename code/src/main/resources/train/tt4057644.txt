We Are Tourists
###BREAK###
Cecile Gamble (O'ar Pali) is shipped off by her editor Harry to write a story on Monteprouve, a French village with the highest lingerie sales per capita in France. Hoping to spice up their relationship, Cecile drags her boyfriend Edward along for the ride. Monteprouve is everything Cecile expected - quaint, frisky and annoyingly French. But a high libido is not the only thing the town is hiding; Monteprouve also has a strangely high tourist suicide rate. It's not long before Cecile suspects that these 'suicides' are actually murders. But with a town full of oddball characters, uncovering the murderer may prove harder than expected.

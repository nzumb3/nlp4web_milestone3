The Gospel According to Brabenec
###BREAK###
Journalist Renata Kalenská's book of interviews with member of the Plastic People Vratislav Brabenec recorded not only his memories of the underground years, but also the author's experiences with this highly distinctive individual. This cinematic sequel builds on those experiences as it captures her additional interviews with Brabenec - improvised talks at places that hold some meaning for Brabenec or Kalenská. The result is several scenes of irrelevant philosophizing, self-deprecating humor, and commentary on the life of birds and on nature in general. The conversations, recorded mostly by hand-held camera, are interspersed with poetic citations.

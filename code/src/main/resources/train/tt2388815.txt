What's Art Got to Do with It?
###BREAK###
What's Art Got To Do With It? is an hour in length, documentary that takes us inside the hidden world of five people living with mental illness, homelessness, addiction and poverty. And yet the film has made people, smile, cry and talk--not about social ills, but about art! The characters, followed over a year, discover new ways to live their lives by attending a very unusual occupational therapy program and artists' sanctuary in Toronto. Through their honest challenges and triumphs we explore the meaning of art in our lives and in our hearts. The character's journeys as they become artists, from novice to finally selling their work and participating in public art exhibits, gives each person a new lease on life.

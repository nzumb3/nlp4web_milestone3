The Last Tape
###BREAK###
"The Last Tape" combines two stories which don't seem to go well together: On the one hand, it narrates about William's passionate struggle to show the purity of death, on the other hand, about the debaucherous, excessively drug-fueled events in the life and love of Leonard and Marie.

Three women who come from different backgrounds work hard to earn a living in Manila, but realize that they are victims of sexual exploitations. A television producer is forced to have sex with her boss in exchange for an opportunity to produce a new programme. That almost costs her marriage. A temporary teacher and her colleagues are sent by their principal to give a dance performance at a ministry officer's birthday party. They are gang-raped or almost gang-raped by the officer and his guests. A bus ticket seller accidentally kills one of the men who tries to gang-rape her, but all the bus passengers who witness the scene refuse to go to court to help her defending the charge of murder. Although the three women do not know each other, they end up taking the same bus leaving Manila and heading to the rural area.

Sir I Vrhnje/Cheese and Cream
###BREAK###
Cheese and Cream is a film-essay about Zagreb's milkmaids and deep crises of political will and national identity in the period between 2002 to 2006. Milkmaids, one of the symbols of Zagreb, have become an endangered species due to the economic turmoil of a society in transition. On top of it all, they may become extinct soon because their way of production and sales does not meet European standards. Can milkmaids and cottage cheese join the European Union and how? Who are they, anyway? Should they survive and why? Who can help them and how?

In the course of her search for a rich aunt who might save the family from a total downfall, Irenka encounters Zbyszek. Much to her disappointment, a young student is completely in love with Greta Garbo, so he doesn't pay any attention to the girl.

The Borowskis resume possession of their estate, and the very first innocent love flourishes between Irenka and Zbyszek.

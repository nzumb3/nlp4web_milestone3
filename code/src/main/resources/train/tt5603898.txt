Tormenta
###BREAK###
Tormenta offers its spectators a reflection of our contemporary society. The 52 minutes-long documentary brings to screen a unique point of view, which is based on the life of Brazilian artist Vera Tormenta Goulart. Besides her career, the film navigates through social themes which are object of her work. The documentary takes us on a trip to post-war Paris, to then bring us back to bohemian Rio of the 50s, where Vera led a successful career until she decided to retreat in a farm in the Southern part of Brazil. The story line is singular in showing us that all individuals are but a sum of their own choices.

Feat: 63 Marathons in 63 Days
###BREAK###
FEAT chronicles one man's coast-to-coast quest to run 63 marathons in 63 consecutive days, while pushing a jogging stroller. Endurance runner Timothy Borland seeks to raise awareness and research funds for kids battling a rare terminal disease whose own feet lack the strength to run. Ataxia-Telangiectasia or A-T combines the complexities of cerebral palsy, cystic fibrosis, muscular dystrophy and immune deficiencies. Most kids are in wheelchairs by age ten and few live beyond their teens. Feat intimately introduces audiences to three A-T families who have children at various stages of the disease. While the prognosis is grim, one man's inspirational journey revives hope for a cure or life prolonging treatment.

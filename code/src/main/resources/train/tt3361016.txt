Empowering Girls Through Horsepower
###BREAK###
At-risk, inner city girls who are falling through the cracks, living in areas with the least amount of green space in Los Angeles are empowered by 'Taking the Reins' - a nonprofit, urban barn where the girls learn everything about caring for and riding horses, and learning how to eat healthfully through an organic garden - and even raising chickens. The nearly 100 year old barn houses the program and the horses, and is tucked away - in the middle of the city.

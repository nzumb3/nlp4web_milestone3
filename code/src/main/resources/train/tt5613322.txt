They Came from the Swamp: The Films of William Grefé
###BREAK###
Savage! Sadistic! Thrill hungry! When it came to independent filmmaking in the sunshine state, William Grefé was the wildest of the wild! During the 1960s and '70s, the Miami-based producer/director transformed the darkest corners of the Florida swamps into his own personal backlot. From rampaging crocodiles possessed by an ancient Seminole witch doctor (DEATH CURSE OF TARTU) to a slithering serpent named STANLEY, William Grefé would grind out low-budget exploitation films for drive-ins and hardtops around the world. Now, without the benefit of cages or other protective devices, the untold story of Florida's most daring moviemaker comes to the screen...IN PSYCHEDELIC COLOR! Featuring over 20 interviews, including STEVE ALAIMO ("Wild Rebels"), DOUG HOBART ("Sting of Death"), GARY CRUTCHER ("Stanley"), RANDY GRINTER ("Whiskey Mountain"), CHRIS ROBINSON ("Stanley"), FRED OLEN RAY ("Scalps"), FRANK HENENLOTTER ("Basket Case"), JOHN DAVIS CHANDLER ("Hooked Generation" & "Mako"), DAVID F. FRIEDMAN ("She Freak"), and HERSCHELL GORDON LEWIS ("Blood Feast"), plus a special guest appearance by WILLIAM SHATNER ("Star Trek"), this explosive documentary packs enough THRILLS, CHILLS, and GILLS to make your skin CRAWL! Produced and directed by DANIEL GRIFFITH ("THE FLESH AND THE FURY: X-POSING TWINS OF EVIL" and "MYSTERY SCIENCE THEATER 3000").

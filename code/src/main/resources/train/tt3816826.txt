Bird Without Borders
###BREAK###
Found nowhere else on earth but the last few pockets of wilderness along East Asia's rugged coastline, the Black-Faced Spoonbill is a survivor. Twice a year this enigmatic bird undertakes a behemoth migration route that navigates through the heart of Asia, a part of the world where geopolitical tensions always run high. For the very first time this magnificent migration has been captured on full HD. This film documents an epic journey, 2000 kilometres from its wintering grounds in Taiwan, across coastal China and the Yellow sea, to the world's most dangerous flashpoint - the DMZ between North and South Korea and the bird's annual breeding ground.

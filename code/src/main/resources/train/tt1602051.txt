Capitalist Drive
###BREAK###
Capitalist Drive looks at life in the aftermath of the historic changes that shook Europe in the 1940s and 1989, and the struggles involved in starting afresh - no matter where you are. It uncovers stories of love and loss, dreams and disappointments, including a father's drive to succeed and the impact it had on those around him. And as we get to know these characters and their pasts, we discover shared passions and ambitions, including a rather eccentric attachment to cars.

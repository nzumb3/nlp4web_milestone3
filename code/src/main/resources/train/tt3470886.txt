In this exploration of the power of sports, foreigners from 5 continents find an unlikely family in New York City through an Olympic sport that few people in America know about: team handball. The squad seeks to defend its national title and cement its reputation as the 'world's handball club,' a group of friends that speak a common language on and off the court. Although most are European, members also come from Senegal, China, Colombia, Japan, Egypt and the Dominican Republic. Meanwhile, the only homegrown American strives to make Team USA and represent his country.

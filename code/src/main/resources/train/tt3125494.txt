Esther en alguna parte
###BREAK###
The peaceful life of Lino, a widower who keeps busy with the simplest everyday things, is turned upside-down when Larry Po, another quirky old man with multiple personalities, confesses to him that his late wife, Maruja, led a double life: by day was a housewife ordinary, and at night was an impressive singer of boleros. Given the possibility that perhaps he had not really known her, he becomes a detective obsessed with finding the truth.

Ronojoy Talukder becomes his teacher and the journey of Soumya to learn English kicks off. But as the plot develops we find that RONOJOY TALUKDAR is no hero but rather a psychopathic character who loves to blow his own trumpet and speak greatly about himself but doesn't have any quality as such other than the ability to speak English. Moreover, as the plot advances we also get to know that Joy Talukdar can't tolerate to watch anybody else other than him getting appreciation and can go to any level to stop that. This centralized theme of the movie is backed up by romance , emotion , comedy ,relationship of father (Mr.Mrinal Mukherjee ) and son (Anshu Bach),relationship of husband-wife , the crude reality and the up's and down's of corporate life and this entire story is well-wreathed psycho thriller.

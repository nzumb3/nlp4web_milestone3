A young boy decides to escape from his boarding school. Chased by bullies, robbed by drunken gamblers, a young boy starts his journey towards Kolhapur. The very people who seem pleasant, and invite him to ride with them turn into horrifying monsters as soon as they learn of his surname, a scheduled caste. Beaten to a pulp by the high-castes, the boy is then rescued by a woman who is on her way to Shigaon with her sick infant son, and three other children.

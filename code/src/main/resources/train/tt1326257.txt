The Road Home
###BREAK###
If duty compelled you to serve your country at wartime, and you returned home as an amputee, perhaps with a traumatic brain injury, how would you deal? The Road Home follows six recent American veterans from varied backgrounds as they travel the hard road back to their former lives with the dedicated Achilles Track Club. From their first shaky steps at Walter Reed towards a year long odyssey to train for and complete the NY Marathon, we follow their road home.

Starvation Doctrine: The Plight of Illegal Immigrants in America
###BREAK###
This documentary looks at immigration away from the borders and focuses on a new law that recently passed in Oklahoma in 2007. It aims to "starve" illegal immigrants by denying them access to medical benefits, state IDs, and jobs. These new policies are profoundly affecting the lives of undocumented immigrants as well as those who associate with them. The film explores why people decide to leave their homelands to find prosperity in the U.S., and what lawmakers feel should be done about those who disregard the law. Finally, the complexity of immigration reform is reveled, highlighting the ways in which immigrants continue to change the demographics of America and the sentiments of many of its citizens.

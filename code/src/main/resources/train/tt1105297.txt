Almost everyone of us stood once at the port watching the ships. You see cruise liners, bulk freighters, oil tankers and container vessels. They all stay short in the port before they sail again and disappear as a small dot on the horizon. But what happens thereafter? Ships are designed to spend more time on sea than in port. But how does life on a modern container vessel looks like, when your workplace become your home for several weeks? Within the documentary film "Steel Solitude" Gabriel Pielke joins the crew of one of the largest container vessels on a journey from Europe to China and back. During this 56 days at sea he experience the solitude of modern seafaring and the gradualness of traveling. This film takes you on a never ending journey between east and west and abducts you in a foreign world beyond the horizon.

Tell
###BREAK###
William Tell, the number one "Swiss" hero is about to rock the screens. In reality, he's an Austrian dreaming of the Swiss passport. When noblemen send him on a mission to free the country from the invidious Habsburgs a once-only chance opens to him... Writer JÃ¼rgen Ladenburger tells the world famous legend from a different angle. Very much in the likes of Manitou's Shoe and Mel Brooks' films.

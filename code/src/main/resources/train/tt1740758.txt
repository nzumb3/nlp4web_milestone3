What does it mean to be Hispanic? Is it being Spanish, Spanish-American, Latino, Latin-American, Hispanic-American, or perhaps Iberian? What role does language, art, music and literature play in identity formation? How does race contribute to our perceptions of Hispanics? This is a combined documentary and representative fictionalized narrative film that explores these questions along with different notions of Hispanic identities, especially in Texas.

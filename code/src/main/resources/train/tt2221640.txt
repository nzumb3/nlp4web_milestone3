When Ketchikan authorities discover the body of a homicide suspect they can't tell if its a murder or suicide. An unlikely investigator of the paranormal uncovers an ancient ritual that has unleashed a spirit with a taste for death and its just getting started. Now with a supernatural killer on the loose the investigator enlists a helpful spirit to stop the madman. Steeped in actual history and including an appearance by the ghost that inspired it this film is the only feature to be ever made entirely in Alaska.

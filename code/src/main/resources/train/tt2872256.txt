Udhayam NH4
###BREAK###
Manoj Menon ( Kay Kay Menon), the encounter specialist is a cool dude who breaks bones and gets information from young college students, about a kidnapping by other college students. Prabhu (Siddharth) and a few other boys from Chennai are students in a Bengaluru college, and live the ideal life of a student: hanging out with friends and bar hopping. Rithika (Ashritha) who screws up her nose at the Chennai boys' dance style, soon falls for Prabhu, who unlike our usual heroes is pretty chilled out, and doesn't plot, plan and get anxious over seeing the girl. But then there is trouble in paradise and the snake is none other than the father, who wants to send her far away the day after she completes her graduation. But Prabhu kidnaps her and their race to Chennai begins, with Manoj burning the rubber, chasing them in his jeep. The cat and mouse game folds there.

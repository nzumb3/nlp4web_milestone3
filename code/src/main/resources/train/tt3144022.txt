Die Die Delta Pi
###BREAK###
In late 1980s, when times were fun, technology was changing, clothes were Rad and girls were Bad; there was one thing that didn't change, traditions. Delta Pi, a long-lasting sorority institution in the heart of Tampa, Florida, keeps that tradition "alive"...until late 1986 Spring Break when a serial killer was just coming to light. When a group of Delta Pi Sisters decide to pull a prank on one of their own; a Sister they hate, a Sister who's smarter than they are, prettier and too young to be part of the Delta Pi group; a prank that goes horribly wrong, fatally wrong during a traditional Spring Break ceremonial burning of the House Mother dummy to start the new season. It was supposed to be an embarrassing moment for Marissa Chambers in the hopes that she would step down as a member of the sorority, but that doesn't happen. After being burned to death, the serial killer strikes with dire consequences. A serial killer that may or may not be related to Marissa. It was a gruesome and devastating time for Sun State University. Almost half of the Delta Pi Sorority were wiped out. Was it a vengeful killing or were they at the right place at the wrong time? After the killings, the sorority had to be shut down, a first in the long running tradition of the exclusive group. 27 years later, the house reopens and new Sisters are elected. When Delta Pi girls begin dying one by one, it is suspected that the serial killer has returned but it's much more than that. The Burnt One has come. Die Die Delta Pi.

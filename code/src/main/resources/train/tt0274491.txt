Set in Bohemian New York and inhabited by ambitious artists of every medium, The Experience Box tells the story of three friends and the extreme measures they take to re-invigorate their languishing creative lives. Led astray by 'experience junkie' Jerome, his friends Anna and Julian soon find themselves embroiled in a wicked web of deceit - and up to their eyeballs in glorious inspiration. Anna secures a child from Julian without asking - and finds out that her therapist wants to be the father. Jerome, after auditioning for a porn filmmaker loses his 'soul-mate', but gains the treasures of the muse - and a sugar daddy. And Julian meets his fantasy woman on the Internet - only to find she doesn't really exist...

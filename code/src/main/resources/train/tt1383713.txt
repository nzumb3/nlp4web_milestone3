The Why
###BREAK###
The Why is an experiential meditation on death, on loves lost, the duality of mind, and ultimately the nature of attachment and memory turned obsession. It takes place simultaneously in life, and in the nowhere place (a place of memory). The film revolves around three characters at the moment of death, where they find themselves existing in a place absent of love, absent of hate and absent of reason. The tighter they hold on to the illusion of what was- the farther out they spiral into a dark, surreal, suspended animation of the mind.

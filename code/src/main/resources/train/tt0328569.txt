Troublesome Night 14
###BREAK###
Christin has been working at a hotel owned by Budcasso, her friend's fianc√©. When she is discovered stealing money from the hotel, she turns to her friend Zidanes for help. When Zidanes refuses, Christin decides to fake a suicide attempt, hoping Budcasso will take pity on her. Unfortunately, her plan goes wrong, and she actually kills herself. Soon after, Christin returns as a fierce ghost, and begins to kill all in her path at the hotel as a means for revenge. In the mean time, Budcasso invites his spirit-fighting ex-wife Mrs. Bud Lung (Troublesome Night regular Lan Law) to the wedding.

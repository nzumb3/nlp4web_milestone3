Inspirations Vol. 6: Destination Beyond Cancer
###BREAK###
Victor Crowl follows the Coast to Coast Against Cancer Foundation, and all of their affiliate programs and signature events, over the course of a full year across Canada. The lives of families and individuals who are both struggling with cancer and continuing to fight against cancer are documented in this inspirational film. Coast to Coast is an organization working for the fight against childhood cancer, a disease that is dramatically underfunded by the government in Canada.

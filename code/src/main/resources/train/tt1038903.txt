Just Like Joe
###BREAK###
"JUST LIKE JOE" is a poignant coming-of-age story that will touch your heart and bring you back to an era when Woodstock became legend and the Peace, Love and Rock 'N Roll generation was just starting out. Set in the tumultuous year of 1969 , the film follows the lives of three 17-year old, high school football players bonded by friendship and their compelling need to find their place in a rapidly changing world. Longing for a senior year filled with dating, the prom and football glory, their normal rites of passage run smack into the drama and uncertainty of the times - the military draft, evolving sexual mores, racial inequality and the possibly fighting in the Vietnam War. With the encouragement of his blind father, star quarterback Paul Russo believes that the only way he can escape the military draft is by winning an improbable football scholarship. Tony shares Paul's infectious enthusiasm for life, but has another obsession-his unrequited love. While Frank struggles to learn about his roots and himself as a young black man living in a world of escalating racial prejudice and tension. As different as these three teammates are, one extraordinary thing unites them above all else-their desire to be "Just Like Joe' - Joe Namath- their iconic hero who was the sexy. ultra cool, 1969 Super Bowl winning quarterback of the New York Jets and the personification of everything they could ever hope to be.

Matt's life is racing out of control - all he wants to do is pass the bar exam and win back his girlfriend, but his boss wants him to house-sit while he's studying, the boss's kids want a party, his friends distract him, his roommate's odd and the neighbours want to convert him. What's a guy to do?

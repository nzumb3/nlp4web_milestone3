En la Sangre
###BREAK###
Cain is banished to the Land of Nod after killing his brother; thus, it became the land of the traitor and of the wanderer. This premise is the starting point for our love story of those who betray; it is a love triangle between Mateo, Nadia and Tomas. It's the story of a friendship, the portrait of a paralyzed generation, the tale of how they live, love and find each other in their loneliness.

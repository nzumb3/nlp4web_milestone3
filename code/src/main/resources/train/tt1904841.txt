Intangible Blue (Azul intangible) is a road movie over and about the ocean, which portrays the diversity and charm of Mexico's northwestern seas. The journey starts in Mexico City and plays out in the waters and depths of the Gulf of California and the Pacific. A film crew sails several weeks on a ship, The Sandman, taking on an expedition to get to know the life in these waters. Immersing in this journey will reveal the unknown: overwhelmingly enormous and friendly beings, waters thriving with life, beauty and motion. A female voice is our guide to an underwater world full of sea titans and fantastic ecosystems. Throughout this trip we will encounter sperm whales, humpback whales, giant rays, dolphins, underwater forests, and more. Back in Mexico City, the interaction between this marine treasure and the people that live in the cities can be seen through a new perspective. This documentary unveils the ethereal and intangible quality of the sea, as well as the importance of taking steps to preserve these waters, starting now and even from distant cities. The unexpected ending offers subtle audiovisual metaphors that will captivate the viewer.

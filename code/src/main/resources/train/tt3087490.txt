A Drop of Water
###BREAK###
A Drop of Water is the debut film by photographer, and now filmmaker, Gus Cantavero. The film was written, directed, shot and edited entirely as a solo project. He narrates this emotional portrait of modern day Cambodia as he experienced it, beginning from the point of arrival and ending with a reflection on life in America. Besides still feeling the effects of Pol Pot's genocide, Cambodia is stifled by starvation, demands by corrupt government officials for constant bribes and a booming population of orphans. The film chronicles the efforts of 3 Christian organizations (Water of Life Asia, Harmony Outreach and World Orphans) that are trying a bottom-up approach to train a new generation of Godly leaders to rescue a broken society.

Der Schein tr√ºgt
###BREAK###
In money all that is solid melts into air. Be it sex, potatoes or weapons, the alchemical substance called money can transform anything into anything else. Humanity's most brilliant and fatal invention is also the one with the furthest-reaching consequences. A magical substance that can mean anything and yet has no value. It is created from nothing, multiplies exponentially and takes its value from its scarcity. Poverty guarantees its value: If everyone had enough money, it would have no worth. We are told, it's a medium of exchange, but only 2 % of the trillions daily blast around the globe are used for the exchange of goods and services.

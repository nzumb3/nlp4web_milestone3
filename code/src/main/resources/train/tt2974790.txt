Nazithon: Decadence and Destruction
###BREAK###
Below the war-torn surface of Nazi Germany is a private bunker, built for two. This lecherous lair is the domain of Frau Bombshell (Michelle "Bombshell" McGee), the most sadistically sinful sexpot ever to grace the ranks of the SS! Goose step inside, as she takes you on a whirlwind march through the tortuously torrid history of Nazi grindhouse cinema. From sex camps, to neo-Nazis, to supernatural soldiers, the Reich bares all in this celebration of Nazi exploitation. Blood. Breasts. Brutality. By order of der FÃ¼hrer, say "heil" to NAZITHON: DECADENCE AND DESTRUCTION!

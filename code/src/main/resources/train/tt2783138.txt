Lagunemine
###BREAK###
An atypical documentary about three people who live and work in a remote area of the venetian lagoon. A place frozen in time, away from civilization. Three different stories, three different ways of living, in a rarefied and motionless environment of a land that lives in symbiosis with the water. The latest anthropological evidence of an endangered amphibian species. Where the poetry of the landscape becomes a tale.

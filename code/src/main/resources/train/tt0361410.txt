Brave in the Attempt: A Special Olympics Story
###BREAK###
A feature length documentary, often humorous and sometimes poignant, which follows fifteen athletes on a Special Olympics basketball team in their pursuit for gold. For the first time the athletes get to tell us about their world, share their diverse stories and what makes their lives amazing. Throughout the journey the athletes, along with their coaches and families, give us a view into the challenges facing those with disabilities while showing us how capable they really are. Through practices, social events, work and school we see their world, and what it takes to make a team. Fully self-financed, KL Entertainment shot Brave In The Attempt over a three month period in and around the Mesa, Arizona area.

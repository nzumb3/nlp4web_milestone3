A Blue Flower
###BREAK###
From an alchemist's laboratory to a shaman's home, from two weeks in complete darkness to tantra, filmmaker Nils Taranger takes you on a search for the blue flower, something that was thought to be impossible to find, in order to obtain a miraculous cure for his indented chest and broken heart. The quest for the blue flower takes him to a place he never considered looking: inside himself.

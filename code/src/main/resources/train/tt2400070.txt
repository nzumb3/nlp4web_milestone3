It Had to Be You
###BREAK###
'Now that I've resigned myself to living, how am I going to make something of it? There's a question I ask of myself and ask of everybody who is struggling to heal themselves, everybody who is dealing with AIDS, dealing with being gay, dealing with this painful world: Where is your passion? Why do you love, and what are you doing about it?' These words of Bill T. Jones (Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company) open IT HAD TO BE YOU, a film that looks at three Philadelphia Gayborhood couples, two male of differing generations and one female couple, as they negotiate life, death, love and why we're here.

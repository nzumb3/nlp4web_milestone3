ACT Honour Walk
###BREAK###
When one watches a wired individual who runs around the world developing odd structures that appear to do nothing, they are judged by the masses as insane. But our society does not understand what a life mission truly entails. For those beacons needed to be installed for future use. And if we are unable to examine the core motivations that drive all of the actions of each individual in question, then we will misinterpret what it is that they are doing. But as we activate the idle satellites around our heart, the bigger picture becomes understood and pathways to spread its message receive the oxygen from the heart that it needs to pump itself through our entire social human body.

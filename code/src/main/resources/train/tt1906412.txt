###BREAK###
In the mountains of Puerto Rico, the once-thriving coffee farmers are on the brink of extinction. Among their enemies are the globalization of the food industry, the inexorable march of agribusiness, a dysfunctional neo-colonial government, and shifting social values. When a plague of never before seen beetles descends on the coffee plantations, the mountain people are pushed to the edge. As the island's agriculture seems about to collapse, the farmers show their grit and meet the challenge with a unique blend of grassroots activism, good humor, black coffee and all-natural biological warfare.

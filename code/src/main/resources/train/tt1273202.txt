Alek is desperate because Teodora has left him after a three years being together.

Despite Bane's advice, Alek keeps calling Teodora who has fallen in love with Nemanja in the meantime. However decisive and tough Teodora is when she is with Alek, she is as indulgent and helpless when she is spending time with Nemanja. The problem is that Nemanja is not in love with her but with Marina, a girl by a few years younger. Unfortunately, Marina is not in love with him, she is very attracted to Alek's "Slavic depression". She doesn't know that reason for his "charm of a desperate" is his failure with Teodora, she thinks Alek was born like that.

State of Aloha
###BREAK###
This is the 50th Anniversary of Hawaii Statehood. There is still a current dialogue and controversy about the legitimacy of Hawaii's state status. Largely anchored by personal narrative, the motivating paths toward statehood are addressed as well as the legacy left behind. Interviewees cover a representative span of the population in Hawaii, including people from the political, cultural, business, academia communities as well as the person next door. STATE OF ALOHA is in reference to Reverend Akaka's sermon on March 13, 1959-- 'The fears Hawaii may have are to be met by men and women who are living witnesses of what we really are in Hawaii, of the spirit of Aloha, men and women who can help unlock the doors to the future... For any collective anxiety, the answer is collective courage.'

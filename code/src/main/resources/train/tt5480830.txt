The Wolf OR-7 Expedition
###BREAK###
The Wolf OR-7 Expedition retraced the approximate track generated by the GPS collar worn by the Oregon wolf known as Wolf OR-7. This young male grey wolf traversed over 1,200 miles through Oregon and into California, to become the first and only documented free-roaming wolf in California in nearly 90 years, and he is still out there . . . Our team consisted of a wolf ecologist, a storyteller, a filmmaker, a National Geographic Young Explorer, a logistics coordinator and a wild peace advocate. Our aim was and continues to be about raising awareness of local strategies that make on-the-ground strides toward human and wolf coexistence in the region.

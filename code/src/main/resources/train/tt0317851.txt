Set in Belgrade over Easter weekend in 1997, the film involves a group of policemen who respond to the city's political turmoil. Due to the overthrow of Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic, violence and protests have erupted all over the city. Patrolling the streets in a bus, the unit is led by commanding officer Dragon who isn't entirely sure what to do himself. Throughout their weekend-long shift, each man of this unit battles with his own personal problems as the political tension escalates.

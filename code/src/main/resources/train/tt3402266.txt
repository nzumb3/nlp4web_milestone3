Wind & Rattlesnakes
###BREAK###
Named for an old cowboy's two-word description of Wyoming, 'Wind and Rattlesnakes' documents the history, people and climbing around Lander, Wyoming. The one hour long film follows the development of the region as a world-class climbing area, from the earliest days of Paul Petzoldt's students at the National Outdoor Leadership School tying in with bowlines around the waist, to the current development of Wolf Point which bow has one of the highest concentrations of 5.14's in America. Highlights include archive footage of Todd Skinner, interviews with developers like Paul Piana and Steve Bechtel, and B.J. Tilden on the first ascent of one of America's hardest routes, Moonshine (5.14d) at the Wild Iris.

Don't Throw Stones
###BREAK###
In 2009, Australian singer/songwriter Stephen Cummings wrote a memoir entitled 'Will It be Funny Tomorrow, Billy?'. From his time in one of Australia's favourite bands, The Sports, through a solo career littered with critical success, public indifference and bad timing, 'Don't Throw Stones' is a unique view of an artist trying to make it while remaining true to himself. 'Don't Throw Stones' the movie tells the story from, and the repercussions of, that memoir. Never one to hold back, Cummings upset virtually every person in the music industry. Feathers were ruffled, feelings were hurt, and friendships tested. But now, in this film, the music industry stalwarts get the unique opportunity to reply to Stephen's version of events, and they relish the opportunity!

In the Steppes of Genghis
###BREAK###
Over half of the people living on the vast central Asian steppe of Mongolia are nomads. Herders live in small felt tents called gers, migrating seasonally to find better grazing land for their flocks. Life on the steppe is almost the same as it was during the days of Genghis Khan. IN THE STEPPES OF GENGHIS focuses on a year in the life of Khoroldai, a nine-year old girl who loves horses. She loves to groom and exercise them, but clearly her favorite thing is to race them. This intimate story is filmed over the course of a year as she weathers a brutal winter, tends to her animals, and then travels across the steppe to compete in the oldest horse race in the world.

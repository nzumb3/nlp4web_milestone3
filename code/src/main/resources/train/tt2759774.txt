One Year's Crop
###BREAK###
Back on the farm upon the death of his father, Robert Biggs, prodigal son of the soil, faces the demons that drove him away, while blessing the angels calling him home. Long an actor, musician, composer and writer, Robert struggles to reconcile the story of where he came from, with the stories he now writes for the stage. Haunting, big-sky visuals of the windswept Illinois prairie support a narrative story unfolding in four patient seasons. Shadows play with light in this homespun American tale of a wandering spirit and the land that he loves.

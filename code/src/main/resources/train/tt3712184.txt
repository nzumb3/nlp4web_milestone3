Altrove
###BREAK###
The physical and spiritual condition of contemporary souls and voices from the past split between revolutionary, unconventional and sometimes conscious life changing choices and situations imposed by the dramatic scenery of the first world war. Belluno's dolomite, a Franciscan hermitage in Tuscany, a grazing land in Sardinia are the background to this documentary called: Elsewhere. The elsewhere represented in this film is not a dimension of isolation, but a love testimony towards the other and the universe.

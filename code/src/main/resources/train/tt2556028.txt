Breaking the Frame
###BREAK###
An exhilarating new work about the American artist Carolee Schneemann, the trailblazing multi-hyphenate (film, video, performance, installation) whose work continues to defy cultural gravity. Montr√©al filmmaker Marielle Nitoslawska interweaves Schneemann's films and documentation with poetic, kinetic mediations concerning art-making, feminism, gender, sexuality, and identity.

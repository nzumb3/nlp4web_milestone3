Flying High, Standing Tall
###BREAK###
From female wrestlers to bearded ladies to bareback riders, women circus performers often straddled the line between the demure, the sexualized and the aberrant. Today, Circus Artemis, a Portland-based, all-female circus is determined to both dazzle and empower women and girls with family-friendly shows featuring trapeze artists, contortionists, fire dancers, stilt-walkers and more. Watch a group of talented women burn brightly, fly high and stand tall, all while turning traditional notions of circus life on their head. Combining performer interviews with footage of live performances, this documentary short will give viewers a behind-the-scenes look at a new kind of circus, coming into its own.

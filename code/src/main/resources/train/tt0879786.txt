Anette/Anette - Krimjouren
###BREAK###
Anette and Anette are both police officers in different towns, Trollhättan and Borlänge. We follow them to work as they investigate crime. They're both women in a male-dominated profession and neither weapons nor safety vests are designed for women. Despite death, grief and adversity, they always seem to find humanity and understanding with the people they encounter.

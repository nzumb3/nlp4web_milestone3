Miss Violence
###BREAK###
It's Angeliki's 11th birthday celebration, and a well-organised party is held in her honour. Everything is in order, and all the ingredients of a usual birthday party are there. A nice fest, a big cake, music, dance, a caring grandfather's embrace... a truly loving family environment. But is it real, or is this an elaborate facade? As we witness a devastating act of despair, we understand that something lies underneath. The story advances, and we slowly get lured into a web of hideous secrets, while gradually getting ourselves dragged into a downward spiral of lies and deceptive appearances. When we unwillingly unravel the mysteries kept behind closed doors, in reality, we plunge into the depths of the human soul and the unfathomable secrets within.

Ancient Alien Agenda: Aliens and UFOs from the Area 51 Archives
###BREAK###
There is startling evidence that we were visited by intelligent beings in the ancient past. Why were they here and what was their agenda? Zecharia Sitchin is the author of the hugely successful book series "The Earth Chronicles." Join this amazing scholar of ancient mysteries as he makes a scientific and scholarly argument for Ancient Alien visits to Earth. Sitchin was born in Russia, raised in Palestine and graduated from the University of London. He worked for years as a journalist and editor in Israel before settling in New York. Sitchin, like Velikovsky and Von Daniken, gives a compelling and entertaining presentation detailing evidence that Ancient Aliens from other worlds have not only visited the earth but plan to RETURN. Sitchin's theories are based on his belief that some ancient myths are not myths at all but historical and scientific texts. According to Sitchin, the ancient Sumerian clay tablets discovered in the early 1900's reveal that gods from another planet called "Nibiru" arrived on Earth some 450,000 years ago. The ancient Sumerians knew of this planet of the gods, that Sitchin termed the "12th Planet." Learn of a time when there were extraterrestrials among us and how they helped advance our civilization, as well as how they plan to return in the future.

A 2 year old baby girl lay alone on a bamboo mat in a government orphanage in Northern Thailand, 11 years ago. She had been abandoned in the "AIDS room". Her medical chart read: "bploi wai dtaai: Leave her to die". In a country that ostracizes those living with HIV, one extraordinary woman, Avis Rideout, was determined to prove that through loving and caring for those rejected and abandoned due to HIV, it is the incredible power of love that can and is... Saving lives.

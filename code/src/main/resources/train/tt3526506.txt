Cinderella on the Go
###BREAK###
Making opera fun is the perfect way to introduce classical music to children. The film is a humorous story of a class of 10-year-old's who with their music teacher, turn Rossini's opera 'La Cenerentola' back into a childhood story from whence it came. Coupled with the challenge of singing four-part harmony, these children act and sing their way through one of Rossini's masterpieces. The resultant romp through childhood innocence will not be forgotten easily.

Ilai
###BREAK###
Ilai follows the story of a little Girl lost in a bustling metropolis. She doesn't speak the city's language and wanders about its hostile streets to find a way to her home. Lost and forlorn, she instinctively lures a kind baker, three young rag-picking boys and a feisty old woman into her search. Ilai encapsulates the lives of these reclusive characters as they zealously bond and set off unwittingly on a circular journey.

Myra, the program leader, traveled to India at fourteen and now returns each summer, enabling others to share her profound early experience. Seventeen-year old Neesha grapples with the filth and poverty of India's surroundings. Adopted from Calcutta at birth , she has returned to her native country for the first time. She realizes, '...this could have been me...'. The young seekers navigate both a new world and their encounters with each other- far from home.

Bare Hands and Wooden Limbs
###BREAK###
In 1974 former Khmer Rouge Commander Touj Soeurly and the fourteen year old Chhem Sip were deadly enemies. Sip was imprisoned, tortured, and just barely managed to escape with his life to the US. Now these two former enemies are working together to make possible the community of Veal Thom, a cooperative village composed primarily of soldiers -- from both sides of the war -- disabled by landmines, and their families. The amputees of Veal Thom cope with extreme poverty, the elements, poor health, lack of education and lack of resources. This film is a testament to the new feeling of cooperation in Cambodia and the courage of the villagers of Veal Thom.

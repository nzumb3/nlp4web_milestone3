Maria Magdalena
###BREAK###
From 1942 to 1981 in Switzerland, authorities arrested pregnant teenagers without any legal basis and put them in jails with criminals without any charge in order to educate them. Maria Magdalena is one them. Her baby was given up for adoption without her consent, before she was put in Interbank prison. While she thought it was always the fault of the Catholic church for all that happened to her, the sudden discovery of her father's letter put much needed light into her life.

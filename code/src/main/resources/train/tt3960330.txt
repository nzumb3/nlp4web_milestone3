###BREAK###
It is the story of a roadside vendor who sells dust cloths. Physically-challenged as a result of a childhood accident, vendor has only one arm. Yet , instead of being dependent on others to fetch him food, he does so on his own. An entrepreneur of sorts, he sells dust cloths to save enough, so that he can open a small shop. With whatever he earns he also takes care of his family-a wife and two sons. It took us two minutes and forty seconds to tell the story of this man.

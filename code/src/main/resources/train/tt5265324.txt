That Great Conspiracy!
###BREAK###
It's election time. It's always Palmira who decides who'll be elected next mayor. This year she decides to elect her nephew, Peter, a clueless forty year old whose only skill is playing bowls. Despite his obvious incompetence he is unanimously elected mayor, but the day after his investiture he's arrested for attempted murder. It's up to Palmira, Miglieta and Geni to solve the case.

Into the Gyre
###BREAK###
Into the Gyre is a 44-minute film documenting a groundbreaking expedition to study the location, extent and effect of plastic pollution in the North Atlantic Gyre. Thirty-four volunteer researchers, scientists and sailors participated in this five-week long journey to the Sargasso Sea, east of Bermuda. Sailing on a 135-foot tall ship, the film closely follows four of the researchers as they collect, count, and archive the plastic they encounter. Along the way, the film examines the history of plastics, the adverse effects it is causing in the ocean, and possible solutions to this problem.

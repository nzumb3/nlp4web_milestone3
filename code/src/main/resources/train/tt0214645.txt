A Hong Kong woman in Toronto suffers from insomnia and is worried sick over a missing boyfriend. She decides to take a trip into the dream world through computer networking. Inevitably, she ends up with more than she bargains for, but, in the end, all seems to boil down to the simple pleasure of a cup of Hong Kong style "milk tea".

El percance perfecto
###BREAK###
Ernesto Palacio, the foremost Latino writer, decides after 2 recent flops to open his latest play in a small theater in Hollywood rather than Broadway or the West End. With a desire to cross language and cultural boundaries with his Spanish language play, and in an attempt to reach the masses, he pushes the envelope even further by casting two non-actors in lead roles...one, a hugely popular, female pop singer and the other a world renowned, Colombian, bullfighter. Fireworks and jealousy amongst the cast lead to mayhem during the opening night performance and despite believing that everything happens for a reason, Ernesto's faith is pushed to the absolute limit by this latest disaster.

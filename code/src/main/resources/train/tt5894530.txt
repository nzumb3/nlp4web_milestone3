Deckument: od rolke do skejta
###BREAK###
Documentary film Deckument is a memoir of a marginal sporting subculture. It tells a story of Slovenian skateboarding pioneers in late 80s and early 90s - kids making their own boards, building improvised skate objects and learning their first tricks, smuggling skate goods from abroad, their first competition victories and widespread popularization of skateboarding. From misunderstood outcasts to local superstars. The first generations of local skateboarders rode through an exciting historical era: from the transitional period of Yugloslavia's break-up and Balkan conflicts to the beginnings of capitalism in all its glory. Deckument is a story of endless enthusiasm, a story of struggling for existence and progression of local skateboarding.

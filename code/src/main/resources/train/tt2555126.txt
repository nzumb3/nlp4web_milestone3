To Chris Marker, an Unsent Letter
###BREAK###
A collective cinematic love letter to the elusive French filmmaker Chris Marker, Emiko Omor's timely film captures the persona of a filmmaker who is at once both contradictorily present in and distant from his body of work. Notoriously private, self-described as the 'best known author of unknown works,' Marker is widely known for a few key cinematic works such as LA JETEE (1963) and SANS SOLEIL (1983), but his wider filmography remains undiscovered. Through interviews with Marker's colleagues and admirers, Omori lovingly describes a man whose preference for personal privacy has rendered him perhaps cinema's most famous enigma: a man who is his works. --Samuel B. Prime, Melnitz Movies Director

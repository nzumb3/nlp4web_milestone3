A Normal Life
###BREAK###
The film examines how a mother keeps herself and her family going even though everything around her is an almost unbearable chaos with a daughter seriously ill of cancer. How she tries to displace the brutal realities, because she so much wants to live a normal life with her three girls. The mother wants to distribute her love and care equally among her girls, but suffers from living in a constant state of emergency. Her greatest fear is that if she starts crying everything around her will collapse.

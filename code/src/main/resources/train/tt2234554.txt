King George VI: The Man Behind the King's Speech
###BREAK###
King's Speech is the definitive story of the man who overcame his own failings for the sake of his nation. When his older brother, Edward VIII abdicates the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, nervous-mannered successor George "Bertie" VI is plagued with shyness and a speech impediment when speaking to his subjects. It is the true story of an introvert and humble man whom events and circumstances made him become an inspiration for the British nation during their war with Hitler's Germany.

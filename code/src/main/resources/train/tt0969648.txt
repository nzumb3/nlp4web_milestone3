In addition Tina is being aggressively pursued by an upperclassman and since their father is out of the picture, Lee feels he is her only defense against the corrupting influences around her. Enter Joe Kross, the owner of a local gym, who agrees to help coach the wrestling team. Because Lee is without guidance, Joe's increasing influence threatens to push Lee over the precipice.

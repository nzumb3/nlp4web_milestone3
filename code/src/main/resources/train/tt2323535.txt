Fant, pobratim smrti 2
###BREAK###
Chernobyl 25 years later... What was happening in the meantime, between the first nuclear cataclysm and the prospect of another one? Where have all the international relief funds disappeared and where are the millions, intended for the reconstruction of the decaying sarcophagus? Where is my life taking me? What legacy am I leaving to my son... These are just some of the questions that the little boy from Chernobyl Anatoliy Rizhov - Tolya, now a grown-up, is trying to answer 20 years after the first documentary about him was made.

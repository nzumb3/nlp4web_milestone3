Guns 'n' Moses
###BREAK###
A day in the life of the Jewish settlement of Hebron, the tomb of Abraham and the stronghold of the Israeli religious right.A polyphonic tale of spirituality and violence. Guns'n'Moses is a documentary about the Israeli ultra nationalist-religious settlers and their ideology in their own words . Their accounts interweave to create a fabric in which stand up their concepts of time and space, their idea of identity and enemy, the Divine plan underlying the daily life and the same use of the violence. Modern prophets carrying assault rifles, hippies devoted to the Cabala and the American folk music, techno-dancers longing for the Redemption and mothers proud to raise the future soldiers of the Messiah. In their own word and through their own eyes.

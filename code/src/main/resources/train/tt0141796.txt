Anita and her married boyfriend, András, get involved with some heavy hitters who smuggle from the Ukraine into Hungary.

At a nightclub, Anita meets Alex, a Ruthenian who's a collector of folk songs. The two of them begin an affair, and András may be left out in the cold, with the local mob still waiting for him to deliver the goods. How patient will they be, how desperate will András get, and how will Anita sort out loyalty and infatuation?

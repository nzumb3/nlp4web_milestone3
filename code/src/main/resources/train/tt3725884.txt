Lesser of Two Evils
###BREAK###
Lesser of Two Evils is an eccentric and emotional tale that examines both the strengths and the frailty of friendship. The story focuses on lifelong friends Patrick, Josh and Francis, who have just lost the entire budget for their film at a Native American casino. Francis, the writer and creative force behind the film, gives up all hope and is left unconscious after a raging drinking bender, leaving Patrick and Josh, his naive and selfish counterparts, to try and devise a solution before it's too late. In the process of coming up with ideas to save themselves and the film, they encounter some friendly and bizarre characters including a blind drug dealing Vietnam war veteran, and a charming southern bell hop with a severe head injury. With many satirical twists on both Hollywood and the film making process itself, this dark comedy explores the concepts of good and evil, and the constant battle between the two that takes place within all of us.

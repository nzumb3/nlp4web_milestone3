Femme de la rue
###BREAK###
Two years ago, master student 'Documentary film' Sofie Peeters moved to Brussels. She was faced with a very frustrating phenomenon. On a daily basis, she was treated with disregard by strange men in the streets: cheap attempts to flirt, sexist roaring, intimidating persecutions,... Sofie decided to make her Master film about this. She caught the sexism on tape, confronted the offenders and questioned women about how they deal with this problem. The result: 'Femme de la rue'.

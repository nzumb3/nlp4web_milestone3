Willing & Able
###BREAK###
'willing & able is a documentary that takes the viewer into the Dr. William Henderson Inclusion Elementary School in Dorchester, Massachusetts, where one third of the children have disabilities of some kind. Shot in the 'Direct Cinema' style, with no narration or interviews, it reveals that inclusion as a choice in an urban school system can be successful for everyone, regardless of their abilities. The big deal is that inclusion is no big deal, and there is a waiting list to get in.

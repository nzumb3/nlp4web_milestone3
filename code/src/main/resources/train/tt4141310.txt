###BREAK###
When Paldang Dam was built, many farmers lost their farms. Instead, they started organic farming in their land around Han River. In 2008, Korean government announced four River Plans including Paldang. The plan in Paldang organic town is to build bike lanes and a public park instead of farms. It causes serious conflicts among the farmers as they decide if they should fight against the government.

Suicide Poet
###BREAK###
After going to the hospital for a routine check up, Bruce Jay discovered his leg was infected with gas gangrene and had to have it severed below the knee that very night. The trauma of being an amputee haunted Jay with depression and suicidal thoughts. Lacking the funds to seek help from the academic world of psychologists, philosophers or doctors, Jay examines his discombobulated life from a street perspective. Through talking with people, using his dark comedy and jaded point of view, he seeks to discover if life is worth living. "Suicide Poet" is the every man's thinking movie that makes light of a very dark subject and dares you to come along for the ride.

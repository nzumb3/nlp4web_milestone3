Tinar
###BREAK###
Doc follows the life of a boy named Tinar, a hired cowherd. Tinar works alone; his father lives elsewhere on the mountain with his new wife and family. Tinar's job is to keep careful watch over a fairly large herd of milking cows. He eats, sleeps, and even plays with them; they are his only companions. As the seasons change, a pastoral portrait of Tinar and his life gradually turns into a harrowing and lonely account of a boy longing for escape and love. What Tinar wants most is to go to school like his step-siblings, or to join his brother, who has escaped their father and now works in the city with their uncle.

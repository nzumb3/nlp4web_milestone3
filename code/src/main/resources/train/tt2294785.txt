Maxim and Irina have been dating for 3 years, but for some reason they have no sex in their life. Developing portraits of each other in the red darkroom replaces the intimacy. They decided to capture on camera their fading feelings. The film is a video-diary. The storyline is based on relationship between director and his girlfriend. This is a frank dialogue between two people, a dialogue between two cameras. The film is shot in an unusual way which includes new visual construction of a movie. Two cameras were used: director shot the main character of the film with one camera, and the heroine used the second camera to shoot the director. Thus, the film is made from two points of view.

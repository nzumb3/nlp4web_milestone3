Orange Winter
###BREAK###
In November 2004 the people of Kiev, Ukraine, took to the streets in thousands, protesting the official results of the Election Committee, after a rigged presidential election. The traditionally silent country erupted: protesting against the corrupted regime of the current president, his appointed "heir" and pressure from neighboring Russia. That was the beginning of the Orange Revolution. Once again the eternal conflict between the powers and the people cast the dark threat of bloodshed upon the country. The feature documentary essay chronicles these crucial days in the history of the country and reflects on the fate of the nation.

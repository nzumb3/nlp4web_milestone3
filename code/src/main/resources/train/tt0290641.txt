H3
###BREAK###
'H3' is a universal story of endurance and courage set inside Europe's most secure prison, the Maze prison in Northern Ireland. Here, in H3 - the bleakest of all the H-blocks - a group of young republican prisoners hold out for what they believe in, refusing to be labeled as criminals or co-operate with prison authorities. However, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher is determined that these Republican prisoners will be treated like all the other common criminals in British jails, ending a special regime which allowed the inmates political status to organise life inside the jail along POW lines. The republican prisoners immediately start a 'no-wash' protest, refusing to wear prison-issue clothes or perform work duties, a protest which results in their being locked in their cells for hours on end without exercise, recreation, reading materials and with only blankets to wear for heat. After four years on this protest, morale is at an all time low and everyone knows that something desperate is called for to break the deadlock... Although 'H3' portrays bleak prison conditions and tough moments, it also shows the camaraderie and craic, (Gaelic for fun) as inmates learn Jailic, (the particular brand of Gaelic learned inside the prison), sing songs, spin yarns and keep an eye out for each other. As each prisoner is forced to confront his own demons, the film shows us the triumph of humanity, friendship, loyalty and courage over the prison administration's crude efforts to break their will. The hunger strikes irrevocably altered the political landscape in the north of Ireland, preparing the ground for the current peace process which was born of the tremendous sacrifices made by the protagonists of this extraordinary yet true film.

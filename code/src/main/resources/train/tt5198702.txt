The Shadow Zone
###BREAK###
In 2016, invaders from space attacked Earth and its people. In an effort to thwart the attackers, brilliant scientist Dr. Diane Landry created an alien-human hybrid to wipe the invaders out. They performed well and drove the invaders out, but then turned on humanity themselves. In 2017, the few remaining survivors, mostly living underground and in secret, must work together to reach a "safe haven" where they will not be at the mercy of these new, deadly creatures.

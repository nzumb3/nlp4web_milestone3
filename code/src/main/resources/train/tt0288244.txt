Tangy Guacamole
###BREAK###
Filmed on location in "The Mexico"... this is the true story of a wild and crazy trip to San Felipe. We follow 3 Avocado Hombres, 4 Red Hot Chili Peppers, 2 and a 1/2 Professional Meatheads, a Mysterious Hitchhiker and a Spiritual Fugitive as they cross paths with the Mexican underworld. From the beaches to the streets, to the cantina's and the clubs.... Everyone must watch their back and eat the magical "Tangy G" in order to turn an awful adventure... into the vacation they will never forget!

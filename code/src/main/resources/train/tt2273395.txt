Made in England
###BREAK###
The best smack in the mouth you'll ever get. Made in England is an observational character driven documentary that looks at the changing world of London, England. The film is set in a down and dirty illegitimate boxing club, squatting in a city council-owned building in a crime-ridden area of London. The gym is under political pressure to close its doors. For the first time in the documentary world, this film reveals an honest and raw depiction of modern England and the people that call it home. A mix of Albanian Mafia, illegal debt collectors and Gypsies who are willing to murder their own. Until now these characters have only been fictionalized. Ultimately this documentary is a portrait of modern England.

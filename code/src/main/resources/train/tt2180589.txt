When Bubbles Burst is the story behind the story: In a globalized economy it becomes increasingly difficult for nations, companies and individuals to protect themselves from today's extreme financial volatility. The economic 'butterfly effect' makes us all equally vulnerable. In this documentary we will travel from Norway out into the world in order to examine the mechanics behind bubbles and crashes, and discuss trends and visions for the future.

This documentary exposes the housing crisis faced by 1,700 Cree in Northern Ontario, a situation that led Attawapiskat's band chief, Theresa Spence, to ask the Canadian Red Cross for help. With the Idle No More movement making front page headlines, this film provides background and context for one aspect of the growing crisis.

Beagle Boogie Babe
###BREAK###
Have you ever had a dream that something horrible happened to someone you know and then it came true? That is what happened to Director Paul Gorman. In his second feature documentary, Beagle Boogie Babe, Paul Gorman attempts to unlock the mystery of a dream that has haunted him for years. In doing so he hoped to learn what drove Joan Carson to take up skydiving and continue on after suffering two serious accidents and to understand the events that led up to her death. 'Beagle Boogie Babe is first hand, refreshing, honest and is from Joan, not me. I acted as a conduit as I pursued my vision. The result is a thought provoking and unique film' -- Paul Gorman

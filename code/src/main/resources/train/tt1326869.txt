Stuck Like Chuck
###BREAK###
Charlie is a lovable loser who can't find a way to work up the courage to ask the girl of his dreams out. After some scheming with Rob, his stoner roommate, Charlie and Juliet find themselves locked in their Film-201 class. Stuck spending the night together, Charlie and Juliet finally open up to each other through a series of witty conversations. Filled with sharp dialogue, movie references and indie film clich√©s, this film was made with both humor and heart.

The Soprano State: New Jersey's Culture of Corruption Part 1
###BREAK###
Envelopes of money exchanged for political favors. Cash paid for back-door deals. Construction contracts handed out for those who bribed elected officials. Sound like an episode of "The Sopranos"? Worse. Welcome to New Jersey, where politics and corruption go hand-in-hand. The documentary takes viewers on a wild ride of political power and corruption that started when New Jersey was still a colony. The film exposes elected officials who ran on platforms promising to end the very practices they now find themselves behind bars for. The real organized crime in New Jersey is committed by the politicians. The film features interviews and commentary from the attorneys, politicians, federal prosecutors and journalists who witnessed it all. The film is narrated by Tony Darrow, who has played in a variety of films, including The Sopranos and Goodfellas.

###BREAK###
'The Return of Lazarus' is the first feature film Alexandros Konstantaras shot in Greece. Two brothers, Lazarus (Alexandros Koch) and Kyriakos (Nelson Lucas), set out for a road trip to Maronia, Northern Greece, in a quest for the mythical cave of the Cyclops. On their journey they meet King'ora (Lizz Njagah), a Kenyan woman who works in a local motel. A low budget road movie beautifully shot on location, with elements of magical realism.

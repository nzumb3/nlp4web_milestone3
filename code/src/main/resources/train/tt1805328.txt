Melakan Portuguese: Preserving Their Heritage
###BREAK###
500 years ago, the Portuguese Viceroy of India, Alfonso D' Albuquerque, led an armada of 19 war ships with 800 Portuguese soldiers, destined for the ancient port city of Melaka. However this premeditated attack on Melaka to avenge the ill-treatment of a former mission was merely a front, with the ultimate mission being to capture Melaka, and gain control of the Eastern Spice Trade. After the successful conquest, Albuquerque immediately ordered the building of a fortress to defend the city and its lucrative spice trade from his arch enemies - the Dutch. Today's Melakan Portuguese are descendants of 600 Portuguese soldiers who survived and were encouraged to assimilate with the locals, yet maintaining their unique identity. The fall of the respectably famed Melakan Empire into the hands of the foreign colonist is a historical enigma that is said to have had a strong influence in shaping today's Malay civilisation. Enduring the numerous invasions from the Dutch, British and Japanese this community is an interesting phenomenon that still maintains its strong roots and yet has no desire to return to their native land. Enigmatic Malaysia allows you to experience the rich cultural heritage of the Malaysian Melakan Portuguese community... their propensity to survive and propagate their language, tradition, religion and arts.

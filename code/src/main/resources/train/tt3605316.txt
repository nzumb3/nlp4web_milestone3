Love Songs
###BREAK###
Love songs is a melodramatic fragment of several lives, intersected by a trace of their mutual past. The outline of this trace surfaces unobtrusively and incidentally throughout the principal episode of the film: Gabriel, a young man, visits a household he used to know very well at one time. Patient observation of the situation unwinds in shades of melancholy, sadness, but also hilarity and humor.

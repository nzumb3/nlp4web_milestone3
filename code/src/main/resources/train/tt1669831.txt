The Visitor from Planet Omicron
###BREAK###
An alien comes to earth with a botanical virus plot. He's not a bad guy, he's just in it for the paycheck. But a shut-in Arizona widow wins him over with her garden-fresh produce, protects him like a foster mother, and even flies to Omicron to overthrow his scheming government. Not bad for a retired widow from Phoenix.

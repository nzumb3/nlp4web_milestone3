Stair Dad
###BREAK###
Fazli is known as an insignificant and inadequate man by everyone around him, including his family. However, his routine life changes with an old stair car he buys, which people are only used to seeing at airports while passengers are getting on and off planes. Although The Stair Car is a subject of ridicule at first, it changes our hero's life like a magic wand. The ensuing events turn a sheepish man into a folk hero overnight.

Dead in France
###BREAK###
Socially-challenged hitman Charles lives in Cannes and wants to retire with a yacht and a woman in tow. He has no experience with either until he lets his cleaning lady (delectable Essex-girl Lisa) into his life, but he doesn't bank on her vile boyfriend Denny or con-artists Simon and Ray stealing a two million quid nest egg from the boot of his car. Charles hunts them down across the Cote d'Azur whilst pursued by his rival Clancy who is incensed by the fact that Charles might actually be retiring.

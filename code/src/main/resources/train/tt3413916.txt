Luna en Leo
###BREAK###
When the moon is in Leo it is time for drama and people feel the need to be loved and recognized. Under this cosmic influence, Luna (30) and Leo (32) will have a first date. During that night, Luna and Leo will go through the difficult art of seduction, in which a few words spoken too honest, or too soon, can undo any charm. The risk of this first meeting and the relentless pursuit of naturalness will make their relationship dance between flirtations and misunderstandings. Leo will advance groping, trying to decode Luna's world, who refuses to succumb to the simplicity of this man who, at the same time, is very refreshing. They both are sensitive, fully formed individuals who are trying to make an honest connection.

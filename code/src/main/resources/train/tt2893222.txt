Geraldo de Barros - sobras em obras
###BREAK###
"Sobras", in Portuguese, means "remainders", like the falls of fabrics which the dressmaker draws aside with a hand. It is also the title of the last photographs carried out by Geraldo de Barros (1923-1998), pioneer of Brazilian experimental photography and also one of the most significant artists of the constructivist movement . His creative process is approached in this film in a stimulative dialogue between passed and present, between the trajectory of a man and that of his country.

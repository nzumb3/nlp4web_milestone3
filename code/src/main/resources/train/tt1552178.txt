Le ragazze di Trieste
###BREAK###
The story, or, better said, the stories of those "Triestine Girls" who, at the beginning of the Fifties, left Trieste for the United States. All of them were very young, many still in their teens, all of them decided to leave to follow their dreams, a project, a man. They all placed a bet on their destiny and made an investment to build a different future for themselves. These women tell us the story of the city of Trieste and of the promised land they found during those years. The film is a private diary, describing our recent history through the voices of some of the protagonists of those times, who have been tracked down following a trail of photographs, names, acquaintances, small details. A documentary made out of archive material (records, videos, pictures) and interviews to seven of these women, each with her own story to tell: New York, Florida, California, Michigan and Virginia, through their memories, the places and people they love, their whole life. A vivid and many-voiced tale, thoughtful and delicate, at times full of irony, a glance back to history suggesting a possible encounter between past and future.

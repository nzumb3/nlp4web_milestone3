Beringia, the longest (1000 km) sled dog race in Russia, takes place every year in Kamchatka peninsula. This race is of the greatest importance to Kamchatka. The mushers of all kinds, nationalities, and ages; men and women; professionals and amateurs participate in the race. The local priest Father Vladislav takes part in it as well. It's not his love for sports that makes him participate in the race, he speeds up to his congregation in small villages scattered among Kamchatka peninsula. Only in winter it is possible to cross Kamchatka from South to North, and only in a dog sled. People and dogs are running through the endless expanses of the stunning winter land.

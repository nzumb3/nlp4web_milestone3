Billi & Theodore
###BREAK###
When aspiring puppeteer Billi joins her long lost best friend Theodore on a road trip to retrieve the remnants of his broken relationship, fate, mixed with a little bad luck, gives them the opportunity to rekindle what they once had. A car-jacking, parking lot brawls, and facing a witch of an ex-girlfriend is nothing with your best friend by your side.

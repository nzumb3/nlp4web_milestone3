L'insonne: Ouverture
###BREAK###
Desdemona is a tormented radio DJ from Florence and her night time program is called The Sleepless. Radio listeners are often bizarre inhabitants of the night just looking for someone who listen to them, but this time it's Luca, a kid calling from an hospital who awakes Desdemona's sixth sense. She feels shades of fear in his voice: what is he scared of? Sometimes a small breath hides a terrifying story.

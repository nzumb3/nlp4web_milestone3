###BREAK###
In a post-critical thought dumbed down world, art and theatre is outlawed. Only the bravest most rebellious artists remain. With this comes the underworld art-scene, not unlike the alcohol prohibition years of America; and like then some politicians and elites are underground art seekers in the speakeasy art scene. There are also the boldest of the bold artist that take their art to the surface with public art bombs. These art bombs are met with the full force of law for fear of free thought breaking out and the darkness of democracy returning to the world.

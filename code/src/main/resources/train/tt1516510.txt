Katja, born from a polish mother and a German father, is also in conflict with her religious parents, who's perception of the reality is different to her own. Finally Katja meets one French dreamer who shows her the other point of view for the life. The death of the Pope will give Katja a symbolic impulse. She will have to make the choice, trying to find out what's her profession based on. Is it only her work or maybe her true vocation. If it's that last, how much is Katja ready to sacrifice?

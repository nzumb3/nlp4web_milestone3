Zooman
###BREAK###
As real as it gets. ZOOMAN is a unique Dogme-style 'reality feature film' about a man living his dream. As a little boy born and raised in Indiana, Buddy always dreamed of having a Zoo in his own backyard. When his father died on his 18th birthday, Buddy moved to Upper Michigan to find his destiny. 36 years later, we follow Buddy (now 54) through four seasons pursuing his dream against the odds. We witness the struggle and sacrifices he and his fiancee Carrie (27) make to live that dream unconditionally, their fight for conservation and survival. ZOOMAN is no fairytale. Rather a raw, authentic account of a raw, authentic man living his life with pure vigor and determination.

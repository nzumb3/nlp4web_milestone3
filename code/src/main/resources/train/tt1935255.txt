The Adventures of a Plumber in Outer Space
###BREAK###
A madcap science fiction comedy which is an affectionate homage to the British 'Confessions' films of the 1970's. Plumber Robin Evans gets transported to a distant planet by Queen Azzizaz, who wants him as her mate. Sergeant Zucker and Mrs Zucker also get transported to the planet, by mistake.

Niemals Allein

Once the female FC St. Pauli rugby team was the best in Germany. Eight times they won the German Championship, but then the crisis hit. The wrong trainer took the lead and hardly integrated new players in the team. And then most women who played for more than 10 years left the team at the same time. But slowly the team recovers, although there are still some troubles. But Johanna Jahnke the Captain of the team is taking the lead and helps the New Zealand Trainer Phil to get his voice across.

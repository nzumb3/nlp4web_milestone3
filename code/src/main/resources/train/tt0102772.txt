A Tao Priest, Master Tien Kuei, and his family provide shelter to the spirit of a young woman, struck down by lightening, until she is ready to reincarnate. However, the ghost is forced into hiding when Tien Kuei's colleague, Master Tien Lung, known for his unforgiving disposition in capturing any ghost or demon he encounters, visits the family with his daughter after a long journey. Tien Kuei is also suspicious that his stature in the household may be jeopardized by his more-powerful colleague's over-extending stay.

Goodnight, We Love You
###BREAK###
Unforgettable with her electrified hairdos and outlandish outfits, Phyllis Diller began her career in comedy as "the world's worst housewife" and rose to great popularity as she delighted in mocking herself and her "husband," Fang. Consisting of entirely new footage, this award-winning film traces Diller's groundbreaking career from its modest beginnings to her extraordinary success and also explores her off-stage life at home, providing a rare glimpse at the real, multi-faceted woman behind the image. Leading up to Diller's farewell stand-up performance, the film captures the comic's press conference, rehearsal and candid dressing room conversation as she prepares to hang up her wigs after 47 incredible years of making people laugh. Fellow comedians Roseanne Barr, David Brenner, Red Buttons, Don Rickles, Rip Taylor, Lily Tomlin and many more reflect on Diller's powerful legacy.

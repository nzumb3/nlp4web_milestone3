###BREAK###
SEAN GREY is struggling to find happiness after a distressing breakup, all while a sickness and infection on his arm are worsening. As Sean secludes to his room trying to recall the events that lead to this situation, many other students are also falling ill. After an unknown agencies involvement is made clear, tensions rise as fears of a more serious problem emerge. That night many bodies twist and turn into horrible creatures and MACQUAID, who is generally disliked for only caring about himself, is looked upon to lead the remaining students to safety.

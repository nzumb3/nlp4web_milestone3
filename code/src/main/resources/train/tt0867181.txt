Patient introduces us two brothers, Jode and Sean Wildman, who are polar opposites. Jode, the impatient brother, will occasionally do things like take a crowbar and a hammer to the trunk of his car in search of his lost keys. Sean, the level-headed, anal brother, would never think iron his socks simply because he gets them dry-cleaned. Sean is suddenly stricken with a life threatening illness and is given only a short time to live. Jode, with little thought, immediately sets out to find a way to save his brother. Having fallen on his face so many times in life, this is Jode's chance to prove himself. But, will he go too far? Soon, he finds himself faced with many difficult decisions and Jode must decide whether his brother's life is worth trading for everything he thought he was.

Jode finds himself in a frenzied chase in which he almost forfeits his own life at the hands of the villainous "CRIPPLE". After attempting every avenue possible to him, and failing miserably, Jode gives up all hope saying, "Only a miracle can save Sean now." and it does...

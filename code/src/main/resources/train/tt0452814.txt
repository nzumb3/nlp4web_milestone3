Loop
###BREAK###
Norwegian documentary about humans relations to time, and what happens when someone decide to jump off the time loop, to find themselves. Some seeks out excitement and discoveries, others want piece and quite. Isn't this two things which are all about the same? Finding your own balance in life, where you chose to do with your life what you want to do? With this as a starting point, this documentary meets people who have found themselves outside the modern, and outside the traditional life, which others might find strange.

They Call Her Lady Fingers (The Betty Loo Taylor Story)
###BREAK###
From 3-1/2 year-old child prodigy to Hawaii's consensus "First Lady of Jazz." This is the story of Betty Loo Taylor, otherwise known as "Lady Fingers." Betty's unorthodox life and career wends from musical family darling to budding young concert pianist; from strip joint key-pounder to R&B "comper"; and from fledgling jam session "blower" to leader of her own esteemed trio gracing one of Honolulu's world-class hotels. According to those who know her best, she is tough, unique, a full orchestra, an icon, a rascal, a character... oh yes, a Chinese-American Jazz Musician.

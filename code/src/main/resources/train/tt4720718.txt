Atacada: la teoría del dolor
###BREAK###
ATTACKED tells the story of Andrea, a 33 year old woman, raped by her boss, Rodrigo Altamirano, owner of the company she works at and one of the most important business men in the country. Rodrigo tries to fix things offering Andrea money to remain silent, but she rejects his offer and goes to trial. The process becomes mediatic and brings in the public opinion. During the trial, Altamirano and his lawyer remain strategic: "there was no rape, but an extramarital relationship that lasted for months". With this posture, they appeal the family moral of the jury and the audience at the trial. Thereby, Andrea becomes an unscrupulous upstart who did not mind destroying a family. Andrea loses the trial, her best friend who betrayes her, her fiancé who breaks up with her because of the media pressure, her father who dies, and her dignity. Pregnant with Rodrigo Altamirano's baby, Andrea is left alone. The Cousins, a gang from her neighborhood, decide to take action without telling Andrea. The police arrets The Cousins and Andrea, although she wasn't guilty, and they go to jail. She gives birth to her son in prison and lives there with him, until the permitted age. Years later, she comes out of jail and gets out of the country, swearing to herself she will fight for her happiness.

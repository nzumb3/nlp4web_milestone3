When I Dance
###BREAK###
"When I Dance" is a feature-length documentary about the artistic research of four dancers from Israel, Spain, and Italy, and the approach they take to interpret with their bodies the stories of some refugees. The film will follow the process of the dancers during their research and aims to portray how a non-refugee can connect to the experiences of a refugee, and to reflect about ourselves in this relationship.

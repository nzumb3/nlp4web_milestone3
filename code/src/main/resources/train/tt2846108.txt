Voice of the Valley
###BREAK###
Voice of the Valley tells the story of two women from the impoverished, religious and tribal agricultural hub of Jordan, the Jordan Valley. With no formal training and despite the government's refusal to issue them a license, Asma and Munira produce and broadcast a groundbreaking socio-political radio program from Amman. Despite numerous threats and backlash from their community, the women expose social, political and environmental issues plaguing the Jordan Valley; issues which have never been addressed by governmental officials in Amman. The struggle of these people is a universal one; a battle that has been fought for centuries and continues to be fought by disenfranchised populations across the globe.

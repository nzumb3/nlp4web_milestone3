About 100 million baby girls are missing from this world (Report in the Lancet 2006, one of the most prestigious medical journals in the world)- they are dead, killed because of simply being girls. Their killing is simply due to blind faith in traditions that prefer baby boys to carry the family's name ahead, to be the heir to the family's fortune, to get nirvana after death. RIWAYAT is a hard hitting family drama touching the conscience of the global audience to raise awareness of this social evil. It is a musical love story against the backdrop of this inhuman practice, an emotional journey of three ladies, including Anita, the central protagonist, who face this evil in their life.

Little Magazine Voices
###BREAK###
Juxtaposing interviews, discussions, conversations and readings, 'Little Magazine Voices' creates a montage of content and viewpoint expressing the plural ethos that sustains little magazines in West Bengal. It observes a culture of intellectual creativity and curiosity allied to voluntary and collaborative work in a mode where commercial reward is not the goal. A 'life of the mind' flowing outside the banks of media and mainstream publishing. The focus is on little magazines as they are today - poetry, short stories, culture and religious investigation, society and politics, linguistics, environment, health and science - a live medley of the astonishing variety of the little magazine oeuvre. The narrative interweaves perspective and character, memory and aspiration to travel through an alternative space that is distanced yet rooted.

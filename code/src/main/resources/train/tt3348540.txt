The anthology film »Hardcore Comedy« consists of three comedic shorts which all deal with heavy matters such as drugs, prostitution, murder and corruption, each from a different writer-director. Its first tale "Shocking Wet Dreams" is a colorful and mad short from director Henri Wong, about a couple of nerds who start living in a decrepit brothel, and soon find themselves sucked into a world of corrupt cops, vigilantism and a seductive damsel in distress. "Run On Drugs" from director Chong Siu-wing focuses on an unfortunate loser who becomes a drug courier and starts to deliver magic mushrooms to strange people all over town. He finds an accomplice in a prostitute and together they travel from one sordid place to another, while they attempt to evade the police and handle their own drug-induced hallucinations. Andy Lo finishes off the film with his short "Can't Stop the Killing", a tale about a down-on-his-luck, womanizing chef, who is indebted to a ruthless bookmaker. He is forced to become a hitman but before he kills his intended target, he attempts to reconnect with his estranged father and the girl he loved in high school.

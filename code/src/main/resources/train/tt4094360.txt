California's San Joaquin County lost nearly 40,000 homes to foreclosure between 2007 and 2012. Thirty-four community members of the small city of Tracy, bedroom to Silicon Valley, narrate an intertwining story of personal and shared experience and provide glimpses into their nuanced versions of the American Dream. The unfolding story of 19-year-old Juan Sanchez, whose parents lost their home in Bakersfield only to lose a rental in Tracy, grounds the film. In addition to Rex, the foreclosure rescue dog, long abandoned homes become characters in this poetic documentary.

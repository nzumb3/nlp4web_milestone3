Big Muddy Moose
###BREAK###
Scott Mestrezat had wanted to do a long distance, human-powered trip for as long as he could remember. After years of following other people's journey's he decided to paddle the length of the Missouri River on a stand up paddleboard. There seemed no better way to travel than by water and no better river to navigate. The dream couldn't be ignored so in the spring of 2013 he quit his job in the financial district of Chicago, built a wooden paddleboard and headed west to Three Forks, Montana to set out on a journey of a lifetime. Big Muddy Moose will take you along with Scott for 45 minutes as he encounters incredible sights and welcoming people.

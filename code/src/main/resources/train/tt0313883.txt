Cherniyat pat na hristovite nevesti
###BREAK###
This is a cinematographic tale of days, nights and the years in a Convent. It is a documentary of the other point of view, the other life, the one we haven't chosen but we can see sinful and divine existence in this world reflected. It is an attempt to go deeper into human psychology and community laws, looking for a metaphoric resemblance to the model of our ailing society. This is a film about guilt and redemption, about the choices we make and the meaning of existence. This is a cinematographic essay on the philosophy of devotion and the healing power of faith.

Saturday
###BREAK###
On a Saturday morning, an advertising crew arrives at a decadent old building downtown SÃ£o Paulo to shoot a TV commercial. And then everything goes wrong, beginning with a broken elevator. The building itself, built in the 30's for the upper class, now has problems of every sort: broken elevators, deaths, thefts, and other weird events.

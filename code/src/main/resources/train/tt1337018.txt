Projecting the Body
###BREAK###
Projecting The Body is an intimate look at the life and work of Stephen Cummins, who blazed a trail through the tumultuous 1980s, examining desire, oppression and the politics of sexuality. Reacting against the environment of AIDS paranoia and ensuing homophobia, Stephen created films that are both bold in their politics and beautiful in their poetry.

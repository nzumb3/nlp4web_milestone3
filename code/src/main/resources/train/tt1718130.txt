Barnabus & Bella
###BREAK###
An original Latin-language musical comedy about high school life and love. Having just moved to a new town, geeky Barnabus faces his first day at a new high school, and it won't be one he'll soon forget. He meets a popular girl, Bella, befriends the wheelchair-bound Rinaldus, gets bullied by jock Jacobus, and botches his track tryout. How will he deal with his new challenges? This charming tale of love and laughter emphasizes the importance of self-esteem and self-confidence in the face of adversity.

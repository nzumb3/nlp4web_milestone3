This documentary tells the story of the arms-length relationship between the Jewish-Israeli rapper Subliminal and the Arab-Israeli rapper Tamer Nafar. Both are pioneers in Israeli rap music, but from opposite ends of the political spectrum. Subliminal presents a nationalistic Jewish message against Arab violence and terrorism, while Tamer's songs are about Palestinian oppression under the Israeli occupation and the hardships of Arab-Israeli life within Israel.

###BREAK###
Feature length documentary which challenges many of the popular myths about the 1798 Rebellion. "It reveals the central role of Presbyterians in the United Irishmen and the strong Catholic involvement in the crown forces who suppressed the Rebellion". The programme features dramatic re-enactments of some of the key skirmishes. "An exploration of the 1798 rebellion which relates the events of two hundred years before to the present day. The film strongly emphasises the links between political groups then which have now become distant and violently opposed to one another and attempts to debunk popular historical myths".

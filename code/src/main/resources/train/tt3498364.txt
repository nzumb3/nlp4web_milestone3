Girl on Girl: An Original Documentary
###BREAK###
Unlike any documentary film to date, Girl on Girl focuses its lens on the lives of feminine lesbians, and invites the audience to discover what life is like for women whose identity is incessantly trivialized and stigmatized, both outside of and within queer spaces. Girl on Girl challenges assumptions of what society imagines a lesbian to look like and, for the first time, addresses the issue of feminine lesbians feeling invisible even after coming out. The independently produced film features such 'celesbian' Lauren Bedford Russell (The Real L Word: Season 3), along with several other women from around the country, including New York, Florida, Utah, and North Carolina.

Beneath Everest: Nepal Reborn
###BREAK###
From deep in the Himalaya mountains where the Maoist soldiers greet the morning sun as they warm up, to the cities where a powerful movement for change explodes on the streets, people of Nepal have experienced moments they never thought possible. Filmed over four years during the height of the insurgency and the historic transition of Nepal from a 240-year old monarchy to a Republic nation, 'Beneath Everest' is a journey that exposes the grass root realities of Nepal's ten-year war. The film critically questions the use and continuation of violence and challenges its justifications. Directed by a native Nepali, the film encourages Nepalis silenced by fear to tell their stories, and challenges the to reflect on their fears, triumphs and hopes as Nepal begins the long journey towards peace.

I Am a Visitor in Your World

I AM A VISITOR IN YOUR WORLD features no interviews. The intention of the film is to be in contact with a a different kind of perception. We witness the main character's struggle with her disease first hand, raw. We follow her while she fights against a medical system, which penalizes the already penalized patients. We look at the love between her and her mother. In a way, the disease itself seems to play a secondary role. What we see is universal. It is a film about love.

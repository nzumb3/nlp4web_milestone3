A Confident Man
###BREAK###
When Steve loses his job, his money, and his apartment, he drunkenly turns to a life of crime. Determined to rob a bank, Steve discovers he's not the only bank robber in town and certainly not the most dangerous. But when they mistake him for one of their own, Steve might just pull off the robbery of the century; unless corrupt cops, a dangerous lunatic, the mob, and a renegade bank robber with a dark secret catch him first.

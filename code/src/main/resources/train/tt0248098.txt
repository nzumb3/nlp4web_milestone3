Never Stop Beginning - The UFA-Star Carola HÃ¶hn
###BREAK###
Between 1934 and the end of the war, Carola Hoehn appeared in over 30 films. In April, April and Zu neuen Ufern she starred in films directed by Douglas Sirk. Johannes Heesters was her partner in Der Bettelstudent, Willi Forst in Koenigswalzer, Hans Moser in Liebe streng verboten and Heinz Ruehmann in Hurra, ich bin Papa. Unlike the femme fatale Zarah Leander or the sing and dance queen Marika Roekk, Carola Hoehn specialised in playing modern, intelligent, open-minded young women. After 1945 she made appearances on stage in Berlin, Vienna, Munich, Bremen and Hannover. She was the German voice of stars like Katherine Hepburn, Irene Dunne, Maureen O'Hara and Danielle Darrieux. Theses dubbing assignments brought her from Berlin to Munich in 1950. In 1994 Carola Hoehn returned to the Berlin stage, playing the role of Mrs. Higgins in My Fair Lady at the Theater des Westens. "Don't ever begin to give up - don't ever give up beginning" is the motto of the ever-young and full-blooded actress. Robert Fischer has made this lively and passionate portrait, presenting numerous film clips, and newly shot footage of colleageus, friends and family, but above all - and in detail - Carola Hoehn herself.

The King of New Orleans
###BREAK###
Take a little trip through the streets of New Orleans.... Larry Shirt (David Jensen) is a taxi driver whose passengers are the city's hustlers, tourists, socialites, musicians, housekeepers, weirdos and reporters. Bobby Cohn (Richard Brien), Harvard student home from school and in the middle of a personal crisis, is one of those passengers. The circumstances that bring them together lead to a bond that is ultimately turned upside down by Hurricane Katrina, but instilled by the love of the city that they both call home.

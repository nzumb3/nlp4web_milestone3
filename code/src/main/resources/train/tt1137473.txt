Playing Doctor
###BREAK###
A modern-day coming-of-age sex comedy of mistaken identity, "Playing Doctor" introduces us to innocent high-school sophomore Heather, a future celebrity relationship author. She and her first boyfriend Bill are teenagers treading the dangerous waters of sexuality in the 21st Century. Innocence meets mid-life crisis in this farcical comedy that poses the question "Can virgins have quality sex without destroying their lives?" Heather discovers that being overly analytical, logical, and a product of a dysfunctional life has prepared her to successfully complicate her own relationships. However, on the flip side, her background and and nature have developed into a gift for helping others with spot-on advice.

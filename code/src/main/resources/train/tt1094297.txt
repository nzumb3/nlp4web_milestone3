Grapes on a Vine
###BREAK###
Kyle is the art director at the High Museum in Atlanta Georgia. He wants two things in life, a male child and a van Gogh painting valued at 275,000. His wife Brandy cannot conceive so he plans a camping trip where he will have her killed and hung to make it look like a racially motivated killing so he can collect the 500,00 insurance policy which will enable him to get what he wants. Of course, things don't go as planned.

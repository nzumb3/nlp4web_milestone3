6B: An Anthology of Hawaii Films
###BREAK###
6B is the anthology feature film of five Hawaii filmmakers. Each of the four stories revolve around rooms with the number 6B and the film examines the darker side of island life: a man struggling with drug addiction has a revelation about his identity; an ex-con must enter an underground poker game to reunite with his daughter; a young woman befriends her neighbor, a former hit man; and a local family deals with an impending tsunami. 6B features an all-Hawaii cast, crew, and production.

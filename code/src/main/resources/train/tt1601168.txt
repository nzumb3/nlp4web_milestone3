A Neighborhood Story
###BREAK###
This is a true story about an Italian neighborhood on the lower east side of Manhattan, situated between the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges. In fact, they had a baseball team called "The Two Bridges". It takes place between the years 1960 and 1990 when I was growing up in a Mafia neighborhood. It is the story of how these people lived their lives. How they brought their old world customs and traditions into the 20th century and lived in the shadow of their heritage. The people lived and died by the codes and unwritten rules laid down by the underworld that controlled their everyday lives. The good, bad and evil weaved everyone together in this environment and ruled their lives with an iron fist.

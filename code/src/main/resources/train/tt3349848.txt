Joachim Prinz: I Shall Not Be Silent
###BREAK###
Joachim Prinz: I Shall Not Be Silent uncovers the dramatic story of a courageous religious leader whose passion for justice compelled him to speak out against bigotry over the course of five decades. As a young rabbi in Berlin in the 1930s, Joachim Prinz preached openly against the Nazi Regime and saved many lives by encouraging Jews to leave Germany. Twenty years later, Prinz became a prominent leader of the civil rights movement in the US, culminating in his stirring speech at the 1963 March on Washington in which he proclaimed, 'America must not become a nation of onlookers! America must not remain silent.' Prinz also helped build the State of Israel and spoke out boldly for peace in the Middle East.

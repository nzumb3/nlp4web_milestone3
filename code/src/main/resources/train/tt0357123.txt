She refuses to take the university entrance exams is left behind in the country town selling fruit tarts. No one can figure out how come that whiz kid got left behind.

How does she manage to be so creative and optimistic, ready to do battle with the everyday injustices of life wherever the may appear? She appears to understand something that all the others ignore.

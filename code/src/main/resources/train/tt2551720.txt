Boxes of Death(1955) was especially significant as this was both Korean famous film director, Kim Ki-young's first film work and as is well known as the first case of synchronized sound in Korea. It was known as a lost film until it was found at NARA(National Archives and Records Administration in US) by chance in 2010. But unfortunately, the sound negative of Boxes of Death is missing so we are not able to hear the sound from it. Neither film script nor any other relevant documentation has been found up until now. At the moment, there are only pictures available so it is difficult comprehend the narrative of this film perfectly. Therefore, in 2011 four musicians prepared for the performance and played live music while Boxes of Death was screened. This documentary is about this moment that the images of 1955 met the sound of 2011.

###BREAK###
Documentary movie "ROCK"N"WAR (...or just because it's Friday)" is a story about phenomenon of rock music scene that emerged during the war in Bosnia, from 1992 until 1995. This movie tells the story about young people and their strength, will and determination to defy violence and complete madness that war brings in general just by playing music and organizing concealed rehearsals and concerts. While city of Tuzla was under heavy artillery fire and police curfew was starting at 16:00h (4 p.m.), musicians of Tuzla organize themselves and turn basements and shelters into core of new music scene. This scene was growing very fast, a lot of new bands form and music life is moving to bigger locations. Old and abandoned cinema called "Cinema Youth" becomes Club "Magic", gymnasium schoolyard becomes "Atrium rock scene" and every week rock concerts were organized. Hundreds of people attended those events despite fear and danger of artillery grenade bursts. But mostly this movie tells about cooperation, mutual support, teamwork, understanding and tolerance among people, regardless of political, national, religious background, values that seems like are kind of forgotten nowadays.

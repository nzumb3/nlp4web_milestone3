Royal Paintbox
###BREAK###
In a story previously untold on film, film-maker Margy Kinmonth invites HRH The Prince of Wales to make a journey through history to celebrate the artistic gene in his family and reveal an extraordinary treasure trove of work by royal hands past and present, many of whom were accomplished artists. Set against the spectacular landscapes of the Royal Estates and containing insights into works by members of The Royal Family down the centuries and The Prince of Wales's own watercolours, ROYAL PAINTBOX explores a colourful palette of intimate family memory and observation.

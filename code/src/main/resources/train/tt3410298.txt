As our relationship to Earth travels down a dangerous path, it has become clear that we cannot sustain the stress of our modern ways. On a quest to restore balance, Tribal Leaders from around the world gather in Greenland to witness the coming of a 20,000 year old prophecy. Surrounded by melting ice caps, Spiritual Leaders from the four corners of the Earth share the wisdom, prophecies and ceremonies of their ancestors. In an unprecedented gathering, they remember the wounds of the past and embrace the spirit that has endured. Together, they reveal a message that can give hope to the next seven generations. Walk with them and discover ancient knowledge along forgotten. Feel their connection to Mother Earth. Stand with these extraordinary "Bridgewalkers" around the Sacred Fire as they bridge the mind to the heart, the heart to the land, and the land to one human family!

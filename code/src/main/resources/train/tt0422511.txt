Jack, the Last Victim
###BREAK###
In a little Victorian theatre in the east end of London, the infamous story of the five victims of Jack the Ripper is being recreated in a rock musical. The film takes us away from the stage and out into the real murder locations. Entwined with the stage performance is an equally disturbing backstage drama. Jenni, (played by Gillian MacGregor) is a new actress, and she's late for the show. We've seen her in a car with two businessmen, Geoffrey (Roy Hudd) and Andrew; She is seen running away from the car by a concerned policeman. Back at the theatre, Trevor (played by Tom Wontner) is a young stagehand, shy and a bit of an "anorak", he takes life seriously. Jenni, whose innocent looks disguise a brittle, sarcastic manner, is rude to all other actors and dismissive of Trevor's fascination with Jack the Ripper. Jenni is alarmed by a strange looking lurker. No one else sees him, but Trevor is sympathetic. Back at the theatre, Jenni and Trevor find that they have more in common than they expect, but she continues to be alarmed by the appearances of the lurker, while on-stage we hear the gruesome details about each of the Ripper's victims. Jenni is to play the last victim, Mary Jane Kelly, but has become convinced that she is at risk. She turns to Trevor, the only person who seems to understand. But then Trevor finds out a secret about Jenni that tears them apart !

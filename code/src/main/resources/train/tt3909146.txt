Secret Breaths
###BREAK###
Yuriko Mizuno is a depressed young woman who has wandered to a remote island, far from her everyday life in Tokyo. She comes upon a house with a curious sign, 'Room Available. $5 per day.' Intrigued, she enters. Despite being wary of the cheapness of the room and the dubious manner of the owner Yuji, Yuriko decides to stay. Later that night, unable to sleep, Yuriko goes outside to get some fresh air. She notices music and light coming from the storeroom. Her curiosity gets the better of her, and she peeks inside. She finds Yuji alone, naked, and masturbating, as though he was having sex with someone. The next day she acts as though nothing has happened, and their strange co-existence begins.

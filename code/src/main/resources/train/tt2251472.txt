'Losing It' follows Andy Fodor's quest to lose weight in the the three months leading up to his wedding. He eats only fast food for one month, only meat for one month, and only gas station food for one month. The effects of these 'bad' diets, not only on his weight but also on his overall health, are examined. While following Andy on the diet, a humorous perspective is given on the obesity problem in America. Are unhealthy foods to blame for the increasing obesity problem in America? Is the obesity problem as severe as we are told? How can this problem be solved?

Puhi was chosen at age 12 by the great Tuhoe prophet Rua Kenana to marry his son, Whatu, and goes on to have an extraordinary life of hardship and wonder showing her fortitude through life and death struggles, walking between spirit and real world, as she bears and loses all of her thirteen children but one. "Rain of the Children" is a dramatic documentary in which filmmaker Vincent Ward attempts to unravel and recreate the life story of Puhi, who he met in 1978 when she was eighty years old.

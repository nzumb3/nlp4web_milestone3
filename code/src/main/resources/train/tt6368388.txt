We Are Sasquatch
###BREAK###
Sasquatches have been discovered and captured. Only thing is, they aren't beasts, they're just hairy people. Since their discovery and capture in the 1960's, Sasquatches have been assimilating into human society. In the year 1997, a TV documentary crew is dispatched to rural Massachusetts, where the Sasquatch population is the highest in the country. Following Clayton, Chet and Ian, three Sasquatch friends preparing to compete in their town's annual dance contest, the TV crew hopes to capture what it's like to be a Sasquatch in the modern world. Will a menacing human dance team, a grimy restaurant owner and a dorky newspaper intern lead to their downfall? Complete with Prism, the classic Sasquatch sport, and an original soundtrack by Squatch Out!.

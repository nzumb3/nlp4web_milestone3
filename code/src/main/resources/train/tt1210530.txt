###BREAK###
Fightfuckpray is the story of seven individuals whose lives intensely intersect at a party on New Year's Eve. Walker, Cass, and Ethan are everything male. It's Walker's first day out of jail and this inseparable, charged trio plans to celebrate in style - drinks, drugs and animal intensity. Rebecca returns home to find her husband David, dead and she deals with the loss in her own way. Ben is a hermit, but his cousin Ringo insists he must go to a New Year's Eve party, and come out of his shell. Meanwhile Kate, unhappily engaged, and yet feeling her biological clock tick, reaches a crisis in her life that maybe only someone like Ben would understand. As the characters meet through tragedy, comedy, and violence, bits and pieces of their personal drives and purposes are revealed. At the end of the night, they come out self-aware, bruised, exhausted, and with their lives changed forever.

Motel Nana
###BREAK###
Ivan teaches history in a Belgrade high school. In his class, Ivan is provoked by a student and ends up slapping him on the face. In Serbia, in the heat of transitional changes, Ivan's presence in school is no longer welcomed. He finds a temporary job opportunity in a war-scarred mountain village in Bosnia. On his way there, he meets Yasmina, a young Muslim woman, back from Germany to her homeland after the war and after being invited by an old friend - Hazim - who now runs a motel. A lone kiss in a stormy night, in a village still lying in ruins, will bring Yasmina and Ivan closer together in a joint escape from reality and to a ride on a dusty bus, where neither one of them wants to sit next to the window.

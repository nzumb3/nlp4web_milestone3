Mike Case in: The Big Kiss Off
###BREAK###
Mike Case is a low-rent private detective who works out of his car and advertises on Craigslist. When approached by the wealthy socialite Victoria Billows to find her missing husband, Mike is initially reluctant ("A missing husband? Never heard that one before") but is persuaded to take the case by Victoria's money and her not so subtle feminine charms.

All the World in a Design School
###BREAK###
Eclectic students and faculty from all over the planet meet at one of the the world's top industrial design school in Scandinavia's faraway north just below the Arctic Circle. This documentary explores everyday life, unique study methods and dynamic design processes at Ume√• Institute of Design during the school's 25th anniversary when traditionally welcoming and generous Sweden, with its export-driven economy, imposes steep tuition fees for non-Europeans, the very students that have been instrumental in making the school what it is today.

Hurt

HURT is a docu-drama like no other. 250 young Australians from rural areas and small towns, have been given the opportunity to tell their own stories, with their images, in their own words. Challenging, haunting and ultimately uplifting, HURT recounts episodes in the lives of these young people whose faces have been marked with the lines of experiences beyond their years. Cruelty, beauty and isolation seen through young eyes. The cast and crew included 15 car thieves, 23 homeless young people and 9 young people with mental illness. There were 200 camera operators, 98 sound recordists and 85 performers. HURT includes 50 portraits, 8 stories, 11 image based scenes, 3 songs, 2 docu- drama scenes, 2 comedy scenes and 1 connecting narrative. An outsider film.

Desert Rain
###BREAK###
Dan and Skye want to leave their small desert town and chase their dreams in Los Angeles, but they're broke, living in seedy motels, and driving a stolen car. Dan, a musician, is owed an undisclosed amount of cash by Lefty, a local music producer who sold him an empty dream and skipped out. Moving through the dust and desperation of this southwest inferno, Dan and Skye hunt for Lefty, sweeping through a unique cast of characters along the trail, and making drastic decisions that only take them further from their goal - heading to L.A. and leaving this place behind. Desert Rain can be likened to a modern day Bonnie and Clyde.

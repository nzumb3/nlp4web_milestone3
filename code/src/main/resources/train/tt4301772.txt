The Crooked Tune, an Old Time Fiddler in a Modern World
###BREAK###
Dave Bing has the audacity to call himself a fiddler. Not only does Bing make a living as a fiddler, a once romanticized profession but he has emerged as one of the keepers of a much misunderstood and overlooked brand of American Music, known as Old Time. The Crooked Tune, follows Fiddler Dave Bing as he takes us through his personal connection to the fading historic ways of the tradition's past into a thriving under-the-radar scene of today. As keeper of the tradition of West Virginia Old Time, Dave Bing not only has to make a living, but must keep it vibrant for himself or else the music dies from within.

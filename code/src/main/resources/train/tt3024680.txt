Goodbye Mr. President
###BREAK###
The life of five citizens during the day of political elections in Italy. Massimo Aquila, university teacher, wants to become the new Dean of Faculty, so he asks Sergio Guidi, the centre-left candidate, for a little 'help'. In the meantime, a student, Rebecca Pera, tries to corrupt her teacher for passing the last exam, and an idle guy, Andrea, passes all his days playing slots. They will meet all together the day after in the polling station.

Cosmos
###BREAK###
Cosmos is about an ambitious engineer who builds a time machine; but must choose between saving the world or the girl of his dreams, as power consumes him. He is faced with the question of "How far would you go for that which you love?" in an ambitious tale of love, power, fate and good old-fashioned science fiction adventure.

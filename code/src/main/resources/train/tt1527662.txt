Mar de Dentro
###BREAK###
Old fishermen appeal to their affective memory to tell their stories of adventure and love. In a setting where time seems to have stopped to listen to them, they recall the time they lived in and on the sea. Accompanying their daily lives, the testimonials of the characters mingle together in the course of the film to become one speech. As if the stories were able to create a unique memory line, so strong and present as the sea itself in the lives of each one of them.

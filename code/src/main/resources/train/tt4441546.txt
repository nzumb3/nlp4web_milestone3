Mask of Love on Yukio Mishima
###BREAK###
Yukio Mishima text is being used to render the reality, to get rid of the fiction- not only from Mishima's writings and life but also Malga's world. Japanese imagery is a cocoon for semi- documentary, dark fairy-tale-like voyeuristic shots and all that in raw trash punk aesthetics. She makes Mishima's fantasies as true as her intimate confessions on love and suicide. Despite the title there is not much love, and if there is- it's all contaminated with death.

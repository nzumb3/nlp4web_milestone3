The Fading Light
###BREAK###
As their Mother slips into the last stage of a fatal illness, her three children gather under the same roof in Dublin for the first time in a long while. Cathy, back from London where she's trying to be an actress; Yvonne, living the good life as the wife of a yuppie businessman; and Peter, who has most to lose by their Mother's death, being the victim of mental disabilities and unable to look after himself. Their days and hours together, and their Mother's passing away, will first draw them closer to each other than ever before, then force them to face truths about their Father's death long ago and the secrets that were buried with him - until finally hurling them apart again, each into their individual loneliness.

Where is Bent Richard?
###BREAK###
Members of Seattle Band Bent Richard have been missing for 13 days. The FBI announced video evidence has been found in the personal belongings of a man who resides in a Mental Rehabilitation Home that is located on a remote privately owned island near the San Juan's. Does this video show a crime has been committed or is the band playing an elaborate hoax for publicity, to promote the release of their new album?

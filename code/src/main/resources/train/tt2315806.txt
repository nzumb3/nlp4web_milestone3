American Courtesans is a feature documentary that takes you into the lives of American sex workers. These women discuss with you candidly what brought them to the doors of the sex trade, what they found when they got there, and why they stayed. Follow eleven sex workers through the streets, massage parlors, brothels, and strip clubs to the high rises in New York and the bell captains in Las Vegas. This is a story, a different kind of American story that will leave you speechless.

Pursuit of Happiness
###BREAK###
After 20 years, a Dutchman and ex-refugee, returns to his original escape route, Istanbul and Athens. Along the way, he visits the neighborhoods where refugees and illegals live, hoping to make contact. During his journey he speaks with a number of refugees, NGO's and locals. He shares what he hopes to accomplish. 'In my search I'm mainly interested in the stories of the people themselves, and what drives these individuals to make such a trip. They remain in transit countries Turkey and Greece, and they all have different reasons for their pursuit of happiness. People seek a happier life instead of economic gain. Is it the infamous American Dream they are chasing? Or is it the safety and security they seek?'

Emma Jones, is an up and coming actress in Hollywood, who catches the eye of celebrated film producer, Roger Hardiman. He is making a movie about his Silent Screen Legend mother, Helena Hardiman. Emma is a dead ringer for Helena. Helena was a terrible, awful woman. Roger loved and hated her. Because he loved her, he is making this movie, because he hated her, he is dressing women up in Helena's Oscar gown and killing them. He has to have Emma---one way or the other. It might not be as easy as he thinks.

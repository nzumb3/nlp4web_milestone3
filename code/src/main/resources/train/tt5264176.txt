Concerto: A Beethoven Journey
###BREAK###
Filmed over four years, Concerto - A Beethoven Journey follows world-class pianist Leif Ove Andsnes as he attempts to understand and interpret one of the greatest sets of works for piano ever written: Beethoven's five piano concertos. Considered one of the top pianists of his age, Leif Ove Andsnes offers rare insights into the mind of a leading pianist and access to his personal and professional life. Against the background of Leif Ove playing these pieces, the film peels back the many myths of Beethoven's life. Perhaps above all it is the fresh new biography of Beethoven that is most revealing.

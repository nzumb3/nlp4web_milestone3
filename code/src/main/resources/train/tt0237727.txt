In order to achieve his vengenace, he travels to the United Kingdom, befriends the local Indians, as well as Irish Freedom Fighter, Irene Rose Palmer (Charleen Carswell). He finally kills Dwyer during a presentation. He is quickly apprehended, and jailed. He refuses to cooperate with the authorities, nor is he willing to accept that he is mentally incapable. His trial is a mockery and travesty of justice. He is ordered to be hung, and the press are forbidden to publish the trial proceedings.

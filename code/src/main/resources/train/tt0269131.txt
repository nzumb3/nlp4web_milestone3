Dari Jemapoh ke Manchestee
###BREAK###
Two village youths decide to travel from their boring hometown of Jemapoh, Malaysia to England. One wants to see his favourite soccer team Manchester United while the other wants to meet his long-lost father. They drive a stolen red Volvo and hope that Manchester will pop up on the road map soon. Along the way they also pick up a girl who is being sexually harassed, and a rock musician whose concert was disrupted by thugs in batik shirts. By the end you're not sure if they will actually reach Manchester, but they've found some firm friends.

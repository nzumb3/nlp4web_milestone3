Dinastia Vivanco: Devolver al vino lo que el vino nos a dado
###BREAK###
Pedro Vivanco started off delivering his family's wine door-to-door on a bicycle, and rose to become the major provider of wine to Rioja wineries and an essential, although anonymous, figure in its transformation. When others were destroying their old machinery to make way for the new, he (and later his sons) started collecting them and other pieces over a period of forty years in order to set up what is perhaps the world's best wine museum, as part of his philosophy of 'giving back to wine what wine has given us.' The documentary uses interviews with Pedro, family members and others to chart a unique and fascinating narrative of the 100 year, four generation history of the winery that parallels the evolution of Spanish wine.

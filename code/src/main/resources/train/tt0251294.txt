Nikita Blues
###BREAK###
Nikita is 17, a senior at Los Angeles High, set on getting her English teacher, Mr. Jackson, to fall in love with her. Her best friend Tangy tells her to get real, but Nikita believes it's just a matter of telling him she loves him and giving him a kiss or two, even though he's engaged to the school's assistant principal Miss Fox: no man can resist for long, Nikita figures. She's also stealing clothes from the store where she works and selling them to students at a big discount. Add to the mix two thieves who hijack trucks and hang out near the school to molest co-eds. Nikita seems to be on a collision course with life.

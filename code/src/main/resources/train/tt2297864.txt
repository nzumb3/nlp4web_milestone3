The REAL Shahs of Beverly Hills
###BREAK###
The REAL Shahs of Beverly Hills is documentary spotlighting the influences of Iranian Americans on our society. Persians account for half of 1% of America's population. Yet, this miniscule minority is responsible for the birth companies on the NASDAQ. They make up 40% of the population of Beverly Hills. Yet the only depictions of this over achieving minority that the media portrays is reality show ,The Shahs of Sunset and offensive stereotypical depictions of wife beaters and terrorists. Society needs to be made aware that Iranian Americans are responsible for companies such as eBay, Qualcomm, YouTube and Expedia, just to name a handful. This is an important game changing film not only because it will change the world's perception of Iranians but it will inspire people from all walks of life to shoot for the stars and push the limits of their potential. My goals in making this documentary are not only to honor this miraculous minority for their exemplary achievements but also to bring them into a proper light in the eyes of the world.

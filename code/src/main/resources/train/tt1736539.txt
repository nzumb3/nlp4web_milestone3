Through the eyes of the witnesses of the tragedy, the Russian speaking immigrants living in New York, we follow the story of 911.... They brought their families to the US from the former USSR; they were seeking for Heaven on Earth, convinced that the greatest country in the world will protect them. They gave their children to this country; that was the most valuable thing they had.. The film consists of the interviews with the family members of those who never came back from the Twin Towers on that tragic day. They were barely 30 years old. Elena Belilovskaya, Gennadiy Boyarskiy, Alex Lygin... 68 Russian-Americans perished on that terrible morning. This film is dedicated to all the victims of terrorism.

Beyond the Mirror
###BREAK###
The documentary Beyond the Mirror connects voices of resistance in the black Diaspora through a dialogue between two important activists and intellectuals in Brazil and the United States - Edson Cardoso and Haile Gerima. Gerima, an acclaimed Ethiopian filmmaker who moved to the U.S. in the 1960s, helped formulate an independent aesthetic for black cinema. Among his most important films are Sankofa, Bush Mama and Teza. Cardoso has dedicated his life as a journalist and activist to confronting racism in Brazil. He was the editor-in-chief of Irohin, one of the only newspapers to address racism from a politically independent standpoint. Weaving between the life histories and political commentaries of Gerima and Cardoso, the film explores racism and common strategies of resistance in black communities.

The Accidental Photographer-Henry Diltz
###BREAK###
Diltz is as much at home as a musician on tour, as he is a visual historian of the last four decades of popular music. The rapport he's developed with his musician friends, along with his down-to-earth-grin and frequent laugh, enables him to capture the candid shots that convey a rare feeling of trust and intimacy with his subjects. For Diltz, the pictures began with a $20 second-hand Japanese camera purchased on tour with the Modern Folk Quartet. When MFQ disbanded, he embarked on his photographic career with an album cover for The Lovin' Spoonful. Despite his lack of formal training, Diltz easily submerged himself in the world of music: the road, the gigs, the humor, the social consciousness, the psychedelia, the up and down times. For 50 years, his work has graced hundreds of album covers and has been featured in books, magazines, and newspapers. His unique artistic style has produced powerful photographic essays of Woodstock, The Monterey Pop Festival, The Doors, Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young, Jimi Hendrix and scores of other legendary artists. In this documentary we will meet many of these famous stars and hear them talking about their friend Henry Diltz and his "fly-on-the-wall" photography style. Diltz tells his fascinating life story and takes us back to those magical moments where these famous photos and album covers were taken.

A woman survives a clinical death in 1988 and wakes up hearing voices in her head. A spirit has started to speak through her. People identify her as a medium. The entity proclaims a mission to save the world before the year 2012. Part of that mission is to dig up the mummy of the builder of the Great Pyramid in Egypt... There is another way to tell the story. A man, excited by his spiritual awakening - following a shamanic ceremony in Colombia - decides to portray a mysterious story involving a certain group in Poland. But doubt and belief are the very issues at play, feedback being the real name of the game that he has become involved in.

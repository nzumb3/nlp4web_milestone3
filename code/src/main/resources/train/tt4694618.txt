Annie
###BREAK###
Following daily routines of a mid-Michigan family, everything appears to be normal on the surface; Spring brings cleaning, Summer is filled with campfires and friends, Fall kicks into gear with family-time at the cider mill and the Winter features family gatherings to share holiday stories. Todd and Evelyn work hard to keep their family happy. They have three children; two boys and a little girl, named Annie. From pajama parties to a Girl Scouts' gathering. From assorted dolls to brightly colored dresses. Annie is your typical preteen princess. The only difference to this story is... Annie was born a boy.

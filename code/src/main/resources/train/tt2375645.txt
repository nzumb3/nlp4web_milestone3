The Man Near Skitter Creek
###BREAK###
'Controlled by the hands of extraterrestrial life, Rag Face must find a way to tear from the bondage of being a face replicated victim: a plan that the Aliens have been fulfilling since the origin of human existence. Their goal; suppressing organic humans from individual thought...which will be completed through Rag Face's help...unless he prevails...' Mike Waterfield; a civilian from the small town of Forkrun has been abducted and brought back to Earth...the only thing different about him is his face; it's missing. During the origin of our species, extraterrestrial life launched a plan to take the faces of their victims for randomization and replication to upload fake versions of humans called 'Surfacers' to planet Earth gaining control amongst the organic evolving human race. The victims are to be condemned to quietude for 6 months as their faces are meshed with other victims faces for a continuous flow of fresh-faced 'Surfacers'. A black cube is given to each victim holding a copy of their own face for a sign of proof that after 6 months, their faces will be reattached if they follow their intergalactic orders...and keep the cube safe from society. Mike Waterfield; known as 'Ragface'' to society's curiosity, must overcome the loss of countenance and weight of loneliness the only way he can; by rebelling against the Aliens and doing what he can to reach out to the distorted perceptions of the ones that provoke him...but 'Ragface' slowly begins to realize that there is no way out...

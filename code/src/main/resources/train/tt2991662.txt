Bringing It Home
###BREAK###
Hemp - it's not just for hippies anymore. Today they're making everything from salad dressings to buildings with it. Despite the inevitable jokes when hemp is mentioned, industrial hemp is actually a non-psychoactive plant, grown in 31 other countries, but prohibited in the United States. 'Bringing It Home' explores the question of why a crop with so many widespread benefits cannot be grown in America through animation, archival images and interviews with hemp business leaders and entrepreneurs in England, Spain, Washington, D.C., California and North Carolina. The documentary weaves a touching narrative extolling the many benefits of industrial hemp for the environment and human health, while illuminating the obstacles to what could be a thriving industry for U.S. farmers to tap into.

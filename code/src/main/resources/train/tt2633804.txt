The Anarchist's Birthday
###BREAK###
An angry farmer finds a witch camping on his land, so he gets the law involved. Enter the government-trained vicar for this very purpose. Unfortunately, this is his first operation, and his skills are lacking...! He's employed two men on community service: the titular anarchist and a cocky delinquent, but no volunteers turn up, with the exception of an all-too-useless townie girl. The motley bunch leave Bristol on foot in search of the witch's blood. In the fields they must prepare, but nothing goes to plan... Finally they charge.

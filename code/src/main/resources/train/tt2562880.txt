Demon on Wheels
###BREAK###
DEMON ON WHEELS is the story of an old hot-rodder, his woman and the car that comes between them - a 1968 Mustang fastback that against all odds he plans to restore and race as a tribute to to the the legendary auto innovator and driver Carroll Shelby. CAN LOVE OUTRUN A FAST CAR? A former speed demon and rumrunner, now an aging mechanic in a sleepy Catskill Mountains town, risks it all - his health, his security, even the love of his life - when he vows to restore and race the prized car of his wild youth, a 1968 Ford Mustang that's been hidden away for 35 years. Now a self-described "old man in an old car," Mike Ondish wants to chase racing glory one last time, hoping to rekindle the spark in his relationship, and rediscover the thrill of a fast car and the wide-open road. But will his quest to restore the car, bolt by bolt, as a tribute to Carroll Shelby (the racing legend who gave the Mustang its muscle) restore him? Is he destined to be reborn to be wild? Or will a love triangle between Mike, his girlfriend Martha and the Demon lead him to crash and burn? This film - shot on location in the beautiful Catskill Mountains, and on race tracks and drag strips in Oklahoma and upstate New York - was seven years in the making. The bolt by bolt restoration and those moments of gear head wizardry and hot rodder ingenuity, are faithfully expressed. The wild nights of our hero in his younger days - racing around the reservoir, outrunning the cops with a trunk full of moonshine, cruising the center of town on Friday nights -are vividly remembered and recreated. Interviews with the legendary CARROLL SHELBY and Ford's chief Mustang enthusiast JOHN CLOR capture the history and legacy of the Mustang. But most of all, this film is a love story: what happens when your partner ventures off in pursuit of a seemingly impossible dream? What happens when a car becomes the other woman?

Cocaine Unwrapped
###BREAK###
Moving from country to country in South America, reporting from across the drugs frontline and interviewing top-level international politicians this film exposes the human cost of one of the most popular drugs on the London streets. Combining reportage from the drugs front line and interviews with those top-level international politicians who are campaigning to get us in the West to take real responsibility for our drugs problem, Cocaine Unwrapped presents prohibition in a wholly new light.

When faced with a lengthy prison sentence, Russ Mahler, a career criminal armed with a destructive secret, blackmails the only man that can get him off the hook, Manhattan District Attorney Graham Seifert. An ambitious politician on the rise, Graham's life is upended when Senator Monty Clemens asks him to join his ticket in a campaign to become the next Governor of New York. Clemens, an un-apologetically corrupt politican, is currently being investigated by the D.A.'s office for a multi-million dollar embezzling scheme so Graham must choose...either finish an investigation that could have the Senator impeached...or ride his coattails and become the youngest Lieutenant Governor in New York State history.

Rolly Hole
###BREAK###
Rolly Hole, a short film that documents marble shooters in Kentucky's Monroe County, was shot on location in November 2006. This brief yet intense study of the folk game that provides the film with its title calls attention to the physical gestures, poses, and movements of players whose casual approach belies the carefully measured techniques deployed by champion players. Complimenting these images, the film's audio tracks convey the lyrical and rhythmic patter of the players' continual commentary on the progress of the game; this commentary also reveals the dimensions of their friendship and camaraderie. As one of the few folk games played by adults, this ritual competition provides members of the Monroe County Marble Club Super Dome with daily leisure between shifts at the local mills and factories. In most American cities and towns such gathering takes place at local bars, but in dry Monroe County, rolly hole provides the men of the community with an important social catalyst.

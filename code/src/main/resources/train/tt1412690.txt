He has a girlfriend, Gloria, who has stuck with him for two years. Greg has many close friends and a steady job selling shoes. It's not the best, but it puts money in his pocket. An interest in theater and music brings Greg to a play where he meets Vanessa, an artistically-minded waitress. Vanessa is increasingly dissatisfied with her boyfriend's priorities, and she's wondering whether to break up with him. Kevin, a street musician dropout, has had a crush on Stacy for a long time. Kevin visits Stacy at the restaurant where she and Vanessa work. After getting into a fight with Stacy, Kevin bumps into Vanessa. The two go to a nearby coffee shop where they run into Greg. Greg invites them to play pool at his friend Mark's house. Gloria meets everyone at Mark's during the middle of a game. The group decides to go to a truck stop for a late-night meal.

Linda and Ben's paths cross one evening and he recognises her as his boss's daughter - but she doesn't know who Ben is. There is an instant connection between them and in an attempt to hide his identity, he tell her that he is in a band. This innocent lie threatens to expose Ben when it turns out that they like each other more than anticipated. As a result, he decides if he's going to be good enough for Linda, he needs to live up his lie. He makes up his mind to pursue a dream he neglected years ago and starts a band with two of his co-workers. They enter a battle-of-the-bands competition, but soon to realise that a music career is rather daunting. And what will happen when Ben's real identity is revealed to Linda?

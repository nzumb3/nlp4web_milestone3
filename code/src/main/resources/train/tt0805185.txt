Blood Trails
###BREAK###
Anne is an avid bicycle enthusiast. She has a one night stand with a fellow biker, Chris, who is also apparently a cop. He gets rough with her and the memory haunts her. Three days later her boyfriend, Micheal, and her go into the Whistler range of mountains for a biking trip. Chris shows up, stalking and frightening them as they make their way further into the dangerous mountain range. Micheal is killed and Anne spends her time trying to survive, while witnessing the demise of several other innocent "bystanders" in the process.

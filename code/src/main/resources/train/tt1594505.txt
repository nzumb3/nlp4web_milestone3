L.A., I Hate You
###BREAK###
Inspired by true events, L.A., I HATE YOU intertwines three tales of sex, violence, redemption, murder and unthinkable twists all taking place in the City of Angels; Los Angeles. When a desperate husband suddenly regrets the hit he has ordered on his handicapped wife, he frantically attempts to stop the murder. However, this sets in a motion a series of events far greater than he can control for the lives of some seemingly unconnected people, including an action star wannabe, a frustrated family man, and a guilt-ridden boyfriend. Starring Malcolm McDowell (A Clockwork Orange, Halloween), William Forsythe (The Devil's Rejects) and Dedee Pfeiffer (Vamp), L.A., I HATE YOU will lead you on a wild and steamy ride through the seedy and visceral streets of LA, where broken dreams are the daily reality...

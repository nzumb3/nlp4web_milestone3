For the End of Time
###BREAK###
For the End of Time is about the mind, about the body and the inability to merge these two entities. Two entities which shape a form of civilization known under the name of 'human'. A human is not a being unto itself, a human is a part of a civilization - related code of a certain precise time and place. A human is not a uniform creature. A human is a split between many things, but the worst is the split carried inside, that between the mind and the body. For the End of Time is a film on a quest, on the eternal longing to find the real thing.

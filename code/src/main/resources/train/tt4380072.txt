Itecho: The Butterflies of Winter or the Road to Sexuality
###BREAK###
This documentary captures over ten people who have various sexual identities in Japan. They are like a mirror reflecting you. They are sometimes called Hentai or perverts. But they live normally like you do, thy also think they are normal people. They struggle with life and have difficulties like you. They live in the same world, breathe the same air. If we want to look for a difference, it might be that they don't compare or avoid people who are not like them. They accept everyone.

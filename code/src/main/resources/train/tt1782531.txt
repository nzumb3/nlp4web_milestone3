Songs Along a Stony Road
###BREAK###
SONGS ALONG A STONY ROAD follows musicologist Zoltan Kallos on his visits to musicians in villages around Transylvania and Romanian Moldavia. In each village Kallos is a welcome distraction from the backbreaking manual labor of farming, and he easily coaxes the citizens to break out a bottle of homemade brandy and sing an old song, or dust off the violin and play. He has collected music in these places for half a century.

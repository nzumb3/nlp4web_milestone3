Fading
###BREAK###
With this film I wanted to engage people on some very dark levels. It was my goal to strip away your comfort zone in hopes to keep your emotions raw concerning the themes and topics of this film. This film was a very personal journey into my own soul in search of finding reasons for the how's and why's. After finishing this film I have realized that I'm no closer towards understanding. But perhaps this film was never supposed to supply answers than it was to keep our emotions raw. It is a very difficult film to watch. It was a very difficult film to make. But whether you agree or disagree with the film one thing remains true - atrocities like this happen constantly. And if we become numb to our atrocities we are truly lost.

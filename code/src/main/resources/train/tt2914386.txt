You'll Be a Man
###BREAK###
A fantastic story of a bond between Leo, a ten-year-old overachiever that lacks emotional connection, and Theo, a twenty-year-old underachiever who is sorta just floundering through life. This movie is truly a hidden gem. It may be on Netflix, under the title "You'll Be a Man" . The French cast is phenomenal, especially the young boy who plays the lead. Has soft funny moments. Highly recommended.

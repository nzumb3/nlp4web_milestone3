Focal Point
###BREAK###
An Artist is stopped from jumping off a rooftop by a wanderer who convinces him to postpone his death just long enough to witness a nearby nest of baby birds hatching from their eggs. The experience moves the Artist into spending the day talking about life and art with the wanderer, who turns out to be a young psychologist who hates his job and other people - but is inclined to embrace the little artistic miracles in nature. The Artist and the Psychologist learn that they may be more suited if they switched professions and found new areas of focus in their lives.

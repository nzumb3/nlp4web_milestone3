Survivor Stories
###BREAK###
Most everyone knows that Hitler was a liar-and his lies about the Jewish people cost six million lives. Those who survived the horrors of the Holocaust have compelling stories that must be heard to counter current lies about what did or did not happen. We have the true stories of survivors whose inspiring experiences challenge yet another lie: that the Holocaust was perpetrated because of Christianity. The Nazi shadow has darkened the Jewish view of Jesus for too long. Now you can hear/read the stories of Jewish men and women who survived the Holocaust and found amazing hope and healing in Jesus.

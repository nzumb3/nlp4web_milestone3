The Mill
###BREAK###
In Landis, the college friends Shawn, Amber, Whitney, Jesse, Madison and Kyle organize a party in the Steen's Textile Mill that has been bankrupted and closed a couple of months ago and is abandoned. They invite the son of the owner, the silly Nick, only to have access to the facility, and the geek Cari to be his date. They go to a convenience store to buy some packs of beer and they humiliate the gentle attendant. Once in the spot, they separate to different places with the intention of having sex. However, their night party becomes a tragic nightmare.

Bali: Hope in Paradise
###BREAK###
This is the powerful story of a young woman, Sri Kebon, who devoted all her time and efforts to helping the Balinese who were affected by the Bali bombing of October 2002, widows and children of the victims. Her tireless efforts have made a real difference to some who had little hope at all. Also documented is her rescue and fostering of two young children who lost their mother in the blast, and her ultimately triumphant struggle against political bureacracy to have them reunited with their father.

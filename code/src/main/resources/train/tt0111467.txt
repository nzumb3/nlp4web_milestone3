Dead Can Dance: Toward the Within
###BREAK###
After an excerpt from 'Baraka (1992)', featuring the music of Dead Can Dance, we see them in concert in Santa Monica CA, alternated with interview sequences with the lead members (Lisa Gerrard and Brendan Perry) where they discuss their influences (Asian/Mid-Eastern music and Irish ballads), their instrumentation (Chinese dulcimer, various percussion, synthesizers), and their different approaches to lyrics (he sings words, she doesn't).

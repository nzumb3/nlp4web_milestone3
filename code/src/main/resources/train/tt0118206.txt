You Don't Know Dick: Courageous Hearts of Transsexual Men
###BREAK###
Lyle, Max, Michael, Steven, Ted, and James: a photographer who lifts weights, a cop, a mechanic, writers, an artist; one is gay, at least three are in serious relationships with women; one was in the seminary; one has three children from a previous marriage. All six were born female, and all are female-to-male ("FTM") transsexuals. They talk about childhood, deciding to make the change, telling parents and friends and co-workers, testosterone therapy, surgeries, organs, embracing their histories, and how their lives are now. Friends, a parent, lovers, and two children also talk. All six men express joy at their new-found and more complete identities.

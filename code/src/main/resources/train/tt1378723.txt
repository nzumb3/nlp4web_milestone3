Honored at eight international film festivals as either an invited film or the Best Documentary winner (Riverside International Film Festival, International Film Festival South Africa, International Christian Film Festival, Gideon Media Arts Conference and Film Festival, National Outreach Convention Film Festival, San Diego Christian Film Festival, Transforming Stories International Film Festival and the Redemptive Film Festival). You've never seen a spiritual memoir like this. Like many who came of age in the 1960s, Greg Laurie was on a search for the meaning of life. Born out of wedlock to an alcoholic mother who married seven times, Greg started drinking, partying, and taking drugs to escape the dysfunction of his family. But his life was suddenly changed when he encountered a group of young Christians on his high school campus in Newport Beach, California. Greg has since authored more than 35 books, started what became one of the first mega-churches in the United States (Harvest Christian Fellowship in Riverside, California) as well as a far-reaching ministry (Harvest Crusades) that today touches many who are searching for meaning, just as he once was. In this film, Greg opens a window on his life and shares about his uncertainty and disappointments, his healing and growth. Some notable reviews of the film: Max Lucado, Author, 'I love Greg LaurieÂ¹s story so much. His own personal story is a stunning reminder of why our savior came.' Franklin Graham, Evangelist, President, Samaritan's Purse, 'Lost Boy will touch your heart in a profound way.'

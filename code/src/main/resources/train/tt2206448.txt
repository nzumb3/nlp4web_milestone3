Wheels of Fortune
###BREAK###
'Wheels of Fortune' takes an in-depth look at the problems associated with disability access lawsuits. The Americans With Disabilities act is an important and groundbreaking piece of U.S. legislation that has improved the lives of many Americans living with disabilities. However, the vague and unregulated nature of the law has lead to a number of complications for businesses, for the legal system, and for the disabled community. Today there is still widespread inaccessibility, and a recent epidemic of serial litigants and opportunistic lawyers with questionable means and motives have exploited the law for personal profit, with often devastating effects. 'Wheels of Fortune' explores this complex issue from all angles though a series of interviews with business owners, lawyers, judges, politicians, and persons with disabilities.

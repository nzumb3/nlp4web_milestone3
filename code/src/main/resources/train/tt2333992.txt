Rancho No Tengo
###BREAK###
Poodie Rodriguez (Joe King Carrasco), a struggling drug dealer living out in west Texas works hard to stay out of jail, but also works hard to keep his girlfriend, Tiffany (Kari Sites), satisfied. But, Tiffany is a material girl who never has her fill of hot tubs, cell phones and her dream 'double wide mobile home'. With the world crumbling around him, Poodie is put between a rock and a hard place thus setting the stage for a comic 'Sampson and Delilah' situation of biblical proportions in trailer trash heaven. Features songs such as 'Chasin Simpatico' and 'Because a Woman', written by Joe King Carrasco.

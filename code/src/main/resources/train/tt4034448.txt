Neverside
###BREAK###
Nevercyde is an original screenplay written by Josiah David Warren. As a music bard himself, he writes the tale of a young, rock band scraping along doing whatever gigs they can find in local clubs. Between pickup girls and bar scene temptations of drugs and alcohol, these aspiring rock musicians find themselves at odds with each other and facing down an ugly drug dealer. What results in tragedy brings about maturity, sobering reality and a message for every youth.

Blue Eyes: Brown Eyes
###BREAK###
Is love between siblings a myth? "Blue Eyes, Brown Eyes" is a quest to understand the relationship between brothers and sisters, and the impact they have over their lives. What traces of Darwinism can we find in the human family? The starting point of this film is the personal story of filmmaker Ilana Tsur, which began with a photo album and a video tape that her mother left her before she died. A closer examination of seemingly innocent childhood photos reveals things that had been unknown to her and to other participants in this film, who joined the documentary journey. A fresh look at the images raises new interpretations and perspectives concerning the most significant choices and decisions we make in our lives.

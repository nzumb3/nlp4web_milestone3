The Children Send Their Regards
###BREAK###
Pupils, wards, acolytes and foster children: all were sexually abused by members of the clergy. Visiting the scenes of past abuse, accounts emerge of a despicable abuse of power. Coming to terms with these events, and discovering obstructions to holding those responsible to account, the painful legacy of their stories persists to the present day. A hugely creative film, which achieves a rare immersion into the tortured worlds of its characters.

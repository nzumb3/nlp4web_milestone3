Pictures from a Hiroshima Schoolyard
###BREAK###
Pictures From a Hiroshima Schoolyard is a documentary focused around a set of old Japanese children's drawings found in the closet of a member of All Souls Church in Washington, DC in 1995. Current parishioners unearth the dramatic story behind the drawings and discover that they were drawn in 1947 by students of a school less than a half-mile from where the first atomic bomb in history was detonated. The children who made them (now in their late 70s) reflect on their early lives amidst the rubble of their decimated city and the hope they shared through their art. The pictures are restored and taken back to Japan where the are reunited with the artists and exhibited in the very building where they were created.

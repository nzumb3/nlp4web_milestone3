Dakar dem dik: Dakar Roundtrip
###BREAK###
Spring 2011: Senegal, streaking through its capitol Dakar, more or less incidentally getting in contact with some urban fishermen, their stories of migrations, different notions of a 'Europe' - concrete, abstract, symbolic, projective, realistic? We are also, what we imagine, but imaginations form manifold and not seldom they seem to be unavoidably contradictory. This footage is part of a media-anthropological master's thesis that tries to collect, from local level, some pieces of the extensive discourses on global migratory processes, which are often framed by the encounters of numerous different life realities, in a sense, it seems, mutually exclusive to each other and yet somehow still co-existing.

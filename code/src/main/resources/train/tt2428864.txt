Duchamp's Bride
###BREAK###
Sex, eroticism, and death. In DUCHAMP'S BRIDE, gay Iranian artist Navid Sinaki creates a diary film to decide between two men; one who has yet to say 'I love you', and the other proclaims love through aggression. A series of intimate daydreams leads Navid inward to face estrangement from his motherland, where homosexuality is punishable by death, and alienation in the company of broken men.

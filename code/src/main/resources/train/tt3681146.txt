The Hitchhiker's Project
###BREAK###
It all starts with two friends, Allyson and Darren who where given a choice for their University project, they chose to do a project on hitchhiking. Allyson invited her younger step brother Leo to help out in the project. After doing some research they recorded their experiences. It all started off well and fun but their last ride was the last time they have ever been seen. If you have seen them we need to know where they are.

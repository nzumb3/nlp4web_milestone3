The Sailor's Anchor is the name of the last drag bar in Salvador-Bahia. During one week we follow the artists who perform at the house, their routines in the decadent city center and the preparation of the traditional party to celebrate the Sailor, an entity from the African religion Umbanda. Little by little we end up conducted through the behavioral, cultural and social matters of this unique territory.

###BREAK###
Bangshi Das is an impersonator of Charlie Chaplin. He earns peanuts by being the 'joker' at birthday parties. However, he prefers to call himself an actor rather than a worker. His life circles around his son who is the greatest critic of his performances. Poverty never seems bitter as the father-son duo knows how to make fun of it.

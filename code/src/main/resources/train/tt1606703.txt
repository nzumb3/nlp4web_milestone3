Are You for Great Sex?
###BREAK###
Are You For Great Sex? is a boundary-pushing, raw, and sophisticated sexual love story told from a uniquely fresh, woman's point of view. Directed by Cynthia Hsiung, and based on a true story, the movie wrestles with a central question: What is the meaning of great sex? Is it just a primal instinctual act? Or is there something deeper that a great sexual connection tells us about ourselves? There's great sex, and then there's unforgettable sex. That's what Thea and Mateas have had for more than a decade. Both New Yorkers in consuming professions, they consider their relationship to be "just" sexual and live out their separate lives. Over the years of this on-again-off-again, modern-epic romance, Thea copes with an unhappy marriage, a mother with Alzheimer's disease, and the pressure of her fertility clock. Mateas pursues a demanding career as a world-traveling consultant, and lives with its attendant emotional isolation while taking financial care of his ailing father. What remains unchanged is their sensational sexual chemistry - and a secret that emerges out of a bizarre series of events, forcing them to examine their lives on a profound level. Shining a spotlight on what it means to have a connection that is both highly sexual and deeply soulful, Are You For Great Sex? comments on contemporary definitions of love and has already inspired viewers to email their first loves, change up their sex lives, and evaluate their relationships. For everyone who wants to learn your greatest inner truth, ask yourself: Are You For Great Sex? The answer can only be: Yes!

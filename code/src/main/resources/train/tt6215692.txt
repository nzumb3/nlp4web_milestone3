Nuclear Holocaust
###BREAK###
The much anticipated sequel on the "Heroes of Sorrow" saga. There are over 600 Argentinean POWs, who fought at the Falkland War, and are still missing. Soldiers that never returned to their homes, to meet their love ones. 20 years later, a group of rouge relatives is seeking a desperate retribution, to rectify this endless ordeal, that so far, has been ignored by all Governments. The plan is simple, to hijack a military airplane with a cargo of nuclear weapons, and unleash their anger towards an ungrateful society, and their leaders who, over the years, have ignored them. The entire continent is at the brink of a Nuclear Holocaust.

Adormecidos
###BREAK###
Other than being a fervent fan of horror and sci-fi cinema (B movies included), Ra√∫l seems to be a fairly ordinary man in his early thirties. He's got a 9-to-5 job, follows quite a predictable routine both at work and in his personal life, and appears to be satisfied with the way things are. Yet, behind the surface, there's another side to him. He has a history of psychiatric problems and is now medicated - but don't picture a zombie; he's just your average urban man on your average meds. Plus there's something that's driving him insane: he suffers from an acute case of insomnia. Gradually, his sleeping disorder begins to hinder his work performance; he blames the lame condition of his pillows for his insomnia. So instead of going to see a shrink (again), he decides to buy a NASA-designed intelligent pillow. Believe it or not, he actually wakes up feeling unstressed and well rested. In no time, he's sleeping like a baby. That is, until he begins to have strongly disturbing nightmares. Soon enough, he starts losing touch with reality and feeling like he's someone else. From here on, it all goes into a spiral of unavoidable madness. Or is there any reality to some of the things he's experiencing? What if he's not that crazy?

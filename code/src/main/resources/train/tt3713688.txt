Be or not to be
###BREAK###
Russia, 1999. The last year of President Yeltsin. The crash of market and of the Soviet ideology make a simple worker, a metallurgist, reconsider his place in society. The role of Hamlet produces a turn-over in his mind and helps him find his own answer to the question 'To be or not to be?' His personal interpretation of the Shakespeare's drama helps to realize that the 'sea of troubles' of our existence is not just bad luck, but the hand of God, leading people to the acceptance of divine love. The film is documentary evidence of time and a trip around the small world of a representative of the 'lost generation' at the turn of the millennium.

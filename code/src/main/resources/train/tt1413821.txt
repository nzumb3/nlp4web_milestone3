It's been a year since Bruce died, but he is surely missed. His father, Roger, has just been released from the hospital and has yet to utter a word. When all of Bruce's buddies go to comfort him they find Roger in an almost catatonic state of depression, barely able to utter a few incongruous sentences. But when they discover that these fragment are actually fragment of old rock and roll songs from the sixties, they are quick to act, creating a whole new set of songs to help bring Rogers lexicon into the 21st century.

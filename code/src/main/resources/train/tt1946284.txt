In Richard III "An Arab VIP", the camera follows a touring Arab production of Shakespeare's play as it moves from rehearsals in the oil-rich Arabian Gulf State of Kuwait to the charged atmosphere of a U.S. premiere at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and on to the United Arab Emirates - for a command performance at the behest of local princesses.

Dimention Zero
###BREAK###
The second film to be made under the convention-defying Pink8 Film Manifesto, "Dimention Zero" tells the story of a man trapped in a dystopian industrial landscape as he encounters a mysterious woman who leads him far down the rabbit hole, and exposes him to the possibilities of the outside world. Part narrative, part formalist documentary, "Dimention Zero" blurs the lines between surrealism and social commentary. Featuring a cast comprised mostly of non-actors, and a soundtrack compiled from some of Scotland's foremost underground musicians, the film's raw and bewildering aesthetic flies in the face of conventional cinema, and represents independent filmmaking in its purest form.

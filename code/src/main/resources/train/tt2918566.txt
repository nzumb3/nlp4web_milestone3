Words of Revolution
###BREAK###
Words of Revolution is a documentary about a culture trying to revive and progress from a history of violence. While the country of El Salvador has suffered the aftermath of a civil war and the growth of gang violence, Salvadorans residing in the United States face challenges with their identity, culture, and negative connotations denoted by the media. Through the hopeful voices of hip-hop artists', a professor, and a community activist, this documentary helps promote change and bring cultural identity to a culture that is beginning a new chapter in their history...a chapter of peace...prosperity...and unity.

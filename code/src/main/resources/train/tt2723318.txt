The Grenadines Road
###BREAK###
It's a resurrection story told through lives of ordinary people who are all heartbroken, stranded traveling people from different parts of the world seeking a new life somewhere on a road in and around Spain via via via on the road getting 'there.' As the story unfolds the reality warps and the film which starts as a documentary turns into a fiction where the documentary parts become the dreams of the protagonists of the fiction shorts that follow the non-fiction parts. And the most fantastic character - a resurrected matador - leaves its form as a human being and becomes the vista as he walks throughout the film into the lives and actions of these people who are all madly in love with someone unknown.

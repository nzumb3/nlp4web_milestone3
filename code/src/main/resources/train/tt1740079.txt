Between Stone & Sky
###BREAK###
The journey of an arctic river as it pours across the tundra into the arctic ocean. A meditative film of the remote and seemingly desolate landscape of the inland Canadian Arctic that at once reveals itself to be a dynamic place of stunning beauty and concentrated life. Shot hundreds of miles North of the nearest dirt road by a solitary crew of four traveling via canoe, the film neither belabors nor belies their presence. Instead, a persistent lens judiciously augmented with time-lapse, and location sound allows the landscape to transcend the exotic and become a place for reflection.

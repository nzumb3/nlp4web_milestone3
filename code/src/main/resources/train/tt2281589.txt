Untitled Punk: Fuck You, Get Drunk, Go Die
###BREAK###
Untitled Punk explores Punk subculture in an effort to reveal the importance of self marginalization as an integral component to not only the structure of the subculture but also the experience of the participant. With an insiders access, an analytical eye and an established artistic aesthetic; personal experience, and ephemera produced by the subculture become a tableau that is the fiber of the subculture, a reflection of the experience and the foundation of the communication network that has lasted for more than 30 years. Untitled Punk offers an example of the organic coalescence that became Punk subculture. The film documents the shared history of several bands and a wide reaching network of friends in the Northern New Jersey Punk scene.

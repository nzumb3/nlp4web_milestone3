Keepers of the Light
###BREAK###
A middle-aged woman living in Los Angeles, saddled with a stressful job, a long-term relationship rapidly unraveling, coping with a drug-addicted daughter facing criminal charges and now facing raising 4 grandchildren, all under the age of 6 years, alone, takes a leap of faith. She sells her California home and heads to Austin, Texas. No family, no friends, no job, no medical insurance. Within days of arriving in Austin, a group of women at a drumming session encourage her to join them on a trip to Peru. What she believes to be an impromptu and much-needed vacation morphs into a spiritual journey of discovery, one that literally transforms her life and directly affects her life and that of the family she left behind.

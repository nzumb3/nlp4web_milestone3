Waterscape: Illusions
###BREAK###
Compelling images of elegant swans on mysterious wilderness waters with upside-down reflections of trees, clouds, and colors make an ever-changing setting for a filmmaker at work. She films the antics of a swan family, ponders her script-in-progress, attempts the optimal light meter reading, and grows impatient when the swans prove difficult to film. As she explores thousands of years of swan folklore, off-screen voices bring to life notable swan observers whose conclusions are more entertaining than accurate. But where is this place and what is it-a flight of the filmmaker's imagination? Oblivious, the swans continue their everyday routines in this magical setting.

My Sisters Kids in the Snow
###BREAK###
The whole family are going to Norway on a week's ski vacation. However, the father of the family breaks his leg and the mother feels she cannot go with all the seven children alone, not with the newborn twins needing so much attention and all. Therefore, her brother Erik is asked to go with the children, which he does. When arriving at the hotel, the kids find out that their arch nemesis, Mrs. Flinth, also has come there. Will their vacation be completely spoiled or will they find a way to get at her this time too?

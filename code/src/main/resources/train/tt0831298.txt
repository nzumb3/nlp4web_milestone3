I Flunked Sunday School
###BREAK###
Lloyd Boyd has been called of God - in the shower - to become a Personal Preacher. No other information was available. Lloyd puts his business card at grocery stores, bus stops, gas stations - lots of places - and starts getting calls. Sister Selma wants her back-sliding man to come back to church. Nine years ago he quit going stating simply "I got it" and now she's ready for him to start again. Miss Minerva and Miss Flossie are the last members of the church Lloyd attended as a child - and the one where he managed to flunk Sunday School. They've moved in to pay the bills and keep the doors open. But a lawyer has a client who wants to buy the property for $5 million. Lloyd... HELP! Kevin Kuchar is a multi-millionaire with a dark secret that drives his philanthropy. Only one person knows - until he tells Lloyd. Now he's afraid everyone will find out. As Lloyd enters each story they begin to change and he stumbles and bumbles his way into their lives. Grant ends up in church - but without his pants. The ladies decide to keep the church going but the lawyers find a way to try to force the sale. And Kuchar gets pushed to the very edge of his ability to cope. The sole person in the midst of it all - is a guy who flunked Sunday School!

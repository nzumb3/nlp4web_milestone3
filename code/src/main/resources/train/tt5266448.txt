Uma volta, pelo parque
###BREAK###
In the same vein of the spaghetti westerns, "Uma volta, pelo parque" introduces us to a low-budget film where the action takes place in the same afternoon about a small problem (owing some minor amount of money) which turns out to be the biggest problem for each one of the characters. An epic about failure.

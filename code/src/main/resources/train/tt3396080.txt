Diary Of an Overly Reactive Middle Aged Teenager
###BREAK###
The desire to be famous is as old as the desire to desire. The story of countless many, yet can this one stand apart. Fame has another wannabe-queen, another to-be-victim, another doormat. Optimistic girl wearing opportunistic glasses sets out into a world most (even if they haven't admitted it to themselves yet) want to be in. The world of fame. The world of movies. The world of constant appreciation. The world of constant recognition. The question is despite all odds, all competition, does this overly reactive middle aged teenager make it? Yes and No.

10 Things I Hate About Life
###BREAK###
Romantic-comedic about a young woman and a young man (McDonell - 'Prom') who meet and fall in love - just when they are about to kill themselves. Their crazy shared experiences and similar emotional state forms a bond that draws them both into happiness and takes them on a rollercoaster ride of young love in a world where emotions runs high. A thematic sequel to Heath Ledger's '10 Things I Hate About You', you might say this is oddly titled and themed given what happened. The director of the original, and the spin-off TV show, returns following 15 years of TV mediocrity. Evan Rachel Wood has a track record of interesting choices, so this could go either way.

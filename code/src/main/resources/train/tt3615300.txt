This film about Turkey, a country that borders eight different countries, explores the various forms that borders can take. The filmmakers visit towns located close to each border, always one on the Turkish and one on the other side. In a total of 16 small towns, we observe various forms of daily life and the social and political problems that give this life motion. The country thus takes shape by tracing its borders on a map.

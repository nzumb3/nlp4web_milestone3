Blue End
###BREAK###
Joseph Paul Jernigan was 39 years old when he was executed in Huntsville, Texas, in 1993. Ten minutes after the lethal injection, he was handed over to scientists, transported to Denver, frozen in blue gelatin and, over a period of four months, photographed as he was planed off, millimeter by millimeter. He would be reborn on the Internet as the "visible man" -- the first completely digitized human being. This worldwide, digitally distributed Visible Human Project is the result of a unique interaction between science and justice.

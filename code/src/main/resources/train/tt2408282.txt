Acedia
###BREAK###
Acedia is set on a country estate where six priests are sent to rid a teenage girl of demons. While waiting for the ritualistic tenth hour, the priests start to uncover demons of their own as well as the dark secrets that haunt the estate. A small box created from wood made from the boat of Noah's Arc can make wishes come true. Once the wish is granted the souls are trapped in the dark corners of hell!

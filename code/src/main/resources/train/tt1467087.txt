Sustaining Life
###BREAK###
Welcome to the biggest story of our generation; the one that will force us beyond our beliefs and challenge every nation to think. In our world today there are 1.2 billion people suffering from a disease that has no reason to exist. This disease is why 3.9 million people were killed in the Congo, why 1.8 million were tortured in Cambodia, and why over 400,000 of our fellow human beings have been raped and murdered in the Sudan. This is the story of you and me and all of us standing up and re-affirming the power of what it means to be a human being. This is the story of our generation's unique opportunity to eradicate extreme poverty. Through stunning animation, compelling visuals, and the scientists, researchers, and humanitarians working on the ground, this film exposes the problem, provides the solution, and lets every one of us know exactly what we can do to help.

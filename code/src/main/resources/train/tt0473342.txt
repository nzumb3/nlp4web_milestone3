Car Babes
###BREAK###
Ford Davis is fresh out of college and out of a job. After damaging a rental car from his father's car dealership, Ford is forced into working on the lot as a salesmen until he can pay off his debt to his dad, Big Len. While at the dealership, Ford befriends the other car salesmen, who refer to each other as "CarBabes," and quickly learns that selling cars is not easy. Meanwhile, a competitor across the street, Ron Hamper of Hamper's Campers RV Park, has had his eye on the Davis Automotive lot for sometime now. When Ron Hamper sees that Big Len is in financial trouble, he decides to strike and attempts to takeover Davis Automotive and make the dealership into a parking lot for his campers. Â  Using the wisdom he has gained from his father and the rest of the team, Ford comes up with one final plan to save the dealership from impending doom: a blowout sale to sell 300 cars in a month. Impossible? Not if you're a CarBabe...

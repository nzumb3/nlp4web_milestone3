World Peace & Prayer Day
###BREAK###
World Peace and Prayer Day was founded in 1996 in the Black Hills of South Dakota by Chief Arvol Looking Horse, 19th generation keeper of the sacred White Buffalo Calf Pipe of the Sioux Nation. Arvol Looking Horse was led by a vision to honor sacred sites and to invite all nations and all faiths to do the same, to heal our relationship with our mother, the Earth. World Peace and Prayer Day is held annually on the summer solstice, a powerful day to pray for peace among all living beings. 2010 WP&PD was held at Blue Star Equiculture in Palmer, Mass. Their mission is to provide homeless working horses a sanctuary while bringing education, equine awareness, skills and healing to the community and environment.

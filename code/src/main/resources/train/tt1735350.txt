Empty Rooms
###BREAK###
Maddie Usher is the single mother of Jonah, a mute autistic boy who can only communicate through imagery. In an effort to change their quality of life, Maddie purchases an old house in the quiet suburbs. Upon moving into the empty dutch colonial, Jonah's demeanor completely changes. The young boy's behavior becomes violent and his savant-like skills at drawing reveal a preoccupation with the form of a terrifying, bald, naked man. Jonah's doctor insists it is simply the stress of moving into a new house yet this does little to ease Maddie's worries. Soon Maddie realizes the problem lay not within Jonah, but within the house itself.

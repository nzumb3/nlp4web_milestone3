Drink Tea Ghost Man
###BREAK###
Edmund, a young English telemarketer, is willing to risk his job for just one thing, or anything, actually. On a whim, he lands in Hong Kong, the exotic city of opportunity, hustlers, bizarre expats and Annie, the one true love of his life. She's seductive, intense and in love with Laurent, a French neo-Marxist. Caught up in a landscape of tropical islands, bustling markets, and towering skyscrapers the down-and-out suburbanite will stop at nothing to win the heart of his Bohemian Princess. That is, until he meets Siu Ling. She's conservative, Asian, available, and the one true love of his life... Edmund is 'about to make a very important decision'. Drink Tea Ghost Man (Yum Cha Gweilo) is a satire on early-life crisis, superficial love, and the search for meaning.

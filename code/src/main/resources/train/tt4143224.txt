Ibyiza Birimbere: The Best Is Still to Come
###BREAK###
2014 marked the twentieth anniversary of a horrible crime against humanity. In Rwanda April 7 is Memorial Day, commemorating the genocide. July 4, Liberation Day, celebrates the genocide's end. Our film was made during that time. It is the portrait of three young adults. Gerard (19) Odette (22), and Shenge (24) have different goals in life. Gerard, who was conceived in rape, wants to find his real parents. Odette, who wants to study psychology, believes in articulating her own trauma, while Shenge uses music and film in order to transport her own story to the world. Ibyiza Birimbere does not explain the genocide, nor is it political. It is a film about people whose eyes flicker against a brighter horizon.

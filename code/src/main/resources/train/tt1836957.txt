The Heart of Business
###BREAK###
The Heart of Business takes us to a unique business conference in the wilds of British Columbia. From there, it follows the lives of six entrepreneurs as they deal with their daily struggles, successes, and insights. These personal stories remind us that business can be what we demand of it, not what it demands of us. They frame business as a potential gateway into the human spirit, into valuable insights that are fueling pivotal change in the business community. The Heart of Business gives us inspiring glimpses into an important trend that continues to grow - one person at a time.

Concert
###BREAK###
Borne out of a benefit performance, CONCERT is a film about one artist's view of the genesis of original music, its importance to the creative process and the significance of the message to be delivered. CONCERT speaks of the texture that lives within a musical composition, the mosaic of stories that unfold in each song, and the artistic relevance of music to our world.

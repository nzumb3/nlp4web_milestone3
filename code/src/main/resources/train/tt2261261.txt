A tree is accidental meeting place of nine people who don't know each other, but who all have a special need to be close to that very tree. Awkward and bizarre interactions develop that even lead to an unintentional murder. In interviews all people involved later reveal their motivations to fight for their place around the tree and share details from their private lives, and it becomes obvious, that they all are unknowingly connected in some way and that each of them has to deal with tragedies and needs that are similar to those of the others. The tree himself expresses his bitter feelings about being embattled in the fairy tale style introductory part of the story.

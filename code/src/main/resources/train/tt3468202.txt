Estimates of 200,000 homeless dogs spend their short lives on the streets and beaches of Puerto Rico, a U.S. territory. Project Animal Worldwide based in Monmouth County, New Jersey, seeks to help these 'Sato' (mixed breed) dogs. The Documentary portrays the plight of the Satos and how Project Animal and animal welfare leaders in Puerto Rico are working together to help the Satos by creating spay and neuter interventions, humane education programs and even bringing the dogs to mainland USA for adoption. Special appearance by Cesar Millan, who speaks about the desperate need for global spay and neuter programs.

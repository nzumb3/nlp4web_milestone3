A Global Education
###BREAK###
A Global Education is connecting students on a individual level from around the world. Ten students from Thomas Jefferson High School in Dallas, after having studied Mandarin Chinese in school, earned the privilege of studying for 21 days at the Hainan Overseas School in Hainan Province China. The students grow in perspective and character, while being on the forefront of international relations. A Global Education shows the importance of connecting our education on a personal level with the rest of the world.

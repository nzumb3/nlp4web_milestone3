We Know Care
###BREAK###
Meet Horace and Mabel Gladstone. When they inherit a mansion, they decide to move in, fix it up, and open a business - of sorts. The bad news is that they have no idea what they're doing. The good news is that they find five senior citizens to help them. However, when Horace's cousin Todd rears his sinister head, everything that Horace holds dear may be lost. Will our heroes' hair-brained scheme raise the money they need quickly enough to help them pass the inspection and keep cousin Todd from getting a little piece of the old girl?

Utopia
###BREAK###
An accident takes place during the filming of a documentary on the future and the film's presenter (Rhys Muldoon) slips into unconsciousness. The actor's muddled neurons recall fragments of his script, and he begins to consider humankind's past and present imaginings of Utopia - an ideal and perfect state.

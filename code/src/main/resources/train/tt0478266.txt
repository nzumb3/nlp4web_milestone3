The Smell of Paradise
###BREAK###
An Islamic world tour is documented here by visits to Pakistan, Afghanistan, Chechnia, and Qatar, to highlight events post 9/11, including footage taken a few years before. The film above all endeavors to shed light on the process leading young men to the radical choice of self-sacrifice, becoming human bombs. The directors of the film traveled for ten years throughout these countries under heavy Moslem influence, and met with clan leaders, mullahs, and other strict followers of the Koran.

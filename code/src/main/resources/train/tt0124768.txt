The Boy Who Stopped Talking
###BREAK###
Young Memo is a happy boy who lives in a small village in the east of Turkey. His father lives in The Netherlands, where he works as a foreign labourer. Things are not going too good in Turkey though, Memo and his family are Kurds. When Memo's father hears there's a war going on against the Kurds, he decides to take his family to The Netherlands. But Memo is not all happy about this, even though he almost immediately finds a friend, Jeroen after arriving in The Netherlands. He wants to get back to Kurdistan. Out of protest Memo decides to not speak anymore, to nobody.

PÃ©rez
###BREAK###
'Perez' presents the encounter between an in mature and irresponsible forty-year-old and his 22 year old daughter, Roma, whom he hasn't seen more than a few times in his whole life. Tardily seeking to establish a relationship with her, he invites her to spend a few days at his vacation cabin in South of Chile. During these three days, Roma uses head-on confrontation, bluntness and dark humor to show the anger she feels towards Perez, as well as the sudden jealousy provoked by Marion, her father's young girlfriend, whom she had not been warned about.

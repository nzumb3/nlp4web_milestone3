Summer Blink
###BREAK###
Mina is 18. She is graduating from high school and is facing the summer that is the prologue to her new life. A life of no college plans, no job, no money, and no idea of what she's going to do once September comes and all of her friends are gone to college. But she does have the summer, and an opportunity to still surprise herself by what life can bring when you least expect it. Summer Blink chronicles a summer full of orange-hued memories and sweeping sensory overload. A time when you did everything society and your parents warned you not to just to prove you were alive.

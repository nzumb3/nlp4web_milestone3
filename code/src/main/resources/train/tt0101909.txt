Frame Up
###BREAK###
In the small American town of Orton Creek, David Farmer is accidentally killed by Don Curran, son of town tyrant Will Curran, during a fraternity initiation. The frat boys frame electronic parts salesman Frank Govers for hit-and-run but determined newcomer Sheriff Ralph Baker and his love interest Jo Westlake seek the truth. Govers and girlfriend Lee Ann Hadley hide in a hunting cabin and are captured by prison escapees Mick August and Merlin Wells (who is tricked by Govers into electrocuting himself). August tries to claim the bounty on Govers from Will Curran but Sheriff Baker is only one step behind.

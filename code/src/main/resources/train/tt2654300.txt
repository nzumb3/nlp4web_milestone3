The Road Back Home
###BREAK###
On any given night, approximately fourteen thousand people in the Phoenix metropolitan area are homeless. In The Road Back Home, we meet five of them and follow their stories through victories and struggles, some surprising and others tragically familiar. Their stories are woven together with poignant insights from people who work with the homeless all the time. From a police officer who leads us to a surreal camp under a bridge to Lucy, a social worker whose tireless love for the homeless is as inspiring as it is unusual, we see not only the problem, but also a way forward, and reason for hope.

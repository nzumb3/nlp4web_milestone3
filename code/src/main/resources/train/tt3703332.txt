We Are Open Cinema

OPEN CINEMA is a film studio for low-income communities. We coordinate a national network of film clubs for excluded people, a participatory filmmaking programme, and make films for cross-sector organisations advocating on issues of social or environmental importance. Since 2009 we have launched 32 community cinemas in some of the most challenged communities in the UK and Ireland. This documentary concentrates on the Open Cinema, Sheffield, South Yorkshire. In association with South Yorkshire Housing Assocition.

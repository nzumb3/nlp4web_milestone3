Double Take
###BREAK###
A writer witnesses a murder that may have been politically motivated involving Argentinian Nationals. After picking the man out of a line-up and persuasively testifying in court against him, the man is convicted. However, his girlfriend shows up and says the man is innocent and produces a picture of a young child which she says will be without a father. This leaves the writer with doubts and then when he sees another man who looks very much like the killer, he becomes more certain that he made a mistake. However, everything is not as it appears and the writer finds himself drawn into the murder and blackmail.

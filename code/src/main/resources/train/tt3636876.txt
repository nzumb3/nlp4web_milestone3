A documentary about the life of Alejandro Cotto, a film making pioneer from El Salvador. We explore his early life, his involvement in the cinema as a volunteer projectionist while he was just a teenager and his eventual departure to Mexico City where he studied and met renowned filmmaker Julio Bracho, who became his mentor and collaborator. Then we follow his return to El Salvador where he continued making films in a smaller scale while trying to jump start a film movement that ended in frustration and contributed in part to his decision to quit making films altogether. This is not only a story of a kid who dreamed of making films and eventually made that dream come true but also a story of a man who sacrificed a chance at a bigger career to come back to his country to attempt of starting a film industry that nobody wanted.

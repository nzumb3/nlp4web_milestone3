Telling the remarkable story of one man's fierce commitment to make the homeless visible. It's why he started InvisiblePeople.TV, a nonprofit that uses social media to document what it's like to be homeless in America, turning common stereotypes of the homeless upside-down. Mark has posted hundreds of raw, unedited video testimonials from the homeless - and these stories have reached millions of people online. He has become the web voice of this cause; his network has given voice to thousands of homeless men and women, and advocacy organizations are taking notice. Few people will share the same dedication Mark shows to eradicating homelessness - because not all of us have been there. But we can learn to step out of our comfort zones and see homeless people for who they really are - our friends, our family, and our neighbors. We can educate ourselves about this issue, and work to end homelessness in our communities. Mark dares us to care as he exposes America's broken safety net, and what its failure means for all of us.

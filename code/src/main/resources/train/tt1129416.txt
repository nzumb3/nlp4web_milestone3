Dandy Kids is a documentary about families who share their life experiences of looking for answers from a limited number within the medical community.Over and over again families struggle to find answers for a diagnosis for which the cause and treatment are not known.Many are told pregnancies should be terminated,and that the prognosis is hopeless. Dandy Kids will depict the experts,advocates, and ultimately the Heroes who by way of faith,perseverance,and unconditional love live life to the fullest every day!Many times this is done minute by minute,second by second,and in the research labs chromosome by chromosome. Dandy Kids are faced with an array of anomalies ranging from Hydrocephalus to Autism.This documentary was made in conjunction with Congress,Researchers,Physicians and those families effected by the various types of Dandy Walker malformations, to promote research and raise awareness, and give HOPE!

Flowers of Evil
###BREAK###
Paris-Tehran. A rootless love story between Gecko, young and free, and Anahita, an Iranian in exile - tangled up in History and steeped in Internet. Anahita is obsessed by the current event in her country, and little by little their story is contaminated by History and its breathless mediatisation on the Internet.

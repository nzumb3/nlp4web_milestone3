Estamos Aqui! We are here! The Latino population is the fastest growing American demographic. They are also among the most under-represented groups in conservation, outdoor recreation, and environmental education organizations. What are the causes and consequences of this divide? Latino families and individuals from all over the United States are already connecting with their history, their culture, their communities and the planet through powerful, meaningful and culturally relevant nature and outdoor activities. In 'Estamos Aqui' we will meet these inspiring people and hear their stories.

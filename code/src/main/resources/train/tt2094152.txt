The Man with the Jazz Guitar
###BREAK###
Deeply inspired by Django Reinhardt, Ken Sykora's musical career was cut short by the 2nd World War and rock'n'roll. He moved into broadcasting where he worked on more than 3000 programmes over 4 decades. At the peak of his popularity in the early 70s he suddenly and unexpectedly quit the BBC and moved his wife and young family from Suffolk to Scotland, to run a hotel, in 'the middle of nowhere'. Featuring intimate interviews with his three children, close friends and colleagues, Ken is creatively brought to life through a mixture of animation and his radio voice. With exclusive access to Ken's extensive archive, his life of music, food and words is reconstructed using memorabilia and rare sound recordings of his musical career not heard for more than 50 years.

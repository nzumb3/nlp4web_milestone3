In My Mother's Arms
###BREAK###
In My Mother's Arms follows several children who live and study in the same room of a small rented house. These are forgotten children whose parents have been killed or kidnapped. They have no one to support them but Husham, a student who works tirelessly to protect them from the dangers of the streets of Baghdad. The landlord demands they vacate his house and now the only sanctuary these children have ever known is about to be lost. The film was shot in 2010: the future of the orphanage has yet to be resolved.

Journey to Justice
###BREAK###
"Journey to Justice" tells the story of Howard Triest, a German Jew who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 when he was 16 years old, returned as a victorious American soldier and then served as an interpreter at the Nuremberg Tribunal, enabling him to come face-to-face with imprisoned Nazi officials who were co-responsible for the death of six million Jews, including Howard's parents at Auschwitz. "Journey to Justice" was shot in five countries and features extensive archival research and images, including historic film and photographs shot by Howard himself. It includes the story of how Margot, Howard's younger sister, was rescued from a detention camp in France just before her parents' deportation and how she saved ten other children in her subsequent escape to Switzerland.

Another Chance: Reentry After Prison
###BREAK###
Washington Corrections Center for Women lies close to the picturesque waterfront town of Gig Harbor. Every year 500 women are released from this prison and 2/3 of them are re-incarcerated, many within the first year. This film is about a group of Rotarians developing a program to help the offenders recognize their true potential and translate their skills into a resume and a successful interview so they can lead productive lives on release. The program actually goes far beyond that in the 6-week class thanks to the dedication of the volunteer businessmen and women who teach it. Several times a year they donate 30 intense hours to instill confidence in a group of women who have never had anyone believe in them and who have never believed in themselves.

Molly's Theory of Relativity
###BREAK###
'Molly's Theory of Relativity' depicts a day in the life of a beautiful twenty eight year old astronomer poised to make the first reckless decision of her life. Her story takes place on Halloween. Aiding her on her day of reckoning are her husband, her father-in-law, three deceased relatives, a precocious, trick-or-treating nine year old girl, her grandfather from Minot, North Dakota, and an eight year old neighbor who may or may not be imaginary. 'Molly's Theory of Relativity' is about the economy, how we value and measure the pride we take in what we choose to do for a living, the unbreakable bonds of family, and the notion that death is merely a relative thing.

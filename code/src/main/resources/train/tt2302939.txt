Trannysnatchers!
###BREAK###
Outside a small, typical American town, an elusive cult of demon worshiping gender queer assassins live in infamy, awaiting the day their savior will return to Earth & end the Gender Binary. Within the context of an avant-garde horror film, we examine cinematic stereotypes and exploit them to our darkest advantage. This film was made over two summers in Portland, Oregon by a group of young artists as an exercise in trust & complete collaboration. Trannysnatchers! is a document of a life-changing work for all involved.

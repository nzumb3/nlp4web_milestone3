Folklore's Intimates
###BREAK###
Young folksinger and mild-mannered pacifist Herbert Meakin, finds himself torn from a peaceful life and dropped in the midst of a guerrilla war. Entrenched deep in the woods and faced with the constant threat of an unseen enemy garrisoned in a nearby town, the bewildered Meakin is forced into an unnerving bond with a group of stir-crazy soldiers. After a string of silent killings escalate camp hysteria, the erratic Major Parradocks initiates his 'master plan': to encircle their camp with a defensive twig alarm system in preparation for further aggression. As the camp prepares for the inevitable onslaught, their already brittle sanity is worryingly strained and Meakin is left with a big decision: stay and spend his final days fighting alongside this band of maniacal comrades or escape and risk leaving behind his last realistic chance of getting home.

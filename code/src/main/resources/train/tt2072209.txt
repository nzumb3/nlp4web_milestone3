Punto muerto
###BREAK###
Thriller-drama, with an intense story that covers two generations of characters that have suffered from unusual episodes of schizophrenia that supposedly were originated by guilt and remorse. The name PUNTO MUERTO summarizes the main thread when the discussions about such delicate topics as abortion and family birthrates face a 'dead end' on point of views and conciliation.

Tutti a Casa - Power to the people?
###BREAK###
In many Western democracies, trust between the people and the politicians are at a low point while populist movements are on the rise. In Italy, Movimento vows to send all politicians home and bring the people to power. They win a stunning 25% of the vote, but what happens when political ideals meet parliamentary reality? Can you be uncompromising and democratic at the same time? Are internet referendums direct democracy or faceless mob rule? The film follows this democratic experiment.

###BREAK###
A pitch black comedy on a serious subject featuring a lonely executive who takes her would-be rapist hostage without fully thinking it through. What ensues is a sometimes explosive, always psychological interaction between two seemingly different people with opposite objectives: she's extracting her revenge, he's trying to break free. Yet through it all they manage to peel away the layers of the situation to reveal a humanity they both share.

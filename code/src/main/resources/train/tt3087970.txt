Face on the Corner
###BREAK###
Frank Koslowsky is the owner of Carousel Collision, a popular body shop in Coney Island, Brooklyn. After starting a clothing line named Underground Clown, he developed a more long-term brand affiliated with known Boxers and MMA fighters, Future Legend. Closely involved in various charities, the community has wondered who Frank truly is and why he lives the lifestyle he does. It all dates back to a 9-year friendship with his younger protégé, Cory "Face" Pelzer. Cory was fatally shot in the head back in 2001 for reasons unknown. The murder case has been closed, unsolved. A Face On A Corner examines the spiritual evolution of a human being and the way doors close for one but open for many. Frank aspires to continue building his line solely due to what it represents and to shed some light on a young, kind and fashion-forward man whose life was taken in the blink of an eye.

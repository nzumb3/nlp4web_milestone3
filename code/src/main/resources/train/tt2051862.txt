Dew on Scallions
###BREAK###
'Dew On Scallions' is an ancient elegy which sang: 'Dew on scallions is so easily dried. Dried and then next day it would still cry. But a person who is gone will never come by.' The film's mind-frame is the same as the elegy above. It's a story about the death of the Chinese young generation.

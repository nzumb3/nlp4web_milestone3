Echoes of the Holocaust
###BREAK###
To the survivors who frequent it, this is holy ground . . . a Jewish cemetery for the countless souls who perished during the Holocaust, and for whom no grave stone, burial marker, or final resting place exists. The true power of the Holocaust Memorial of Miami Beach can be witnessed when survivors - serving as docents or guides - begin gathering to tell their stories of survival to school children, tourists and visitor groups from across the globe. In 2006, the Memorial's leaders embarked on a mission to preserve some of the survivors' tours on film, so that the echoes of their words live on. With each passing year, there are fewer survivors left. Echoes of the Holocaust captures four of the Memorial's remaining survivors.

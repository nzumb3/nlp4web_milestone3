Teresa sin mar
###BREAK###
The routine the evasion and the tension are imposed inside a big dimension boat, left in a moment of crisis in the port of Barcelona. Six crew members go on strike and occupy the boat to press the company and to recover their salaries. They survive with the food and the minimal fuel to continue on board. The time and the space are distorted after more than three months of waiting and stagnation. When they wonder what is the use of continuing to bear, an unforeseen turn changes the situation. A paradigmatic case of the dangers of capitalism, a story of collective fight, a rarely seen situation on board of a Spanish merchant ship.

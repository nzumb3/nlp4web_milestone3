Cannibales du Pacifique
###BREAK###
On the island of south Pacific, natives from Futuna created "The Vanuatu Kannibal Magic Tour". They dress up as cannibals for tourists from New-Caledonia and Australia. They need this subterfuge to earn their living. Johnson, the village's chief, is very charismatic. He creates the shows for the tourists. This money's not benefiting natives because the way of life in Port Vila, the capital, is very expensive. It is often used for health or school costs. Johnson has a dream: build his own village to protect his culture and to get some power. Waiting for his dream, Johnson and natives disguise, dance and play Kannibals for tourists. The movie is the story about the life of Johnson and the villagers. Through Johnson's point of view we discover the Tour Kannibal's effects on their culture : their denial of identity and the economical crisis.

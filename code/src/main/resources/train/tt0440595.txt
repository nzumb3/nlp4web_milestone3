Six Strong Guys
###BREAK###
Malcolm, Ben, Long and Chai meet up on the rooftop of an office block for an unusual suicide plan. The four men, driven to the edge by problems and stresses, are going to jump off the roof in a protest against the miserable lives of men. But before they take the leap of their life, they have agreed to give themselves three hours to say their last goodbyes. They are in for a big surprise when two more unexpected "guests" with the same suicidal intent join them to share a men-to-men, heart-to-heart talk.

A Beautiful Game
###BREAK###
Six American homeless men from different backgrounds are observed through a year of their lives and a season of homeless soccer. The film presents a cross sectional view of the American homeless plight and shows that something as small as a game, and a team community can be the big difference in a life. Through learning this beautiful game our characters struggle to rejoin society as they confront issues on the field in order to apply their new skills and discoveries in taking their first step out of the streets.

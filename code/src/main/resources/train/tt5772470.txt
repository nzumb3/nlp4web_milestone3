Welcome
###BREAK###
A black screen. Four voices are heard. Two men are telling and repeating to two others that they are "welcome to the region". Gradually, the situation becomes clearer: the filmmaker, Zhu Rikun, is on a shoot in Sichuan. His interest is in the lung diseases that plague the region's workers, a health problem already present in his film Dust and which the Chinese State is trying to hush up. So here he is, invited to a brief interview with the local authorities, which is audio-recorded and played back in full in the film. A raw document that bares the methods of power: the insistence of the censors, their successive changes in strategy ranging from sugar-coated threats to the express demand that the images be destroyed, which only fuels the desire to bear witness even further.

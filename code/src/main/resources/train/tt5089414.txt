Hano! A Century in the Bleachers
###BREAK###
Experience the untold story of the extraordinary life and times of Arnold Hano, who just might be the Babe Ruth of writers. As one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century, Hano wrote for Sport magazine from 1955-1981, penned almost 500 magazine articles, wrote 27 books, sold over a million of them, and won the Sidney Hillman prize for journalism. But Hano is more than an accomplished writer. He's a social activist who has successfully battled racism, land developers, big corporations and the federal government. He met and talked with Babe Ruth, JFK and John Wayne. His story has flown under the radar...until now.

Messias, the husband, a dentist, almost magician. Felizbela, the beautiful wife, almost happy. Joana, the daughter, almost a singer, and Nuts, her boyfriend, almost a filmmaker. Finally the grand father Tobias, a shepherd, almost immortal. Five characters, five stories, one film: FORGET EVERYTHING I'VE TOLD YOU.

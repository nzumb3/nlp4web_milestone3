Garden of Eden
###BREAK###
Lithuania in the near future. The land is full of rich immigrants. Rich Lithuanians that were scattered throughout the world return to Lithuania to spend their golden years in luxurious nursing homes; and the laws that govern life and death provide a feeling of security... The residents of the Garden of Eden look upon this "global theatre of life" with tearful smiles and great wisdom.

Small Market, Big Heart
###BREAK###
Small Market, Big Heart is a feature-length documentary that shares the compelling 26 year story of the people of Sacramento and their battle to get and keep a professional sports franchise, the Sacramento Kings. The story has many heroes, but one common theme: a community with a huge heart. It is a emotional journey that appeals to sports fans and non-sports fans alike because it shows the power of community and how ordinary people can come together to do extraordinary things through the platform of social media.

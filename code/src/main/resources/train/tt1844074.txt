The League of Rock: The Rockumentary
###BREAK###
The League Of Rock is a league for adult non-pro musicians who are hidden in their basements and have no-one to play with. This 'Rockumentary' follows this 'Hidden Musical Population' as they join a band, play live, record in a pro studio and ride the roller-coaster of emotions through a ten week process. Features well-known Canadian musical icons such as Terry Brown, Michael White & Blair Packham and Jim McCarty, a founding member of the Yardbirds. Watch Moms & Dads, Truck Drivers & Scientists, Lawyers & Home Renovators as they discover the ups and downs of life as Rock Stars!

Kannan Varuvaan
###BREAK###
A comatose matriarch (Manorama) shockingly awakes from her near-death state when caretakers mention the impending return of her long-lost grandson. In a medical miracle of Tamil film proportions, she is back full form, and sends her crony (Goundamani) to fetch the grandson. The grandson (Ranjit) turns out to be a creep, so the crony comes up with a quick plan to appoint a temple architect Kannan (Karthik) as an interim grandson for the unsuspecting matriach. Kannan agrees, and eventually takes his role a bit too seriously. Divya Unni as Kannan's poor lover and Manthara as the grandma-chosen bride add a creamy love triangle to top up the potboiler.

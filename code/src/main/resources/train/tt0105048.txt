Oh, What a Night
###BREAK###
In a small Canadian township two lads start to investigate the world of women, with some advice from the local Scottish shop and garage owner. One of them tries to impress his girl with his dad's various cars while the other takes an increasingly serious interest in an older woman. Meanwhile the parents involved have their own adult problems.

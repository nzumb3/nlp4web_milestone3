Mysterious intern neurosurgeon Dr. Kang saves three young patients, even though the surgeries should not have saved the patients. Chief physician Dr. Lee becomes skeptical of the results so he sends video tapes of the surgery to America for analysis. Dr. Lee's niece, who is an anesthesiologist, Dr. Pyo Ji-Soo has strong feelings for Ji-Min, but keeps it to herself. One day, Oh Sae-Yun suffers from a brain tumor and is admitted to the hospital. Sae-Yun becomes involved in a hostage situation in the hospital, in which Dr. Ji-Min saves her. Since that time, Sae-Yun becomes interested in Dr. Kang. Sae-Yun follows Dr. Kang, who leaves the hospital late at night, and discovers Dr. Kang's secret. Sae-Yun, on the condition of keeping Dr. Kang's secret quiet, starts to date Dr. Kang. With the outcome of the tape analysis from America, Dr. Pyo discovers that Dr. Kang treats patients with his energy. The spirit of Dr. Kang's mother then asks Dr. Pyo to take care of her son.

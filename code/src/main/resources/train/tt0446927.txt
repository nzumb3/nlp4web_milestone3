Dajun still lives with his father, who dates and plans to marry a ditsy starlet. The boy's mother is a flight stewardess, hence often away, and so Dajun's chubby cousin Yifen is often hired in as a child-minder.

The emotional complications escalate satisfyingly, climaxing on the night that Dajun goes missing and everyone blames everyone else...

Ilona llega con la lluvia
###BREAK###
Out from prison in Ceuta, Abdul is going to buy a steamship in order to reach his friends, Maqroll and the fair Ilona, and to start back, in a sort of sentimental triangle, the adventurous and fascinating life they were used to. Meanwhile, after travelling separately around the world, Maqroll and Ilona meet casually in Panama and decide to open a joyous airplane-like brothel, to get the money necessary to Abdul to carry out his plan. But a mysterious woman, Larissa, psychologically insane, starting a rather morbid friendship with Ilona, would upset the plan, thus provoking the tragedy.

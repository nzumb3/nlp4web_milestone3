My Name Is Hmmm...
###BREAK###
A fiction. An 11 year old runaway, the oldest daughter of three. An absent mother, an abusive father, a grandmother too pure to imagine what is going on. A field trip, the girl disappears... she has found refuge in a truck; an initiatory journey, a chance meeting, new encounters; a wonderful and tragic road movie with a Scottish truck driver "when love just happens".

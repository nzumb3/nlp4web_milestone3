The Longer Day of Happiness
###BREAK###
Today is the day the Jones children change the course of their lives for better or worse. Raised by their mother Lydia Jones, a prominent black actress in the eighties with a knack for marriage, she's done it six times, has always told her children that 'you must take risks in life no matter what the consequence'. It not only makes for great art but for a great life'. Her daughter Lisa and her two adopted sons, Jack and Garret, find themselves up against the wall of change today with two options before them. They can either torch their past that has been guided by the family motto and start over. Or push through and break into the The Longer Day of Happiness.

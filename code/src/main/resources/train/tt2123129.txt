The film takes on a journey through the love story of Ram (Dhanush) and Janani (Shruthi) who are 12th standard students and eventually falls in love with each other. As they grow up, so does their affinity for each other, and despite opposition from the elders, they tie the knot. When they start a fresh life, problems start to grow up. Apart from the usual misunderstanding difficulties that newly-married couples would face, this is of a different kind. Ram is forced to take a decision in that problematic situation. What follows is an emotional tale.

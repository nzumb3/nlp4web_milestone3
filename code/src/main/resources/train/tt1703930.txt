Article 12
###BREAK###
Article 12 presents a sharp look at the current state of privacy and the rights and desires of individuals and governments, and the increasing use of surveillance. The film adopts the twelfth article of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights to chart privacy issues worldwide, arguing that without this right no other human right can truly be exercised. It brings together the world's leading academics, cultural figures and technologists to highlight the devastating potency of surveillance, the dangers of complicity, and presents a growing movement fighting for the upkeep of this crucial right. Article 12 provides a powerful wake-up call as we sleepwalk into a worldwide surveillance society.

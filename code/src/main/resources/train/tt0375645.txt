Celluloid Dreams
###BREAK###
Celluloid Dreams takes a trip into the wonderful and weird worlds of fantasy, nightmare and adult fairy tale...where intuition and pure imagination run wild. By constantly pushing the boundaries of what's? conventional and familiar in movies, a handful of independent filmmakers have a proven genius for delighting us one minute and making our hair stand on end the next. Exclusive interviews with some of the best auteur directors of this surreal art form include Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Guy Maddin, David Lynch and the Brothers Quay. Exploring recent films along with their past work, Celluloid Dreams will take an intimate look into the artistic processes and inspirations of the directors who transport us beyond our dreamiest dreams.

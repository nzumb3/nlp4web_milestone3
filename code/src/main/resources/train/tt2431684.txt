Gonzalo and Gina live in a world of their own; a magnificent villa on a 4.000 m2 estate, in the outskirts of Mexico City. Walls with barbed wire keep the outside world far away. It's their son, filmmaker Diego Gutierrez who tells their story. Parts of a Family is a portrait of how a relationship between two people after many years can change from great love into a strangling imprisonment. It's a bittersweet and universal love story.

"Again and again I have this dream. After all those years I know every single detail. And maybe it is the most important story of my life." It's the dream of an old man, the memories of a forbidden love thousand years ago, long before our time. He tells this last secret to his granddaughter, the story of Aiana and Janas who had to escape from the king's knights and the tragic consequences of their love. 1000 years later, in our present, a young couple is in a car on the journey to nowhere. Anna and Julian, both in their 20s are enjoying the ride and their freedom. It seems as if they were escaping the monotony of daily life in the city, to start somewhere else completely new. Anna starts reading a book, and soon it is obvious that she is the granddaughter who heard the old mans dream long ago. After many years she found the book, where he had written down this story. Slowly the two stories, the escape from everyday life and the escape from the tragic consequences of a forbidden love, develop, but soon they even start to merge. Dream and reality become one and in the end find the meaning and the common essence.

Out Mates
###BREAK###
Two miss match boys in 1972 accidentally escape 3 days prior to parole in a falsely accused jail sentence. Ted is anal and serious, Robert is go lucky and whimsical and always in a great mood. Their adventure starts off in action and never lets up. They encounter waterfalls, bounty hunters, trains, planes, the cutest little baby ever, and much more as they try desperately to get BACK TO PRISON before their parole date in order to explain their story and legally get out of prison. The comedy is very physical with scenes inspired by the great silent filmmakers, sight gags, and as Chaplin would have it, a touch of heart. The only way out, is to get back in!

Edward Wood is a an 84-year-old African American man, a veteran of the US Navy and the American Civil Rights Movement, and one of a few who personally witnessed the 1961 Freedom Riders Greyhound bus burning by an angry mob of Ku Klux Klan members in Anniston, Alabama.

My Anniston Edward Wood is 60 minutes of very compelling stories in the great tradition of American oral history.

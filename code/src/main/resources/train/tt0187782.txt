Chesterfield
###BREAK###
A human tooth with the number 6 etched into it. An old lover returning after an eight year absence. A dark secret that everyone is after, but no one wants to know... Johnny is at the end of his rope, burnt out by a lifestyle that he both embraces and eschews, unable to cope with the daily contradictions his career presents. He is a criminal, a killer excellent at what he does, but no longer able to rationalize it. Into his life walks Eleni, the daughter of Johnny's boss, Gravas. She presents him the mysterious tooth and a message: "I'm in trouble, Johnny. Someone is trying to kill me." Deeper Johnny falls into the mystery, deeper he falls into the life he was trying to escape; killers with a penchant for black jelly beans, demented dentists, lost love affairs, and an impromptu exhumation of a woman dead nearly sixteen years. Soon he comes to realize that nothing is what it seems.

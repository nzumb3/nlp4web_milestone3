InBetween
###BREAK###
A severely disturbed teenager obsessed by the topic of murder comes across a theory in Psychology stating there are only Five types of murder in existence. To disprove this, he decides on murdering his best friend. Unlike every other film with the topic of murder and teenagers, we aren't trying to find out who the killer is or who will die next- we know who dies and who kills them within the films first few minutes. The goal of this film was to take a different approach and ask... Why? Why do killers kill, and what effects does murder have on those closest to the victim?

Interlude City of a Dead Woman
###BREAK###
"Interlude City of a Dead Woman" is a story of transformation. The story takes place on the holy island of Patmos. The austere beauty of the Greek island provides a dramatic backdrop that naturally molds an aesthetic code of simplicity and mysticism. Three of the five main characters, a former opera singer, a priest and a bullfighter, have fled to Patmos seeking redemption. The other two, an older British couple, are fugitives of modern life who came here long ago seeking salvation and alternative living. Their interaction will irrevocably affect each other's lives. "Interlude City of a Dead Woman" is about a circle of life that lies beyond ordinary comprehension. Through a process of individual crisis and recollection the main characters will reach meaningful answers, which will enable them to continue their journeys.

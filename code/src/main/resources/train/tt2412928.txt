Kingdom of Animal
###BREAK###
Kingdom of Animal reveals the sensations, curiosities, and experiences inside the three large spaces of the interconnected factories. The movie took three months to plan and is a single, moving shot with no edits or cuts. However, the factories closed before the project could be fully realized. In this sense, the movie remains a sketch.

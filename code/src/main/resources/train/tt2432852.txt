Am I Broken?
###BREAK###
AM I BROKEN? is an unflinching journey of three children at a crucial crossroad in their young lives. Ejected from the public school systems and trying to navigate through their own kitchen sink diagnoses of severe behavior disorders, these children get a second chance under the tutelage of some outstanding teachers in a unique educational setting. Following these students with a camera crew every day for an entire school year, the filmmakers document a story of unfettered joy, pain, setback and triumph along the way to extraordinary achievement. AM I BROKEN? is the story of their hard won victories and heartbreaking losses.

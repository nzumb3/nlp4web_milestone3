Meeting Resistance
###BREAK###
MEETING RESISTANCE is a verit√©-style non-fiction feature-length film set in the streets, alleyways and ubiquitous teashops of the Adamiyah neighborhood of Baghdad. It enters the physical and psychological heart of the "Insurgency" against the American-led occupation. Photojournalists/directors Steve Connors and Molly Bingham spent ten-months among the insurgents there to create this exclusive, unique, and at once horrifying, compelling and insightful film about their lives, motivation, and goals.

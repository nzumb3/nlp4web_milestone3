Astral Shit Show
###BREAK###
Astral Shit Show, the first film from Mario Ashkar and the moon baby, invites you to take an uncomfortable look into the life of sociopath and celebrity, moon baby. The film is shot in split-screen to show the possibility of multiple memories, realities, and histories. The film starts as a mockumentary of a celebratante readying herself for a surprise wedding day and spirals into a hysteric synapse of music and murder. Part narrative, part art film, part music video.

Eli & Ben
###BREAK###
Ben (Lior Ashkenazi, "Walk on Water") has always affectionately entertained his son Eli's (Yuval Shevakh) mischievous behavior. Their profound connection seems secure as Eli approaches his tumultuous teenager years. But when the police arrest Ben under suspicion of bribery, Eli has to face the possibility that his father is morally fallible. Ravid's film about the conflict between disillusionment and faith delivers a touching story without any simple answers.

All Miller Davis wanted was to own a comic book store. He partnered with his close friends, Artie Shaw and Brian "Diesel" Bishop. But now those dreams are over because of a shady real estate agent who stole their down payment. They soon agree to scrap the plans for a comic book store and decide to open a strip club instead. They find funding via a very unorthodox method: stealing. They get wind Action Comics #1 (the first appearance of Superman) is for sale at a local comic book shop... and is fetching $150,000 in cash. Nice seed money for a strip club, isn't it? Well, the boys think so and that's where the chaos begins. How does it end? With a few beers, bikers, a stripper, the cops, an irate father... did we mention a stripper?

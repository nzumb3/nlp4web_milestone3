The Sparrows: Nesting
###BREAK###
Feeling a lack of purpose in her life as her teenage children Emily and Max grow increasingly independent, and her husband, Mike, devotes most of his time and energy to his growing business, Anna Sparrow follows the advice of her Pastor and volunteers at the local food bank. While helping the disadvantaged, Anna meets Maria Sanchez. From very different backgrounds, the two women bond over their shared love for their families. As the women grow closer, Maria reveals her concern for her precocious, but lonely daughter Bella, who she fears is being bullied at school. At Anna's urging, her teenage daughter Emily takes Bella under her wings. Maria's husband, Hector, loses his job, and his ability to provide for his family. He falls into despair as he's unable to find work, and turns back to drinking. When he finds Maria at the Sparrow's house, he assumes she is cleaning houses. His pride overcomes him and demands she leave with him. Anna agrees to watch Bella as Maria leaves with Hector, hoping to reason with him, make him understand how much she loves him, and that she knows he is always there for his family. A short time later, the police arrive at the Sparrow residence with devastating news. As they weigh the impact on young Bella, Anna and Mike face one of the most important decisions of their lives.

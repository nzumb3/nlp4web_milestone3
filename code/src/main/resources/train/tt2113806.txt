The Seducer
###BREAK###
John Koch's second feature and follow up to "Je ne sais quoi" (2008), "The Seducer" (2009) is an adaptation and present-day re-imagination of Fyodor Dostoevsky's 1848 short story "White Nights." Through this tragic tale of love and loss the questions and consequences of seduction are explored. 163 years after the story's original publication, the fundamental conflict between masculine and feminine energies within it remains universal and as relevant as ever in contemporary life. A lonely, wandering dreamer on his nightly patrol of empty streets happens upon a young woman, Sophia, who is waiting by the river for her long-absent lover to make his promised return. Sophia and the Dreamer form a fast friendship, as they proceed to meet on four consecutive nights, each night awaiting the appearance of the mysterious seductive man. As the two become closer and patience begins to wear thin, the situation becomes tense for all involved. It is a love triangle with desire moving in all the wrong directions. Will she persevere for the man she really wants? Will he ever return?

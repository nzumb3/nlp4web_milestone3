Facing the Mirror
###BREAK###
Dr. Kaveh Alizadeh, an Iranian born American plastic surgeon, has dedicated his life to offering hope and healing to those whose lives and bodies have been ravaged by war. Through the stories of a four-year-old boy and a middle-aged man, both disfigured in the recent war in Iraq, this film puts a human face on war's collateral damage and presents a lyrical journey of a doctor whose 'past' enables him to relate to the 'present' of his patients.

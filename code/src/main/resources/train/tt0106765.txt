Dove siete? Io sono qui
###BREAK###
Fausto's mother refuses to accept the fact that her child is deaf, and refuse to send him to a special school where he can learn sign language. His aunt, though, teaches him to communicate, and helps him find a place among a group of deaf-mutes. He meets and falls in love with Elena, leaving the "official" girlfriend picked by his mother, and the two plan to go to Washington to study at a special university for deaf- mutes. The mother accuses Elena of being selfish, Elena is hit by a car and hospitalized, and Fausto ends up being shocked into hearing for the first time what is going on around him.

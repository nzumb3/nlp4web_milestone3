In Medias Res
###BREAK###
On the other side of Purgatory, across from the Gate of Heaven - a burning house - the place where Satan takes sinful people to Hell. A man is told he has made many sins and must report to Satan, whereupon the man begs forgiveness for his sins and tries to strike a deal with God. Satan covertly observes the man, deciding to tempt him to take his place in Hell. This exchange would allow Satan to find his own unique audience with God in the form of a written poem Satan calls "In Medias Res."

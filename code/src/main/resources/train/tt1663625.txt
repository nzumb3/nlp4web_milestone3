Bloody Bloody Bible Camp
###BREAK###
In 1977 a group of young, horny, out of control Christians are spending a fun filled weekend at the Happy Day Bible Camp. Their impure antics rile up a sadistic crazy nun known as, "Sister Mary Chopper". One by one these youthful sinners pay a BLOODY penance for their sinful acts. 7 years later, another group of Bible totin' Christian wannabes return to the Happy Day Bible Camp. All ignore the warnings from the local folk of the grizzly murders that took place 7 years prior. Is Sister Mary Chopper dead or is she just waiting for backsliding Christians to commit sins of the unholy?

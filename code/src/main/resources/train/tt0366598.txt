In some circles, she is considered white trash. One night after a few drinks at the local pub, she gets into a physical altercation with Billy, her now ex-boyfriend, their fight and break-up because she caught him cheating on her. At the hospital emergency room to deal with a serious cut to her hand the result of the fight, she is treated by her family physician, Dr. Richard Darian, one of the wealthiest and most respected people in town. However, under heavy sedation which Dr. Darian warns her that she may have hallucinations and/or amnesia, Kimberly is certain that Dr. Darian raped her, she unable to fight him off in her drugged state. Believing she will get no justice going through Rickerby's police, she files charges against Dr. Darian with the metro police. After a physical examination, it is determined that she did have intercourse recently, and semen is found on her panties she provides for DNA testing. In Kimberly's eyes during the subsequent investigation, Dr. Darian is able to manipulate every move to his own benefit, in the process having the town rally around him while they shun her for trying to ruin his good name and reputation. The question becomes how far she will go to regain her soul, regardless of whether those measures will result in the justice for which she is looking.

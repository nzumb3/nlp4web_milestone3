I Love Special Olympics
###BREAK###
I LOVE SPECIAL OLYPMICS is a documentary film that chronicles the lives of four people with learning disabilities. The film centres around a Downs Syndrome dancer, Hannah, in her twenties who wants to be the most famous Downs Syndrome person in the world. A World Champion Judo Fighter, Oliver, in his teens and in foster care who struggles to make sense of the world. A Ten Pin Bowler, Jonathan, in his fortes who couldn't walk until he was nine and said his first word at seven and a Basket Ball player, Tom, who just wants to fit in. They all have learning disabilities but this does not define them; what does is that they are all athletes who train all year round to compete in the Special Olympics.

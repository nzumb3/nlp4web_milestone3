Face Value
###BREAK###
Scott Baio, ex-child star in real life, plays a young man who goes to visit an old friend of his who resides in California. His friend's got it all: Nice house, great car, lots of neat accessories, friends, and, or course, women. But after Baio's friend mysteriously disappears, and Baio suspects foul play in a boating accident, Baio adapts to the persona of his friend for a while. But this idea backfires when the bad guys who killed his friend start coming after Baio, thinking they didn't succeed in their job. Or is that what it's all about? (Taken from my review on the film)

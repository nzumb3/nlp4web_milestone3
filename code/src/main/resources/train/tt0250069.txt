A Head for Business
###BREAK###
Dutillard is an amateur film maker working as a computer programmer for a small French investment bank. When the bank finds that it has been forced to fork over $104 million to fund Dutillard's film, Chekov's "Three Sisters", and that it has no legal recourse against him, the bank must find a way to make the film profitable. They float around a few ideas including a nude gang bang with the prettier sister, but the horrified Dutilliard comes up with a plan, buy the rights to a blockbuster and package the TV rights with those for the Three Sisters. Before they know it the bankers find them self flying to London and New York to raise money and buy a major film studio.

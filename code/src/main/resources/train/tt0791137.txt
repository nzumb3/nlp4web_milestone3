The Volcanic Peninsula
###BREAK###
This documentary depicts the dreams and projections of four Chilean female sophomore students. Two of them study in a public Industrial school in San Joaquin commune, in Santiago, where they have already begun their instruction as textile technicians. They both dream of the future, expecting to form their families, to study further and to transcend their diminished social and economical situation. On the other hand, in the exclusive Saint George's School, two girls study in conditions of privilege. They want to go to university and develop themselves through art. This is the portrait of two worlds no more than 20 kilometers apart but which only encounter themselves in audiovisual editing. It is the manifestation of the coincidences and contradictions that exist between both realities, and between the speeches and realities of four young Chilean students in a stage which is crucial for their future development.

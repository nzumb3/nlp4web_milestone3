Checkpoint
###BREAK###
Examines the status and plight of Palestinians after the Oslo peace process, discussing and documenting situations in which things have gotten worse for refugees, rather than better. The checkpoints at various locations (access to highways, exiting and entering a city or an area under putative Palestinian control, and access to holy sites) become the symbol of Israel's post-Oslo apartheid. The film also argues that, in the islands of Palestinian autonomy that make up three percent of Israel's land, Arab self-determination is virtually non-existent.

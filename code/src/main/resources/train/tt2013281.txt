The Guerilla Picture Show
###BREAK###
Two crude humored out of work actresses make a film for seven thousand dollars. With limited funds, they hire Jay and Randy, two guys who specialize in porn and the rest of the cast and crew off of Craig's list. Things go downhill quickly: Cast and crew drinking and doing drugs on the set, running out of food and finally money, shelving the film for good. To finish the film, Randy offers the girls' roles in his porn films. Balking, the girls finish the film the 'Canadian' way, culminating in a 'World Premiere' but will they get distribution?

He didn't have a crew and he didn't have funding, but he had a question, and he wasn't going to stop until he found an answer. In an unheard of style of documentary film making, Mark Pedri rides his bicycle into the desert of Wyoming with only a camera and survival gear in search of answers. Pedri struggles to travel over 7000 miles by foot, bicycle, car, train, plane, and boat in search of the best type of energy. Visiting major power plants, mines, dams, gas fields, and more, Pedri shoots, directs, edits, and produces this film. What starts as a bike ride into the desert becomes a full year of balancing survival with the adventure of answering the question of his generation.

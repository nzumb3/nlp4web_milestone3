The History and Modernization of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church
###BREAK###
Balazs scholars are committed not only to improving the lives of their fellow congregants in Transylvania, where Unitarianism began over 400 years ago, but also to sharing with North American Unitarian Universalists the depth of their passion for their homeland and for the common Unitarian faith tradition. This film focuses on the impact modernization has had on the Transylvanian Unitarian Church and the steps being taken to ensure the survival of the Unitarian community itself.

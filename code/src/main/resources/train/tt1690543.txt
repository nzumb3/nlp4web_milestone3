Flea
###BREAK###
FLEA is the story of a young boy, who runs away from an abusive home to join a tribe of forest dwellers known as the Shadow Clan. "Flea" inhabits Shade Land, under the guidance of "Raven" (Suza Lambert Bowser), who protects the elderly, the disabled, and the children. The Clan's advocate, "Marsh Man" (Barry Williams) and their historian, "Poet" (Josef Cannon) assist Raven in the care of the Shade Land people. "Flea's" destiny soon challenges the exiled antagonist, "Badger" (Bruce Cole), who begins hunting him down with the help of Scavenger (Brian O'Halloran), a slimy recycler who plays both sides of the fence. The movie, FLEA, embraces the story of people who live in the open, by choice or by necessity, people who band together to survive, people searching for a new leader, and the young man who must discover his true calling.

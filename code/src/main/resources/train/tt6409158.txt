###BREAK###
Six Americans from varied backgrounds - a single mother whose son was murdered in a tragic school shooting (from Sandy Hook) and her friend (from Atlanta), an ex-gang leader (from Los Angeles), an educator (from Newark), and two advocates of the Movement for Black Lives (both from Oakland) - who have all experienced violence come together for a shared experience of healing and transformation during a 10-day pilgrimage to India, following the intention behind Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when he had visited India to deepen his understanding of nonviolence, nearly sixty years ago. What will they discover in India that can help reinvigorate nonviolence in America today?

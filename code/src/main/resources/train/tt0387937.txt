Cipriano
###BREAK###
Two brothers, Bigail and Vicente, living in the backcountry of the State of Piauí, an arid and hostile environment, decide to take their father Cipriano's dead body to be buried in a very faraway cemetery by the sea, since the old man, a former cowboy, dreamed of knowing the sea. In their way, they meet the Death, three Guardian Angels and two demons. First feature film entirely produced in the State of Piauí, perhaps Brazil's poorest State.

"El Jairo", a young schizophrenic, believes in extraterrestrial beings and feels that he should battle against them. Claudia is an overweight woman who has a strong weakness for pornography, a fact that leads her into a number of conflicts. Finally, there's Juvencio, an old retired teacher whose major concern is his quadriplegic daughter, whose future without his or his wife Anita's assistance is a great worry to him. The paths of all these three characters become increasingly entangled.

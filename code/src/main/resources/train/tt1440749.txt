Laughology
###BREAK###
Laughter. Plato hated it, the Bible discouraged it, scientists avoided it, psychologists once thought if it didn't kill you, it would drive you insane. With his trademark blend of humor and serious investigation, Albert Nerenberg drops in on cutting edge neuroscientists and cardiologists to Christian holy laughter groups in search of its origin and meaning. Ultimately he finds the man with the most contagious laugh in the world. Laughology wittily weaves research, archival stills, television clips, and a hilarious send-up of the use of re-enactments in docs. Nerenberg's quest to rediscover his own laugh has produced a film that will undoubtedly play a major role in a 'global laughter trend at a crucial time when the world needs a good laugh.'

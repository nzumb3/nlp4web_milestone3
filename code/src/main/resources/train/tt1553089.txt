My Father: An Artist
###BREAK###
'My Father, An Artist', A film by Sanjay Kumar. This documentary feature is a study of artistic creativity. Far from a biography or an exploration of persona, the film uses words, color, sound and the editing technique to understand the spirit and artistic intent of a creative genius - the legendary Indian flautist, composer, choreographer, musicologist and poet Pt. Vijay Raghav Rao. Like an original artist, the subject of the documentary engages in art for the pursuit of eternal truth. And in the process he enlightens one and all.

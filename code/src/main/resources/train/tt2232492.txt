Kupica
###BREAK###
This is a film about a tiny pub called the Kupica, situated in the gloomy Eastern European city of Zagreb and run by a woman called Barbara. The story follows the pub's band that plays on Fridays. Anyone who can play is welcome to join the Kupica band. The players are not virtuosos, but nevertheless they enjoy playing, joking and having fun. There is a tram station in front of the pub and sometimes tram-passengers are unable to hide their surprise - more often then not, joining in with the players. This is a kind of the Eastern European Social Club in which the marginalized, the forgotten, the alcoholics, and the lonely scream with joy in the midst of depression.
